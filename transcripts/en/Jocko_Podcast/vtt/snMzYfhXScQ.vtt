00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.860
This is Jocko podcast number one 83 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.680
Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.873
<v 1>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.260
<v 0>Not One of the guys on the ground at bike. This mission</v>

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.700
now moving to within a click of their target,

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.470
they had pushed that distraction from their minds and were solely focused on the

7
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:27.471
deadly challenge before them glancing at the gps attached to the stock of his

8
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:30.300
rifle and scanning the terrain ahead.

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.420
Lieutenant Commander James Reese called a quick perimeter.

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.090
Snipers were already moving up to the high ground as team leaders joined Reese

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.470
for a last quick update before the final push to the objective.

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.000
<v 0>Even with all the technology at their disposal,</v>

14
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.340
things could go wrong in a heartbeat.

15
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.720
Their enemy was cunning and highly adaptive after 16 years at war,

16
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.250
the Afghan saying the Americans all have the watches,

17
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.170
but we have all the time.

18
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.550
<v 0>Rang a bit more true than it had in the early days.</v>

20
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.430
What do you think Reese asked?

21
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:16.431
A huge beast of a man looking like a creature from another world with his a o R,

22
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:22.131
one patterned camouflaged body armor and ops core half shell helmet with nods

23
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:24.630
firmly in place.

24
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.740
Reese looked at his most seasoned troop chief,

25
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.540
the light green glow of the nods illuminated through the beard on the man's

26
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.643
face,

27
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.230
a slight smile that could not be mistaken for anything other than the confident

28
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:43.770
look of a professional special operations soldier.

29
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.560
It's just over the rise. Reese replied, Predator shows nothing moving.

30
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.300
No centuries, nothing. His troop chief nodded.

31
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.390
All right guys. He said to the other four men in the circle, let's do it.

32
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.580
They rose with resolve and moved with the poise of men who are comfortable in

33
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:06.420
chaos.

34
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.800
Moving up the rocky ridge line to get their teams in place before approaching

35
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:12.450
the target to make entry.

36
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.040
<v 1>Okay,</v>

37
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.690
<v 0>this is too easy. You're thinking too much. Again, it's just another mission.</v>

38
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.370
Then why this feeling? Maybe it's just the headaches.

39
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.480
The headaches had played Reese for the past several months.

40
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.890
Finally prompting a visit to

41
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.660
Balboa Naval Medical Center before this deployment for a series of tests.

42
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.830
Still no word back from the docs. Maybe it's nothing.

43
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.320
<v 1>Okay,</v>

44
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.370
<v 0>but maybe it's something.</v>

45
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.570
<v 0>We had learned a long time ago that if something didn't look right,</v>

47
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:47.650
then it probably wasn't

48
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.940
that judgement had kept him and his men alive on many of deployment.

49
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.740
Everything had lined up a little too easy for this target, the Intel,

50
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.880
the offset in fill the current state of the objective area

51
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.500
and why the pressure from higher authority to go after this target.

52
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.900
When was the last time a flag level command injected itself into a tactical

53
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:18.040
planning process? Something wasn't adding up.

54
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.690
Maybe everything's fine. Maybe it's the headaches.

55
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.180
Maybe it's a bit of paranoia.

56
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.890
<v 1>Okay,</v>

57
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.810
<v 0>maybe I'm getting too old for this focus. Reese,</v>

58
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.380
this wasn't the first time that they had approached our target.

59
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.440
They had suspected was a possible ambush at one point in the war when Intel,

60
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.730
it pointed to the high possibility of an ambush corroborated by multiple

61
00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:49.410
sources. Both human and technical.

62
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.870
Reese would have knocked on the door with a thermobaric 84 or a few one oh five

63
00:03:54.871 --> 00:03:57.090
rounds from an AC [inaudible] gunship.

64
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.990
This was the first time that actual tactics had been dictated from higher for

65
00:04:04.881 --> 00:04:07.270
men who would not be on the ground.

66
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.570
Focus on the mission. Reese.

67
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.210
One more check with the tactical operation center.

68
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.870
A forward based command also called the talk and to look at the Predator feed.

69
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.933
<v 1>Nothing.</v>

70
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.710
<v 0>Another check with the sniper teams. Nothing moving.</v>

71
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.430
We use glanced up at the military crest of the hill in front of him.

72
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.860
Through his nods, he could see the assault teams set and ready to move.

73
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.090
He couldn't see the snipers,

74
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.140
which gave him cause for a thoughtful smile.

75
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.470
Best in the business.

76
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.060
Reese keyed his radio and opus opened his mouth to give the order to move.

77
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.630
Then it all went black.

78
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.183
<v 1>Okay?</v>

79
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.900
<v 0>The explosion knocked Reese back 10 yards and ripped his helmet from his head as</v>

80
00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:12.390
the entire military crest of the hill in front of him.

81
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.410
You re-upped it in a concussion of violence and death.

82
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.080
Teammates, friends,

83
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.770
husbands and fathers who one moment earlier had represented the best spas,

84
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.110
special operations force in the world.

85
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.620
We're gone in less than a second,

86
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.683
<v 1>okay?</v>

87
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.563
<v 0>Okay.</v>

88
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.093
Somewhere.

89
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.420
A true believer is training to kill you.

90
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.030
He is training with minimum food or water in austere conditions day and night.

91
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.580
The only thing cleaned on him is his weapon

92
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.460
and he made his web gear.

93
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.830
He doesn't worry about what workout to do. His rockways,

94
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.970
what it weighs.

95
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.950
His runs end when the enemy stops chasing him.

96
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.010
The true believer doesn't care how hard it is.

97
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.020
He only knows that he wins

98
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.420
or he dies.

99
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.340
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

100
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.460
<v 0>he doesn't go home at 1700</v>

101
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.780
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

102
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.613
<v 0>he is home.</v>

103
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.540
He only knows the cause

104
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.153
and

105
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.170
those right there or two excerpts from two books.

106
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.600
The first one, a book called the Terminal List and the second book,

107
00:07:06.601 --> 00:07:11.520
a book called true believer and these books are

108
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.310
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

109
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.143
<v 0>fiction.</v>

110
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.720
They are novels and with the exception of the novel Musashi by Eli Yoshikawa.

111
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.870
I have not covered any novels on the podcast,

112
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.580
but I'm actually not here to talk about those novels.

113
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:36.350
The novels of these books were written by a seal,

114
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.270
a seal that I knew,

115
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:44.050
and a seal that is here with us tonight to share his experiences in the teams,

116
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:48.620
what he learned, how he ended up,

117
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.610
where he did as a retired seal officer,

118
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.490
a husband, a father,

119
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.420
and a writer of fiction.

120
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.420
His name is Jack Carr. Welcome to the show.

121
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.510
<v 2>Thank you so much for having me on. It's great to be here. Yeah, man. Good,</v>

122
00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:11.540
good to finally get you out here.

123
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:14.580
I know we tried to hook this up for a little while. Yep. It's a, it's good. And,

124
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.830
and, and you sent me your latest book and I'd said to myself, okay,

125
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.130
well let's just make this happen. Awesome. So, yeah, man,

126
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.790
let's talk a little bit about you. Well, that, that's hard,

127
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.360
but I've never heard that a true believer read quite so well.

128
00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:32.280
So I used to read that to my guys in the teams and then read your, uh,

129
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.150
laws of combat. Read those to them, Kinda to [inaudible] that one, you know,

130
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.600
just kind of set the stage about what the Syria, who we're going after here. Uh,

131
00:08:41.601 --> 00:08:46.050
and then your laws of combat, which of course I, um, yeah, pass on.

132
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:48.390
Everybody I ever worked with ever since. Right on,

133
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.120
you probably found a couple of them in the book for those that, that read them.

134
00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:56.550
There's a couple, I put them in Italics, you know, give you credit jack.

135
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.720
Uh, so let's, let's talk a little bit about, you know, where it all started.

136
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.160
Yeah. Like your, what year were you born? Yeah, 73. Okay.

137
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.050
So you're kind of a young and well off. What are you, one year old? 71. Okay.

138
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.540
Yeah. Yeah. Dominant child of the 80s, though.

139
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:16.320
You know that those former of the years were like 80 to 89 or you grew up in

140
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.070
north county. Norco. And my mom was librarian and from a very early age,

141
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:24.420
this is one area or city area. A rural. Yeah, but not too rural.

142
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.580
Small town, I'd say small town. Yeah. So north of San Francisco. Um,

143
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.330
but uh, wealth today is d day. Um,

144
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.650
so probably appropriately talk about that.

145
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:37.930
My grandfather was killed in World War II. Some were very early age. Uh,

146
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.710
I was surrounded by those silk mappings and aviator marine, uh,

147
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.580
flew the course air, which was that plane that had the,

148
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.150
the wings that would fold up. Um,

149
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.870
right about that time there was a show black sheep squadron on TV.

150
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:52.050
I went to an air show and met pappy Boyington before he passed away.

151
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:55.410
I got his book signed. And, um, so I always knew that, uh,

152
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:58.500
the military was where I was going. Um, just earlier on,

153
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:00.600
I didn't know exactly what that was going to be, but, uh,

154
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.360
cause you ever thinking about trying to be a pilot, you know, fleetingly,

155
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:05.970
I'm sure I did, but we're all marine corps, uh,

156
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.650
fleetingly as a pilot just following the footsteps of my grandfather. Um, but,

157
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.270
and it became very obvious that, uh,

158
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:15.750
that my skill set laid a more primal level on the ground.

159
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.560
It was just attracted to that for some reason. Um, probably a lot of, you know,

160
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.060
in the DNA for sure,

161
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:24.780
but also the influence of popular culture that books and movies that I read

162
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.020
growing up. Um, those are the guys that I, that I wanted to be like. And,

163
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.660
and had backgrounds that I, I wanted to have one day, but, um,

164
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.810
my grandfather didn't make it back from, from World War II,

165
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.100
so he was killed off Okinawa in 1945 in May, so near the end of the war.

166
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.250
And, uh, but his, his wings made it back old pictures of his, uh,

167
00:10:42.251 --> 00:10:44.760
black and white pictures of his squadron. And by his plane,

168
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.860
the silk maps they give a few years back then,

169
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.260
cause if they hit the water with paper, they'd just disintegrate.

170
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:53.200
So I had these silk maps. Um, so I just grew up with him really as kind of the,

171
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.500
the ideal hero I guess. Um,

172
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.220
obviously never met him and neither did my dad cause he was a born while he was

173
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:03.480
deployed. So, uh, so grew up with just knowing that the military was my calling.

174
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:05.400
There was never anything else I wanted to do.

175
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:09.390
And then early on I found out what seals were. And your mom was a librarian?

176
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.290
Yup. Yup. Still is to this day. And so were you into reading? Yup. Yeah.

177
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:15.720
I grew up surrounded by books and uh, yeah,

178
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.930
just always naturally gravitated when I got to be about fifth grade,

179
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:22.200
I'd say towards the things that, uh, the adults were reading at the time.

180
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:27.190
So Tom Clancy, David Morrell, Nelson to mill AAJ, Cornell, JC Pollack, uh,

181
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.860
mark olden, these guys in the 80s,

182
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:33.240
that ad protagonists with seal backgrounds or CIA backgrounds or a special

183
00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:35.010
forces background. So, um,

184
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.910
not having the Internet and not having that many nonfiction books written about

185
00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:39.744
seals. Uh,

186
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.980
that's what I read and I knew this is where I'm going and then after that's

187
00:11:43.981 --> 00:11:46.200
done, I want to write fiction like these guys.

188
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.750
So those are the two things that I wanted to do with my life.

189
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.020
How old were you when you actually found out about the seal teams in fifth

190
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:56.380
grade? A seven. So [inaudible] second grade, second grade,

191
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.660
you found out about the two themes from what?

192
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.420
So that then there were four channels back then growing up.

193
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:03.100
So there was like ABC, CBS, NBC,

194
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:07.540
and then that one outlier channel that always had some world war two movie on it

195
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:11.470
going all the time. And, uh, I was at remote control back in the late seventies,

196
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.210
so, uh, Sundays were football days and I was not interested in football at all.

197
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.540
Uh, but I was interested in that warm movie with playing opposite football.

198
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:20.950
So at a commercial,

199
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.500
my dad would look at his watch and I can still remember to this day sitting on

200
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:26.740
the couch and he'd say, go. And then I'd have two minutes to run up,

201
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.430
change that channel to that outlier channel and then sit back down,

202
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.740
watch that movie. And then he'd say, turn it back,

203
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.840
back to football two minutes later. So I got to do that and,

204
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.980
and I just wait through the football parts and then run up and change it to

205
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:40.090
whatever war movie was playing.

206
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.380
So this cross is attention deficit disorder without question. Yeah.

207
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.420
To be trained for incredible patients and imagination.

208
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:49.210
You've got to fill in the blanks direct that during that. That might be,

209
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:53.730
it might be. It, it, uh, yeah. So one of those movies was the frogmen. And, uh,

210
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.400
it showed these guys climbing up over the beaches ahead of the conventional

211
00:12:57.401 --> 00:13:00.520
force landing and putting explosives on these, uh, obstacles.

212
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.240
And I asked my dad, hey, who are these guys? And uh, he said those are frogmen.

213
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.800
And I said, okay, what's a frogman? He said, ask your mother. So, uh, so I did.

214
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.200
And then we went down to the local library cause she would take any,

215
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.780
any excuse to get us to the library and do research,

216
00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:16.210
show us how to use the Dewey decimal system, pull out the card things,

217
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:17.510
the whole deal and uh,

218
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.140
did a little research and there was hardly anything written back then.

219
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:23.260
There was a couple of magazines that had mentions of seals, um,

220
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.450
a couple nonfiction books that had a chapter or a paragraph or two on ceilings.

221
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.350
Not much at all. And, uh,

222
00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:33.370
but my takeaway was that these guys are touted anyway as one of the most elite

223
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:34.510
fighting forces in the world.

224
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.480
And the training is the toughest ever devised by our modern military, arguably.

225
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:43.210
And that was my takeaway. We all know that's arguable. They, exactly,

226
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:45.760
there's all kinds of different hard parts of all different training. You know,

227
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:46.750
I,

228
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.610
I'd never went to ranger school and if I did go Eton MRE one MRU Day, I ruin,

229
00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.390
not be a happy camper. Brutal. But, you know, so everyone's got their little,

230
00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.560
their level challenges or heard the same thing. Exactly. So they had me and,

231
00:13:59.561 --> 00:14:02.020
yeah. And you find out that it's, so what did you do?

232
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:06.790
Did you start preparing for it physically? Yep. Oh yeah. Everything we're doing,

233
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.120
everything I did from that. So I guess I do it an early form of crossfit,

234
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.900
I guess, uh, before, uh, before crossfit was a thing in high school.

235
00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:16.490
So not in the, you know, in the younger years, junior high,

236
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.680
I was still playing soccer right around cross country doing all that sorts.

237
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.460
But I do credit cross country, uh,

238
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.030
in those hills in northern California with giving me for whatever reason that

239
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.460
no, never quit. Uh,

240
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.390
I'd see people stopping on the hill that was giving you energy,

241
00:14:28.391 --> 00:14:30.820
like a pretty good runner. I was. Okay. Yeah, it was good.

242
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.150
But there were some guys that were really, really good. Um, mine was just,

243
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.520
you know, Doug and determination really. Um,

244
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:40.060
so I was pretty good but not the greatest. Um, and, you know,

245
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.530
but I'd love it when I'd see people walking,

246
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.170
especially on the hills when people from the flatlands would come up to our

247
00:14:44.171 --> 00:14:47.170
horse and, uh, and they picked that first hill and just walk.

248
00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:48.700
It would just devastate them and that, which is,

249
00:14:48.701 --> 00:14:51.410
I just feed off that kind of like a whole week when people would quit.

250
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.050
And I always feel bad talking about this, but I mean, it's true.

251
00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:56.570
Some people would say, come back, no, don't quit. Come back.

252
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.980
I didn't say one word. This is exactly,

253
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:05.270
this is what this program is designed to do. Uh, and so I kind of fed off that.

254
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:07.640
I guess. I love it, especially when the biggest, strongest,

255
00:15:07.641 --> 00:15:11.240
fastest guys for those first three weeks or whatever it was, a buds, uh, with,

256
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:13.490
with the verse couple, that's all just duds,

257
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.240
just quitting first couple of hours.

258
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.230
I don't know if people said that was gonna happen and uh, and it did.

259
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.570
And I'm studs where I thought to myself, wow,

260
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:24.680
this guy seems like a complete stud. Yup. Mentally,

261
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:29.630
physically, you know, just legit and then just quit app right away.

262
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.160
How is that? I don't know,

263
00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:33.350
but I would look at these guys when I first showed up the buds, I'm like, man,

264
00:15:33.351 --> 00:15:37.450
that guy's huge and he's doing great climbing these ropes and he's like losing

265
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.780
his legs and like, oh my God,

266
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:41.320
it's going to go on those monkey bar things and Geez,

267
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.460
how am I going to make it through if this guy, this guy,

268
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:46.350
like they just got like that here and then he quits and I'm like, oh,

269
00:15:46.351 --> 00:15:51.050
I see how this works. You're mentally weak. Exactly. I can do this.

270
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.300
Yup. So, so you did running? Yeah, we did cross country. Yup.

271
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:59.600
Early on did that stuff. Soccer, um, a Lacrosse in, uh, in high school,

272
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.450
but then I'd ride my bike to school, which was, I don't know how long,

273
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.730
not at least 10 miles, I guess. So early morning, northern California cold. Um,

274
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.770
and cause I was, it was part of training and I'd get home and we had this, um,

275
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.420
kind of place that whatever from when we were kids and, and I do, you know,

276
00:16:15.421 --> 00:16:17.810
pull up solely to holding different, you know,

277
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:21.260
trying to try to make an obstacle course for myself when I got home and I would

278
00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:24.050
be knocking out like 20 pull ups at whatever, 13,

279
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:29.051
14 years old and then go have like some pasta or a piece of bread with butter on

280
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.810
it for my snack. Um, and uh, and started training, not charter,

281
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:38.720
train martial arts pretty early too. Um, but I didn't, I was searching cause uh,

282
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.890
uh, local taekwondo place. Right. And here's the joint,

283
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.860
some cotta stuff and you're learning a little bit and you've even, you're,

284
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.740
how old were you? Uh, that would probably be freshmen. 14,

285
00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:51.380
let's say even as a 14 year old, you're like, wow,

286
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.270
like this seems like many work, but it also seems like,

287
00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.220
what if someone hits me in the face? Yeah. Work Greg, a 13 year old.

288
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.110
Yep. Kind of picked up on that. Yep.

289
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:07.010
Which is I give you credit because I'm guys can be convincing, you know,

290
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.020
that's how you see these videos of people online that are making people fall

291
00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:15.570
down by cleaning out the middle. There is yelling their key. I Adam,

292
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:20.570
I know it's hilarious. People literally fall down him and start shaking.

293
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.490
It's crazy. Yeah. It's crazy.

294
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.070
But I can say I grew up also like to talk about that, uh,

295
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.570
the influence of popular culture. So, uh, you know, rocky movies, I was just,

296
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.080
wow, man, that's fighting right there. I want to learn how to do that.

297
00:17:33.081 --> 00:17:35.900
How do I learn how to do that in northern California where there wasn't really a

298
00:17:35.901 --> 00:17:39.620
place to go, but, uh, that, that tenacity, you know,

299
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.240
like getting up every time you get knocked down.

300
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:43.580
Like I think those things have really wore off on me.

301
00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:47.000
Like I took that seriously. Um, and still do to this day.

302
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.710
What kind of music were you listening to? I didn't really do the music thing.

303
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:50.010
Tell

304
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.850
<v 3>a little the last few years really. I was like quiet. Yup. Yup.</v>

305
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.640
I realized I'm starting to give music less credit than I used to for,

306
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.180
I used to look, I used to,

307
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.390
when I meet people and I talk to them for a little bit, I'd go out,

308
00:18:02.391 --> 00:18:03.720
what kind of music did you listen to growing up?

309
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.070
Because we would always kind of fill me in about kind of who they were.

310
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:11.220
Because when, when we grew up, you,

311
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.690
you only listened to what you kind of, you,

312
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.120
you didn't get exposed to a bunch of stuff.

313
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:17.490
You kind of had to figure it out and go down that channel.

314
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.930
And so if you listened to heavy metal, okay, I see, you know,

315
00:18:21.931 --> 00:18:25.180
I see what you were doing or you listened to, you know, Leonard Skinner don't,

316
00:18:25.181 --> 00:18:27.420
okay, cool. I get where I get. You could just kind of know,

317
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.460
cause people wouldn't say, because what does everyone say now?

318
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:29.950
What are you listen to?

319
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.780
They say everything because everything's free and they can listen to all this

320
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.960
different kinds and it's wide open. And that's what all these kids say nowadays.

321
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:38.970
I listened to everything, a little bit of everything.

322
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.860
And so don't offend anyone. Yeah. Yeah. And so you just weren't even in music?

323
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.650
Nope, not until I got my driver's license and then I kinda had to,

324
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.990
cause you had other people in the car and they'd bring a cassette tape.

325
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.630
I'm like a mix tape and a and put that thing in. And uh,

326
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.600
for whatever reason where I grew up, people listened to uh, stuff like sixties,

327
00:18:55.601 --> 00:18:59.380
seventies, [inaudible] my dad had a, uh,

328
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.950
a Barracuda and the the car, like the sports car,

329
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.600
like the sense of three Barracuda, yellow with [inaudible].

330
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.670
And you're saying it impressed, but it was not because it was,

331
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:14.460
it was my dad being a broke teacher,

332
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.980
needed a new car and went out and paid whatever,

333
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:21.480
1800 bucks for this car that was rusty, but it had an eight track in it.

334
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.650
I'm sorry. And my dad, I think he had one eight track and it was Hank Williams,

335
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.470
like Hank Williams was it? Yeah, Hank Williams Sr.

336
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.140
So we listen to a lot of Hank Williams. When I was growing up,

337
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.830
we had Kenny Rogers, we had the Gambler, I'm sorry to hear that.

338
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.650
We are the gamble every morning and dropped off for school.

339
00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:42.340
It wasn't an eight track. I think my dad was an early adopter. [inaudible]

340
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.020
exactly. And I remember to this day, every day on the way to school.

341
00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:50.380
Was it the gambler? All right. So what did your dad do? Uh,

342
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.310
it was an attorney at that time and I got into real estate and then later on and

343
00:19:53.311 --> 00:19:57.600
then retired early. And so, okay, so you're, you're now,

344
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:02.340
at what point did you say, okay, I'm going to, I'm going to go for sure.

345
00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:05.610
Like what point was this? 10 years old. Was this 12 years old? Seven,

346
00:20:05.611 --> 00:20:07.620
seven years old. Our idea, this is what I'm doing, I'm going.

347
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.340
And what made you decide any, anything else significant from high school? Your,

348
00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.700
you're playing soccer, you're playing lacrosse. Yeah, running,

349
00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:17.400
you're doing pull ups on the monkey bars, whatever, trail run,

350
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.720
all that sort of thing. Just getting ready,

351
00:20:18.721 --> 00:20:23.100
thinking about my next steps and knowing that there was going to be a little bit

352
00:20:23.101 --> 00:20:25.680
of pause there to go to college first just in case because we have to have

353
00:20:25.681 --> 00:20:29.050
contingency plans. Tertiary. So second you looked and said like, okay,

354
00:20:29.051 --> 00:20:31.530
I'm going to go to college. Yup, Yup. That person,

355
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:35.940
I need to do that cause I needed to get a stronger, bigger, faster. Um,

356
00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:38.880
and uh, I thought I needed to anyway. I don't know if that's the case or not,

357
00:20:38.881 --> 00:20:42.660
but probably not. But you were just more humble and you were thinking, Hey,

358
00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:45.690
I need to be in better shape than I thought there was eight guys on a seal team

359
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.990
and, uh, I was going to be one of those guys and if I

360
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.070
<v 2>was going to be one of those guys, I needed to be in the best possible shape.</v>

361
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.180
And at that time the best possible shape looked like Stallone and looked like

362
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:59.620
Arnold. So I did not look like either of those guys. So,

363
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.530
and I still don't, and I never did, but, but I thought,

364
00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:05.620
and I need to hit the iron here. I need to get boxing.

365
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.610
And I did a little bit in high school. So, uh, so that, go back to that, uh,

366
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.150
martial arts school or taekwondo thing, there was an instructor there that, uh,

367
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:17.110
kind of knew that this wasn't quite the deal, like a brown belt in taekwondo.

368
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.410
And then for my last, I guess, year and a half of high school, uh,

369
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.510
he wanted to start his own thing. And so he'd,

370
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.510
I'd go pick him up in my car cause you didn't have one and we'd go to a local

371
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:30.340
park and we box and it was like jab, reverse hook, you know,

372
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:34.030
you know the basics and uh, and that was awesome.

373
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:38.970
I'd love to re I absolutely loved it up the largest 24. Yes, exactly. Um,

374
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.490
my learned about a take down was, you know, like, cause he did some wrestling.

375
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.260
Oh. So I got to do a little of that early MMA. Exactly, exactly.

376
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:51.760
Yup. If you had a car you couldn't really make something happen. It's such a,

377
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.040
Greg and he's, and he's still doing it today. Yeah. Mike Valentine, his name.

378
00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.540
I've seen him in years, but he has a, a,

379
00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.690
a place up in northern California and he's still still doing it.

380
00:21:58.691 --> 00:22:01.410
And as soon as he found out about Jujitsu, he was doing that for,

381
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.780
he was driving to San Francisco and working out with whoever was the San

382
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.050
Francisco guy in the early nineties, I guess. And uh, yeah,

383
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.280
we're talking about health greasy. I don't know Charles Gracie vape.

384
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.310
There's a bunch of options up there, but nobody was really doing that.

385
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.560
Nobody was mixing stuff up like that, that I knew about anyway,

386
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.080
and where my in my little town of whatever, you know,

387
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:23.260
however many people it was. Um, but then I just kept on that path,

388
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.350
just kept doing it. I thought it was gonna be a lifelong path and uh,

389
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.780
but I peaked in about 95 and that was in college. Yeah.

390
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.970
So you end up going to college. What do you, what'd you go to study college for?

391
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.860
Uh, well, I want it, well, I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible,

392
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.070
so I get to the seal teams. And so justice studies seemed to be,

393
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.190
the criminology seem to be there. The thing that you could just, hey,

394
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.590
that's kind of interesting and uh,

395
00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:47.530
I can get through this thing in four years and get to the teams and your backup

396
00:22:47.531 --> 00:22:50.410
plan would have been good. Some credit cop or something like that I guess.

397
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:53.350
But I didn't really waste too much time thinking about a backup plan.

398
00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.140
I just knew that college having that degree was the backup plan.

399
00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:00.670
But I figured that out later it was full on devoted to figuring out how to get

400
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:04.090
to the teams and they'd be in the best shape I could mentally, physically,

401
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:06.670
spiritually before I got there. When did you go to a recruiter?

402
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:09.610
What Year of college? Uh, after I finished. Oh,

403
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.160
so after you finished and I thought it was going to be like Forrest Gump.

404
00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:12.670
Like you,

405
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.760
you go to the recruiter and there's a bus waiting outside and you walk through

406
00:23:15.761 --> 00:23:19.240
and you get on a bus and off you go. Like I didn't know. Totally ignorant. Yeah,

407
00:23:19.241 --> 00:23:22.080
it's crazy. Until you do it, you know? I mean,

408
00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.630
I did research enough to find out that there was something called a die fairer

409
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.880
program. And My, uh, my recruiter didn't even know what it was,

410
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.520
but I was in the back of a book and I forget the name of the book,

411
00:23:30.521 --> 00:23:33.610
a paperback book that talked about all sorts of different special operations and

412
00:23:33.611 --> 00:23:33.731
like,

413
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:37.690
and it had like one paragraph on how to get to those places and put the steel,

414
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:42.450
it said Diet Fair program. So I went in there, it was kind of a scam.

415
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.430
I did the, I did that program two total scan.

416
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.190
It's like they get you to sign on for six years

417
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.570
<v 3>and a, they say you get, you guaranteed a chance to see it to try out.</v>

418
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:55.250
That's all I know. I want the guarantee to try out. That's all I need. And uh,

419
00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.400
then you get to boot camp and everybody got a chance in when I was there any way

420
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:02.300
to try out. I sign up for six these guys for four and we all get the chance.

421
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.170
Dang it. Uh, but anyway, ended up spending the, uh, the 20 years in any way.

422
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.990
Yeah. So you, you, what year was it that you actually enlisted in the navy?

423
00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.190
96 96. So got it. I called and I thought, like I said,

424
00:24:13.191 --> 00:24:16.850
I thought I was gonna walk on that bus and then I'm training and I roll my ankle

425
00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:18.950
and I'm like, Oh man, this is gonna be the end.

426
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:21.770
And I can't believe it's like this huge, I thought it was broken. Uh,

427
00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.180
I ended up just being, you know, whatever that's spraying nothing. I lost

428
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.280
21 and uh, get the tow. You think he's seeing this black and blue ankle?

429
00:24:31.281 --> 00:24:35.050
That's huge. And uh, it's like, Oh man, what did I do? Austin run. And I do.

430
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.430
Why was I trained in that day? I should just take, I should've just relaxed,

431
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.070
not gotten hurt. And then soaps on crutches for a couple of months and uh,

432
00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.280
and got back after it and got in the pool.

433
00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.900
How long was it from the time you enlisted until the time you shipped out?

434
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:49.870
Uh, Gosh, you know,

435
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.000
there's all those things you're supposed to do ahead of time. When you're on a,

436
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.220
what do they call them? You're supposed to be going to classes there.

437
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.110
I didn't do any of that maths I think. Yeah,

438
00:24:57.111 --> 00:24:59.330
I didn't do any of that stuff though cause it was encouraged.

439
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.850
But I somewhere I found out it was not mandatory and I was like,

440
00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:03.950
okay good cause I don't want to have to, you know,

441
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:07.280
do whatever these 10 pushups or these people, I knew they actually training a,

442
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:11.690
was it a month ago? No, it was uh, it was months. Yeah, it wasn't years. No,

443
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.660
it was like five months or five months or something. Yeah.

444
00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.400
That's just a like a little heads up to people like you think what?

445
00:25:16.401 --> 00:25:18.350
Like what you thought, which is what I thought, hey,

446
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:22.760
once I sign up I'm just going to get on a bus and that's cool. I'm good. Yeah.

447
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:26.550
And really you got to go survive for another five months or six months as you're

448
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.990
waiting to go. Cause they have certain billets allowed and all this stuff.

449
00:25:29.991 --> 00:25:32.420
So it's kind of a pain. Yep. And you got to do the medical stuff,

450
00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:36.650
the dental stuff, take the as Bab and all that sort of thing to get ready.

451
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.280
So those a couple of trips over to the main recruiting station to do all those

452
00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:42.650
sorts of things. Get over, they'll paperwork in line and then uh,

453
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.860
then off you go. So, and then I was in, now they have every,

454
00:25:45.861 --> 00:25:49.540
all the people that are going to be in some sort of naval special warfare or

455
00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.630
something more squared away now I think. So they go through like they go to,

456
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.130
they go to Chicago I think for eight weeks. So get ready for bugs. Yep.

457
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.810
So you showed up to bugs. Were you ready for boats? Uh,

458
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.750
as I always as ready as one could possibly be with all that training and all

459
00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:06.561
that thought, and then I knew, hey,

460
00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:09.620
there's no way I'm quitting because all my friends growing up knew that I wanted

461
00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:13.040
to do this since I was seven and a so there's no way I'm quitting my die.

462
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.290
I can't go home and tell them I didn't make it.

463
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.860
You know what's weird as people do that right there and they still quit. Yeah.

464
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:20.270
Which boggles my mind.

465
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:25.550
I though the quitting thing is hard for me to comprehend.

466
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.600
And when I hear about people doing it, look, people like that, you know,

467
00:26:29.601 --> 00:26:33.800
there was a guy that killed himself recently and he was that guy and,

468
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.350
and he had told everyone, I'm going to be a seal.

469
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.020
And he had trained for it and he prepared for it. And he looked like a stud.

470
00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:44.010
He looked like a beast of a kid and he played lacrosse and he was varsity this

471
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:45.900
and captain of that. I mean,

472
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.080
and then he got to buds and for whatever reason he quit and then he,

473
00:26:51.301 --> 00:26:55.770
and then he killed himself. And you just think, man,

474
00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:00.420
like whatever they're telling you in buds, you don't quit.

475
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.520
Don't quit. It's pretty easy. Yeah, just do not quit.

476
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.500
And I know they play psychological games on people of saying,

477
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.380
you know, they'll say you don't belong here, and all this kind of stuff.

478
00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:14.850
I don't even remember if they said that to me.

479
00:27:14.851 --> 00:27:16.110
I didn't care what they said to me.

480
00:27:16.111 --> 00:27:20.820
It wasn't even penetrating anything in my brain. Uh, but, but you know,

481
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:22.830
that's what they do. They, they'll say, oh, you don't belong here.

482
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.360
We don't want you on the team.

483
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:29.390
And somebody that's sensitive to that it can get through to them shit and make

484
00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:32.100
them start believing that the instructors, actually,

485
00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.530
the instructors are going to leave and go order a pizza. They don't,

486
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.330
they're not actually thinking about that, you know,

487
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.410
but they take some kid and they quit. And you know what good, like you said,

488
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.620
like good that if someone has that, if someone is going to quit,

489
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.230
please quit during buds for sure.

490
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.930
Did you guys watch a full metal jacket?

491
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.320
I mean there's all these movies that they show drill instructors and what it's

492
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:55.620
like to yell at you. People are screaming at you, it's going to be a game.

493
00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.320
Did you have any trouble with anything of boats?

494
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.980
So I swam before I got there and I'd wake up super early week,

495
00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:04.960
the master swim program at five in the morning. Um,

496
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.080
cause I knew swimming was my weak point. I mean I swam,

497
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.960
I had no problem with swimming, but I wasn't, uh, a competitive swimmer.

498
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.890
You are so much more prepared for bugs than me. I'm just like,

499
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.880
even the fact that you analyze like what your strengths and weaknesses were.

500
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.980
I was just, I was just like, that's another way to go. Yeah.

501
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.520
It worked out but I was young too, which is beneficial. You know,

502
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:29.130
it's beneficial just to be young cause you're just going to adapt.

503
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.520
I mean your brain isn't even completely developed until you're what,

504
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:37.020
24 1819 years old. I was just full,

505
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.690
full adaptation to whatever they're telling me.

506
00:28:39.691 --> 00:28:42.510
That's what you have to do in life in general. But uh,

507
00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.490
but I remember I distinctly remember going to the pool.

508
00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.710
So I'm rehabbing my ankle at this point. Um,

509
00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.980
and I'm going to the pool now and it's flipped.

510
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.250
It's outdoors and it just like,

511
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.550
not snow but that frost layer of frost on the pool deck. So once you got in,

512
00:28:56.551 --> 00:28:57.510
it was actually kind of warm,

513
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.420
but you still have to walk across that pool deck and jump in with these people

514
00:29:00.421 --> 00:29:03.000
that are way older but way faster.

515
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:06.060
I was definitely the slowest person in this masters swim program cause these

516
00:29:06.061 --> 00:29:07.650
people had, you know, swung competitive leaving.

517
00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:10.170
Now they're 45 and which was old time,

518
00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:13.560
42 years old person sitting in your life and they're swimming at five in the

519
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:18.060
morning. Dang. Um, but uh, so I did that. So I was prepared, uh,

520
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.050
for the water and I grew up in the water essentially grouping that scuba diving

521
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:25.170
at age nine until I was comfortable in the water. Once again,

522
00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:29.700
you are so much more prepared. I was like, you know, well I mean I I knew I was,

523
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:33.510
I could swim and I served as a kid and that helped but I definitely wasn't scuba

524
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:37.280
diving. Yeah. I lost that three diving for abalone up north. Um,

525
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.450
so I spent with all those [inaudible]. I don't know if I do that now.

526
00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:42.100
It's like a great white good breeding ground up for sure. But abalone

527
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.640
<v 2>was amazing. I loved that we camp out up there and just have a great time. But,</v>

528
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:49.420
but even though I prepared like that the swims were hard and that first swim,

529
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.510
cause it's that underwater recovery stroke in 1996 they didn't teach you.

530
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.600
Now they teach you how to do this thing. Yeah. Now get in the water,

531
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.330
here's your little basics, here's how you do it. Bring your head up, whatever.

532
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.510
Um, so I had like, what stroke is this? None of the books talked about this.

533
00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:03.680
Let me try to do it. We can get this master's program,

534
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:07.930
what's not in the master swim program. Um, and I was third to last.

535
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.690
I remember getting out of that first one where they pair everybody up and

536
00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:12.670
whatever they call it, the two weeks before you class up,

537
00:30:12.671 --> 00:30:16.420
whatever that thing is called. Um, and I was like, man, I'm third to land.

538
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.080
I can stagger it out of the water. Like I put out on this thing. And I'm like,

539
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:24.400
wow, what's, anyway, they pair me up with this really slow guy. Um,

540
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:25.630
and I think he quit right away.

541
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.390
So then they paired me up with somebody else who was faster. Um,

542
00:30:28.391 --> 00:30:31.360
so I'm barely making the swims in first phase.

543
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.240
And then one of the guys in my class was a water polo player, uh,

544
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.680
from like USC or something like that. And he's like, Hey,

545
00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:41.590
you want me to teach you how to do this stroke? I'm like, yeah, it'd be great.

546
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:45.850
And so we went out behind the barracks thing and went out in the ocean and he

547
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:46.720
just showed me how to do it.

548
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.960
And then I went from being third to last to the next swim. I was third.

549
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.540
There you go. That was awesome. And I was never third again.

550
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.120
I was like fifth or sixth, whatever. But from going from third to last,

551
00:30:55.121 --> 00:30:57.910
I distinctly remember to then coming out third after learning the stroke,

552
00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.150
I was like, I got this. It's different to swimming with fins too.

553
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.510
And the way that they teach you to do it is a little bit different, whatever.

554
00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:07.990
But now they prepare. Now you're prepared going in physically like that. Uh,

555
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.590
that eight weeks they spend in, in uh, Chicago, they learned the strokes,

556
00:31:11.591 --> 00:31:15.060
they learned how to lift the logs and not hurt themselves and how to, uh,

557
00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.340
you know, I use the boat, there's instructions on how to lift the log seizure.

558
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.870
Oh Wow. How to climb the ropes, mental toughness classes, all that stuff.

559
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.970
But you know, what happened? Of course,

560
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.000
once those guys showed up and they were all expecting a lot more seals to come

561
00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:31.150
through now because they needed more in 2003 five, four, five, six,

562
00:31:31.151 --> 00:31:33.220
we need more seals. So let's do this program.

563
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:37.630
And now we just got the fitter quitters and a so same essentially the crazy

564
00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:41.260
thing, the crazy thing is the attrition rate doesn't change. Exactly. Fitter.

565
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.420
Quitters are quitters. I liked that because it's,

566
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:47.170
it doesn't matter how many pull ups you can do. I mean it does matter.

567
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.600
And people say to me, was it mental or physical?

568
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.090
It's definitely both of you can't do, if you can't climb a rope,

569
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:53.850
you're not making it through it. It doesn't matter how bad you,

570
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.750
if you haven't put in the work, you're not gonna be able to climb a rope. Yeah,

571
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.450
you can get some fitter quitters. Exactly. I always did.

572
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.720
Any average high school athlete physically can do and make it through,

573
00:32:04.721 --> 00:32:09.100
but it's obviously the metal parts there that comes in and you get guys that are

574
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:12.910
in amazing shape, guys that were Olympic athletes or whatever it is,

575
00:32:12.911 --> 00:32:15.070
and they quit right away. And I think a lot of that,

576
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:17.430
and like the guy that killed himself maybe, maybe hadn't, you know,

577
00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:21.490
faced adversity in the, uh, in the the ways that you need to,

578
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:24.070
to figure out how to actually overcome it and how to get knocked down and,

579
00:32:24.071 --> 00:32:27.790
you know, moving forward. Um, and you know, you're going to get hurt,

580
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:30.770
you're going to play hurt. And a lot of these guys aren't used to that.

581
00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.460
They're used to be being treated in a way where if they're hurt,

582
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.770
they have someone's right there.

583
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.500
They're there making sure that they're okay and they're going to rehab and all

584
00:32:38.501 --> 00:32:40.040
that stuff. It's not, you know, they're like

585
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.440
<v 3>Lamborghinis, they're going to the shop a lot.</v>

586
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:46.940
There's no one that really crushes buds. No, I don't think so. Just like,

587
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.640
Oh yeah, everything was easy cause there'll be some really good athletes.

588
00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:52.100
And I did have some stud athletes and Mike, my honor man,

589
00:32:52.101 --> 00:32:55.160
was a guy named Keith [inaudible] who was just a boy.

590
00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:00.500
He just fast at everything and strong. He was just a beast, you know?

591
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.710
And so I would say there, I guess there are a few guys that crush bugs,

592
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:06.120
but most people, they're going to have some, they're going to like,

593
00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.690
they're going to pick apart some weak points in you. Yep.

594
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.790
And that's what you want. I want it to be tested. That was the whole,

595
00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:12.350
that was one of the main draws. I was like,

596
00:33:12.351 --> 00:33:15.560
how did you make it through first time every time. No, so I had a,

597
00:33:15.561 --> 00:33:19.190
after hell week my legs weren't working, whatever stress or whatever,

598
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:23.050
whatever it was. So they yanked me off the next swim because I was just no,

599
00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.270
no sinking probably and said, you're going to medical and cushion. Like, no,

600
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:31.090
I'm not going to medical [inaudible] take me alive.

601
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.890
Exactly. I mean, I remember them pulling me out onto the boat and be like,

602
00:33:33.891 --> 00:33:37.700
you are going to medical now. And I was like, Dang it. So I went in there and,

603
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.020
but it worked for me whenever they did.

604
00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:40.460
Like some people stayed there at that time.

605
00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:43.750
Like you'd have a guy in there for like a year just kind of hiding out. Um,

606
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:44.630
but for me it worked,

607
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.470
it just legs near a little rest and then classed up with the next class and next

608
00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:52.940
class. What was your attitude when you got rolled?

609
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.030
Was it like the end of your life where you like, oh my God. Or were you like,

610
00:33:56.031 --> 00:33:59.120
okay cool, I'm going to, cause I guess there's so many people get rolled back.

611
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.050
Yeah, yeah. I was a little bummed cause I had friends with all these guys,

612
00:34:03.051 --> 00:34:04.850
they're going on to die phase and you're like, oh,

613
00:34:04.851 --> 00:34:07.350
you're watching them go on dive phase. And you're like,

614
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.610
but then a lot of them get rolled back for pool comp and then you've got half

615
00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:12.800
your class back again. So that was great.

616
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.500
I had a pool comp was my favorite like that.

617
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.370
And a drown proofing because that's the only time you get to forget physical and

618
00:34:19.371 --> 00:34:21.200
instructor. And the other time, like you're just there, you're getting,

619
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.420
you're getting yelled at, you're being told you're worthless, you know,

620
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.180
whatever. But this is the time where it's motto, we motto,

621
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:29.810
it's like you against them and uh, you know, you, it's a little bit physical.

622
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.170
So I love pool comp pass. First Time I was comfortable in the water. Um,

623
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.710
but then the drown proofing also that's what you really get in physical when

624
00:34:35.711 --> 00:34:38.330
they have those different types of bodies that you have to save.

625
00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.410
You mean lifesaving like saying yeah, for sure. Lifesaving.

626
00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.490
So they have the guides,

627
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.460
they're dead weight and then they one that's fighting you and that's the one I

628
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:49.250
liked. That was awesome. And they drag you to the bottom and I just be like,

629
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.460
and there's probably the martial arts stuff just relax cause he's working,

630
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:55.550
he's working to keep me down there at the bottom and then when he comes up for

631
00:34:55.551 --> 00:34:57.310
air then I just go a little little more than that.

632
00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:00.680
He get his air and he dragged me back down. But it was like us together.

633
00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:03.210
Like I loved that part. That was my favorite part of buttons.

634
00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.880
What I figured out, I figured out what the show called, right?

635
00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:09.590
I figured out like, okay, this is a choke,

636
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:13.940
like a rear naked choke that I can use and the recovery is you, you,

637
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.940
I think you put your arm over like almost the same way you grab them like by the

638
00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.290
lat on the other side. And I just realized, Oh, if I just pay it over here,

639
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.810
it's going to choke this dude and it's gonna make them like get under control

640
00:35:23.811 --> 00:35:25.540
and then boom, I can go back to the position. But yeah,

641
00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:28.250
I had a good time with that. I failed pool comp. Oh yeah.

642
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.900
Because the former UDT guy from nom who ended up working for at trade at

643
00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.580
[inaudible] and one day I asked him, I said, you know,

644
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.950
do you remember family in Pool comp? He goes, Oh yeah,

645
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.270
I was just messing with you. I was like, oh cool. Thanks. Yeah, that's awesome.

646
00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.780
I appreciate it. And then I passed the next time. But yeah, those, those,

647
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.530
the water I was pretty comfortable, comfortable in from surfing growing up,

648
00:35:55.531 --> 00:35:59.360
but nice for me. Everything I had to work hard. I didn't run hard,

649
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:03.330
all that stuff. That's all things. That's what it's all about. So you get done,

650
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.320
you get done with buds and where'd you end up going? Go on team five. And uh,

651
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.690
you know, back then you're like, oh, it's gonna happen. No,

652
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.830
North Korea is going to happen. I said,

653
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.380
I've got to give here weeding stuff in the air.

654
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.500
It's still going to happen if you read the news. Uh, so, uh,

655
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:21.030
I went to teen five, that was my first choice. Um, and just because of that.

656
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.800
So now it's 1997, 1997. Yep.

657
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.370
Showing up. Right Eric? Yeah. So I was still on the west coast at this time.

658
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:32.700
I was over at team one. Yep. And I was, I was in training,

659
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:35.700
so probably got those right around when I got picked up for a commissioning

660
00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:37.790
program. So I'm just trying to think timeframe,

661
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.380
like all the guys that I know from team five were all there. Yeah.

662
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.800
Well old school nineties welcoming you aboard. Oh yeah. Very great.

663
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.460
Very gentle loving environment. Yeah. You know, actually I loved it, you know,

664
00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:51.030
and I thought we'd get there of course and get issued a pager and then they'd

665
00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.540
give us all this awesome gear and we'd be at the bar drinking and all of a

666
00:36:54.541 --> 00:36:57.280
sudden they go off like in the movies and we'd fly off and you know,

667
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.820
save the princess and get back in time for a beers the next night.

668
00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.640
And then I get there and it's like, Hey, new guy,

669
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.600
clean that toilet and paint that wall and change those light bulbs.

670
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.780
And I was like, Roger, that, let's do it. I'm gonna Change.

671
00:37:09.781 --> 00:37:13.470
I'm gonna be the best light bulb changer that, uh, that you've got here. And uh,

672
00:37:13.471 --> 00:37:15.100
so that was a little different. A little,

673
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.440
did you go through SQT at group one or did you go through it second time? Yeah,

674
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:23.010
it was the second class at group one. And uh, yeah,

675
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.870
so I went through that one and you know, it was good.

676
00:37:24.871 --> 00:37:26.910
There was professionalizing standardizing things.

677
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.450
Obviously it's more professional now, but uh, yeah, it was great time.

678
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.870
I loved that. I had a blast. All of the, you rolled into what's, what was your,

679
00:37:33.871 --> 00:37:35.760
what was your position in your first platoon? What'd you do?

680
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:40.890
I see a assistant comm guy. So, uh, for whatever reason, they're like,

681
00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.430
oh, college, you're going to comp school. Oh Dang it.

682
00:37:43.431 --> 00:37:44.970
I want to reach the point man. Exactly.

683
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:47.650
You must be smart enough to say you must've wanted to be appointment. Yeah,

684
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.740
of course. You read those books, right. Point man. Of course the foot patches,

685
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.130
Watson, that's what you want to do. Watching all those movies.

686
00:37:53.131 --> 00:37:55.890
So when they told me I was gonna be a calm guy, I was like, Dang it, you know,

687
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:57.820
that's the guy that will want it. The guy to get shot, first of all,

688
00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.300
the Vietnam and he's right next to the LTA agent located, we make,

689
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.320
and he's got the tennis sticking up in the jungle and the over the grass.

690
00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:05.820
And that's where they, so anyway,

691
00:38:05.821 --> 00:38:08.580
but I did that and it was actually a great experience being a calm guy because

692
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.100
you're part of the planning processes that your guy, um,

693
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.430
and then you're learning the radios. Yeah, it was great. So, um,

694
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:17.250
going through that comscores and then bringing back the, the newest,

695
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.730
whenever you waste radios, newest techniques, whatever it is to the platoon.

696
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:24.000
So even though you have a primary calm guy, um, you kind of know,

697
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.570
you know what's going on after that. That's a good course. There was anyway,

698
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:30.000
it was long course. Um, so it was good to be part of the planning process.

699
00:38:30.001 --> 00:38:32.850
So as for someone that was gonna be an officer at some point,

700
00:38:32.851 --> 00:38:35.620
I got to experience, did you, and you even have that in your brain?

701
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:37.720
I knew it was an option. Yeah, it was an option.

702
00:38:37.721 --> 00:38:41.650
So it was either that or the other east coast seal team. And uh, you know,

703
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:44.860
I wanted to do both of those things. I thought, uh, but I figured, Hey,

704
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:47.170
let's give this a shot. Let's give this a little, it's checking out.

705
00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:50.020
I'm brand new, figure this out and see if, uh,

706
00:38:50.021 --> 00:38:53.500
I'm going to be an officer one day or go to another seal team or move on and go

707
00:38:53.501 --> 00:38:55.150
to the, you know, Central Intelligence Agency.

708
00:38:55.151 --> 00:38:59.380
Like all the people I'd read about and, and watched in the movies. Um, so,

709
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:01.270
and there's nothing going on, right. There's nothing going on.

710
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:05.860
Exactly. And nothing happening, you know,

711
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:07.390
some shit boardings like one platoon digital,

712
00:39:07.391 --> 00:39:10.960
a ship boarding wasn't your platoon? No, no. As long as that was, I did,

713
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:13.850
I did some ship boardings Burke and the dairy,

714
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.660
well I did them retro September 11 it was, this was before that.

715
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:20.440
So it was like wow, pre September 11th doing shipboard. Yeah. I was like,

716
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:23.680
you know, I was walking around like I was damn he had, you know,

717
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:28.160
the like whoever was walking around like I was like,

718
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:32.170
Oh God, bad experiences. Like no you're a loser.

719
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.510
But back then that's what you wanted to be doing.

720
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.940
No and to be quite frank and we weren't walking around like,

721
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:40.870
but we were completely stoked that we got to do something real that I got to

722
00:39:40.871 --> 00:39:44.620
lock and load my gun like that. That was cool. And it was good. It was,

723
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.800
you know, good enough. Cause most guys didn't get to do that.

724
00:39:47.801 --> 00:39:48.634
Most time you don't.

725
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.600
Many guys would just go on deployment and they would train other, other,

726
00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:55.600
you know, foreign militaries on how to do stuff. That's cool.

727
00:39:55.601 --> 00:39:59.080
Build relationships with other countries. Cool. All that. Do some big exercises.

728
00:39:59.081 --> 00:40:01.930
Cool. But to actually lock in, load your weapon and get,

729
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.360
have a real loadout was pretty,

730
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.510
was like a big step back down.

731
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.720
And it felt great for me. But this was,

732
00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.740
so this is 97 and where'd you go on deployment? Uh, so that was a pay comm.

733
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.900
So it was a shipboard or no, no, not, no, no.

734
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.420
This was all the things you just talked about. [inaudible] in South Korea,

735
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.270
countries, trout Australia or wherever else.

736
00:40:25.271 --> 00:40:27.400
So just done the normal pay calm type thing.

737
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.130
Well Pre September 11th with not much going on.

738
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.680
And then you come back from that deployment and roll right into another platoon.

739
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.020
Cause that's what the guys do. They become one cruise. Wonder,

740
00:40:35.021 --> 00:40:37.360
you get promoted to one cruise wonder, Oh yeah,

741
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:40.260
we're either primary comms guy or did you skate out of calm? So I know.

742
00:40:40.261 --> 00:40:43.390
How did you get any good schools in between? Yep. What'd you get? False sniper.

743
00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:47.680
Oh Wow. Yeah. So we'll trouble, yeah. So snipers, what I want,

744
00:40:47.681 --> 00:40:50.110
you must've been squared away cause they don't just give those schools away.

745
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.280
I mean, I don't know. You asked my chief. Yeah, I did. I checked with him.

746
00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:59.560
He was a crazy man, that guy, but a, yeah. So right. Ticked by to sniper school,

747
00:40:59.561 --> 00:41:02.500
which is what I wanted, which I always wanted to do. So, uh, so got there.

748
00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.300
Did a with 73 days I guess.

749
00:41:04.301 --> 00:41:09.100
And what color lingo are you get the valley fever going on. So,

750
00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:10.990
uh, in past, so I passed,

751
00:41:10.991 --> 00:41:14.320
but I didn't pass docking cause I didn't grow up doing that sort of thing.

752
00:41:14.321 --> 00:41:18.810
So I was shooting, you know, that was good. I grew up shooting. Um, so had,

753
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:22.810
I had no problems there. Uh, but then the stocking was a, was a shock to me.

754
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.780
I didn't really understand what was going on was crawling people.

755
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.150
I was crawling for a thousand meters, you know,

756
00:41:28.151 --> 00:41:30.650
out to do this and you can just walk for most of that. You know,

757
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:31.950
I didn't know that at the time. You know,

758
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.310
those of us that didn't know what were doing were just crawling

759
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.960
<v 2>in island in the summer.</v>

760
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:39.080
And just so I came back and did it again and then knocked it out the second

761
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:43.520
time. No problem. Jason Gardener on same thing. He, you know, he,

762
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:47.890
he's like, yeah, I'm a shot. Fine but failed stalking, telling a kid and,

763
00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.970
and then he came back on again and was talking about,

764
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:52.550
well he talked about some of the mistakes he made and it was very similar to

765
00:41:52.551 --> 00:41:54.620
what you said, but yeah, they would tell them like, hey,

766
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:59.030
figure out where you're trying to get to and actually analyze the situation

767
00:41:59.031 --> 00:42:02.000
before you start moving. And of course when he was younger he was just new,

768
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.340
I'm just going to go. Yeah.

769
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.350
And so we just went and he would make it in time or people would see him.

770
00:42:06.351 --> 00:42:08.690
So yeah, that's talking thing is no joke out.

771
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:12.010
But the second time was complete opposite. I think I just relaxed. I said,

772
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.290
you did, you go, did you, when did you go through it? The second time? When did,

773
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.400
when did you go back for stocking? Right before I think we deployed. Yeah.

774
00:42:19.401 --> 00:42:22.640
Right before we deployed. Some time during that same workout. Yep. Oh, okay.

775
00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:25.190
That's cool. That's awesome. Pass it right back. But yeah,

776
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:27.470
I think I just relaxed and I got there and knocked them all out.

777
00:42:27.471 --> 00:42:29.540
Had all you have to get points for people that don't know,

778
00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.150
we build up points says you stock or whatever. So the last,

779
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.520
I think couple of stocks, I'd already had all my points.

780
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.700
So I'm trying to help other guys, you know. That's cool. You know? Yeah.

781
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:38.630
Looking back, I'm like, man,

782
00:42:38.631 --> 00:42:40.760
I should have really helped with these people or should they have, you know,

783
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.010
should I have gone back to my seat with my buds thing like,

784
00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:45.890
but you're different. It's how would you help them?

785
00:42:45.891 --> 00:42:50.510
Like by trying to distract the instructors or by finding that, uh,

786
00:42:50.511 --> 00:42:51.344
that LP,

787
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.620
but you have to crawl and get within a certain distance and then let them know,

788
00:42:54.621 --> 00:42:59.510
hey, no, you're too far. You're too close. I'm risking like, oh,

789
00:42:59.511 --> 00:43:04.070
there it is. So he didn't have to risk and that sort of thing. So, um,

790
00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.070
should I have done that? Maybe not, but uh, anyway, but,

791
00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.380
and it gave me good practice too, cause I got to push the limits then,

792
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.410
which gave me a lot of confidence in what I was going to do later.

793
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:15.800
That's pretty awesome. And then I paid for myself to go to some, uh,

794
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.920
some urban sniper course at Pendleton, some, uh, you know,

795
00:43:18.921 --> 00:43:23.170
one of these kind of fly by night operations that was going on back then, uh,

796
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.590
to teach people how to do with whatever.

797
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:26.680
So I went to an urban sniper course that I paid for,

798
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.280
cause I was curious that at the time snapper school. So, uh,

799
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:32.570
I got to learn about urban hides and, and all that sort of thing,

800
00:43:32.571 --> 00:43:35.180
which was pretty cool. Sweet. Who's running it? I forget the name of it.

801
00:43:35.181 --> 00:43:38.870
I think it had like people were they former former marine snipers.

802
00:43:38.871 --> 00:43:40.460
I think they were out with foods at Pendleton.

803
00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:45.110
I guess it probably was some connections there or something. Exactly, exactly.

804
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.830
So, and then the, and free fall too. And free fall was a crazy one cause, uh,

805
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:52.610
that was, um, I came back to the team one day and I didn't,

806
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:53.570
I didn't get free fall right away.

807
00:43:53.571 --> 00:43:56.660
I did sniper school and then usually kinda like one or the other, um,

808
00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.700
for a new guy coming back. Um, and so,

809
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.840
so my friends went and I came back from,

810
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:06.910
and this was the first time that they'd done the civilian, uh,

811
00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:11.540
deal where they were training. Oh, okay. Whoever that was. And, uh,

812
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.520
so came back from lunch, he was like, you're back and you're kind of,

813
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.200
people are going to schools and it's, you know,

814
00:44:15.201 --> 00:44:18.200
so the people that they can leave or whatever got married. Um,

815
00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.090
and so I came back and I see you Andy stone, who, you know, and, uh,

816
00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.520
he's got this look on his face. And I'm like, oh, that's weird.

817
00:44:25.521 --> 00:44:28.280
I parked my truck and you know, there's no, no gate guard at the time.

818
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.430
You drive onto base, remember that? Um, and told us everyone,

819
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:35.250
one of our dear friends had had a, I'd burned in and died, uh, in freefall,

820
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:39.150
like in that first week. And, uh, I was like, and then of course,

821
00:44:39.151 --> 00:44:41.640
what does the team do after at night? You, I go to the family, we're, you know,

822
00:44:41.641 --> 00:44:44.730
dear friends and do the whole, all that stuff is my first experience with that.

823
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.610
And so as a team do, oh,

824
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:52.380
you're going to free fall like a week later after the funeral, I'm like, Dang,

825
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.250
okay, let's do it. So, uh, so yeah. When did the huma, not though civilian one,

826
00:44:56.251 --> 00:44:59.430
but went to, went to you must stopped at Brag first for the, for the air tunnel.

827
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.550
Let the thing that they did back then, the wind tone. Oh, that's cool. Then, uh,

828
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.090
not be Uma. So did those before my, uh, my second platoon.

829
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:10.020
And then you go into your second, you go on your second deployment. Yup. Yeah.

830
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:13.710
When did you go on deployment? So a couple of weeks before September 11th. Yup.

831
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:18.120
So, uh, Guam expecting a, uh, like the first one just stay.

832
00:45:18.121 --> 00:45:21.280
We're gonna go train some people and finally get to go to Thailand. Uh,

833
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.910
and yet two weeks into it, September 11th happened,

834
00:45:23.911 --> 00:45:26.720
people start banging on doors up and down the barracks.

835
00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.490
We didn't have TVs in our room then. So, uh, you know,

836
00:45:29.491 --> 00:45:33.300
phones are ringing cause it's midnight I guess in warm and uh, you know,

837
00:45:33.301 --> 00:45:37.080
9:00 AM on the east coast and we all get up and go down to the basement of the

838
00:45:37.081 --> 00:45:37.890
barracks in Walmart.

839
00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:41.280
We had one TV and we all watched the twin towers falling TV.

840
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.510
And I was the Intel guy too, so I was comms and Intel. And so I'd been reading,

841
00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:49.740
I just, you know, read a, what are the bin Laden book was, or previous year,

842
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.130
the man who declared war on America or it was called. And so I was doing,

843
00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:54.960
I was always reading this stuff. I was always fascinated by it.

844
00:45:54.961 --> 00:45:56.310
I was always reading about terrorism,

845
00:45:56.311 --> 00:45:59.040
insurgencies and where to make myself the best seal I could possibly be.

846
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:02.460
So I knew what I'll kind of mint, you know, I knew what meant the base. And um,

847
00:46:02.461 --> 00:46:06.220
so I gave a brief right away and nobody knew that. I remember the CEO of,

848
00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.590
of Guam had no idea who all kind of was. And, uh,

849
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.590
so I gave my brief, and you obviously studied it ever since,

850
00:46:13.591 --> 00:46:17.430
but um, that was, we thought we'd be on planes the next day that this is on,

851
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:20.180
let's go. And we start palletizing, getting ready, uh,

852
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.590
but really took couple of weeks. And then off we went.

853
00:46:22.591 --> 00:46:24.330
And that's when I did the shit boardings. Um,

854
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:27.840
cause we took over for team three who went into Afghanistan and we ended up

855
00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:29.010
taking their ship boarding mission,

856
00:46:29.011 --> 00:46:32.580
which actually looking back was a good one because that was my only ship

857
00:46:32.581 --> 00:46:33.414
boarding experience.

858
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.390
And it was interesting because it's like a cop pulling over,

859
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:38.640
pulling over someone in the middle of the night and you don't know what you're

860
00:46:38.641 --> 00:46:42.860
walking up on who have no idea. And instead of a car in a cop, this is a, uh,

861
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:45.870
a class three tanker and it's hidden for Iranian waters and you have a certain

862
00:46:45.871 --> 00:46:49.170
amount of time to get on there and turn it around. And you know, as an e five,

863
00:46:49.171 --> 00:46:53.130
I'm turning around a class three tanker using my gps and a compass,

864
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.730
turning this thing around. It was always pretty cool doing that.

865
00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.410
And there's some good coordination that has to happen on those sorts.

866
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.130
As a calm guy, you're,

867
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:05.520
you're working with a bunch of different networks and young and you're,

868
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:06.780
did you end up, yeah.

869
00:47:06.781 --> 00:47:09.570
Well you just said you end up a lot of times being the person that knows how to

870
00:47:09.571 --> 00:47:12.240
work gps cause you're the calm guy. At least it used to be that way.

871
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.030
Now everybody, that's all they know. Now everybody knows how to do it. But yeah,

872
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.510
actually map and compass. That's why when I later on jumping ahead,

873
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:21.900
I had to relearn map encompass cause I got so dependent on GPS and there was a

874
00:47:21.901 --> 00:47:24.650
book, I think it's called a bee expert with map and compass.

875
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:28.480
So when I took over the junior officer training course before I got out, um, we,

876
00:47:28.481 --> 00:47:30.630
I really a nap

877
00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.030
<v 0>course that we did and topic of course the map and compass exit.</v>

878
00:47:35.031 --> 00:47:39.470
So I was a calm guy and when we first started getting issued,

879
00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:43.820
this was in like 92, we first started getting issued the big gpss and they were,

880
00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:45.860
they were like the size of a route and they were big.

881
00:47:45.861 --> 00:47:48.770
They were like the size of two shoe boxes, baby number. They were big.

882
00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.570
The PSN eight with this big giant antenna that was like the size of my water

883
00:47:53.571 --> 00:47:57.740
bottle. But, but what was interesting is they say, okay Jocko, you know,

884
00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:58.700
you gotta figure out how to work this thing.

885
00:47:58.701 --> 00:48:00.470
So I figured how to work it and though I said,

886
00:48:00.471 --> 00:48:05.450
well all it does is tells us where we are. And they're like, yeah. And I said,

887
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.820
who, if we have a map and compass, we're good.

888
00:48:07.821 --> 00:48:10.700
Like I know where we are on a map and compass for sure. I'm like,

889
00:48:10.701 --> 00:48:13.140
I know out at sea it's different than when you're,

890
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.230
once you get over the horizon. But anyways,

891
00:48:15.231 --> 00:48:19.160
so it was kind of always surprising to me that it's so much easier if you do a

892
00:48:19.161 --> 00:48:20.120
good terrain study,

893
00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:24.110
you can just walk and you can look at your compass occasionally and you know

894
00:48:24.111 --> 00:48:27.680
where you are at rather than constantly looking at a gps and getting your night

895
00:48:27.681 --> 00:48:32.270
vision trashed from that or whatever. You just just was a different transition.

896
00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.320
I mean, and then obviously gps became so good that, yeah, I mean they're,

897
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.130
they're pretty awesome. Everyone has on their watch. Yeah.

898
00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:40.213
<v 2>Pretty awesome now.</v>

899
00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.430
But I did like the map and compass stuff cause I grew up doing it in the,

900
00:48:43.431 --> 00:48:46.310
in the Sierras. I grew up backpacking and an item. But before I can't,

901
00:48:46.311 --> 00:48:49.370
after college I went to Alaska for three months and backpack around up there.

902
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:52.640
Today I did a national outdoor leadership school up there. And once again,

903
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:54.670
training, getting ready. You are so ready for that.

904
00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:58.920
<v 0>I went to high school. That's what I did.</v>

905
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:02.550
Then I just go this, it doesn't matter. You know, it's all the metal part.

906
00:49:02.551 --> 00:49:05.360
Doesn't matter how much you prepare, how little prepare, it's all he wanted.

907
00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:08.400
If your average athlete and you want this thing, hey, just don't quit.

908
00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:09.690
You'll learn along the way.

909
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:13.050
You'll get in better shape when you start running and that sand just don't quit.

910
00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:14.490
That sand will get you in a good run, in shape.

911
00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:18.840
So at what point did you put in for an officer package?

912
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.770
<v 2>So that spring before the September 11th deployment, um, it was, uh,</v>

913
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:28.630
we had a, let's say a chief that was interesting, a leadership team,

914
00:49:28.631 --> 00:49:31.890
I'd say that was interesting. Um, and you know, the,

915
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:35.500
the e five mafia was not happy. Um, they were, and it was, um,

916
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:36.851
it's one of those things like, Hey,

917
00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:41.050
I can complain about it like everybody else or I can put in this package and uh,

918
00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:44.260
and go and do it better than it was done for me. So, so that's what I did.

919
00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.460
<v 0>And you got picked up first time? Yeah. Oh,</v>

920
00:49:47.461 --> 00:49:49.100
you already had a college degree and all of that.

921
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.570
<v 2>Yeah. So put in, they didn't put pronounce. Got My, I remember there's,</v>

922
00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:54.560
I won't say who he is cause I think he's a, an admiral now,

923
00:49:54.561 --> 00:49:57.590
but he was an XL at the time and I'm going in for my interview and it was a

924
00:49:57.591 --> 00:50:02.480
Friday afternoon. So Friday afternoon, team five workout included a keg and a,

925
00:50:02.481 --> 00:50:05.540
so, you know, I didn't, I did the workout, but then I changed into my whites.

926
00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.210
So now I'm in my whites in the spring and those things are horrible.

927
00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:11.510
I hate those uniforms, but, so I'm in my whites, getting them all perfect.

928
00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:15.170
And I go in to do my interview with the, uh, with the XL at the time,

929
00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.410
admiral now. And, uh, he's got a beer in front of him and his PT style,

930
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:19.250
he's like,

931
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:22.100
I just want you to know how this is going to go and if it's any indication that

932
00:50:22.101 --> 00:50:24.470
this beer should be an indication of how this interview is going to go.

933
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:27.010
And I was like, ah, I live, but I was still, you know, do you want me? Yeah,

934
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:30.140
of course. So it's very bearing the whole the whole thing. Um, but yeah,

935
00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.610
of course they, uh, I, I did,

936
00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:35.240
I had a good first two platoons as a new guy with no war going on. Um,

937
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:39.380
and so I got ya got picked up the first time and then you went to ocs? Oh yeah,

938
00:50:39.381 --> 00:50:41.930
after I got back. So, but of course, September 11th happened and I'm like,

939
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.250
Dang it, I made the wrong choice. Um, cause I,

940
00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:49.430
if where you want to be because you want to be enlisted guy, uh, you know,

941
00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:52.750
it'd be in the fight for awhile first. Anyway. Yeah. So, uh, uh,

942
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.970
but it ended up working out well because I got right back from that deployment,

943
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.130
did well, I did it a little training trip to,

944
00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:01.370
to a place and that was a great experience. And then, uh,

945
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:06.230
classed up for OCS at a in Pensacola Hertz or cola and did the same things.

946
00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.380
Yeah, I do that too. It's awful to do the same things.

947
00:51:09.381 --> 00:51:12.920
We didn't bootcamp fold and underwear folds and tee shirts making our bed, uh,

948
00:51:12.921 --> 00:51:16.130
you know, all of those things that somehow qualify you to lead men in combat.

949
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.110
And uh, then right to the seal teams,

950
00:51:18.111 --> 00:51:21.820
right back to seal teams and ended up at a great team that, uh, kind of re,

951
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:25.040
well, let's see, I would just come back from another east coast seal team, uh,

952
00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:28.100
having spent almost a year deployed after September 11th and Rod,

953
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.310
his lessons learned back and then he sent me into that team and right down

954
00:51:31.311 --> 00:51:34.490
range. So, uh, as a brand new officer, uh, I was,

955
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:37.760
I was down range fairly quickly. So timing wise it worked out well for me.

956
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:40.040
That's, that's beautiful. Yeah.

957
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:43.790
I can learn to learn a ton on that deployment and then brought that back to my

958
00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:47.170
team and uh, then deployed again, right, right away to Iraq. So I got a good,

959
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:50.350
then you deployed as an assistant to a competitor. Uh, I was Kinda like a third,

960
00:51:50.351 --> 00:51:52.700
a third, a third,

961
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:56.730
a third o say your ended up doing a lot of the admin stuff and I used to look in

962
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:58.070
there a lot. Um,

963
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:03.110
but that's one was an extra guy essentially that's when a nudge off happened.

964
00:52:03.111 --> 00:52:07.310
So that's when I had probably the most most formative time in uniform was uh,

965
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:10.910
taking a sniper team into an nudge off. So it's, you know, pitch combat for,

966
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.320
it was a two week campaign,

967
00:52:12.321 --> 00:52:16.220
so it was 11 days and it was one of the first times I think that a,

968
00:52:16.221 --> 00:52:19.010
that we really went to the conventional side and said, hey, how can we help,

969
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.340
you know, we're here to support you in this campaign here.

970
00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:23.660
Here's what I'm bringing to the table, these snipers Jay tax,

971
00:52:23.661 --> 00:52:27.700
we can control aircraft for you, complete preplan air. Um, and,

972
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.860
and this is what we can offer. How can this augment you? How can this help?

973
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:35.610
And I'm sure it's happened before, but that was the first time that a,

974
00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:38.720
that I was involved in something like that and had a great relationship.

975
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.110
Colonel Rainy was the guy's name. You must be a general now or retired,

976
00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:46.540
probably retired now. Um, but I had a great relationship with him and uh,

977
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:50.420
we just got after it and for 11 days out there it was great. It was absolutely,

978
00:52:50.421 --> 00:52:52.880
I remember how many team guys did you have with you? And it's six I think.

979
00:52:52.881 --> 00:52:56.210
And then we had some Polish ground guys. Um, and then MARSOC debt one,

980
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.520
cause they were part of that deployment with us was the, it was the uh,

981
00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:01.880
I guess trial run or whatever you call. No,

982
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:06.050
I saw those got turned over with me in Baghdad.

983
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:11.810
Cause when you guys got to Baghdad from your team, Yup. You went to Mozel. Yup.

984
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.260
First and I was down to Baghdad doing the turnover with the Marzoc guys,

985
00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:18.320
which I knew a bunch of the more soft guys from the old days of doing shipboard

986
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:22.550
apoe 97, they were butcher. Awesome guys. Awesome. And then, yeah,

987
00:53:22.551 --> 00:53:25.770
and then I went home and then I guess you came down to Baghdad

988
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.800
<v 4>right before I went home. Take the PSD thing. They, that mission and yeah.</v>

989
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.740
And while that was going on, while we're standing that thing up,

990
00:53:31.741 --> 00:53:34.960
and I learned a ton there too, cause you're like, uh, what are you,

991
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:35.551
what are we doing?

992
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:38.400
We're protecting the interim Iraqi government officials and we're not turning

993
00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:40.020
over with anybody cause it hasn't been done before.

994
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:44.190
And the last guy before allow, he just got blown up by an IED. Ah, okay,

995
00:53:44.191 --> 00:53:47.130
let's do this. Let's figure it out. And uh, so I mean we,

996
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:50.820
we started with one computer, uh, and my CEO from team two, and it was,

997
00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:53.130
I was at that computer just like he'd be talking to me,

998
00:53:53.131 --> 00:53:55.710
dictating things and putting together the mission, blah, blah, blah.

999
00:53:55.711 --> 00:53:58.530
And I was just learning and you know, chairman and where I could,

1000
00:53:58.531 --> 00:54:03.531
where I thought I could have PTSD got stood up with one computer in one small

1001
00:54:03.601 --> 00:54:07.470
office and then it grew into this huge monstrosity. I should eventually became.

1002
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.210
Um, but still learned a lot.

1003
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:12.330
But that also meant I was an extra and extra dude as we kind of figured out what

1004
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:16.680
was going on. And then I got to go up and, uh, help out with [inaudible] at one,

1005
00:54:16.681 --> 00:54:18.750
cause one of those guys had to go back and do something.

1006
00:54:18.751 --> 00:54:21.600
So I got to go up and help them out for a little bit on the Intel side of the

1007
00:54:21.601 --> 00:54:24.810
house for a few weeks. And while I was there, that's when the job kicked off.

1008
00:54:24.811 --> 00:54:25.860
And they're like, we need snipers.

1009
00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:29.340
And so he has grabbed snipers and threw us together. Yes.

1010
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:33.840
Awesome scholar. Yep. I remember the uh, the COO team one.

1011
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:36.360
So he was attached to that Marzoc thing.

1012
00:54:36.361 --> 00:54:38.490
So essentially working for team one at the time.

1013
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.760
And I remember him distinctly calling me in, cause I was y'all. I was the,

1014
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:45.390
Oh and, and I was taking these guys to do this thing that was kind of ambiguous,

1015
00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:49.800
were taking over the city as part of a bigger campaign with, uh, uh, uh, two,

1016
00:54:49.801 --> 00:54:53.400
seven calf. And he said, hey, whatever you do and whatever this means,

1017
00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:55.350
I didn't really know what it meant. I just nodded. But he's like,

1018
00:54:55.351 --> 00:54:59.130
whatever you do, don't go forward to friendly lines. And I was like, uh, okay,

1019
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.050
like Rogers, what does he mean?

1020
00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.130
So within hours of being on the ground and we are pushing forward, taking puss,

1021
00:55:05.131 --> 00:55:07.800
pushing the enemy back, going up, getting high ground in,

1022
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:10.590
calling in the Bradleys and Abrams and coordinating all that stuff.

1023
00:55:10.591 --> 00:55:14.910
So right away I'm disobeying his order and uh,

1024
00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:17.520
and getting the job done because that's what it, that's what it took, you know.

1025
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.940
Um, but it was, it was incredible to work with those guys. And um, we,

1026
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.730
and it was a hodgepodge of people. It wasn't just two, seven cab,

1027
00:55:23.731 --> 00:55:27.030
it was army national guard units. It was air from everywhere. Um,

1028
00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:28.080
all coming together,

1029
00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:30.840
working together for the first time and making this thing happen and pushing the

1030
00:55:30.841 --> 00:55:32.490
enemy back towards the emo Molly mosque,

1031
00:55:32.491 --> 00:55:36.780
which is one of the holiest sites in all of Islam. And, uh, and that 11th day,

1032
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.780
we, we had that place, all of them in the, my Molly boss.

1033
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:42.760
So we worked every day, we'd push forward a little bit and then go up,

1034
00:55:42.761 --> 00:55:44.760
take the high ground. Everybody would come up, we'd do that.

1035
00:55:44.761 --> 00:55:46.710
Maybe they'd be there for a day though. The water would come up,

1036
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:48.720
the food would come up, that army logistics train.

1037
00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:52.180
We would keep us moving and then we'd push forward again. And, uh,

1038
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:56.310
it was incredible to be part of that and a, you know, help out where we could.

1039
00:55:56.490 --> 00:55:58.970
But then of course, we have them right where we want them and, you know,

1040
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:02.090
brand new guy, just want to bomb it. I want to drop a bomb on a human,

1041
00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:06.180
Molly mosque. Uh, looking back, you know, that probably not the right decision.

1042
00:56:06.181 --> 00:56:08.400
There were not, um, no, no. And, uh,

1043
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.470
but without all solders in their old tactic call, but not the best.

1044
00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:13.770
[inaudible] no, no, definitely.

1045
00:56:13.771 --> 00:56:17.820
Now in hindsight and with what I've studied since, you know,

1046
00:56:17.821 --> 00:56:20.750
bombing one of the holiest sites in all of Islam probably was not,

1047
00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:24.060
would not have been the right move. So that was, that was denied. Um,

1048
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.960
<v 2>but if I'd dot all solder was in there,</v>

1049
00:56:25.961 --> 00:56:29.200
although the Mahdi militia was in there and then they did some sort of a peace

1050
00:56:29.201 --> 00:56:31.390
agreement, ceasefire ish thing or whatever.

1051
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:35.860
And then we got to watch them all leave and turn their weapons over to the, uh,

1052
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:39.490
Iraqi national guard or somebody. And that was the end of that. So,

1053
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.820
and then we dealt with without repercussions for, oh, for a while. But yeah,

1054
00:56:42.821 --> 00:56:44.730
we use the tactical experience. Um,

1055
00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:48.490
cause I had to come back and talk about having know sniper weapons systems,

1056
00:56:48.491 --> 00:56:51.520
but also being able to have a red dot on those things to clear rooms cause we

1057
00:56:51.521 --> 00:56:55.090
were clearing rooms and then using those same weapons systems to set up and, uh,

1058
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:56.580
and do the job. So, uh,

1059
00:56:56.700 --> 00:57:00.660
I've got to bring a lot of different ways to make the Hudl to become loopholes

1060
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:03.110
or whatever in the walls and you know, all that sort of thing.

1061
00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:05.590
So I've got to bring back and share a lot of that experience.

1062
00:57:05.591 --> 00:57:08.200
How much longer was deployment once you got done with that?

1063
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:12.520
I think like a month or so. Okay. So it was Kinda like, eh. Yeah.

1064
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.890
You were just like so stoked. Yeah, it was pretty good. And uh, yeah,

1065
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:21.290
it's always a, that was a formative experience. And uh, and then it was a,

1066
00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:22.780
they called it, it wasn't the surge,

1067
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:24.580
but in the seal teams we called it the surge.

1068
00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:28.120
So we got to deploy a year later instead of a year and a half later.

1069
00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:30.320
I was really all that meant, so got to get right back after it, which was so,

1070
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:32.260
yeah, cause then you came home. Yeah.

1071
00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:35.820
Now did you get platoon commander was your, your so now, so now I'm on,

1072
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:39.490
now it's second over the assistant, I guess the official assistant my way up.

1073
00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:43.600
I'm in charge of what you guys the awesome. That's great. Yeah, it was amazing.

1074
00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:46.300
Yeah, you're super stoked. You're like, oh I just had that awesome deployment.

1075
00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:49.270
Yep. And now I get to do another assistant platoon commander.

1076
00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:50.770
Pretty much no factor.

1077
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:54.430
And this time you've got to do an actual workup where you did a workup the first

1078
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:56.120
time to ish, but I was at that third,

1079
00:57:56.340 --> 00:57:59.440
oh so I'll do an admin stuff here and there and it wasn't quite a way it is

1080
00:57:59.441 --> 00:58:01.240
today where you're only doing admin stuff.

1081
00:58:01.241 --> 00:58:04.890
Is that kind of guy attached to the cast unit head shed or whatever. Um,

1082
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:07.780
but essentially I was doing a ton of the app. You're still doing all the workup?

1083
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:09.640
Yeah. Still work. CQC, you still want them out?

1084
00:58:09.641 --> 00:58:11.920
You still want to learn more for not all of them. Oh really? Nope.

1085
00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.830
Cause I was Whitehead my deployment with east with other east coast team in

1086
00:58:14.831 --> 00:58:15.880
there. Uh, I came back,

1087
00:58:15.881 --> 00:58:19.070
I didn't hit with Haiti when that went down cause I was an extra guy so I got to

1088
00:58:19.071 --> 00:58:22.200
go down there, which was pretty cool. You make a good strapping or hoe,

1089
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.620
you're one of those guys that kind of like,

1090
00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:29.390
I didn't plan like land that was always kind of like, Oh man, I'm not in a,

1091
00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:31.690
you know, I'm not the sec, I'm not an Aos. Good deal.

1092
00:58:31.691 --> 00:58:34.000
Dave could be late burger run for his money.

1093
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:39.230
It was not a bad time to be just a dude hanging out. They could grab at anytime.

1094
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:43.250
And of course I'm like, Hey, can you go? Yep. Yeah, of course I can go. Uh,

1095
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:47.630
hey sweetie, I'm leaving this afternoon for me. So you,

1096
00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:49.960
so now you're in your, now you're doing an actual workout,

1097
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:52.660
you get to do all the training and then you go on deployment and you go back to

1098
00:58:52.661 --> 00:58:57.120
Iraq again. Yup. Yup. And a hit Remati this time. Sweet. So going into her mind,

1099
00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:00.790
it's oh five, so five. Yep. Fall of Oh five. And that's where he wanted to be.

1100
00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:01.900
And uh,

1101
00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.580
of course it changes throughout that workout for your own here you go there,

1102
00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.780
whatever. But, uh, I forget at what time it churned to, you were going to,

1103
00:59:07.781 --> 00:59:11.440
to Ramadi now. Um, but that's where he, that's where he wanted to be, you know,

1104
00:59:11.441 --> 00:59:15.760
five oh six. Um, and so we got to get in there and you know,

1105
00:59:15.761 --> 00:59:18.490
it was interesting cause I forget if it was someone there before us or not.

1106
00:59:18.491 --> 00:59:20.410
I can't, I don't know why. I can't remember if there was a Turner,

1107
00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:23.510
there must have been somebody, but that doesn't stand out in my head. Anyway.

1108
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.970
I think it was a much smaller debt before you guys maybe. Yeah,

1109
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:28.670
maybe that wasn't part of that initial,

1110
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:30.680
that first when the head shed goes over first,

1111
00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:34.220
like the head shed went over and then I was the senior guy that came over with

1112
00:59:34.221 --> 00:59:37.550
the rest of the guys. So I didn't really do. And when I got, when we got there,

1113
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.030
most everyone was gone and it was, it was just time to time to figure it out.

1114
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:45.800
So we got to do a few cool things. Um, uh, like going out with the marines,

1115
00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:48.800
dressing up like a marine and getting left behind to do the snipers thoughts,

1116
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.190
you know, not, not exactly what you guys did cause you guys really got after it.

1117
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.090
But, uh, you know, baby steps, you're right. So it was, uh, you know,

1118
00:59:56.091 --> 00:59:59.780
going just going out with the marines in the day, you know, doing those patrols,

1119
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:03.420
like, wait, where this, where the IED threat is high. Um,

1120
01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:05.630
and one of the most dangerous cities in the world at the time,

1121
01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:09.230
like that was legit. Yeah. That's a good, some evolution.

1122
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:11.700
I'm just being on the base side. I mean,

1123
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.600
with mortars coming in at night and I stayed, I didn't stay in that,

1124
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.920
that whatever the, the, the building, the building, you know,

1125
01:00:17.921 --> 01:00:21.110
I stayed out in the tents of the guys. Yeah. Um, and yeah,

1126
01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:24.830
there's nothing there to protect you from the water then like you're just

1127
01:00:24.831 --> 01:00:29.630
sleeping and all of a sudden wasn't gonna land on you. Water suck. Yeah. Well,

1128
01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.560
on the receiving end of you knows, and then you,

1129
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.500
and then during that deployment as well, you also went to Baghdad and,

1130
01:00:35.501 --> 01:00:37.640
and work with an Indian force there. Yep. Yep.

1131
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:40.400
So that's why I didn't see you and turnover, um, got to do this.

1132
01:00:40.401 --> 01:00:43.390
The second thing in my time in the military that was the most formative and

1133
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.720
yeah. Go do some stuff. Uh, in Baghdad with a [inaudible] basically. Yup. Yup.

1134
01:00:47.721 --> 01:00:52.460
Doing that with the more of a civilian type organization and uh, yeah,

1135
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:55.550
with a little less, um, I guess oversight I say.

1136
01:00:55.730 --> 01:01:00.320
So I loved it because it fit my personality in my, uh, my drive I guess.

1137
01:01:00.321 --> 01:01:03.900
Like I was a perfect fit for me at that time. Um,

1138
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.230
and actually one of the things that happened during that time was the

1139
01:01:06.231 --> 01:01:08.810
inspiration for the, the second book. One of the guys that I met there,

1140
01:01:08.811 --> 01:01:12.250
one of the, uh, Iraqis that I was working with. Um, but yeah, that was,

1141
01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:15.650
that was a great time. Learned a ton. We're right there next to, um,

1142
01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:20.790
guys from Great Britain, other army guys from their, their uh, the, uh,

1143
01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:23.390
I guess Premiere Special Operations Unit. Um,

1144
01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:26.460
so when we're doing stuff together and we're training together and uh,

1145
01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:29.420
you guys had a really good optempo, if I remember correctly.

1146
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:32.750
It was a good time to be part of that. Yeah. I had a blast doing that.

1147
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.380
Learned a ton and I got to stay active. Got To, got to,

1148
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:39.920
got to stay getting after it every, not every night, but you know. Yeah. Good.

1149
01:01:39.921 --> 01:01:43.310
Good. OPTEMPO has it Optiv Bro. And then you wrap up that deployment,

1150
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:47.510
which again these are, these are, you've got some choice deployments.

1151
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:52.040
I got a few good ones. Yeah. Was Royce deployments. It was a good time to be in.

1152
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:54.440
My timing was good there, but then I get back.

1153
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:58.670
So now I've done a five deployments in a row. And you're married? I'm married.

1154
01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.260
Yep. Got Married after that first deployment.

1155
01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:05.810
[inaudible] the kid count at this point we are at one. Okay.

1156
01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.290
One and then uh, two for the next one and then three for the next.

1157
01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:14.291
So what'd you do when you got home from that deployment to when you got done

1158
01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:16.970
with your assistant platoon commander tour?

1159
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.030
So this is where my good deal train ends and uh, I get

1160
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.320
<v 4>back and I've done five deployments in a row. Uh,</v>

1161
01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.630
if you count the enlisted ones, three is an officer,

1162
01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.970
all of them get after it and they're like,

1163
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.850
you need to go somewhere and get some professional development. Oh yeah.

1164
01:02:29.851 --> 01:02:34.720
They did call when to your scan and they out of hope on that there.

1165
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:40.050
Yup. And, uh, semi XO had done a, was the ops had been the op, so in Germany.

1166
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.710
So he's like, you need to go to Germany and you need to learn what a unit does.

1167
01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:49.020
Like you need to what? Like that's a place to be in 1944,

1168
01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:52.520
that's where I want to be, not in 2007. And uh,

1169
01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.110
so I went kicking and screaming and I probably should have just said Roger that,

1170
01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:58.530
you know, but a, you know, five appointments in a row.

1171
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.650
And those last three being fairly intense, uh,

1172
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:04.470
I didn't want my guys to go back without me, you know, I felt like you're,

1173
01:03:04.471 --> 01:03:09.030
I'm abandoning them to go to Germany and go like taste wine and look at like

1174
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:13.110
castle walls and these different towns like that. No. Um,

1175
01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:17.010
but you got to go. Um, but since I'd worked with that other government agency,

1176
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.910
um, I got a kind of, I guess you'd say recruited by them.

1177
01:03:20.911 --> 01:03:23.280
And while I'm waiting to go to Germany,

1178
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:28.110
I go up to DC and do my bunch of tests that they put you through up there and

1179
01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:32.960
uh, get a class update to go to a, to that organization. And, uh,

1180
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.560
so I get to Germany, I'm there for a few months. It's horrible. Um, I uh, I,

1181
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.690
well they sent me to French language school first cause they thought I was going

1182
01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:42.270
to go to North Africa, west Africa. How long was French language school?

1183
01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:46.450
Six months. Six months. Um, that was actually good. And you good, whatever,

1184
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:49.200
good family time, all that stuff. But I still wanted to be Iraq rough, you know,

1185
01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:53.250
straight up DLI and straight up DLI Monterrey. Yup, sure. Yup.

1186
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:56.280
Luckily I was at an off site so I didn't have to go on base. So that was the,

1187
01:03:56.281 --> 01:04:00.150
that was good. So I guess, I guess those are good. Yep.

1188
01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:01.740
And of course now I find out about crossfit.

1189
01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:03.120
So I found out about crossfit and Ramadi.

1190
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:07.920
So now I'm just crushing the crossfit and people think I'm insane. Um,

1191
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:11.710
cause no one really had seen that yet. It was 2006, 2007 and they're like,

1192
01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.880
especially outside of the seal teams or outside of, you know,

1193
01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:17.520
firefighters and all that stuff, just the regular gym.

1194
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:21.120
They see you're doing all the swinging barbells around like their kettle bell or

1195
01:04:21.121 --> 01:04:22.500
whatever. Um, so,

1196
01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:25.770
so I'm getting in shape and I'm training for my next whatever deployment.

1197
01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:29.790
I'm trying to make myself better. Um, but we go to Germany, get there, hate it.

1198
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:33.690
A lot of people that were loving it and that made me hate it even more. Um,

1199
01:04:33.691 --> 01:04:35.610
and I probably, you know, I probably should've just said,

1200
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.930
this is where the government needs me,

1201
01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:39.300
so I'm going to do the best I can while I'm here. And I did the best I could,

1202
01:04:39.301 --> 01:04:43.320
but you're not doing anything. It was awful. Um, I shouldn't say that.

1203
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:46.890
It was a very important place to be and they have a mission and it's great,

1204
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.940
but it wasn't for me. Um, so I dropped my papers to get out to go to that. Uh,

1205
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:54.390
cause I was wanting to get back to what I was doing in Iraq and Baghdad in 2006

1206
01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:58.020
getting it. And, uh, so dropped my papers and just gonna go,

1207
01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:01.770
just get out and go do that. And, uh, then a few weeks later they call me,

1208
01:05:01.771 --> 01:05:03.690
the CEO called me back in. And so I say there was, uh,

1209
01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:07.770
an OIC at team seven got out, there's a spot open. Do you want it?

1210
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:11.320
And I was not expecting that at all. And I said, Whoa, I have,

1211
01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:13.940
my mind was already set. I was, I was essentially mentally, I was out,

1212
01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:16.980
I was training, I was getting ready for, to go back down range with this other.

1213
01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.370
And uh,

1214
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:20.770
<v 3>so went home, talked to my wife, she was pregnant again with number,</v>

1215
01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:24.940
our second child. And we decided to stay. And I'm like, okay, I can get, uh,

1216
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:28.590
get back after to do that leadership role that, that, uh,

1217
01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.940
that I became an officer to have.

1218
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:35.470
And we went team seven. And that's where I met you.

1219
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:40.610
So now I get my first taste of Jocko and uh, some finally some, uh, uh,

1220
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:44.950
actual professional development that mattered. And uh, it, uh,

1221
01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:47.830
up until that point it's baptism by fire. Like show up a team to, hey,

1222
01:05:47.831 --> 01:05:49.870
you're going to Afghanistan. Oh No,

1223
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:53.790
no training other than the tee shirt folding and a and underwear folding hit

1224
01:05:53.791 --> 01:05:58.420
ocs. Um, luckily I had some really good guys on those deployments that, uh,

1225
01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:01.780
had already been to Afghanistan that took me under their wing that, uh,

1226
01:06:01.781 --> 01:06:04.310
you know, showed me how, here's how these nods work.

1227
01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:06.890
The point man only had them in your last platoons, uh,

1228
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:09.410
before September 11th tears. I use these things. Yeah.

1229
01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.480
And that's kind of the way it used to be. You,

1230
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:15.940
it was OJT and the young junior officers, or even the young enlisted guys,

1231
01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:18.370
you'd just get trained by the more experienced guys.

1232
01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:23.230
And that works great if you're lucky enough to have a good experience guy that

1233
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.410
has the desire to teach you that really cares about the job,

1234
01:06:26.411 --> 01:06:27.670
that wants to do a good job,

1235
01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:31.540
that recognizes the importance of leadership and the then, then it works fine.

1236
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:35.500
Yep. The problem is that's, that's not, it doesn't always work like that, right?

1237
01:06:35.501 --> 01:06:37.840
You get a guy that's a knucklehead, you get a guy doesn't care, you just,

1238
01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:41.980
you can just end up in a bad situation. And then, and then some young kids,

1239
01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.410
we're young, we're influential,

1240
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.650
what clothes we're, we're,

1241
01:06:47.651 --> 01:06:52.651
we're very easily influenced now and we see how a bad leader acts and they tell

1242
01:06:53.321 --> 01:06:55.360
us that that's how we're supposed to act. And we start acting that way.

1243
01:06:55.361 --> 01:06:58.420
It's very, I've seen that happen many times. I'd meet a guy,

1244
01:06:58.421 --> 01:07:02.680
I'd meet a guy that would be coming through my training and like,

1245
01:07:02.681 --> 01:07:06.190
he wouldn't quite be a good leader. And I, you know,

1246
01:07:06.191 --> 01:07:07.540
I'd say it'd be just be talking to him like, Oh,

1247
01:07:07.541 --> 01:07:09.340
who was your platoon chief when you were a new guy?

1248
01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:11.700
And they'd name a guidance saying, okay, well I,

1249
01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:15.880
you could very easily find the root problems here. Right? Or I'd get a young,

1250
01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:18.790
oh, I'll get a platoon commander. And I'd say, well, who was your, you know,

1251
01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.230
who was your platoon commander when you were at AIC?

1252
01:07:20.231 --> 01:07:24.220
And they'd give a name and they, the guy would be a bad leader. And you'd say,

1253
01:07:24.221 --> 01:07:25.610
okay, well I know where you got this from.

1254
01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:29.920
And they give me the ability to actually steer them in the right direction and

1255
01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:33.790
say, hey, you know, I wouldn't be offensive about their old boss or anything,

1256
01:07:33.791 --> 01:07:37.300
but I'd start like saying, hey, there's another way to look at these things. So,

1257
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:41.380
yeah, sure. Yep. No, it sounds like you got lucky. You had some good leadership.

1258
01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:45.030
I mean, I know who your CEO was a team too. He's freaking outstanding. Yep.

1259
01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:48.700
And yeah, so you had some good [inaudible], some great mentorship,

1260
01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.150
cared about it, and he cared about mentors for sure. Um, and his,

1261
01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.480
the senior guys that he brought with him from his other command also cared about

1262
01:07:55.481 --> 01:07:56.231
those senior chiefs.

1263
01:07:56.231 --> 01:08:00.220
They cared about what the next generation of both enlisted and officers were

1264
01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.040
gonna do and how they were going to lead. And, uh,

1265
01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:07.570
so I was very fortunate to be the recipient of that mentorship and that

1266
01:08:07.571 --> 01:08:10.140
guidance. Um, and, uh, and that,

1267
01:08:10.141 --> 01:08:13.870
that served me well and I had a good foundation anyway, but, um, but, uh,

1268
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.040
but having that, have somebody cared that

1269
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.810
<v 4>a, the put a little structure, I mean, not, not, no.</v>

1270
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:23.610
A little structure behind it, um, was, uh, was refreshing and uh, yeah,

1271
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:25.550
I just took all that on board and just, uh,

1272
01:08:25.551 --> 01:08:28.410
you don't wanna be the best leader I could from for my guys. Um,

1273
01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:32.540
but now a team seven. So that's now it's, well, we won't, it was a good,

1274
01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:36.350
it was a great experience as an OIC, but most of that was due to the,

1275
01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.720
the training that you brought. And, uh,

1276
01:08:38.721 --> 01:08:41.600
so now I've got to professionalize things a little bit. Think about them.

1277
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:44.900
And now my deployment, my good deal train, I thought ended. Um,

1278
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:48.110
and it spiked a little bit and we thought, oh, we're going back to Afghanistan.

1279
01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:50.980
Yes. And it's gonna be you guys, cause you got anybody in,

1280
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:54.100
it didn't end up being my platoon. Um, so I got to go to the Pi,

1281
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:57.410
got to go to the Philippines. And at first I'm like, Eh, that's a bummer.

1282
01:08:58.070 --> 01:09:03.050
But it ended up being a great experience, uh, at an outstation had more,

1283
01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.530
uh, special forces guys working for me than I had seals working for me. Um,

1284
01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:10.130
I had multiple outstations that, uh, that reported to me and, um,

1285
01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:14.930
and we were there to assist, this has been type thing,

1286
01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:19.490
but it was with a Philippine Marine general and he'd been down there fighting

1287
01:09:19.491 --> 01:09:22.250
that and certainly in the southern island chain since he was, uh,

1288
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:26.600
an incident or whatever they, you know, I'm a second lieutenant there. And, uh,

1289
01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:26.901
I know,

1290
01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:31.901
so I took the role of a student with him and amazing guy and just,

1291
01:09:32.391 --> 01:09:35.040
I really learned the area, learn what they were up against,

1292
01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.870
learn how the enemy was adapting to them, um,

1293
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.790
and how to change over his 30 some years of doing that.

1294
01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.910
And of course he was mentored cause they'd been doing that for over a hundred

1295
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:46.990
plus years. They'd been fighting that thing. Um, so he was a recipient of,

1296
01:09:46.991 --> 01:09:50.480
of mentorship and lessons from the people that came before him. And, uh,

1297
01:09:50.481 --> 01:09:54.620
I took that time because I noticed that the SF guys, the army SF guys,

1298
01:09:54.621 --> 01:09:56.390
particularly the warrant officer that was there with me,

1299
01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:59.000
knew a lot more about counterinsurgency than I did.

1300
01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:02.180
Like I had the tactical kicking the door. I had that experience,

1301
01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:04.310
but I didn't have that broader piece yet.

1302
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:09.580
And so I took that time in the Philippines to study and read a ton.

1303
01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.640
And who are the, who are the foremost experts on counterinsurgency out there?

1304
01:10:13.641 --> 01:10:15.050
Where are they? How do I get in touch with them?

1305
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:18.860
Do they have anything I can read? And so I just really schooled myself up.

1306
01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.260
And so it became a kind of a competition, uh,

1307
01:10:21.261 --> 01:10:24.050
between me and him and discussions about counterinsurgencies worldwide,

1308
01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:27.620
but particularly where we are, but how that applies more broadly. Um,

1309
01:10:27.621 --> 01:10:30.650
so I took it as a time to a, and, and we did get to go do,

1310
01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:34.310
they got to do some things down there that film, film, marines with us, just,

1311
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:39.050
uh, you know, helping with some more technical things. But, uh, but we,

1312
01:10:39.051 --> 01:10:42.210
they got to get after it and they lost guys and we were there doing the,

1313
01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:44.630
the Medevac and doing all that sort of thing. Um, you know,

1314
01:10:44.631 --> 01:10:48.540
the bodies lined up the whole deal. Um, and it was a, so it was, uh, it was,

1315
01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:52.400
it ended up being a very, um, I, I guess a,

1316
01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:54.770
a another formative experience for me.

1317
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.970
And then I got to use what I learned about working with the army once again.

1318
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.120
But, uh, in my next deployment as a troop commander, once again,

1319
01:11:02.121 --> 01:11:06.100
I had and went back to Iraq and had more SF guys working, uh,

1320
01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:11.180
under my man than, than I had seals. So it was good. It's a good run.

1321
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:14.070
So you, you went through workup when you were a platoon

1322
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.870
<v 0>commander in 2008. Eight, Yup. Cool. Yeah,</v>

1323
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:23.400
so I was pretty settled in because I'd come home in 2006 and 2007 I took over

1324
01:11:23.401 --> 01:11:26.360
the training. So yeah, we were, we were, we were going hard.

1325
01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.550
<v 4>Oh yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. My first experience, I heard all about this Jocko guy,</v>

1326
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:35.260
why, who is this guy? And, uh, and uh, the first time I met you,

1327
01:11:35.261 --> 01:11:37.000
you walked in to that room,

1328
01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:40.510
that briefing room at Fort Knox of the stadium seating and they have them

1329
01:11:40.511 --> 01:11:43.960
diagram of things over the sand table stuff, Huh? Yeah. And uh, yeah,

1330
01:11:43.961 --> 01:11:48.730
you came in and gave us this, this talk and I was like, yeah,

1331
01:11:48.731 --> 01:11:53.490
let's go get it. It was awesome. But uh, I had one of my more formative uh,

1332
01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.190
experience in training in that particular, um, uh,

1333
01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:01.610
urban warfare environment thing where I, you probably remember the,

1334
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:05.080
the scenario cause you probably did it for her for most of the platoons and

1335
01:12:05.081 --> 01:12:06.010
troops coming through,

1336
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:09.700
but you have a mission and you go out there and you're doing that mission and on

1337
01:12:09.701 --> 01:12:13.330
the ground force commander now the GFC and I'm there in my,

1338
01:12:13.331 --> 01:12:18.331
in my vehicle and helicopter crashes like a few buildings down a few blocks down

1339
01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:22.090
and a that comes over there where they're radioing for help for a couple of

1340
01:12:22.091 --> 01:12:22.950
blocks away. And we,

1341
01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.480
we still have guys in the building and our guys are taking contact in the

1342
01:12:25.481 --> 01:12:28.660
building and it's all set up, whatever. And I'm like,

1343
01:12:28.661 --> 01:12:30.760
I'm hearing that and I'm not going, I'm not going to,

1344
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:34.500
I'm going to deal with this problem first when to prioritize and execute. Sure.

1345
01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:37.250
Yes. But I wasn't quite doing that yet. I was like, why'd you,

1346
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:40.180
I'm listening to the radio and I'm hearing they have a woman with the screaming,

1347
01:12:40.181 --> 01:12:44.530
a helicopter pilot, females screaming like, ah, they're surrounding us.

1348
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.940
What about the whole thing? And like, ah, what do I do? Ah,

1349
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:52.960
and I split my force. Oh yeah, I split my force. Oh yeah. And uh,

1350
01:12:52.961 --> 01:12:56.310
so hey, these two vehicles breaking off, you're gonna go to the crash site,

1351
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.890
secure the crash site will then meet you at that crash site and we'll exfil

1352
01:12:59.950 --> 01:13:04.400
together. So you know what happens next? Yes, I do. Disaster, disaster strikes,

1353
01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:07.510
everything goes. So I, and that was the point of the exercise.

1354
01:13:07.511 --> 01:13:10.420
I think if you split your force, that may matter what happens every time.

1355
01:13:10.421 --> 01:13:14.590
But it, but uh, in this case it did was it ended up being a disaster.

1356
01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.890
We get out, we, there's guys behind. We have to go back in the whole thing.

1357
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:20.500
It was, it was great. It was great, but, uh,

1358
01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:23.350
I remember sitting down with you afterward and it really drove home,

1359
01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:28.330
prioritize and execute. And, uh, if you split your force,

1360
01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:32.370
you better have a damn good reason to split that for us. Just

1361
01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:36.330
<v 0>had a, a guy named John Stryker Meyer on the podcast, the last podcast,</v>

1362
01:13:36.331 --> 01:13:39.150
you couldn't have heard it yet because it's not out yet,

1363
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:44.430
but he's telling a story. He's in Vietnam and this guy's just incredible sock,

1364
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:48.690
just the most insane stories ever. And he's telling a story and he goes, yeah.

1365
01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:51.060
So I split my forces and I put, you know,

1366
01:13:51.061 --> 01:13:53.490
four guys on one side of valley and four guys on the other side of the valley

1367
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:57.000
and we start moving it. And I, and I had to like find out bro,

1368
01:13:57.001 --> 01:14:00.780
cause I mean like this is, this is disturbing to me. Right. And so I said,

1369
01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.620
I was like, explain to me, you know, what,

1370
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.750
what made you decide to split your forces? I said, I never liked it. He goes,

1371
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.860
I never, he goes, I split no this way. He said, he goes,

1372
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.570
I split my force to two times in Vietnam.

1373
01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.140
Other than that it's horrible idea cause I didn't even like doing it here.

1374
01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:21.400
I didn't have a choice. So that is a true statement. That is a true statement.

1375
01:14:21.401 --> 01:14:24.100
If you can avoid splitting your forces, avoid flooding,

1376
01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:26.620
splitting your forces and if you have to, you better have a damn good plan.

1377
01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:31.720
You've ever damn good reason. Because when then when you add enemy fire into it,

1378
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:36.550
trying to link up forces friendly forces under enemy fire,

1379
01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.100
I believe that's the hardest thing to do in combat.

1380
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:42.610
I think that's the hardest thing to do in combat is separate forces.

1381
01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:46.570
Trying to link up with enemy contacts is a freaking nightmare.

1382
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.000
And so if you can avoid it, avoid it. Yep. You have had to do that. Yeah.

1383
01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:53.040
<v 4>Baghdad once with a QRF that we,</v>

1384
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:57.110
I just talked to on the radio before and ask that was a little little dicey.

1385
01:14:57.111 --> 01:15:00.470
But um, but yeah, that the not splitting your forces for our ties and executing.

1386
01:15:00.471 --> 01:15:03.110
I'll never, never forget that and never forget that experience.

1387
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.820
And luckily up until that point,

1388
01:15:04.821 --> 01:15:09.440
I hadn't been in a situation where I had to do it down range because I probably

1389
01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:14.010
would've done it. Um, but after that training, I, I was like, I would,

1390
01:15:14.011 --> 01:15:17.180
I would think, I think long and hard, maybe not long and hard, I would think,

1391
01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:22.610
uh, think it through before doing that. Yeah. Tough move to make. Yup.

1392
01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.473
That was a great one

1393
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:26.100
<v 0>for me. Coming back from Ramadi, I was like super, um,</v>

1394
01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.300
paranoid about stuff and really into the fact that like,

1395
01:15:31.301 --> 01:15:36.301
I wanted people to not make dumb mistakes that I made or that I could have made

1396
01:15:36.371 --> 01:15:39.050
or that I saw other people make. Like, so I was pretty, um,

1397
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:42.700
adamant to make sure the guys were learning lessons.

1398
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:45.170
<v 4>Oh yeah. No, it was a, it was amazing that that training was great.</v>

1399
01:15:45.171 --> 01:15:47.150
And then we went to Niland of course,

1400
01:15:47.151 --> 01:15:50.990
and did the Philando warfare thing and I was very comfortable with that because

1401
01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:53.650
we had a team on the east coast. We'd done that. Uh,

1402
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:57.440
I EMT individual movement technique, uh, earlier on,

1403
01:15:57.441 --> 01:15:58.580
I guess maybe on the West Coast.

1404
01:15:58.581 --> 01:16:00.950
So I had it died down at a couple of times already.

1405
01:16:00.951 --> 01:16:03.560
So some of my junior officers that, uh,

1406
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:06.000
had never done it before and they were like, what are we doing? Why are we,

1407
01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:09.320
it's not just just online and just the old school. Um,

1408
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:12.590
so they didn't quite quite get it, but I was a platoon commander.

1409
01:16:12.591 --> 01:16:16.610
I was very comfortable with that at Nyland. So, um, and it was, it was, yeah,

1410
01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:19.040
obviously amazing training, especially with the technology that's, uh,

1411
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:21.260
that came along at that time where there was no,

1412
01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:24.230
there was no hiding from any mistakes that you might've made out there.

1413
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:26.900
You got the GPS on you and you go back and you debrief it.

1414
01:16:26.901 --> 01:16:29.300
There's none of that old school nineties. Like, no, that wasn't me.

1415
01:16:29.301 --> 01:16:31.940
I think it was so and so over there. I would never do something like that.

1416
01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:34.760
Oh No. Here it is. Here's your number or whatever it was on there. And,

1417
01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:38.360
and you can watch it all in the debrief room and watch your little watch,

1418
01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:39.194
your little, uh,

1419
01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:44.380
your little what's icon or still icon around field and watch your little icon

1420
01:16:46.011 --> 01:16:50.960
engage your own forces. Oh yeah. Watch that over, over do it. Right. Yep.

1421
01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.570
No, exactly. And then going through the second time, you know,

1422
01:16:53.571 --> 01:16:56.300
things evolve and change and, and all that. But uh,

1423
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:59.570
going through the second time as a troop commander then I was even more

1424
01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:02.060
comfortable with it, particularly in those those situations.

1425
01:17:02.061 --> 01:17:05.260
I knew the lessons we wanted to get out of there. Um, and uh,

1426
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:07.310
then I could do it a little better even than when I was a platoon commander

1427
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:10.040
cause I'd already learned some of those in those scenarios.

1428
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.190
<v 3>But uh, yeah, and that was a amazing training and there was no,</v>

1429
01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.880
there is no question, uh, the, the impact that has had on the,

1430
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:20.980
on the seal teams for them in a positive way carried some down. Ben, did you,

1431
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:27.410
that was awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody, everyone's down. Everybody. Oh my gosh,

1432
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:32.270
yes. A lot of down mandrills it was a lot of that. I mean especially,

1433
01:17:32.271 --> 01:17:35.150
and then what was cool for me and people always remember that but,

1434
01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:38.570
but when they talk to me about it and, and sometimes even then, you know,

1435
01:17:38.590 --> 01:17:43.400
this is too much, you know. And the fact of the matter is if you,

1436
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:47.780
if your leadership did a good job inside of a task unit or inside of a troupe,

1437
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:49.940
if the leadership did a good job and the,

1438
01:17:50.230 --> 01:17:52.850
and the use decentralized command and the fire team leaders got up and made

1439
01:17:52.851 --> 01:17:55.970
things happen and they kept thinking like if they did those things,

1440
01:17:56.330 --> 01:18:00.890
you couldn't, we the trade at guys, the treat at cadre couldn't take,

1441
01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:01.640
they couldn't,

1442
01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.160
they couldn't put a bunch of people down cause they would get their asses kicked

1443
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:07.580
by the troop, the troop would crush them. And you know,

1444
01:18:07.581 --> 01:18:10.970
that would usually not happen early on cause they would have to figure this out.

1445
01:18:10.971 --> 01:18:13.730
But once they got good at it, like the trader guys would say, you know,

1446
01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:17.120
they'd be calling up myself for the or the master chief running it and be like,

1447
01:18:17.121 --> 01:18:19.490
Hey, can you bring me back to life? Can you bring back to life? And be like,

1448
01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:22.160
no man, you, you know, you got killed. Of course,

1449
01:18:22.161 --> 01:18:24.140
sometimes we would bring them back to life to press the platoon harder.

1450
01:18:24.141 --> 01:18:25.250
Of course I'm not,

1451
01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:29.720
I'm not going to claim that we didn't do that because we're going to put the

1452
01:18:29.721 --> 01:18:33.140
pressure. Yeah. Yeah. But uh, yeah, so that was amazing.

1453
01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:36.820
The down mandrills yeah. I get you get you in shape and then, but then it,

1454
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:38.120
it gets people pissed off.

1455
01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.760
Like I came back to life and you're pissed and you're not making good decisions.

1456
01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.593
Yeah, totally.

1457
01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:45.750
And the other thing that you taught me and I passed on and they'd say,

1458
01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.880
I still think about today and it's not, it gets in the book, uh, you know,

1459
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:53.870
take a breath, look around, make a call, as easy as that,

1460
01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.510
they say that, that I think about that a lot. Like, oh, I got to do,

1461
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.830
sit back and get off my gun,

1462
01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:02.300
look around what's going on with the sac tactical situation and make a call.

1463
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:07.580
That's it. So simple. So not easy.

1464
01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.680
So, not easily do, but it's cool when someone like,

1465
01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:14.030
like for someone like yourself that's a sniper that likes to shoot and all of a

1466
01:19:14.031 --> 01:19:15.170
sudden you're tasking to commander,

1467
01:19:15.171 --> 01:19:18.530
it's real easy to get to go right back to what you're super comfortable with,

1468
01:19:18.531 --> 01:19:20.750
which is, hey, I'll just get on my gun and start killing bad guys.

1469
01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.560
But you've got 40 other guys that are doing that and none of those 40 guys are

1470
01:19:24.561 --> 01:19:26.960
actually making a decision about where you're going to go next to save every

1471
01:19:26.961 --> 01:19:31.340
one. So you're the guy that has to do it. So that's, so that's a good one. Yep.

1472
01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.950
For sure. When I look back at old pictures,

1473
01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:37.020
I see that how my loadout changed over the years. Uh,

1474
01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:39.410
and now five time I was a troop commander, you know, my,

1475
01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:42.460
I'm a lot lighter while I'm radios now too. And you're carrying

1476
01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:45.210
mags. I'm like, ah,

1477
01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:47.300
the only thing y'all three and one of the gun or whatever it was.

1478
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:50.720
But there's a reason for that is cause that my job is not a control this element

1479
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:55.070
and crush the enemy not to be on the trigger. And then, uh, what was your,

1480
01:19:55.071 --> 01:19:56.950
what was that deployment like where'd you go as a, to you commit?

1481
01:19:56.970 --> 01:20:01.400
That was interesting because it was the, a, it was the withdrawal from rack, so,

1482
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.550
uh, were there six months. Um, but, uh,

1483
01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:08.070
it was because we didn't know if we're staying, if we're going, if

1484
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.790
<v 2>we're staying or authorities, we're going to be, um,</v>

1485
01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:14.940
where we were going to be based. Uh, there was a lot of questions. Um,

1486
01:20:14.941 --> 01:20:19.350
so we had to prepare both to stay longterm and to get up, pack and come home.

1487
01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:23.460
Uh, which is what ended up happening. Uh, so I think we got, they made us,

1488
01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:26.160
our element actually ended up going to the Aleve and at the end of November,

1489
01:20:26.161 --> 01:20:29.460
I guess there was another month there, but it was getting,

1490
01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.130
they packing up and going home essentially. Um,

1491
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.610
but you're working with a partner force and you're using your, uh,

1492
01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:39.300
technical intelligence to try to prosecute targets so that, uh,

1493
01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.470
this wasn't gonna become a highway of death on the way out of there as the enemy

1494
01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:47.850
just sets. I did you drive out of there? No. [inaudible] throughout. I was,

1495
01:20:48.230 --> 01:20:52.560
they drove out pretty peacefully to not a big massive convoy. Exactly.

1496
01:20:52.561 --> 01:20:55.680
It was not, uh, now what we expected. So,

1497
01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:58.530
but it was cool for a little bit cause you got, I think they,

1498
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:02.160
they got a little more liberal with some of the targets there for awhile when

1499
01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.630
they were like, okay, we don't want this highway debt.

1500
01:21:03.631 --> 01:21:04.411
That's not going to be on really,

1501
01:21:04.411 --> 01:21:09.060
because I denied that I didn't want to let a unilateral op go when we're leaving

1502
01:21:09.061 --> 01:21:14.000
anyway. Uh, so, so it got a little, we got to do a couple of obs, but uh, but,

1503
01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:15.540
uh, mostly it was, uh,

1504
01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:20.570
a leadership challenge to keep the guys focused on their mission while at the

1505
01:21:20.701 --> 01:21:23.790
same time getting ready to go home for almost the entire deployment.

1506
01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:26.130
So it was an interesting time. That was Bosnia southern racks.

1507
01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:28.680
I hadn't been down there before the Brits had been there first. Of course,

1508
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:33.110
I'm totally different terrain than anything I had dealt with before. And uh,

1509
01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:34.920
it was, but it was good. It was an interesting deployment.

1510
01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:38.490
Had a great a senior chief. Um, and, uh, he was still in,

1511
01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:40.890
he was still in crushing it and yeah,

1512
01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:44.550
came home and that was the last time I'd ever tactically lead guys on the

1513
01:21:44.551 --> 01:21:45.091
battlefield.

1514
01:21:45.091 --> 01:21:49.080
And I knew that and pretty much as soon as we were airborne on the way home,

1515
01:21:49.081 --> 01:21:53.030
like getting out. It's a, so that was, that was many years.

1516
01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.200
Were you out at that point? I think I was at 16. Right there.

1517
01:21:55.230 --> 01:22:00.060
And what was your family situation at this time? So three kids and right at the,

1518
01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:04.590
during the second worker, so or so in my OIC work up, uh,

1519
01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:07.380
the one where I met you and then went to the Philippines, um,

1520
01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:10.860
that's when our middle child was born and we found out,

1521
01:22:10.861 --> 01:22:15.150
I think it was at the month checkup that something wasn't quite right. And, uh,

1522
01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:18.540
he ended up, well, I'll get to where he has, but we couldn't,

1523
01:22:18.541 --> 01:22:22.320
didn't know what was going on. I wasn't eating, um, wasn't meeting milestones.

1524
01:22:22.321 --> 01:22:25.170
There was something off and my wife knew right away, but it was just like,

1525
01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.770
I just took just a Keto eat when he's hungry, that sort of thing. Um,

1526
01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:32.620
and we didn't know what was happening. So all during that second, uh,

1527
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:33.301
of that deployment,

1528
01:22:33.301 --> 01:22:36.750
they put me in that exceptional family member category five cause there was a,

1529
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:39.600
you know, pretty severely disabled and uh,

1530
01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:43.080
which means that you're not going anywhere outside of the, your,

1531
01:22:43.090 --> 01:22:46.230
your current medical situation for your family. So it essentially takes the,

1532
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:49.650
the decision out of the service members hands, which is a good thing,

1533
01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.210
meaning you're gonna stay,

1534
01:22:51.211 --> 01:22:54.000
you were in San Diego and you're staying with that exceptional service member

1535
01:22:54.001 --> 01:22:56.670
thing says, okay, we got to take care of this guy.

1536
01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:00.220
He's going to stay in San Diego. Yup. Yeah. There's different levels to it.

1537
01:23:00.221 --> 01:23:04.050
But ours was during your second, during your OIC tour or during your,

1538
01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:06.160
to compare between the, you can mandatory the first

1539
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.670
<v 4>that we're still trying to figure out what was going on during that first one</v>

1540
01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.410
and nobody knew what was going on with him. So it's, well it's a lot of,

1541
01:23:11.411 --> 01:23:13.210
a lot of doctor visits, all that sort of thing.

1542
01:23:13.211 --> 01:23:16.120
But my wife did it all because as you know,

1543
01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:18.070
when you're in that pendulum has to be on the team,

1544
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:20.860
that's your responsibility as a leader. You're, you owe it to the,

1545
01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.410
to the mission. You owe it to the guys, you owe it to their families,

1546
01:23:23.411 --> 01:23:27.440
you go to the country ultimately to have that be your sole focus. Um,

1547
01:23:27.490 --> 01:23:31.600
and that's how it was. The pendulum is over there and my wife got that, um,

1548
01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:36.940
uh, that, that's, that's what you do as a leader obviously. So when I got back,

1549
01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:39.400
well, yeah, when I got back, we still don't know.

1550
01:23:39.401 --> 01:23:41.770
So now I've done two workups with this situation,

1551
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:44.950
two deployments with this situation. My wife's handled it the whole time,

1552
01:23:44.951 --> 01:23:49.650
super strong. Um, get back and I go to buds as the Oxo,

1553
01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:52.480
so I get to see people ring the bell outside that office and put the,

1554
01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:54.760
put the helmet down. Um, but in my head,

1555
01:23:54.761 --> 01:23:58.150
I know I'm done and I haven't w I didn't make a, I didn't hide it.

1556
01:23:58.151 --> 01:23:59.710
A lot of guys will hide it if they're planning on getting out.

1557
01:23:59.711 --> 01:24:02.410
They won't say anything to anybody in the chain of command because they might

1558
01:24:02.411 --> 01:24:05.830
stay in or whatever it is. Uh, but I'm like, Yep, I'm getting out. That's funny.

1559
01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:09.070
And they're like, no, you gotta go be an ex now and not at 20. And uh,

1560
01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:12.490
it kind of surprised people when I'd say that. Um,

1561
01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:17.530
but buzz is a machine that is running and as an op, so it's fairly,

1562
01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:22.270
I dunno, it's not as dynamic, let's say. Is that at a seal team? Um,

1563
01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:25.630
and is during that, well,

1564
01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:29.350
little after that that someone told Ross Perot our story,

1565
01:24:29.351 --> 01:24:33.820
the Ross Perot and in Texas and the guy and so about your son. Yep.

1566
01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:36.840
About our son. Cause you still didn't know what was going on. Right?

1567
01:24:36.850 --> 01:24:39.550
So this is six years into a bunch of different hospitals. You know,

1568
01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:42.220
these six years old, you have no idea what's happening.

1569
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:44.880
All sorts of different diagnosis, uh, to, uh,

1570
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:48.640
paid for Cedar Sinai going up there where we thought we're the foremost experts,

1571
01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:52.900
um, to oxygen. My wife would take him to an oxygen tank 30 days,

1572
01:24:52.930 --> 01:24:55.150
two hours a day or whatever it was that we paid for,

1573
01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:57.940
just to see if anything would, would help. Um,

1574
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:59.740
someone tells Ross Perot Her story,

1575
01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:04.150
and this is December of 2013 I want to say.

1576
01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:05.590
Um,

1577
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:10.590
and I get a call out of the blue from Ross Perot who sounds exactly like Dana

1578
01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:16.480
Carvey impersonating Ross Perot in the 90s. And, uh, like what is going on?

1579
01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:20.730
And he's like, I'm going to, we're gonna fix your son. Like what? Uh, what?

1580
01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:23.140
And he's like, yeah, I want to send the, send the jet,

1581
01:25:23.141 --> 01:25:26.170
I'm going to assemble a team of doctors here in Texas and we're going to fix

1582
01:25:26.171 --> 01:25:30.490
him. And then he hangs up like, what just happened? That was wild.

1583
01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:31.511
And about an hour later,

1584
01:25:31.511 --> 01:25:34.540
his Lee doctor at southwestern medical center calls and says, Hey,

1585
01:25:34.541 --> 01:25:36.130
I know Mr [inaudible] just called you. Uh,

1586
01:25:36.190 --> 01:25:38.440
we're not gonna send the jet tomorrow, but we are going to send it.

1587
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:39.730
And in the meantime,

1588
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:43.500
send us everything you have on your son and any medical records and we'll

1589
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:46.480
assemble a team of genetic specialists here that we'll take a look at everything

1590
01:25:46.481 --> 01:25:50.770
and we'll bring you guys in for some testing and see what we can do. It's like,

1591
01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:53.140
wow, amazing. So a month later, um,

1592
01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:58.290
they send the jet you five 50 lands and we get on and head off to Texas and go

1593
01:25:58.420 --> 01:26:00.010
to a week of testing in Dallas.

1594
01:26:00.460 --> 01:26:05.360
And they sent our blood all around the world and found a genetic specialist in

1595
01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:08.390
the Netherlands who had just discovered the certain genetic mutation that helps

1596
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:09.830
form the brain at birth.

1597
01:26:10.370 --> 01:26:14.750
And that now it has a name to it and it's the three doctors that discovered

1598
01:26:14.751 --> 01:26:18.110
this. But when, uh, when we found out about he was the 13th person in the world,

1599
01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:20.420
so number 13 in the world they found with this,

1600
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:24.650
and it was just called an r two f one, which is the,

1601
01:26:24.710 --> 01:26:28.250
the gene that this mutation affects. And uh,

1602
01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:31.940
being able to put a name to it for us, especially for my wife,

1603
01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.230
that was so liberating. Um,

1604
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:36.230
I can't really describe what it means just to put her name to it.

1605
01:26:36.231 --> 01:26:37.280
It seems like a simple thing,

1606
01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:41.420
but a not knowing for six years and then being able to put a name to it and know

1607
01:26:41.421 --> 01:26:42.020
that, hey,

1608
01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:46.070
this is just one of those random freaky things that happens and there's nothing

1609
01:26:46.071 --> 01:26:49.810
you could have done about it. And that's it. Just dub.

1610
01:26:49.811 --> 01:26:52.890
We got to put a name to it. So it was like Roger that, okay, uh,

1611
01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:56.030
now what do we do? And, uh, for us, that's our mission in life. You know,

1612
01:26:56.031 --> 01:26:59.210
he gave us purpose and that purpose and mission is to make sure that, uh,

1613
01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:02.570
he reaches his full potential, whatever that may be, but he needs 24,

1614
01:27:02.571 --> 01:27:05.990
seven fulltime care for life. So, um, uh,

1615
01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:08.240
and we have two kids bracketing him on, on either side.

1616
01:27:08.241 --> 01:27:11.030
So the real challenge is raising those kids so that their childhood is not

1617
01:27:11.031 --> 01:27:14.450
solely defined by their brother's condition. And, uh,

1618
01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:18.260
hopefully it makes us all more loving, more compassionate people.

1619
01:27:18.490 --> 01:27:20.750
And so far it's, it's worked out that way. But once again,

1620
01:27:20.751 --> 01:27:24.080
my wife still bears the brunt of that every day cause I'm out here, you know,

1621
01:27:24.081 --> 01:27:26.660
I'm a, I haven't had a nice dinner last night. I'm here hanging out with you.

1622
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.333
Um, and she's at home.

1623
01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:32.390
<v 0>The only thing I sound like the bad guy or let's just say I go on book tour,</v>

1624
01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:35.090
I'm a dad, go on for two weeks, a book tour and a, you know,

1625
01:27:35.091 --> 01:27:39.020
I'm shaking hands and all that. And she's, uh, she's got it, you know, the,

1626
01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:42.290
the wives that the wives are incredible. You know, mine included,

1627
01:27:42.291 --> 01:27:46.820
she raised four kids and you know, I was barely ever around. So, um,

1628
01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.340
and you know,

1629
01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:51.710
same thing with every guy that we have on here that talks about what their wives

1630
01:27:51.711 --> 01:27:55.790
had too. And I think Jason Gardner, when he was on,

1631
01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:00.050
he said he, the first time he was on, he said, put up with his wife,

1632
01:28:00.051 --> 01:28:02.060
had to put up with a lot. And then he came back on and said like,

1633
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:03.680
he didn't mean it like that.

1634
01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:09.080
It's like actually had the strength to handle what the appropriate statement is.

1635
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:12.680
Hey, you know, the wives, the wives that stick around. Yep.

1636
01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:14.810
Which isn't a big number, right? Most,

1637
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:18.550
most women don't have the strength to get through this and deal with this kind

1638
01:28:18.551 --> 01:28:23.120
of thing. But you know, obviously your wife is a saint and as his mind and like,

1639
01:28:23.121 --> 01:28:26.360
okay, you're going to be gone all the time. Cool. I got this,

1640
01:28:26.361 --> 01:28:28.610
I'm going to handle it. So, and that's how it has to be.

1641
01:28:28.611 --> 01:28:32.000
So now hopefully the pendulum is not quite like this. You're like,

1642
01:28:32.001 --> 01:28:32.870
I'm not dealing with life, life and

1643
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:37.190
<v 4>death situations. Um, so I can, I can help out a little more, but I'm still,</v>

1644
01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:37.800
yeah,

1645
01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:40.940
there's an entrepreneurial type venture writing is not just a writing in a cave

1646
01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:42.380
somewhere and sending it off to New York.

1647
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:44.780
It's everything that goes along with building a small business.

1648
01:28:44.781 --> 01:28:48.770
So right now it's a, it's a full on sprint. We have momentum and a,

1649
01:28:48.771 --> 01:28:51.560
I don't really have any other speed besides just all in.

1650
01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.840
So a is are building this thing and,

1651
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:57.470
but it's not like you're deploying for six months, although things do shift now.

1652
01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.780
So now, uh, even a,

1653
01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:04.290
like a two week trip that that's like a six month deployment relatively now.

1654
01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.610
Cause there's not the country asking you to do this. You don't, uh,

1655
01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:10.470
you don't owe it to the guys or the mission anymore, uh, type thing. But, uh,

1656
01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:13.680
yeah, no, I'm super, super fortunate to have the wife that I do.

1657
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:16.320
She's so strong and um, yeah, our son is,

1658
01:29:16.321 --> 01:29:21.321
so he's 11 now and really has a mental capacity by a two year old I'd say.

1659
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:25.350
And, um, but with only the, so few people in the world diagnosed with this,

1660
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:29.160
I think now they're probably up to must be in the 70s now. But, um, uh,

1661
01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:32.620
you know, uh, it just, every day.

1662
01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:36.930
So every day is still a struggle. And uh, but that's our mission. You know,

1663
01:29:36.931 --> 01:29:39.560
we got him for a reason and that's, I look at it has a,

1664
01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.290
we got him because we're strong enough to, uh, to handle it. And that's,

1665
01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:45.990
I don't know how else you'd have. How's he do? Look at it. I don't really know.

1666
01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:48.540
<v 0>And then so as this is going on,</v>

1667
01:29:48.630 --> 01:29:51.390
was that one of the things that made you think about getting out of the

1668
01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:51.720
[inaudible]?

1669
01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.130
<v 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1670
01:29:52.130 --> 01:29:55.650
So I didn't think about it while I was doing that OIC platoon or doing my troop

1671
01:29:55.651 --> 01:29:59.130
commander to work cause I was just all in. Um, but once I got back,

1672
01:29:59.131 --> 01:30:01.450
like when that plane took off, when we landed in San Diego,

1673
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:03.720
when I took a breath, realize I'm going to buds,

1674
01:30:03.721 --> 01:30:06.030
I see people guys running on the beach, you know, doing the,

1675
01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:10.670
doing the buds thing. Um, that's not why I came in. Um,

1676
01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:14.990
I came in to do the job, I'd done the job. Now I owe it to my family to, uh,

1677
01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.240
to let that pendulum go back and take care of them.

1678
01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.250
So it was very obvious to me. It wasn't like, it wasn't,

1679
01:30:20.251 --> 01:30:22.770
it wasn't something I struggled with. Uh, I think a lot of guys like,

1680
01:30:22.771 --> 01:30:24.910
should I get a stay in? Should I get out? Uh,

1681
01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:29.160
what's my hard time with that transition? Mine was not difficult.

1682
01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:32.610
Neither was the decision to get out because I was handed my next mission.

1683
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:37.110
Really. We just didn't care of the family and especially our middle child. So,

1684
01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:41.910
um, in that respect, my transition, um, easy is the wrong word, but,

1685
01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:46.590
um, I knew what I needed to decision was clear. There was no, no wavering.

1686
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:51.950
<v 0>And then you knew from your previous,</v>

1687
01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:55.190
from your childhood that the job you were going to take,

1688
01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:59.630
the job you're going to go after after you retired was going to be a writer.

1689
01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:00.750
Yep,

1690
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:01.900
<v 4>Yep. And of course, you can't say that,</v>

1691
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:04.480
especially at that time in the CLT teams, like, you know, the, uh,

1692
01:31:04.481 --> 01:31:07.930
the midline and stuff is going on and all that. So, uh,

1693
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:12.550
that's when I played very close to the chest, I say, uh, to the best. Um,

1694
01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:14.430
so I knew what I wanted to do my whole life.

1695
01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:16.300
I didn't think about it while I was in the teams. It was just like,

1696
01:31:16.301 --> 01:31:17.270
that's what I'm going to do next. Yeah.

1697
01:31:17.380 --> 01:31:21.130
That's the amount of thought I put into writing when I was in the teams. Um,

1698
01:31:21.190 --> 01:31:24.730
but everything that I read growing up was part of that education.

1699
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.740
All the reading don fiction that I did on insurgencies and terrorism, um,

1700
01:31:29.770 --> 01:31:32.680
all that fed into it. Then all the personal experience down range.

1701
01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:34.360
So it's almost like, um,

1702
01:31:34.410 --> 01:31:38.740
I could not be more prepared for what I'm doing now as a writer. Um,

1703
01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:42.340
but uh, I didn't during those last couple years, I was just like, okay,

1704
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:47.410
upsold budge then to your junior officer training course OIC, which was great,

1705
01:31:47.411 --> 01:31:48.340
but it's only for a couple of months.

1706
01:31:48.341 --> 01:31:53.341
But I love that cause you get to pass on some lessons and then you'll move on

1707
01:31:53.741 --> 01:31:56.350
out. But that last year in the navy,

1708
01:31:56.530 --> 01:31:59.070
and I think I've heard you talk about this before, uh,

1709
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.600
and that you didn't do all these things that you're supposed to do when you get

1710
01:32:01.601 --> 01:32:04.360
out. Like I had went into the, what are the taps, whatever that course.

1711
01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:07.330
It was awful. I could did all those things that you're supposed to do.

1712
01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:09.400
Are you even going, I know I heard you say that. I'm like, you could,

1713
01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:12.490
how did you get out of that? Well, no one's going to tell you what's, I mean,

1714
01:32:12.491 --> 01:32:14.440
you're a big dude. You're not, everyone's going to tell you, you gotta do this.

1715
01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:16.050
But, uh, I went,

1716
01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:19.530
I did that course and I went to medical and I went to dental and I got all the

1717
01:32:19.531 --> 01:32:21.550
signatures and I got my paperwork in order.

1718
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:25.510
And that was like the whole last year in the navy. Uh, had spine surgery,

1719
01:32:25.511 --> 01:32:29.950
had spine surgery in there last year. Yeah. So that was good. Um,

1720
01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:32.550
and I still got all that taken, taken care of. Uh,

1721
01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.450
but it's during that time where I'm like, okay,

1722
01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.770
my job is to get out of the navy now.

1723
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:38.640
Well now I'm gonna start thinking about it's writing thing. And uh,

1724
01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:41.610
that's when I wrote down about seven different ideas. Uh,

1725
01:32:41.630 --> 01:32:44.230
I put them on the table in front of me, like one page synopsis type things.

1726
01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:47.350
And I chose the one that I thought would resonate with people the most.

1727
01:32:47.351 --> 01:32:50.500
And that's that, that theme of revenge cause that's, that uh,

1728
01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:54.190
resonated with me as a kid growing up, both in movies and books.

1729
01:32:54.190 --> 01:32:57.460
And it's something that just resonates with people in general,

1730
01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:01.540
is that theme for whatever reason. So I knew the first book would be without,

1731
01:33:01.541 --> 01:33:03.130
would be the theme of the first novel.

1732
01:33:03.490 --> 01:33:08.140
And then when did you start actually writing it? During that last year?

1733
01:33:09.010 --> 01:33:11.890
Um, so yeah, for outline, uh,

1734
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:16.540
synopsis started writing title came really quickly, all that sort of thing.

1735
01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:18.760
Um, but then submitted it.

1736
01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:23.590
So I got out summer of 2016 was my retirement and submitted it to Simon and

1737
01:33:23.591 --> 01:33:27.730
Schuster in the fall of 2016. And uh,

1738
01:33:27.731 --> 01:33:30.890
I got very lucky, very, very lucky in that a,

1739
01:33:30.891 --> 01:33:33.970
a friend calls me out of the blue and he says, Hey, do you know this uh,

1740
01:33:34.090 --> 01:33:38.560
author Brad Thor? And I said, Oh yeah, of course I know him. And he said, well,

1741
01:33:38.561 --> 01:33:40.420
I know you're writing this book. Do you want to, you want to talk to him?

1742
01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:44.290
Maybe has some advice for you. I said, well, he talked to me and he said,

1743
01:33:44.291 --> 01:33:47.350
let me set it up. Yeah. It's a former CEO who's out in the finance world now.

1744
01:33:47.710 --> 01:33:50.800
And they sat next to each other at some fundraiser or something. And, uh,

1745
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:54.070
so I get on the phone with this Brad door guy and he could not have been more

1746
01:33:54.071 --> 01:33:56.230
generous with his time. It's Kinda like an interview. It's kind of like a,

1747
01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:59.740
why do you want to write type thing. That was the underlying, um,

1748
01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:01.420
kind of theme of our conversation.

1749
01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.530
And I think he wanted to make sure I was doing it for the right reasons and you

1750
01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:04.610
know,

1751
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:07.390
told him the truth about my mom being a librarian and reading all this stuff

1752
01:34:07.391 --> 01:34:09.910
growing up and all these authors I loved and wanting to do this forever.

1753
01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:13.810
And he's like, all right, I'm not going to help you as you go along,

1754
01:34:13.811 --> 01:34:17.560
so don't send me chapters, don't ask me questions. Um, but if you read a book,

1755
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:21.480
if you finish a book, I will let Simon and Schuster know that it's coming.

1756
01:34:21.630 --> 01:34:22.510
You can't guarantee the open.

1757
01:34:22.511 --> 01:34:27.040
It definitely can't guarantee that they'll like it, uh, if they read it. Um,

1758
01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:28.180
but as a thank you,

1759
01:34:28.190 --> 01:34:30.280
your friend told me some of the things you did in the teams and as a thank you

1760
01:34:30.281 --> 01:34:34.360
for that, um, I will let them know it's coming. And I'm like, Roger that.

1761
01:34:34.361 --> 01:34:38.020
And he said, what are you going to be done? I said, one year from today, and uh,

1762
01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.590
call them back one year to the day later. And I was like, Dude, you remember me?

1763
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:44.910
And uh, he sure did. And I said, it's done. And he said, well,

1764
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:48.910
it done the best it can possibly be. I was like, well,

1765
01:34:49.810 --> 01:34:53.740
nope, nope. I can still work on it a little more, but it's done. Uh, he said,

1766
01:34:53.741 --> 01:34:57.890
well, call me back when it's the best that it can possibly be. And I said,

1767
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:01.580
<v 2>Roger, that. So it took another four months of reading, editing, rewriting,</v>

1768
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.390
getting it to, you know, if you've held onto it for 10 years,

1769
01:35:05.391 --> 01:35:07.880
you could probably make it better by degree. But, uh,

1770
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:11.760
I mean it was at that stage where it was ready for another set of eyes and, uh,

1771
01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:13.760
called them back four months later and he said, okay,

1772
01:35:13.761 --> 01:35:16.940
I'll let my editor know what's coming and shipped it off. And she read it.

1773
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:18.231
Next thing you know,

1774
01:35:18.231 --> 01:35:20.480
I'm on a plane to New York and we're having coffee and I think you want to make

1775
01:35:20.481 --> 01:35:24.080
sure I wasn't a crazy person. And, uh, she said, hey, I want this thing, but,

1776
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:28.100
but you need an agent. And I'm like, well, how do you get one of those? And uh,

1777
01:35:28.130 --> 01:35:31.580
so she introduced me to four agents and then I, uh, I chose one. Next thing,

1778
01:35:31.581 --> 01:35:35.180
you know, we're off to the races. So, uh, I, I got very lucky. Yeah,

1779
01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:38.930
that's awesome. It does take a little bit of luck. How do you,

1780
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:43.850
how do you actually mechanically, right? Like what do you actually do? Yep. So,

1781
01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:47.900
um, all those seven different synopsis that I had ahead of time, um,

1782
01:35:47.901 --> 01:35:48.770
where I picked the one,

1783
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:51.980
now all those other ones are turning in to these next novels,

1784
01:35:51.981 --> 01:35:53.600
even though I might have different characters or whatever,

1785
01:35:53.601 --> 01:35:56.930
I can more for those ones. So I have about seven different novels in,

1786
01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:01.640
in the pipe ready to go. So start with that idea, the synopsis,

1787
01:36:01.670 --> 01:36:05.030
like a one pager, two pager, then an outline. And then as I write,

1788
01:36:05.031 --> 01:36:08.060
I fill in that outline cause new things, I, new ideas come up, new chapters,

1789
01:36:08.061 --> 01:36:10.780
new characters and I added to that outline. So the,

1790
01:36:10.781 --> 01:36:13.400
and it was in word up until very recently. Um,

1791
01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.590
and I just of have a visual representation.

1792
01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:18.740
What's words you switch to from word to Scribner. Okay.

1793
01:36:18.741 --> 01:36:23.210
We shall get to here in a second. Game Changer. Um, so yeah, in words,

1794
01:36:23.211 --> 01:36:24.740
you're scrolling and copying and pasting,

1795
01:36:24.741 --> 01:36:26.420
moving chapters around and then you know,

1796
01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:29.590
you don't want to cut and then have it disappear because it was nervous. Uh,

1797
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.720
is it backed up? Oh my God. So, uh, so yeah,

1798
01:36:32.721 --> 01:36:37.040
so I'm filling out of that paradigm. Exactly. Don't cut and paste,

1799
01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:41.360
I want to cop cop the case. Power goes out at that moment,

1800
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:44.370
it's out something, I hit the wrong thing and it's gone. Uh,

1801
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:49.390
so I fill in that outline until I'd say about 75% and then it becomes not as

1802
01:36:49.731 --> 01:36:53.750
efficient for me to continue to just have an outline that's now very complete.

1803
01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:57.980
Uh, now I can just transition to just the story about that point. Um,

1804
01:36:58.010 --> 01:37:00.050
but you know, recently I found out about this thing,

1805
01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:05.150
Scribner and that it set up very much like word, but you,

1806
01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:09.410
it's broken down by chapter so you can drag and drop chapters and see how it

1807
01:37:09.411 --> 01:37:11.810
looks. You can have each one of those chapters have a synopsis.

1808
01:37:11.811 --> 01:37:15.950
So it shows up as essentially like a card or a yellow sticky and you're looking

1809
01:37:15.951 --> 01:37:17.960
at this whole thing and think, oh, you know what?

1810
01:37:17.961 --> 01:37:21.200
Chapter six should really be chapter three, drag and drop.

1811
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:26.030
And you can move in research so you can drag in articles from online pictures,

1812
01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:30.170
video into research folders. So it's all right there instead of like,

1813
01:37:30.171 --> 01:37:31.620
what file was that? Did I copy you?

1814
01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:36.780
Put where you are like a day late and uh,

1815
01:37:37.220 --> 01:37:41.360
eight books too late for me at this point. Seriously.

1816
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:43.250
Like that sounds like brilliant.

1817
01:37:43.670 --> 01:37:47.900
And I could so use that and I just finished my eighth book. Nice.

1818
01:37:47.901 --> 01:37:52.130
So that sucks. That sounds awesome.

1819
01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:56.280
For nine. Yeah. And [inaudible] which I started yesterday.

1820
01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:57.820
<v 4>Yep. Import from words,</v>

1821
01:37:57.850 --> 01:38:01.470
I had about half of the import from word and it breaks it into chapters.

1822
01:38:01.471 --> 01:38:04.950
You just put an icon and let it know whenever that little symbol is I'm where

1823
01:38:04.951 --> 01:38:07.680
you want the chapter breaks and then can you export it back to work.

1824
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:08.790
And I haven't done that yet.

1825
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:13.010
So I will be doing that in the next couple of weeks. Uh, for book three. Uh,

1826
01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:16.230
but I have not actually have imported from ward. I have not exported.

1827
01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.970
So you can say you can. Yup.

1828
01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:20.520
They say you can in the tutorial video and they show you how,

1829
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:23.910
but I have not yet done that check. Yeah. From all over it.

1830
01:38:23.911 --> 01:38:25.200
Cause my editor likes that word.

1831
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:30.080
<v 0>So before we nerd out too hard, we'll move on to something else. Yeah.</v>

1832
01:38:30.510 --> 01:38:35.180
Uh, so you get done with these and,

1833
01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:36.620
and where did you, I mean,

1834
01:38:36.621 --> 01:38:40.190
what did you do with your family once you retired because you had the mission of

1835
01:38:40.191 --> 01:38:43.340
your kid and your kids, you had the mission,

1836
01:38:43.341 --> 01:38:44.600
now that you've got to finish this book,

1837
01:38:44.601 --> 01:38:47.090
did you finish that book while you're still active duty? Nope. Nope. Sell,

1838
01:38:47.091 --> 01:38:49.640
finished it a just a four months afterwards.

1839
01:38:49.641 --> 01:38:53.120
So you set yourself up financially somewhat that you were in a survivable

1840
01:38:53.121 --> 01:38:56.120
scenario, even without alternative income besides your retirement.

1841
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:58.180
<v 4>Uh, I had other, uh,</v>

1842
01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:59.590
<v 0>businesses. You had some other little,</v>

1843
01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:02.890
you had some other little side things going on and give you enough money to

1844
01:39:02.891 --> 01:39:03.724
float this gig.

1845
01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:07.470
<v 4>Yep. I have an operation in Hawaii, a hunting operation out there, um,</v>

1846
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:09.150
with a couple of other partners. Um,

1847
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:12.240
every so often someone would ask me to do some speaking or whatever. Um,

1848
01:39:12.241 --> 01:39:15.150
that sort of thing. Did some, some tactical training, um,

1849
01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:18.510
little things like that. But I was set up to, uh,

1850
01:39:18.511 --> 01:39:22.140
to be able to move into this financially and then we're, where did you,

1851
01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.370
where'd you move to?

1852
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:26.820
So we got out and we weren't planning on moving cause our son, we thought, hey,

1853
01:39:26.850 --> 01:39:30.600
we have this, uh, the support network built up now over the last six,

1854
01:39:30.601 --> 01:39:35.100
seven years. Uh, it's here in San Diego and we can never move. We can't,

1855
01:39:35.101 --> 01:39:38.280
we definitely can't go someplace where it's cold because he just lies down.

1856
01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:40.590
And just, anyway, it's a,

1857
01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:43.230
it would be very difficult to take him to a place where it was rainy,

1858
01:39:43.231 --> 01:39:46.100
where it was snowy, uh, where you had to put extra clothes on him and that,

1859
01:39:46.101 --> 01:39:50.340
that sort of thing. And then we go to park city, Utah, the a,

1860
01:39:50.341 --> 01:39:54.240
the winter after I get out and we took our son on a vacation with us for the

1861
01:39:54.241 --> 01:39:57.900
first time and we started going to park city during my last couple of years when

1862
01:39:57.901 --> 01:40:00.690
I'm not. So I build up ton of leave. I never took leave, uh,

1863
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:03.870
until those last couple of years. Um, cause I was last couple of years.

1864
01:40:03.871 --> 01:40:06.240
I'm like, well, I'm not taking guys down range anymore. Um,

1865
01:40:06.330 --> 01:40:09.750
let's start taking some leave. Uh, we have all this on the books. So we, uh,

1866
01:40:09.751 --> 01:40:13.020
we'd go to park city with a few friends from San Diego cause it's easier to fly

1867
01:40:13.021 --> 01:40:16.980
to salt lake and drive to park city than it was to drive two bands of traffic to

1868
01:40:16.981 --> 01:40:20.040
get to a mammoth or big bear or whatever else. So a,

1869
01:40:20.041 --> 01:40:23.430
so we started doing that last couple of years and then we took our son on

1870
01:40:23.431 --> 01:40:26.550
vacation with us and we took someone with us to help.

1871
01:40:26.610 --> 01:40:27.870
So we had an extra set of hands.

1872
01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:30.960
But we got there and we spent two weeks up in park city and we thought,

1873
01:40:30.961 --> 01:40:34.840
you know what, we can do this. We're not tied to San Diego. Um,

1874
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:38.230
we brought someone, yes, that was your full time. Yes. Um,

1875
01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:40.090
but we did it and that was like, ah,

1876
01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:44.550
that opened just some few doors for us that we didn't think were open to us

1877
01:40:44.551 --> 01:40:47.880
ever. And while we were there, I opened this, open this magazine and say, Hey,

1878
01:40:47.881 --> 01:40:50.970
look at this, this house around the corner here, let's go check this thing out.

1879
01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:54.340
So we drove around the corner, checked it out and let's move.

1880
01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:57.020
We decided right then and there to move and, uh,

1881
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:58.840
got the house and six months later we're there.

1882
01:40:58.841 --> 01:41:03.460
And I think it helps to make a physical and psychological break with the

1883
01:41:03.461 --> 01:41:08.050
military for me. Um, because I was in Coronado and as the obstacle buds,

1884
01:41:08.051 --> 01:41:09.940
I saw so many guys, they couldn't let it go.

1885
01:41:09.941 --> 01:41:11.920
And obviously it's a huge part of who I am. It's in my,

1886
01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.220
my novels and all that stuff. It's a huge part of me. Um,

1887
01:41:15.250 --> 01:41:17.470
but I saw guys that kept coming back to buttocks,

1888
01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:19.150
kept calling me as the opposite. Hey, can I get a tour?

1889
01:41:19.151 --> 01:41:21.670
I want to show somebody around, hey, no problem. Come on in. And you know,

1890
01:41:21.850 --> 01:41:26.110
I call them out it, um, but I saw these, couldn't let it go. Um,

1891
01:41:26.140 --> 01:41:29.080
going to all the charity events, uh, going to the same bars,

1892
01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.140
going into the same grocery stores, especially in Cornetto. Um,

1893
01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.640
so I think for me it was healthy to say that was one chapter of my life.

1894
01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.310
Obviously a huge influence on me. I wanted to do it my whole life, but now,

1895
01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.240
now we're moving forward and now there's a new chapter and that's as an author

1896
01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:47.560
and that's taking care of my family and raising our kids to be good citizens and

1897
01:41:47.561 --> 01:41:50.280
good people. And that's what I'm going to do next.

1898
01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:53.080
And I think it just helped to not run into somebody at the grocery store from a

1899
01:41:53.081 --> 01:41:56.770
platoon and say, oh, what are you doing? Oh, who's your CEO? What's a, you know,

1900
01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:00.280
an all those sorts of same questions. Um, that just keeps that tie.

1901
01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:02.710
So being able to say goodbye to San Diego and he was saying,

1902
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:05.200
he goes great to us, love San Diego, love Coronado,

1903
01:42:05.380 --> 01:42:06.610
but that was one part of our life.

1904
01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:09.490
And our new life is in the mountains raising our kids in a ski town.

1905
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:14.950
And you're super stoked or no? Yeah, love it over there. Loaded up there.

1906
01:42:14.951 --> 01:42:16.780
And we got there, we drove, you know,

1907
01:42:16.781 --> 01:42:19.720
we'd put at the u hall and we drove through the night and all that.

1908
01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:23.230
And we'd get there 13 hours later cause you're chugging along with this you all

1909
01:42:23.231 --> 01:42:27.100
and we get to unload it and the next day we go to the grocery store and we look

1910
01:42:27.101 --> 01:42:30.580
around and we're like, man, people in Park city are in good shape.

1911
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.980
Like we thought we were in pretty good shape in San Diego.

1912
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:35.350
Like these people are insane in park city.

1913
01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:38.680
It just draws these people that want to raise their kids in ski towns.

1914
01:42:38.681 --> 01:42:41.400
Usually they've done something somewhere else where they, you know,

1915
01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:46.460
hit their nose, whatever they, they can live there and they're really in to, uh,

1916
01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:51.040
being in shape and, uh, being, you know, the best people physically,

1917
01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:53.590
mentally, spiritually, whatever, just being the best,

1918
01:42:53.591 --> 01:42:55.000
most efficient people they can be.

1919
01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:58.720
And Luckily had some friends up there already and this insane group of guys that

1920
01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:02.620
works out in the morning, we wake up at five and uh, once again, that pendulum,

1921
01:43:02.621 --> 01:43:06.100
this last few months has been on the writing. But when I first got there,

1922
01:43:06.130 --> 01:43:08.890
I start working out with these guys that I knew from before. Um,

1923
01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:11.120
and a hope you darling is kind of the lead of that.

1924
01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:15.590
It used to be the CEO of Skullcandy and a new CEO, a g or a, he, uh,

1925
01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.600
has a bunch of other ventures,

1926
01:43:16.601 --> 01:43:21.601
but this guy is in insane shape and he's there every morning at five 30 with

1927
01:43:22.001 --> 01:43:23.230
some crazy workout,

1928
01:43:23.231 --> 01:43:26.910
like picture your hardest crossfit workout and then times it by three or four

1929
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:30.540
had some trail running it. It's crazy. And, uh,

1930
01:43:30.541 --> 01:43:32.890
so I showed up with these guys and uh, they're awesome,

1931
01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:35.470
but they're all about just human potential,

1932
01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:38.680
I think is the best way to put it and maximizing that potential,

1933
01:43:39.250 --> 01:43:42.310
whether it's your family, whether it's in business, personally, whatever,

1934
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:43.870
just uh, and,

1935
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:47.590
and staying up to date on the latest and the greatest and testing things out.

1936
01:43:47.591 --> 01:43:49.720
And they're, uh, an amazing group of people.

1937
01:43:49.721 --> 01:43:52.640
So I'm very fortunate to get to work out and spend time with them.

1938
01:43:52.641 --> 01:43:55.400
Cause all high performers, we all push each other. Um,

1939
01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:57.170
and even though I'm not the, not the fastest anymore,

1940
01:43:57.171 --> 01:43:59.960
certainly not the strongest, especially with this crew, it's, uh,

1941
01:43:59.961 --> 01:44:04.010
it's cool to get out there and uh, and then just be, you know, just be together.

1942
01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:08.780
That little team. Awesome. Well, I mean it looks like we're at a pretty good,

1943
01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:12.410
that's, that gets us to today. You know, where you're at.

1944
01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:15.830
Probably a good place to wrap the books.

1945
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:17.450
Tell us just a little bit about the books.

1946
01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:20.360
What do we need to know about book one book two? Yeah.

1947
01:44:20.361 --> 01:44:23.150
So the first one is the terminal list, which uh,

1948
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:25.250
I didn't say it out loud for about,

1949
01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:28.040
for the first year I was working on it and then I said it out loud for the first

1950
01:44:28.041 --> 01:44:30.710
time and there's two ELLs next to each other. And I said it for the first time.

1951
01:44:30.711 --> 01:44:35.600
I was like, Dang it. Like it's a tough one to say that terminal list. Um,

1952
01:44:35.810 --> 01:44:39.530
but a, at it's base level, it is a story of revenge without constraint.

1953
01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:41.960
And that's what I wanted to explore. And I think it was,

1954
01:44:41.961 --> 01:44:45.740
I adored a team five ops 1997.

1955
01:44:45.741 --> 01:44:49.200
I saw there yet someone xeroxed copied a,

1956
01:44:49.201 --> 01:44:52.160
a thing from the brand new internet that, uh,

1957
01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:57.370
had a picture of a Samurai on it and it said something about a Samurai going

1958
01:44:57.381 --> 01:45:00.260
into battle thinking they were already dead. And, you know,

1959
01:45:00.261 --> 01:45:03.350
I went back and looked at all my old bus shooto books from high school and

1960
01:45:03.351 --> 01:45:05.960
college. And, uh, I thought, Oh wow,

1961
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:08.570
maybe they did that because they thought it made them more effective and

1962
01:45:08.571 --> 01:45:12.560
efficient lawyers. Uh, they're going into battle already dead. And I thought,

1963
01:45:12.561 --> 01:45:14.000
how do you do that with a modern lawyer?

1964
01:45:14.001 --> 01:45:16.820
How do you do that with someone that has a background similar to mine?

1965
01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:20.660
So I can explore these feelings and emotions behind different experiences that I

1966
01:45:20.661 --> 01:45:23.570
had down range in a completely fictional sense. Um,

1967
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:24.980
but how do I make him already dead?

1968
01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:28.880
And then I thought about the church hearings in the late seventies and how the,

1969
01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:31.550
uh, the government had tested certain drugs on our nation,

1970
01:45:31.551 --> 01:45:36.110
soldiers on a mental patient, mental mental institutions, uh, college students,

1971
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:39.120
um, without a, any review, when,

1972
01:45:39.230 --> 01:45:42.170
any sort of structure in place with how that's gonna go down.

1973
01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:44.780
And things changed after that. And I thought, well,

1974
01:45:44.781 --> 01:45:46.130
what if somebody didn't get that memo?

1975
01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.470
What if there was something they wanted to test out?

1976
01:45:48.471 --> 01:45:51.890
They wanted to test it out on some of our nation's most elite soldiers and then

1977
01:45:51.891 --> 01:45:53.600
something goes wrong. Um,

1978
01:45:53.630 --> 01:45:58.630
so how do I free this guy up to think he's already dead and come back and have

1979
01:45:58.671 --> 01:46:01.670
to use the, um, tactics,

1980
01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:04.340
techniques and procedures of the enemy on home soil?

1981
01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:06.860
So essentially I wanted someone that thought they were already dead,

1982
01:46:07.130 --> 01:46:11.660
that now gets to bring what was so effective against us in Iraq and Afghanistan

1983
01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:14.390
to home soil as he works his way up a list,

1984
01:46:14.391 --> 01:46:17.990
putting the bad guys in the ground one by one. Um, so that's,

1985
01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.460
that's really what that first one's about.

1986
01:46:19.461 --> 01:46:23.170
And then if you dig a little deeper into it, more, uh,

1987
01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:27.020
like psychological wise, I guess it's, uh,

1988
01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:30.860
about a veteran that comes home and brings the war from Iraq and Afghanistan

1989
01:46:30.861 --> 01:46:35.150
home to people that have been sending young men and women to their deaths for

1990
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:39.140
clothes. Well, coming up on 20 years now, pretty soon. So, uh,

1991
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:43.320
you can read it like that too, but that's, that's deep. That's deep. Uh,

1992
01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:47.510
where'd you pick up with true believer? So it's a continuation of the story.

1993
01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:49.290
So in high school I saw it's a,

1994
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:53.910
it was on PBS and it was a special with bill Moyers and he had an interview with

1995
01:46:53.911 --> 01:46:57.120
a guy named Joseph Campbell who wrote a book called the power of myth and the

1996
01:46:57.121 --> 01:46:58.530
hero with a thousand faces.

1997
01:46:59.010 --> 01:47:02.430
And I was fascinated by it because why are you wanted to write one day?

1998
01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:05.730
And I remember they talked about George Lucas being influenced by this for star

1999
01:47:05.731 --> 01:47:08.640
wars and uh, kind of the Samurai aspect of different things.

2000
01:47:08.641 --> 01:47:12.870
And then how across culture, the hero's journey is similar,

2001
01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:15.900
very similar for the cultures that had never touched each other before.

2002
01:47:16.090 --> 01:47:19.830
You know, China, native American, Indian, Africa, northern Europe,

2003
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:21.510
they all had this similar journey.

2004
01:47:21.630 --> 01:47:25.950
And usually it's a reluctant hero that goes on a journey, emerges,

2005
01:47:25.951 --> 01:47:30.420
transformed at the end of that journey. Um, so that was a big influence. So,

2006
01:47:30.650 --> 01:47:34.000
and writing these you have go Mikey, in the dragons on it.

2007
01:47:34.890 --> 01:47:38.100
I was just reading that to my kid the other night. And uh, yeah, so he,

2008
01:47:38.101 --> 01:47:41.640
so he has to go, you got to go into the cave and you have to emerge transformed.

2009
01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:45.240
But how do you do that with one book and how do you make that overarching a

2010
01:47:45.241 --> 01:47:48.030
series as well? So there's two things I think about as I'm writing.

2011
01:47:48.031 --> 01:47:52.380
I think about that hero's journey in the context of one singular story and then

2012
01:47:52.410 --> 01:47:56.070
over what I hope will be a longterm series. So that's what I'm,

2013
01:47:56.130 --> 01:47:58.860
what I'm thinking about as I write these things. And then true believers,

2014
01:47:58.861 --> 01:48:01.200
the continuation of that story. But it's a,

2015
01:48:01.201 --> 01:48:05.940
I was inspired by somebody I met in Iraq in 2006 and I thought,

2016
01:48:05.941 --> 01:48:07.580
what have I made this interaction and what I,

2017
01:48:07.770 --> 01:48:09.210
when I heard through the grapevine later,

2018
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:11.460
what if I made this a lot more interesting and fictionalized it?

2019
01:48:11.860 --> 01:48:12.930
And so that's where the,

2020
01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.670
the second one picks up and it's really a story of redemption and taking the,

2021
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:21.510
was still taking the emotions and the feelings behind certain things that

2022
01:48:21.511 --> 01:48:22.630
happened down range. Uh,

2023
01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:26.790
but also now exploring what that transition was like because the hero you're in

2024
01:48:26.791 --> 01:48:30.960
the story, James Reece has to go through a transformative journey. And uh,

2025
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:32.370
the second one's all about redemption

2026
01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:37.280
<v 3>and when is, when does book two wins? True believer come out July 30th,</v>

2027
01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:41.000
July 30th, that comes out. Internal list is out right now

2028
01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.093
<v 4>is out. Yeah.</v>

2029
01:48:42.110 --> 01:48:44.940
The second one should have come out April 2nd but the Department of Defense took

2030
01:48:44.941 --> 01:48:46.920
seven months to do a 30 day review.

2031
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:51.120
A sort of make sure I was honoring my former security clearances by submitting

2032
01:48:51.121 --> 01:48:52.050
it to the deployment.

2033
01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:55.320
<v 3>You just leave the stuff that they tell you to take out or the stuff that they</v>

2034
01:48:55.321 --> 01:48:58.490
tell you to react. You just, you just black it out, black it out.

2035
01:48:58.710 --> 01:49:02.730
I didn't know if I ride around it and I still kind of funny as you did that and

2036
01:49:02.731 --> 01:49:05.190
true in the terminal list to you when you send it to me, I,

2037
01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:08.760
you gave me a heads up, he said, Hey I just blacked things out. And you know,

2038
01:49:08.761 --> 01:49:10.710
obviously my books had been, well not my kids' books,

2039
01:49:10.711 --> 01:49:12.940
but my other books had been through the Pentagon review and they tell you that

2040
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:15.780
could remove certain things and we would remove it and change it.

2041
01:49:15.781 --> 01:49:17.610
So it's acceptable to them.

2042
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:20.010
But you just blacked it out straight out of blacked out.

2043
01:49:20.011 --> 01:49:22.950
Yeah cause I was worried like what if I write around this and then I publish it

2044
01:49:22.951 --> 01:49:26.880
and then come back and say, well you didn't quite why right around that enough.

2045
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:28.860
Did you do that just to be cool? Kind of.

2046
01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:33.960
And it also has little authenticity helps with the marketing. And it's like,

2047
01:49:33.961 --> 01:49:36.400
I mean I was, I was looking through it and I'm looking at like what is,

2048
01:49:36.450 --> 01:49:39.010
and I can, I can figure out a lot of them. I go, oh they, they,

2049
01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.040
they didn't want them to say that. Oh, they didn't want him to say that.

2050
01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:43.050
So it's pretty cool. But you can still,

2051
01:49:43.051 --> 01:49:45.270
I mean obviously you can still understand all the context around it.

2052
01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:50.540
You just don't know a certain like specific term or a certain specific location

2053
01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:55.420
or a certain specific name. But yeah, that's pretty, that's pretty cool.

2054
01:49:55.690 --> 01:49:59.130
Pretty cool that you left it in there and the books are available everywhere.

2055
01:49:59.190 --> 01:50:01.570
Everywhere, everywhere. You're audio people love the audio.

2056
01:50:01.571 --> 01:50:03.160
Ray Porter does the audio. He's an awesome dude.

2057
01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:04.930
He's up for audio book of the year this year.

2058
01:50:04.930 --> 01:50:06.220
So we were in New York and it's up there.

2059
01:50:06.221 --> 01:50:09.300
Well I texted you cause you're bucketing, you know you're in your,

2060
01:50:09.301 --> 01:50:11.500
in your s your category. So I was texting you,

2061
01:50:11.501 --> 01:50:14.660
I took a picture of the screen and everything. It was cool seeing it up there.

2062
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:18.370
That's a Stephen King. I was like Dang, it's pretty cool. That was pretty cool.

2063
01:50:19.050 --> 01:50:22.660
Uh, you to find you, um,

2064
01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:27.760
you got your website, which is official Jack car.com.

2065
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:31.570
That's it. Because you didn't buy the URL Jack Carr early thing,

2066
01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:36.600
an insurance guy has it in some guys holding it for hostage and your damn,

2067
01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.200
we're going to get it out. Well maybe you will never say never. So that's a,

2068
01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:42.034
yeah, that's a,

2069
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:45.700
and that's one that people want to geek out a little more on the weapons,

2070
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:47.620
the knives, that sorta thing. Um,

2071
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:51.580
the website goes deep dives into a lot more of that stuff in the books cause you

2072
01:50:51.581 --> 01:50:55.750
get your nerd on. Yeah. You get your weapons nerd on, you're like,

2073
01:50:55.751 --> 01:50:59.500
you bring the librarian of your mom to the,

2074
01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:04.420
to the Damn Jack car weapons scene. That's it.

2075
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:08.860
That's it. So it's on there. And, and uh, then on the socials,

2076
01:51:08.890 --> 01:51:12.970
which I am very new to, I'm about a year and half into this now it's a Jack car,

2077
01:51:12.971 --> 01:51:16.510
USA beyond the socials and there is a Facebook, but uh,

2078
01:51:16.570 --> 01:51:18.340
three was just too much like,

2079
01:51:18.341 --> 01:51:21.880
so somebody else just copies and paste things further into their,

2080
01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.770
but a on Instagram and Twitter,

2081
01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:26.770
Jaguar USA and there's the ones that I interact with the interacting in the

2082
01:51:26.771 --> 01:51:29.650
game. That's it. I'm in on those, but three years just to daunting,

2083
01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:33.880
just kind of, nope, nope. Prioritize all three.

2084
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:37.510
The next level. I'm crazy like that.

2085
01:51:37.511 --> 01:51:42.511
That's how it's super motivated down on three social media platforms kill me

2086
01:51:43.151 --> 01:51:45.250
now. What, you know, usually I have a,

2087
01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:47.530
every now and again I have a hard time going to sleep in front of my mind's

2088
01:51:47.531 --> 01:51:49.840
racing. I'm thinking about all these things, thinking about storyline,

2089
01:51:49.841 --> 01:51:52.780
solving problems on the written page here aggressively like I used to do on the

2090
01:51:52.781 --> 01:51:54.040
battlefield. Um,

2091
01:51:54.190 --> 01:51:58.690
but usually I don't have a problem staying asleep once I get there this morning

2092
01:51:58.750 --> 01:52:03.610
up 3:07 AM and I'm like Dang. And I took a picture of it for you cause I'm like,

2093
01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:07.410
should you post it, you know, no do day to day. So I didn't, you know,

2094
01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:11.560
think that way. So I uh, I kept my d day post on point,

2095
01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:16.120
but I will, I will post it. DJ. Awesome. Yeah.

2096
01:52:16.121 --> 01:52:18.810
So I think that's a good place to wrap it. You know,

2097
01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:25.450
Echo Jack was just talking about fitness. He's talking about being prepared,

2098
01:52:27.130 --> 01:52:31.690
opened up, talking about being a true believer. That knows the cause. Yeah.

2099
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:36.670
What do you know about, you know, sort of that cause being on the path,

2100
01:52:36.730 --> 01:52:39.340
believing in it, truly fully.

2101
01:52:39.670 --> 01:52:42.820
Do want to comment on how you blacked out the classified

2102
01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:47.900
parts of your book? Kind of like in the movies, right. When they want to,

2103
01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:51.320
you know, they show movies on HBO or in the Cinema, whatever. It's all good.

2104
01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:57.020
They put it on USA or one of these, you know, networks, they got to edit it.

2105
01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.080
Right. Edited for television. So there's three ways they do it in the movies.

2106
01:53:00.081 --> 01:53:02.330
They either just take out the whole scene,

2107
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:05.780
which is like what they do with books. Right. Sometimes like I guess they could,

2108
01:53:05.781 --> 01:53:10.240
yeah. Usually change it. Yes. We'll do that. Movies too. In the movie version,

2109
01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:14.060
they have a dubbed voiceover for the swearing. Right.

2110
01:53:14.370 --> 01:53:17.420
And every once in a while you have a movie with an actual different scene.

2111
01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:19.720
Like if you watch trading places or something on you,

2112
01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:22.700
they have actual different scenes like that they redid. Sure.

2113
01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:25.820
Then the third is the blackout version and what you did,

2114
01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:29.180
which they just blanket out. So if they're swearing, he'll be like, what?

2115
01:53:29.181 --> 01:53:32.460
The and the mouth will show it, but they just won't have the audio. Right.

2116
01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:35.690
To me that's the best way to do it because it keeps you in the story.

2117
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:37.670
You're like, okay he swore right there. I get it.

2118
01:53:37.671 --> 01:53:40.400
You can't swear on t on this network or whatever.

2119
01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:45.740
But in my opinion this, the blackout, the physical, like I just saw it in there.

2120
01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:50.860
It's physically blacked out. Anti highlighted, low lighted. Yep. Few of them.

2121
01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:53.070
It gives it the mystique. Yeah.

2122
01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:56.840
Of like there's something hidden under here that's classified that you can't

2123
01:53:56.841 --> 01:54:01.310
know about. So classified you can't know about. You can't even know about it.

2124
01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:06.380
Yeah. Even even that it's fiction, which is even a level up like half level up.

2125
01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:07.243
Even from

2126
01:54:08.370 --> 01:54:11.780
there redacting fiction that me

2127
01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:16.310
[inaudible] when he said like secret,

2128
01:54:16.311 --> 01:54:20.960
cause you and I both know what gets redacted. Ridiculous. It's not really,

2129
01:54:20.961 --> 01:54:23.030
not that I don't want to build it up too much.

2130
01:54:23.031 --> 01:54:26.150
So when we talk about [inaudible] we'll edit this out.

2131
01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:31.340
It's so top my plans for the first one I didn't, I didn't appeal.

2132
01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:33.710
So you got a year to appeal these things. And uh,

2133
01:54:33.711 --> 01:54:36.560
I didn't do it in the first one because I didn't have any enough money. Um,

2134
01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:39.230
so second one though, they just got a lot more in this second one.

2135
01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:42.830
And I'm appealing this one. So,

2136
01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:46.610
and what you do for the appeal is you find the information on government

2137
01:54:46.611 --> 01:54:48.410
websites. You can't just go to Wikipedia or whatever else,

2138
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:52.280
but on actual government websites, in congressional testimony,

2139
01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:55.820
I'm out there via the government. Um,

2140
01:54:55.910 --> 01:55:00.230
so we're appealing this one and almost everything in there except for one little

2141
01:55:00.231 --> 01:55:03.630
phrase. Um, we found it on government website, so,

2142
01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:06.390
so we're appealing so that if the paperback comes out in this,

2143
01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:09.710
now you can see what the government didn't want you to see. But it's,

2144
01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:12.110
I don't want to build it up too much because it's really,

2145
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:15.050
it's not as cool as it sounds, smells.

2146
01:55:16.290 --> 01:55:18.980
But one thing that they took out was so surprising as I made up.

2147
01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:22.520
So I made up a location because I been there. Yeah.

2148
01:55:22.670 --> 01:55:24.110
Before I came into the one in the military.

2149
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:27.320
So I used it as location in the novel because it made sense where it started.

2150
01:55:27.321 --> 01:55:30.450
Second one is kind of starts in Africa and then it goes up here and you know,

2151
01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:33.140
it goes into whatever. But I'm like, God,

2152
01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:36.350
that'd be a good place for Kinda the cave. You gotta go there and change,

2153
01:55:36.351 --> 01:55:39.440
got to transform. And uh, so I just made it up cause I'd been there.

2154
01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:41.180
I can describe the rocks, I could describe the mountains,

2155
01:55:41.181 --> 01:55:43.010
I can describe the architecture. So I put it in there.

2156
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:46.800
They blacked it all out and it's, I totally made up. They blacked it all out,

2157
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:51.450
but they left in by accident, the, um, uh,

2158
01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:56.010
the capital of that country. So I blacked it out for them, knowing the intent,

2159
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:59.340
knowing their intent. I took it out for them, but they missed that.

2160
01:55:59.341 --> 01:56:02.250
They took out the type of architecture they took out the mountains,

2161
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:05.220
they took out any reference to the country, which is so strange.

2162
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:10.230
But they left in by accident, the capital [inaudible] right. Yeah, exactly.

2163
01:56:10.231 --> 01:56:14.490
What else was up in that cave? You know,

2164
01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:19.410
exactly to this stranger than fiction. But that's good.

2165
01:56:19.411 --> 01:56:22.620
That's another selling point in a way. When you can say this,

2166
01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:25.570
like I'm revealing in this book what the government didn't want you to see.

2167
01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:30.030
Yeah, actually. Yep, exactly. So the paper bag. Yup. Yeah.

2168
01:56:30.031 --> 01:56:34.290
We'll see how it goes. Cool man. Well, one day, what did you revisit?

2169
01:56:34.291 --> 01:56:37.830
You did through it. What are you doing these harder to take heavies right now.

2170
01:56:37.831 --> 01:56:42.100
I know, I know. So I dabbled through the years. Um, but uh,

2171
01:56:42.210 --> 01:56:44.550
essentially what I did up until 95.

2172
01:56:44.551 --> 01:56:48.920
That's really my base and I got up like obviously I shoot a lot and obviously so

2173
01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:51.650
shoot all the time, stay in shape, that sort of thing. But uh,

2174
01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:54.120
the Jujitsu is wherever I am right now.

2175
01:56:54.121 --> 01:56:58.520
That is where my march old ground fighting skills are going to remain. Um,

2176
01:56:58.770 --> 01:57:00.360
we are, wait, why are you committing to that? Right?

2177
01:57:01.950 --> 01:57:03.930
The spine surgery to uh,

2178
01:57:03.931 --> 01:57:07.620
to just time wise and knowing where my focus needs to be right now.

2179
01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:10.350
What do you think, what do you think is worse for your spine?

2180
01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:15.000
Clean and jerks or grappling. Clean and jerks.

2181
01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:17.430
I'm going to have to agree like I'm not, I love cleaners. I don't,

2182
01:57:17.431 --> 01:57:19.140
I don't actually think cleaner drugs are bad for your spine.

2183
01:57:19.141 --> 01:57:22.960
I think they're good for your spine. But grappling, that's the,

2184
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:27.690
this is the delve into how you get your information for your little books,

2185
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:31.680
right? Oh yeah. You sent me a text or whatever, like two years ago. Hey,

2186
01:57:31.710 --> 01:57:36.710
if a guy was in Virginia wanting to train with like the best on the east coast,

2187
01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:40.500
where would he go and train you help you send me that text.

2188
01:57:40.501 --> 01:57:44.310
I'm like send them to hens. Oh, grace shared it. He got right back to me.

2189
01:57:44.311 --> 01:57:46.830
I appreciate it. Went right in the book.

2190
01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:51.270
That's these guys used research you've ever done. I was great. Jocko. Perfect.

2191
01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:53.660
And it made it right in the book and then I moved on. Right.

2192
01:57:53.730 --> 01:57:56.910
I feel bad when people text me and I don't text them back like right away.

2193
01:57:57.540 --> 01:58:01.430
Oh really? You must feel real bad with me then do the whole right away.

2194
01:58:02.090 --> 01:58:02.923
Real form.

2195
01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:06.870
But sometimes it just doesn't get a lot of texts and like you got to sit there

2196
01:58:06.871 --> 01:58:07.740
and you know,

2197
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:11.430
but I try and text people back eventually or he might need to hit me with a

2198
01:58:11.431 --> 01:58:16.080
little follow mud or you'll follow up. Yeah man. Well, hey,

2199
01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:17.100
um,

2200
01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:21.450
well doing Jujitsu and peeking at 95 staying there is better than not picking

2201
01:58:21.451 --> 01:58:22.890
you. Just doing that. People at all.

2202
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:26.550
The kids were in it right away and daughter and it, uh,

2203
01:58:26.610 --> 01:58:29.880
from maybe age four. Oh, just saying the game right now.

2204
01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:34.650
[inaudible] and so now that we're in what we need to talk. Yeah.

2205
01:58:34.651 --> 01:58:39.240
So she's a into snowboarding now and tennis, so she turned 13.

2206
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:43.180
That's cool. Everything but I think age 11 or maybe 2011,

2207
01:58:43.181 --> 01:58:48.010
I think you might've stopped. Uh, she kind of, yeah, it's tough. That was tough.

2208
01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:50.710
The game. Is there a Jujitsu in park city?

2209
01:58:50.711 --> 01:58:54.400
I know there's full on Jujitsu in Utah. You got Pedro Sauer up there.

2210
01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:57.340
You got all kinds of good. Did you two people up in Salt Lake City? Yeah,

2211
01:58:57.341 --> 01:59:01.270
for sure. Yep. No, we sure do. And there's one, I think Pedro Sauer has,

2212
01:59:01.271 --> 01:59:05.000
I think a and a little offsite in park city neighborhood lead. So, uh,

2213
01:59:05.010 --> 01:59:07.720
of course we checked it out before the move. Uh, they moved San,

2214
01:59:07.721 --> 01:59:10.870
so I haven't followed where they moved to, but I think there's one still there.

2215
01:59:11.590 --> 01:59:13.810
Um, but cause it was important to me because at the time we moved,

2216
01:59:13.811 --> 01:59:16.070
my daughter was still in it and our little guy was in it. Uh,

2217
01:59:16.170 --> 01:59:18.400
our eight year old who's now at year old. Um,

2218
01:59:18.610 --> 01:59:22.320
so it was important to me that there was Jujitsu where we were moving and uh,

2219
01:59:22.330 --> 01:59:24.220
but now that we moved out, we get there and it's gone.

2220
01:59:24.250 --> 01:59:26.920
It's just like an empty space. So I think it's still there somewhere.

2221
01:59:26.921 --> 01:59:28.870
But the kids, you know, they're doing their, their things.

2222
01:59:28.871 --> 01:59:33.740
Unfortunately the scheme, there's a lot to do, a lot to do up there. But uh,

2223
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:34.780
we know I dabbled over the,

2224
01:59:34.781 --> 01:59:36.670
over the years we're still doing it while I was in a knob. So,

2225
01:59:36.671 --> 01:59:40.630
or an XL is way before I got out, um, in Coronado cause it was right there.

2226
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:44.770
I'd go at lunch and roll with some guys, some research where we can get you,

2227
01:59:44.890 --> 01:59:48.970
get you and your family back in the game up and up in park city. Cause I,

2228
01:59:49.290 --> 01:59:53.890
I personally feel like guilty to have your family not training to have you not

2229
01:59:53.891 --> 01:59:56.410
training and me doing a little bit that squared away.

2230
01:59:56.530 --> 01:59:59.160
I know you're taking some extreme ownership, right. Their car,

2231
01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:00.810
you're taking some extreme ownership of that.

2232
02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:05.380
Reese needs to be getting in the game and the stories to be fictionalized. Yeah.

2233
02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:09.310
James Reese is on it. He's training his digits too. But you got to get,

2234
02:00:09.311 --> 02:00:13.060
you know, you talk about transferring those emotions, right? Real world.

2235
02:00:13.090 --> 02:00:13.690
I remember. How,

2236
02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:16.870
do you remember what it feels like to get just thrown around the mat?

2237
02:00:17.170 --> 02:00:19.660
The floor wiped, you know? Yeah. I was worried.

2238
02:00:19.661 --> 02:00:21.250
That's why I didn't tell you I was coming in last night.

2239
02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:23.800
I noticed I didn't get that. I didn't,

2240
02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:27.550
I was worried that I'd be up at three something getting just destroyed on the

2241
02:00:27.850 --> 02:00:31.250
mat. He just, yeah, he is out. So, you know, either way,

2242
02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:36.320
if that need is rapidly approaching yet and it's been rapidly hot for a long

2243
02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:40.390
status, all good. And we're gonna look forward to that.

2244
02:00:40.570 --> 02:00:43.270
So back to you just do, when you get back in,

2245
02:00:43.271 --> 02:00:46.750
did you see you're gonna need a gate or if you're getting in to just do for the

2246
02:00:46.751 --> 02:00:49.540
first time, you're gonna need a g d g Nogi do both.

2247
02:00:49.570 --> 02:00:53.500
That's the best 100% of the way. If you're at Park City, Utah,

2248
02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:55.210
if you get no fighting park city, Utah,

2249
02:00:55.270 --> 02:01:00.270
the other person is almost guaranteed to be wearing a geek type out right now.

2250
02:01:01.250 --> 02:01:04.770
Let's do home straight up wearing a jacket. Good point. You started weight,

2251
02:01:05.050 --> 02:01:08.770
always caught up wearing a north face Parka, right?

2252
02:01:09.070 --> 02:01:11.020
Just Patagonia. Boom.

2253
02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:15.310
It's very possible that going to pell on a Patagonia jacket. Yeah.

2254
02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:20.200
Let's get some of that sleep. What's the Patagonia jacket? It's just the jacket.

2255
02:01:20.201 --> 02:01:21.670
It's like a Parka. This is another,

2256
02:01:21.730 --> 02:01:25.150
I had explained to me what a Parker was on one podcast. Wow. He's from Hawaii.

2257
02:01:25.210 --> 02:01:29.740
Wow. I don't know. I never heard of that, but nonetheless. Sounds Nice.

2258
02:01:29.770 --> 02:01:34.120
Sounds good. Uh, similar to a g top. Good. All right. We're going to do g,

2259
02:01:34.121 --> 02:01:36.100
what kind of gear we're going to get? Do you know?

2260
02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:40.040
I know origin origin only 100%. There's only

2261
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:43.010
<v 0>one that's one in the world. Why would you not get the best one in the world?</v>

2262
02:01:43.270 --> 02:01:45.410
There's no reason percent get the best one in the world.

2263
02:01:46.150 --> 02:01:50.180
Cause the best one costs five times more than the not best one. No.

2264
02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:54.590
Or is it all kids the same? Nope. Same. Same cost. While you can choose,

2265
02:01:54.591 --> 02:01:57.890
you can grab the, the big deadlocks. A, what do you call,

2266
02:01:57.891 --> 02:02:02.090
what's the word you always do? Use. Not always, but luxurious.

2267
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:05.960
Luxurious. Last. You can grab down if you want. Good. Good. Up to you.

2268
02:02:05.961 --> 02:02:08.090
Origin keys and various, uh,

2269
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:12.560
what do you call like options of keys all made in America though, by the way.

2270
02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:16.340
Speaking of made in America, you get other clothes made in America,

2271
02:02:17.210 --> 02:02:22.070
namely t-shirts. Yeah, sure. But also sweatshirts. Yeah.

2272
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:25.250
And also newest latest jeans,

2273
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:31.190
which I have some on the way, by the way, I'll finally be little. We teamed up,

2274
02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:34.000
we teamed up. We're going to blank.

2275
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:38.630
We're in a secondary group me and be little Brian Little field. Um,

2276
02:02:38.690 --> 02:02:42.050
and you know, we're, we're tight, we're in the game, whatever. Right?

2277
02:02:42.051 --> 02:02:45.230
But we're always last to get the cool new stuff. Jocko always first,

2278
02:02:45.231 --> 02:02:48.470
Pete always first, right? US always, we're not even second,

2279
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:50.510
we're not even third. We're last every time.

2280
02:02:50.700 --> 02:02:54.440
And then the last we banded together and now I have a pair of origin jeans made

2281
02:02:54.441 --> 02:02:56.930
in America. American denim jeans on the way to me.

2282
02:02:56.990 --> 02:03:01.940
So please happy to announce Allen to everyone. Also rash guards,

2283
02:03:01.941 --> 02:03:03.710
of course, other Jujitsu stuff as well.

2284
02:03:03.711 --> 02:03:08.000
Also supplements the most important kinds of supplements.

2285
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:11.150
Boom joints keep you in the game. Protein keep you in the game.

2286
02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:15.850
The white tea is Jocko white tea. A supplement? Yes. Yeah,

2287
02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:19.990
because it has to be a supplement because what else would give you an 8,000

2288
02:03:20.290 --> 02:03:22.780
pounds? I look at your app. You're absolutely right. Nothing.

2289
02:03:23.130 --> 02:03:26.180
And it's certified organic. So the whole water thing? Nope.

2290
02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:27.680
How'd you like your first Jocko white tea.

2291
02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:32.240
I couldn't do the podcast without having one sales people. Some people don't.

2292
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:37.040
It's not sweet, you know, there's no sugar in there. Nope. It's just tea.

2293
02:03:37.370 --> 02:03:38.660
It's great, but it tastes,

2294
02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:43.010
but it has the pomegranate little fruitiness to it that keeps you wanting more.

2295
02:03:45.060 --> 02:03:47.780
I'm a big fan. Big Fan of have to, you know,

2296
02:03:47.781 --> 02:03:51.350
you should get some of those deadlift and then go right. Cause whenever I,

2297
02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:53.930
whenever I write, that's guaranteed. Right. That's guaranteed.

2298
02:03:53.931 --> 02:03:58.080
Like at least 300 words come and are coming at you live, oozy, smooth,

2299
02:03:58.550 --> 02:04:01.910
run it off your finger until I get into the computer,

2300
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:06.080
my marching orders also discipline by the way, speaking of writing.

2301
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:07.400
Oh that's a good one.

2302
02:04:07.610 --> 02:04:11.510
I found and I don't write as much is you?

2303
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:13.520
You might not have known that, but you know,

2304
02:04:13.610 --> 02:04:16.660
but I make these videos every once in a while if you're on the disciplines or

2305
02:04:16.890 --> 02:04:20.510
even that kind of comes a lot easier when you're doing.

2306
02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:25.650
And so stay up everyone. We lie to ourselves. Yeah,

2307
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:28.070
that is a good one. That is a good one. Yeah.

2308
02:04:28.190 --> 02:04:31.820
Accurate representation of yourself can't grow otherwise. It's true.

2309
02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:34.970
It's absolutely true. But yeah, discipline, that's a good on and discipline go.

2310
02:04:35.450 --> 02:04:38.400
If you don't want to, don't mix it up and do all that stuff.

2311
02:04:38.401 --> 02:04:40.500
If you're on the go essentially. Right. That's,

2312
02:04:40.650 --> 02:04:44.940
that's where it goes in the last makes sense. And then you just go,

2313
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:49.750
you get milk, which is additional protein. Yeah.

2314
02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:53.040
For your life because we all know we're eating steak. Yes. Reading chicken.

2315
02:04:53.041 --> 02:04:57.220
Some people are eating Sushi. Yes sir. We are a lot of Sushi.

2316
02:04:57.300 --> 02:04:58.620
That all gives you protein, which is good.

2317
02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:01.050
Sometimes you need a little bit more or sometimes you just want it.

2318
02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:05.670
So dessert is there straight up. Have you tried the,

2319
02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:10.140
I have not yet. So looking forward to it though. Just just, it's ridiculous.

2320
02:05:10.170 --> 02:05:14.070
You ever had a Nestle strawberry quick? Yes. It's been a long time.

2321
02:05:14.610 --> 02:05:18.150
Did you like it? I always, yes. I like the chocolate one. I think that okay.

2322
02:05:18.270 --> 02:05:21.150
You like to try. Some people are like that. I've never tried them both.

2323
02:05:21.151 --> 02:05:22.840
But I go back to the chocolate,

2324
02:05:23.670 --> 02:05:28.200
the strawberry slayer mock tastes absolutely delicious.

2325
02:05:28.201 --> 02:05:30.870
And then we have where your kid milk. So for your kids. Yeah,

2326
02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:34.890
totally good to go. I keep meaning to get that too. Cause our kids, man,

2327
02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:38.760
they do not anyway. Yeah cause your kids want to eat cake.

2328
02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:42.590
They want to drink Nestle's quick cause it's tasty still.

2329
02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:44.700
I don't have to do that. Nope. They can get protein.

2330
02:05:46.570 --> 02:05:50.970
No sugar. You know what's up and it tastes delicious. All right, cool. Cool.

2331
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:56.030
So there's that where your kid mall Malke and then if you want like this shirt

2332
02:05:56.611 --> 02:06:01.560
that echo's wearing this good shirt. The second one go to our store.

2333
02:06:01.590 --> 02:06:05.640
Collectively. Everyone's, this isn't a no cause you keep calling it my store.

2334
02:06:05.641 --> 02:06:09.360
It's not my store. It has your name in it. Yeah. No, but everybody goes there.

2335
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:12.900
It's not just me in the store by myself. You are the store is for everyone.

2336
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:15.330
Right. It's true. It's not your store. It's not my story.

2337
02:06:15.331 --> 02:06:19.530
It's our store collectively as a group. The Jack Carr Story. Yeah, absolutely.

2338
02:06:20.730 --> 02:06:22.920
Yeah. So that

2339
02:06:24.450 --> 02:06:26.970
is@jockostore.com if you want to represent on this path, right?

2340
02:06:27.090 --> 02:06:29.850
Discipline equals freedom. Shit. Good mentality, right.

2341
02:06:29.851 --> 02:06:33.540
Looking for the good in the bad quote unquote bad again, it, you know,

2342
02:06:33.590 --> 02:06:35.860
whatever you want to reference your home. That's where you get your stuff.

2343
02:06:36.090 --> 02:06:39.030
Speaking of which you are talking Jocko white tea,

2344
02:06:39.060 --> 02:06:43.470
I don't know if you saw this Tam, Tom Clancy, a fan that you are.

2345
02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:47.880
Did you see that in the latest Tom Clancy novel, the uh,

2346
02:06:47.970 --> 02:06:52.110
Jack Ryan. You know what he drinks? Oh, I saw this. Yeah.

2347
02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:55.740
I didn't read it but I saw it. Somebody posted a picture and put it out there,

2348
02:06:56.100 --> 02:06:59.640
Jocko. Yep. Jack Ryan's in the game.

2349
02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:03.920
We're wondering what James Reese is going to be drinking in book three.

2350
02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:06.120
You'd have to stand by [inaudible] find out

2351
02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:09.720
[inaudible] it's definitely,

2352
02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:12.850
we know easier to be wearing like the warrior kid in three book. You know what?

2353
02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:18.210
[inaudible] being ward origin. Nice. Yeah. Boom. There you go. So yeah,

2361
02:07:44.110 --> 02:07:46.270
Like you're looking at your computer, you read,

2362
02:07:46.510 --> 02:07:51.120
you read a solid review and you just give that review a little, a little late,

2363
02:07:51.410 --> 02:07:53.560
not little and all that. Not for that thing.

2364
02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:56.980
Like somebody wrote a damn good review the other day and I read it. I was like,

2365
02:07:57.670 --> 02:07:59.650
you know, gave him one of those physical,

2366
02:07:59.890 --> 02:08:04.090
physical movement at my computer until 11 o'clock at night. What am I doing?

2367
02:08:04.091 --> 02:08:05.380
Reading reviews, trying to go to sleep.

2368
02:08:05.500 --> 02:08:07.860
You're talking about how you have no problem going to sleep? Sometimes I do. No,

2369
02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:09.580
I was, I have some trouble going to sleep. Well,

2370
02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:12.640
I have trouble going to sleep that way. It's at a, it's trouble waking up.

2371
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:16.420
Oh yeah. Oh, you have trouble waking up. Yeah, I mean I'd rather sleep in,

2372
02:08:17.060 --> 02:08:20.580
but I do get up. Well that 5:00 AM it comes quick. Yeah.

2373
02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:23.700
And finally I let him down at 3:00 AM like he would finally the guys at five 30

2374
02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:28.080
knock it out home at seven help with the kids then start writing shit. No,

2375
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:29.560
that solid right there. That's fine.

2376
02:08:30.850 --> 02:08:34.860
We'll get some stuff for your crew up there. Get them in the game. Awesome.

2377
02:08:36.380 --> 02:08:38.920
Absolutely. They have a nod. That's like level one.

2378
02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:44.190
I'm like re like what do you call? There's base level respect, right?

2379
02:08:44.230 --> 02:08:47.200
There's extra respect and then there's the ceiling above the ceiling.

2380
02:08:47.201 --> 02:08:51.370
There's level one. Respect when physical head nods for computer. Yeah.

2381
02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:55.890
Level two claps. Claps for you. Seems like you clap for the,

2382
02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:59.550
for the performer. That's different bro. No,

2383
02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:02.850
I would never in a million years clap. I'm like am I? No cause that's fine.

2384
02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:07.150
[inaudible] level two but someone's going to come up with like a review or

2385
02:09:07.151 --> 02:09:10.630
something and it'll warn a clap. That's my contention.

2386
02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:15.220
We had a good one that I know yesterday. [inaudible] your computer.

2387
02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:20.500
Somebody wrote a Jack Carr has a graduate degree in the art of war.

2388
02:09:20.590 --> 02:09:23.700
Oh liked it? Positive Ed.

2389
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:26.380
Positive head check.

2390
02:09:26.381 --> 02:09:30.310
Look someone else at one rock up that someone else wrote one about if John Wick

2391
02:09:30.311 --> 02:09:33.220
the punisher and somebody else had a child would be James Reese. I'm like, yeah,

2392
02:09:33.810 --> 02:09:38.410
it's going check this out 100%. Yeah, man. So yeah,

2393
02:09:38.411 --> 02:09:40.840
subscribe, man. If you're into it and you want to write a review,

2394
02:09:40.841 --> 02:09:44.680
you do it also, don't forget about where your kid podcasts, which is not dead.

2395
02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:49.730
No, it's, it's, it's been, um, resurrected. Well it's not, it was never danced.

2396
02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:54.790
Resurrected. No. Yeah, it is alive and well, however,

2397
02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:58.150
there hasn't been a lot of new additions lately, but they're coming,

2398
02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:02.230
they're coming. Boom. There you go. So I was mentally going through

2399
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:08.080
possibilities for the next story from Uncle Jake. Right.

2400
02:10:08.590 --> 02:10:12.100
So yeah. So the pendulum was just a way,

2401
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:14.950
pendulums away from warrior kid podcast. Yeah.

2402
02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:20.130
Actually now that book eight is almost wrapped. That's what,

2403
02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:20.651
that's what the,

2404
02:10:20.651 --> 02:10:24.580
that's what the prioritize and execute is on just going gonna say you beat me to

2405
02:10:24.790 --> 02:10:28.390
the waiting to get in there with parents. Yeah, exactly. Yep.

2406
02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:32.050
So that's where it could broadcast. And if you want to support a warrior kid,

2407
02:10:32.770 --> 02:10:36.660
then you can get some Jocko soap, Yemen,

2408
02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:39.680
warrior kid soap from Irish oaks,

2412
02:10:52.420 --> 02:10:57.380
What do they say? I think they think like subscribing. No, wait something,

2413
02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:01.240
some other thing that you're supposed to do. Yes. If you're that. Okay.

2414
02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:04.370
So anyways, youtube channel. Yeah, that's it. Yeah,

and that's where you can get echoes, echos,

2417
02:11:09.650 --> 02:11:14.030
videos that he spends all allegedly so much time making balloons and they come

2418
02:11:14.031 --> 02:11:18.020
out once every, every four years like the Olympics,

2419
02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:21.440
the Winter Olympics in Park city. It's every four years.

2420
02:11:21.441 --> 02:11:25.160
A good video is going to come out. Whatever. Check her likes, some soap, boom.

2421
02:11:25.161 --> 02:11:30.050
Deal every posted through. Boom. There you go.

2422
02:11:30.051 --> 02:11:33.440
See, thanks. Thanks for that by the way. All right. Psychological warfare.

2423
02:11:34.130 --> 02:11:36.560
Go ahead. No, I'm giving it to you. I put your name there.

2424
02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:39.660
Psychological warfare. If you don't know what that is, this is what it is.

2425
02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:44.240
It's an album with tracks Jocko track. Anyway, he on those tracks,

2426
02:11:44.241 --> 02:11:46.670
he tells you how to get through moments of weakness,

2427
02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:50.960
like if you're about to eat the wrong thing because for the short term,

2428
02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:55.820
because there's short game, long game, listen to this. 100% works by the way.

2429
02:11:55.821 --> 02:11:59.030
So if you're like, okay, I'm going to can life, this is what I learned.

2430
02:11:59.031 --> 02:12:00.830
It's one of the biggest things. People ask me this all the time.

2431
02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:04.520
I would say literally anyone who has questions quote unquote for me,

2432
02:12:04.521 --> 02:12:05.990
this is one of the questions they'll ask.

2433
02:12:05.991 --> 02:12:08.780
What's the biggest thing you learned from Jocko? I'll tell you right now,

2434
02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:13.730
here it is. If you look at things short term versus long term,

2435
02:12:13.790 --> 02:12:17.150
small picture, big picture, and then there's like another one, whatever.

2436
02:12:17.151 --> 02:12:19.160
But either way it's all the same thing short term.

2437
02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:21.440
So in psychological warfare you're going short game.

2438
02:12:21.441 --> 02:12:24.680
If you're going to start playing the short game for that moment, this will this,

2439
02:12:24.681 --> 02:12:27.860
you're gonna lose the short game in the moment. As you were just saying,

2440
02:12:27.861 --> 02:12:29.540
if you're going to, if you're going to take a short term,

2441
02:12:29.541 --> 02:12:33.650
short term is going to have immediate gratification, but it's a long term down.

2442
02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:36.440
Yes, exactly right. And most of the time, not all the time,

2443
02:12:36.441 --> 02:12:39.380
but most of the times short term, if you play short, short game,

2444
02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:43.070
you lose the long game. With that play, it's like you take a short term,

2445
02:12:43.071 --> 02:12:46.010
step forward and take a long step back. It's one of those deals.

2446
02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:49.580
Usually you can break things down into that. So this is what this does.

2447
02:12:49.581 --> 02:12:52.970
I'm getting that because I need to listen to that while I'm at whole foods and

2448
02:12:52.971 --> 02:12:56.510
I'm getting up there ready to get to that register and they have those peanut

2449
02:12:56.511 --> 02:13:00.300
butter cups. Oh, all natural. All natural animal

2450
02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:04.730
[inaudible]. Exactly. All that. Better than that orange

2451
02:13:06.650 --> 02:13:09.660
[inaudible] weird is all natural. Same thing.

2452
02:13:10.710 --> 02:13:13.610
What are we doing over here? Just gotta listen to that as I'm checking out.

2453
02:13:13.611 --> 02:13:13.791
Right.

2454
02:13:13.791 --> 02:13:17.090
That's perfect actually because actually it's good because you can actually have

2455
02:13:17.091 --> 02:13:19.310
it in the queue, you know? Because a lot of times,

2456
02:13:19.311 --> 02:13:22.460
like you're just in the pantry wherever you are and you're like, boom,

2457
02:13:22.461 --> 02:13:24.940
I'm looking for the good stuff. Whatever. Boom. I see the, the,

2458
02:13:24.941 --> 02:13:28.460
the Oreos brought my, you can't just go, Oh let me queue it up.

2459
02:13:28.461 --> 02:13:32.280
Sometimes it gets hard as what I'm saying Bro. My son, okay, can drive now.

2460
02:13:32.281 --> 02:13:34.980
Right. Which means he can go to the store,

2461
02:13:35.370 --> 02:13:40.140
which means he can shop for food. Right? We're talking 16 year old boy.

2462
02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:44.890
What does he get at the store? [inaudible] worth talking to y'all natural.

2463
02:13:45.170 --> 02:13:49.170
Oh he just gets crazy. So he'll be like, I'm hungry.

2464
02:13:49.290 --> 02:13:52.200
Go into the store, comes home, what does he come home with?

2465
02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:57.090
Half Gallon of whatever ice cream makes sense. Cause you know,

2466
02:13:57.091 --> 02:14:02.091
the supermarkets they formulate or they design the store and the product course

2467
02:14:02.130 --> 02:14:04.140
a certain way. So like boom, boom.

2468
02:14:04.141 --> 02:14:06.090
That's why they put the Reese's peanut butter right at the,

2469
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:08.700
at the checkout they call them impulse buys. Right?

2470
02:14:08.701 --> 02:14:12.060
And that goes for everything. Little magazines and balloons and all that.

2471
02:14:12.150 --> 02:14:15.750
You know what that is? That's their psychological warfare. That's what it is.

2472
02:14:16.070 --> 02:14:17.460
Their psychological warfare.

2473
02:14:17.670 --> 02:14:21.120
And then you've got to combat that with psychological warfare.

2474
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:24.350
Chocolate's psychological flanking me. Definitely can. Absolutely.

2475
02:14:24.570 --> 02:14:28.680
Cause I can avoid the aisle and avoid the snack aisle.

2476
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:29.743
You're not even going down there,

2477
02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:34.050
but you got to checkout and that's why they got them. That's your weakness Bro.

2478
02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:35.213
They're so good.

2479
02:14:35.490 --> 02:14:39.480
But that's what your boy is essentially falling for when he goes in. He's like,

2480
02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:41.460
Hey, I'm going to go here near you so that's where you're wrong.

2481
02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:45.330
He's not going up there. [inaudible]

2482
02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:50.070
he's leaving the house and he's thinking the briars. Okay.

2483
02:14:50.071 --> 02:14:54.030
That's where these ads do. Yes. He's, he goes and gets cakes like dude,

2484
02:14:54.550 --> 02:14:55.480
the plan is, you know,

2485
02:14:55.530 --> 02:15:00.300
honestly the ice cream thing has really taken a down hit at my house cause mark.

2486
02:15:00.301 --> 02:15:02.800
Right. Cause everyone just kind of on the milk tray that makes like,

2487
02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:06.420
but my son will get straight up chocolate chip cookies.

2488
02:15:06.710 --> 02:15:09.090
Just that's what he did last night. That's why this is fresh on my mind.

2489
02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:09.990
Comes home,

2490
02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:14.130
nine o'clock goes to the store at eight 40 like we already ate dinner.

2491
02:15:15.330 --> 02:15:16.163
Okay. Where are you going?

2492
02:15:16.350 --> 02:15:18.750
I'm just going to go to the store and he's only thinking about one thing.

2493
02:15:18.751 --> 02:15:23.010
He's not thinking about lettuce, thinking about apples.

2494
02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:25.880
He's thinking chocolate chip cookies. Yes.

2495
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:31.310
Coming back with the big chunks in them like the premium and then this little

2496
02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:34.590
kid brings him into my house. You know what I mean?

2497
02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:39.060
It's a good way to get shanked actually. Psychological warfare,

2498
02:15:40.630 --> 02:15:43.440
big time shit. Like probably get to that home. All the tape.

2499
02:15:43.470 --> 02:15:47.530
If you want to go visual, visual, psychological warfare for yourself.

2500
02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:52.240

2508
02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:23.620
You'll figure it out. You'll make it happen. So true. Also on it.

2509
02:16:24.270 --> 02:16:27.080
Will you go to [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko this is where you can get your

2510
02:16:27.081 --> 02:16:29.980
kettlebells. You're getting kettlebells, you know on it, right? Yeah. We've seen

2511
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.500
<v 2>those kiddos there before. Do you guys work out the home gym?</v>

2512
02:16:32.501 --> 02:16:35.260
Where are you guys working out now? Now we go down. It's really cool.

2513
02:16:35.290 --> 02:16:38.800
They have a full on my crossfit type set up at the gym and there's an indoor

2514
02:16:38.801 --> 02:16:43.210
track. Um, it's, it's amazing pool right there, but it's a,

2515
02:16:43.211 --> 02:16:46.590
it's full on like crossfit asks out thing and you can go get it. Yup.

2516
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:50.230
And they leave you alone. Yup. Two bowl the other day. And guess what?

2517
02:16:50.231 --> 02:16:53.840
No chalk was allowed. Really notices gym section

2518
02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:56.620
<v 0>when you, you to talk about it. Was it a hotel? Jamerson it was a,</v>

2519
02:16:56.750 --> 02:16:59.940
but it was really a proper gym. Hey, it was a gym that had bumper plates.

2520
02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:04.410
It was a gym that had six squat racks,

2521
02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:09.240
no power squat, no six squat racks. I'm in this gym, no chalk.

2522
02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:14.220
If they have bumpers, eight kettlebells, no chalk. They had pull bars,

2523
02:17:14.250 --> 02:17:18.600
no chocolates. That's a real problem. I can see like, you know, hey,

2524
02:17:18.601 --> 02:17:21.780
if you're into 24 hour fitness and you're, you got the, the,

2525
02:17:21.781 --> 02:17:25.200
the universal machines or whatever that echo's out there to JMU,

2526
02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:31.470
that's yacking anyway, nothing gets universal by the way. But you know,

2527
02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:36.280
let's keep it real anyway on it. Kettlebells, whatever.

2528
02:17:36.450 --> 02:17:38.220
Yes. So that's where I get my kettlebells.

2529
02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:41.300
Kettlebell routine in general is good, do kettle,

2530
02:17:41.450 --> 02:17:44.460
but a lot of what mo did as far as your spine and whatever,

2531
02:17:44.461 --> 02:17:45.510
and I was going to ask you earlier,

2532
02:17:45.511 --> 02:17:49.260
but what does that like keep you from doing mainly? Well,

2533
02:17:49.670 --> 02:17:53.060
<v 2>I wake up but it hurts all the time. But uh,</v>

2534
02:17:53.090 --> 02:17:58.070
every time I turned my head and I realize just how lucky I am that after 20

2535
02:17:58.071 --> 02:18:02.280
years and all those things, like that's all I have to deal with. So it's a,

2536
02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:06.350
it's mobility, it hurts whatever surgery. But a c six c seven spine,

2537
02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:09.890
they went to know, not know the military wanted to fuse me, but luckily I had,

2538
02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:13.280
I've got a second opinion and they went in and shaved off of a bone spur in

2539
02:18:13.281 --> 02:18:15.630
there that was crushing a nerve that was making my left arm.

2540
02:18:15.770 --> 02:18:19.370
Was it like a foraminotomy? I don't think they use that term. That's what I got.

2541
02:18:19.610 --> 02:18:23.720
But a unethical back. Yep. C 67 got to go back in there. But uh,

2542
02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:27.140
every time it hurts, I'm just like, you know, there's guys out there for PTSD,

2543
02:18:27.410 --> 02:18:31.980
TBI, missing arms and legs just destroyed. And a, this is all I have. Yup.

2544
02:18:32.150 --> 02:18:36.800
And a good, Yup. Seriously. Yep. Absolutely.

2545
02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:39.530
Um, some of them would keep me from doing anything. It just reminds me,

2546
02:18:39.590 --> 02:18:43.310
so I use it as a, here's a reminder that I'm very, very lucky, very fortunate.

2547
02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:47.810
So you can, you can push it but just not get nuts and yup. I still got,

2548
02:18:47.811 --> 02:18:48.170
you know,

2549
02:18:48.170 --> 02:18:51.770
I keep trying to keep up and if anything I'm trying to take it easy on goes out

2550
02:18:51.771 --> 02:18:54.110
the window. I just said that's just like, let's just roll.

2551
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:58.400
It's just roll at 20% I remember those. Yeah, exactly. Not happening,

2552
02:18:58.730 --> 02:19:01.820
so I remember well, yeah. Good. Then kettlebells, right? Right. Yup.

2553
02:19:01.821 --> 02:19:04.910
My point was you do kettle bells. You get that functional strength back,

2554
02:19:04.911 --> 02:19:08.120
whatever, boom. Non P. I mean you're backed up prohibiting, boom,

2555
02:19:08.121 --> 02:19:09.890
you're into kettlebells. Yup. Absolutely.

2556
02:19:09.891 --> 02:19:12.140
Almost every day when we're working out with the whole, with the crew.

2557
02:19:12.350 --> 02:19:13.850
Well yeah, so yeah. All my kettlebells,

2558
02:19:15.040 --> 02:19:18.050
<v 0>kettlebells and then we've got some dogs. If you want books, if you like books,</v>

2559
02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:22.580
first of all, the terminal list and true believer by Jack Carr,

2560
02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:25.580
check those out. Get into the,

2561
02:19:26.060 --> 02:19:29.560
I believe you just said the psychological mind field

2562
02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:36.520
of this dude who's on the serious warpath already dead get so way the warrior

2563
02:19:38.301 --> 02:19:40.100
kid three is out.

2564
02:19:40.130 --> 02:19:45.130
It's live and you can get that on amazon.com where there's a will is the

2565
02:19:46.731 --> 02:19:51.080
subtitle of that book. Find out what happens to young mark,

2566
02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:54.440
how Uncle Jake helps him out way the where your kid one and then way the warrior

2567
02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:57.440
could do Mark's mission. Those are also available. Mikey and the dragons.

2568
02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:02.680
You can get that one for any kid between the ages of zero and 150 and they're

2569
02:20:04.551 --> 02:20:07.130
going to get something out of it. The discipline equals freedom field manual.

2570
02:20:07.220 --> 02:20:10.720
Get that. That's what you want to get your kid that just graduated.

2571
02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:12.110
That's what you want to get your employee.

2572
02:20:12.111 --> 02:20:13.400
That seems to be sliding off the track.

2573
02:20:13.401 --> 02:20:17.270
That's what you want to get your friend that is letting themselves go down the

2574
02:20:17.271 --> 02:20:21.710
slippery slope. Yes. Taking the short term gratification on stuff. No,

2575
02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:23.990
you get them. The discipline equals freedom field manual.

2576
02:20:24.470 --> 02:20:28.460
The audio version of that is on iTunes, Amazon music.

2577
02:20:28.461 --> 02:20:30.230
It's a MP three format.

2578
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:33.470
Then there's extreme ownership and the dichotomy leadership where you can take

2579
02:20:33.471 --> 02:20:37.790
these lessons from combat. Me and my brother Leif Babin wrote that book,

2580
02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:42.320
those books and how you can apply those lessons to your business,

2581
02:20:42.321 --> 02:20:43.154
to your life.

2582
02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:47.000
We've got Ashkelon Front leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems

2583
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:50.960
through leadership. We also have ef online where you can,

2584
02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:56.600
you can continue to train leadership because you never master it.

2585
02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:00.260
You never met. You never even really get good at it. It's,

2586
02:21:00.261 --> 02:21:03.710
you always have to be working at it. So we have online work at it,

2587
02:21:03.711 --> 02:21:06.800
work at it every day. Do what happens if you stop working out.

2588
02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.530
Do you stay in shape? Echo, chas, negative.

2589
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:13.430
What happens if you stop trying to become a good leader? Same. Same thing.

2590
02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:16.910
You go backwards. Get rusty beyond rusty.

2591
02:21:17.300 --> 02:21:20.950
We're talking catastrophic. Just lose it. Yeah, we're talking.

2592
02:21:20.970 --> 02:21:24.830
You turn into a leadership slob. Yes. You don't want no, you want to be sharp.

2593
02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:26.470
You want to be in tune. Yeah.

2594
02:21:27.230 --> 02:21:31.070
I experienced this because I get to see it all the time with the companies we

2595
02:21:31.071 --> 02:21:34.940
work with. Like I see someone that's like early in the game and they're sharp,

2596
02:21:35.610 --> 02:21:35.940
they're there,

2597
02:21:35.940 --> 02:21:40.010
their leadership is sharp and then all of a sudden they slack off for awhile and

2598
02:21:40.011 --> 02:21:42.200
they have a leadership problem and they handle it wrong.

2599
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:44.150
Just like they couldn't Mack,

2600
02:21:44.151 --> 02:21:46.910
they couldn't do 42 pull ups like they could before.

2601
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:48.920
Now they're doing 30 to why they haven't been trained.

2602
02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:53.740
Got To keep your leadership brain sharp. You ever done 42 pull ups now?

2603
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:56.510
Like my mind was 30 something was my, was my best.

2604
02:21:56.511 --> 02:21:59.690
I think it's still 30 something in high school when I was at very,

2605
02:21:59.730 --> 02:22:03.240
very light and there are two sets of 20 I still remember that was my thing came

2606
02:22:03.270 --> 02:22:05.780
on that bike seeps. That's it. That's what's interesting.

2607
02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:07.590
And that was getting ready for buds essentially.

2608
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:10.070
That was high school but still I still had a little time.

2609
02:22:10.071 --> 02:22:10.750
But you're still at a time.

2610
02:22:10.750 --> 02:22:13.550
I was still training and what I was going to say is like for me getting ready

2611
02:22:13.551 --> 02:22:15.610
for buds was I was like Bro, I did.

2612
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:21.130
I did three sets of pull ups today cause we didn't know how had to do 250 pull

2613
02:22:21.131 --> 02:22:24.380
ups per workout. Right. 350 pull ups work out. I didn't think of that.

2614
02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:25.950
It didn't even make sense to me. Right.

2615
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:30.750
It was 19 it was 1989 1990 wow.

2616
02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:33.660
[inaudible] there was no way to access this information. No.

2617
02:22:33.661 --> 02:22:36.540
So you're never going to be doing the same number of pull ups as your class

2618
02:22:36.541 --> 02:22:40.530
number. Yeah. Yeah. How, how many? That's what we're going to do. Yeah.

2619
02:22:40.531 --> 02:22:44.520
By the way, we're doing it tomorrow too after lunch. So get some of that.

2620
02:22:44.521 --> 02:22:46.500
So that's the same thing. Physical, mental,

2621
02:22:46.740 --> 02:22:51.210
get your leadership mindset sharp, keep it sharp.

2622
02:22:52.050 --> 02:22:53.280
Eff Online. If you want to come to the muster,

2623

2624
02:22:55.680 --> 02:22:58.290
They all sell out very quickly. Chicago sold out.

2625
02:22:58.410 --> 02:23:03.410
Denver's heading that way that September 19th and 20th and then Sydney,

2626

USA. Echo. Anything else? Nothing else. Thank you. Jet Car.

2640

Thank you guys so much for having me on. It's a pleasure to be here.

2641
02:24:07.980 --> 02:24:10.080
I feel very fortunate that uh, getting out,

2642
02:24:10.410 --> 02:24:14.400
we were able to kind of make the life we want on the outside. Um,

2643
02:24:14.430 --> 02:24:19.010
can defy a few odds along the way and that's all because, because my life, um,

2644
02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:24.180
the 19 coming up on 19 years, I'll stay on this month and uh, and uh, yeah,

2645
02:24:24.181 --> 02:24:27.270
so because of her strength raising those kids while I was away,

2646
02:24:27.271 --> 02:24:29.820
now I can tell that a little bit. Hopefully not mess it up, um,

2647
02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:33.270
got to getting into her routine. But uh, yeah, she's amazing.

2648
02:24:33.271 --> 02:24:35.580
Super Strong love with all my heart. My next, uh,

2649
02:24:35.581 --> 02:24:39.570
this next mission in life really is all about her and them. That's awesome.

2650
02:24:39.690 --> 02:24:40.523
Well,

2651
02:24:41.370 --> 02:24:46.370
thanks once again for coming on and obviously thanks for your service to America

2652
02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:50.550
as the healers. You had an awesome,

2653
02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:54.990
awesome run and you were deployed over and over and over again.

2654
02:24:55.170 --> 02:24:57.180
And even though we joke about, you know,

2655
02:24:57.750 --> 02:25:01.410
what a good time it is and we did have a good time. I know you had a good time,

2656
02:25:01.411 --> 02:25:03.870
but at the same time, you know you're making sacrifices,

2657
02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:08.250
your family's home alone and that's huge. So thanks to you,

2658
02:25:08.251 --> 02:25:09.960
thanks to your family, thanks to your wife for,

2659
02:25:10.140 --> 02:25:14.780
for having the strength to deal with that and appreciate you and,

2660
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:18.780
and it's awesome to see what you're doing right now. Thanks brother.

2661
02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:23.680
Appreciate it. To anyone else that's listening that is serving right now,

2662
02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:28.860
where has served thanks to you for keeping us a free and to police and to law

2663
02:25:31.691 --> 02:25:35.620
enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and e mts and dispatchers and

2664
02:25:35.621 --> 02:25:39.580
correctional officers and border patrol and secret service and all the first

2665
02:25:39.581 --> 02:25:44.581
responders that are out there 24 hours a day and they're training and they're

2666
02:25:44.681 --> 02:25:49.270
preparing and they're on call so that we can be safe here at home.

2667
02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:53.020
Thanks to all of you for that service and for that sacrifice.

2668
02:25:54.310 --> 02:25:54.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

2669
02:25:54.760 --> 02:25:58.460
<v 0>Into everyone else that is listening.</v>

2670
02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:01.220
Remember that?

2671
02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:02.380
<v 1>Okay?</v>

2672
02:26:02.380 --> 02:26:05.440
<v 0>There's always somebody out there with their sights on you.</v>

2673
02:26:06.770 --> 02:26:07.370
<v 1>Okay?</v>

2674
02:26:07.370 --> 02:26:12.260
<v 0>It may be it's a competitor in business. Maybe it's an enemy and the surgeon,</v>

2675
02:26:12.470 --> 02:26:14.930
maybe it's some criminal Fogg.

2676
02:26:14.931 --> 02:26:19.460
Maybe it's someone that's just looking to do harm to you or your family,

2677
02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:21.973
or maybe,

2678
02:26:23.470 --> 02:26:23.650
<v 1>okay,</v>

2679
02:26:23.650 --> 02:26:25.180
<v 0>maybe that's someone who's you.</v>

2680
02:26:26.490 --> 02:26:27.120
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2681
02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:29.150
<v 0>It may be you're your own worst enemy.</v>

2682
02:26:30.110 --> 02:26:30.610
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2683
02:26:30.610 --> 02:26:34.240
<v 0>Sliding into the depths of complacency,</v>

2684
02:26:34.270 --> 02:26:38.230
allowing yourself to wander down the easy path.

2685
02:26:41.130 --> 02:26:41.970
Say No to that.

2686
02:26:43.050 --> 02:26:43.883
<v 1>Okay?</v>

2687
02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:48.390
<v 0>Remember why you're here. Remember what you want to do.</v>

2688
02:26:48.510 --> 02:26:52.980
Remember your cause. Be a true believer,

2689
02:26:54.270 --> 02:26:54.620
<v 1>okay?</v>

2690
02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:56.960
<v 0>And then live that belief</v>

2691
02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:03.880
by getting up every day. Then getting after it,

2692
02:27:05.790 --> 02:27:07.410
and until next time,

2693
02:27:07.470 --> 02:27:12.120
this is Jack Carr and deco and Jocko out.
