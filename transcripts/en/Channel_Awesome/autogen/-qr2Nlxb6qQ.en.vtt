00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:51.329 align:start position:0%
times like five different futures that
 

00:11:51.329 --> 00:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
times like five different futures that
don't<00:11:51.570><c> connectors</c><00:11:52.079><c> yeah</c><00:11:52.410><c> so</c><00:11:52.769><c> I</c><00:11:52.800><c> like</c><00:11:53.010><c> that</c>
