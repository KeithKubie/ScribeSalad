00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.550
Are messy people more creative?

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.590
Are organized people boring?

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.330
As somebody who cannot find
his keys underneath his dirty

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.410
laundry, I say yes to both.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.550
And so does science.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.781
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:16.780
Anthony here for D News.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.200
And there is this
prevailing myth

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.470
that messy people are
super-creative geniuses.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.820
Just look at the
desks and work spaces

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.060
of Albert Einstein, Roald
Dahl, or Peter Parker--

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.870
who is not real, but
feels real in my heart.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.369
I like this theory because I'm
a little disorganized myself.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.220
But is it true?

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.540
And what traits come along
with an organized life?

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.200
Researchers at
University of Minnesota

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.160
wanted to find out just that,
and so they ran three studies

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.090
to see how the tidiness of a
room affects human behavior.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.557
In the first, people were
sent into either a tidy room

00:00:46.557 --> 00:00:48.390
or a messy room and
asked to think about all

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.010
the creative ways to sell
ping-pong balls they could.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.350
People in each room gave
the same amount of answers,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.950
but the two independent
judges found the answers

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.090
from the messy
room more creative.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.564
And a previous study by
Northwestern University

00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:01.980
showed that people
in a messy room

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.099
drew more creative pictures
and could solve brain-teasers

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:05.900
faster.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.680
In the second Missouri study,
the people in each room

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.410
were given menus
from a smoothie shop

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.900
and they were offered a
smoothie with a free boost.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.750
In the tidy room,
people were more

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.490
likely to choose a boost
that was labeled "classic,"

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.920
while the people
in the messy room

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.930
were more likely to
pick one labeled "new."

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.960
So the messy room led people to
be drawn more towards novelty,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.720
while the tiny room was drawn
more towards convention.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.100
Boring.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.490
Trailblazers, I tell you.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.716
Messy trailblazers.

00:01:33.716 --> 00:01:35.090
Anyway, the final
group was asked

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.940
to fill out a
questionnaire, and then they

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.310
were offered either a
chocolate bar or an apple.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.390
And here's the thing.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.740
The people in the messy
room almost always

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.750
went for chocolate,
and tidy-roomers

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.110
went for the apple.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.890
I'm willing to admit to a
certain level of impulsiveness.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.600
That's fine.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.940
Oh, and also, those
people were asked

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.250
if they'd like to donate to
a charitable organization,

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.310
and the people in the clean
room donated a lot more money

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.640
and they donated more often.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.350
OK, so maybe tidy people make
healthier, more ethical people,

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.190
but the messy people are still
the creative risk-takers,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.250
and that counts for
something, right?

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.550
In reality, the
results just seem

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.670
to show that cleaner
environments promote safe

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.670
and conventional
behavior and messy ones

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.600
cause a break from
traditional thinking.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.940
Those things are not good
or bad by definition.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.094
It just depends on what
situation you're in.

00:02:21.094 --> 00:02:23.510
You know, speaking as somebody
from the messy camp though,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.420
it's important to remember
that in a public space,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.940
like school or work, you have
to deal with other people's

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.140
perceptions of your habits.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.340
57% of people in a
recent survey said

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.050
they judge people by how clean
they keep their work spaces.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.270
And nearly half of them
said that a messy desk

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.690
is a clear sign that the
person who sits at it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.360
is straight-up lazy.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.780
Maybe I should
keep my desk clean

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.560
but secretly do all my
work in the storage closet.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.910
Best of both worlds.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.390
Do you work better in a
clean or a messy environment?

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.810
I cannot think unless I'm
surrounded by clutter.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.597
