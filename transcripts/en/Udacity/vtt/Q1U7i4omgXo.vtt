00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So I predict that most people say they would hold, and why is that?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, under the identity function, sort of the arithmetic function,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
$3 million is 3 times better than $1 million, and so half of $3 million is 1.5 times better

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
than $1 million.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So the gamble is more.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But that's only true if $3 million really is 3 times better than $1 million.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For most people, that's not true.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That going from $100 to a $1 million is a big, big jump.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Going from $1 million to $3 million is a smaller jump than that,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
even though arithmetically it's more,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in terms of what you can do, it seems like less,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and that doesn't mean that people are irrational in any way.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Instead what it means is that for people, the value of money is not a linear function.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Rather it's something more like a logarithmic function,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
meaning if you have a certain amount of money,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
if you double that money,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you don't get twice as much value out of having that money,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
rather you just get 1 increment more of having that money.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So let's try again.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm going to input the math module, and now I'm going to ask,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
what's the best&lt;u&gt;action starting from $100 in my pocket,&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but valuing money with logarithmic function rather than with the identity

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
or linear function.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now my best&lt;u&gt;action tells me that what I should be doing is holding.&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
That corresponds to my intuition. That that's the right thing.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I can also ask, well, what if I had $10 million already,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
then would I take the bet, assuming my value of money is still logarithmic,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and best&lt;u&gt;action tells me that yes, I should.&lt;/u&gt;

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If I have $10 million, now I'm starting to look at money as more closely linear again.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm at this stage where logarithmic function is approximately linear locally.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
If I've got $10 million, I could say, yeah, I'm risking my $1 million,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
but that's no big deal. I've already got $10.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's a good bet because if I win, I get 3 or 0--that's 1.5 on average,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and that's more than 1, so I'm willing to take that bet,

00:02:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and I don't mind not gaining the additional $1 million.
