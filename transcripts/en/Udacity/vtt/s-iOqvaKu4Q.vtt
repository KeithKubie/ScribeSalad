00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.990
One of the really cool features of 23andme results,

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.560
is when you can combine your Ancestry and Traits information

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.930
and you can do this when you have family

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.088
members that have results to see. You can see exactly

00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:13.550
which alleles you share with which family members. Let's

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.450
take Joanna Mountain's family as an example. Here's her family

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.680
tree or pedigree. This is Joanna, this is her husband

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.850
Heyward. Her children Myles and Seamus and their grandparents, David,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.610
Susan, Anthony and Tasha. One big question that

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.880
Joanna and her husband had about one of her

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.140
children, Seamus, is that he has blue eyes while

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.760
both of his parents Joanna and Heyward have brown

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.090
eyes. Of course Joanna knew that eye color

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.125
was determined genetically, which meant that she knew that

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:46.780
Seamus' blue eyes must have been passed down from

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.310
her and her husband. And ultimately from their individual

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.370
parents, Seamus' grandparents. So Joanna set out

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.630
and coded their family tree or pedigree

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.330
here. With the eye colors of her children. Her and her husband, and their

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.520
parents. Now unfortunately, the maternal and paternal

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.290
grandfathers were deceased. But the paternal and

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.910
maternal grandmothers were still alive. And we

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.630
know that they both had brown eyes.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.010
And the question was. Were either of them contributing

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.170
to the blue eyes that we see in Seamus? So

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.845
a simple saliva sample from each and every one of

00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:27.690
the six individuals that we know something about here was

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.300
collected. Now one of the alleles important in determining eye

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.210
color is a gene called HERC2. Which we'll learn more

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.700
about in Lesson Nine. Now without explaining the whole story,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.720
one allele of HERC2 is recessive and promotes blue eye

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.250
color and another allele is dominant and promotes

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.920
brown eye color. So, for Seamus to have

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640
blue eyes, that must mean that he inherited

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.200
two recessive copies of the HERC2 gene from each

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.800
of his parents. This means that Seamus is

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.040
homozygous recessive. And each of his parents, Joanna and

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.150
Heyward are heterozygous dominant for brown. And the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.400
question is, where did these recessive alleles come from?

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.020
Which of Seamus's grandparents, in this case

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.930
his paternal or maternal grandmothers, did they contribute

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.620
a recessive allele to his eye color?

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.940
So after submitting a saliva sample for everyone

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.180
in the group, the 23andMe website allowed

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.270
the family to compare their chromosomes side by

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.646
side. In this case we're comparing Seamus' chromosomes

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:31.718
with his paternal grandmother and here we're comparing

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:35.307
his chromosomes to his maternal grandmother. Everywhere you

00:02:35.307 --> 00:02:37.782
see a shade of blue in which it indicates

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:41.157
shared ancestry meaning that some of his chromosomes

00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:44.935
have inherited a piece from that individual grand parent.

00:02:44.935 --> 00:02:47.023
Any where you don't see shading means that

00:02:47.023 --> 00:02:49.725
they don't share that piece of the chromosome. And

00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:53.295
the red arrow indicates the location of the HERC2

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:56.850
gene on chromosome 15. So looking at comparison of

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.314
Seamus' chromosomes to his paternal and maternal grandmothers, which

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:04.554
grandparent did he inherit one HERC2 allele from and

00:03:04.554 --> 00:03:08.400
why? Go ahead and select which grandmother you think,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.070
and then tell me why in the text box here.
