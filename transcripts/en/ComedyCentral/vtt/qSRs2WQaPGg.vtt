No, you and the vice president

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.644
-in the next room
behind that, uh... -What room?

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:12.845
There's nothing there.
There's a mirror.

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:14.480
No, on this side,
it looks like a mirror,

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.482
but on the other side,
you can see and hear them.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.584
-They won't be able
to see or hear you. -Oh, wow.

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:20.620
Give a little yank.
You know what I mean?

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:21.888
Please don't do that.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.823
Oh, there,
just have a seat anywhere.

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:24.824
Look at this guy.

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:26.492
PENCE:
These are real Americans.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:27.860
TRUMP:
Oh, there we go.

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:29.228
Hi, honey.

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.898
-Look at that. Perfect place.
-MAN: I thank everybody

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.534
for being here today.
My name is Jason.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.202
The moderator
looks like a beaver.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:38.871
Let's go around the room and
have everybody say your name.

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:40.406
Uh, my name is George.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.574
My name is Greg.

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:42.875
Hey, what's your name, honey?

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:44.744
-My name is Yoda.
-TRUMP: Yoda.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.379
TRUMP:
In love I think I am.

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:47.780
JASON:
All right, let's just

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:49.315
start off
with sort of a general question.

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:51.484
-TRUMP: Can they hear us?
-PENCE: No they can't hear us.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:54.320
If we want to talk to Jason, we
just talk into this microphone.

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:57.757
What do you think are the most
important issues facing America?

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.194
Middle America is being
decimated, and it's time that...

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.695
that we're brought back
into consideration...

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:03.963
TRUMP:
This is so boring.

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:05.932
Do we have any snacks
around here, anybody?

TRUMP:
Ooh, Yoda.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:15.775
Yoda.

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:18.644
PENCE:
I think Yoda's married, sir.

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:20.513
-Who cares?
-I see a ring around her finger.

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:22.381
Listen, I'll tell you
what I told Billy Bush.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:24.550
-Oh, don't. No, no, no. No, no.
-I knew she was married,

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:26.152
-but I moved on her
like a bitch anyway. -No. Aah.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:27.787
I couldn't help myself.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:34.026
-MAN: I know... -Sir, no.
You have to rip it off.

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:36.395
I told you,
you're supposed to rip it off.

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:39.098
Look, I got another tie, Mike.
I got another tie.

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.367
Look at me. I'm a businessman.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.136
JASON: And just
as a general question--

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.471
and we can do this
by a show of hands-- do you feel

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:47.039
that the country is
on the right track?

00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:48.875
PENCE:
Only three.

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:51.410
That should have been 100%,
Jason.

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:53.546
Uh, wrong track?

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.316
-TRUMP: What jerks! -PENCE:
You threw your animal crackers.

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.418
What total... jerks.

00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:01.821
What are you doing? Why aren't
you saying things like,

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:03.789
-"President Trump is so great"?
-It's my job

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:05.992
to be neutral.
I can't be expressing...

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.994
Did you...
Have you had a fruit roll-up?

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.061
-Give him a fruit roll-up.
-No, thank...

00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:11.063
-No, honestly.
-You take that end.

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:12.365
-Sir...
-Take that end.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.634
Oh, you're gonna do...?
Don't do that. I mean, that...

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.036
This is... I mean,
this is sort of a...

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:20.506
PENCE:
No. No, no, no. No.

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.909
Don't kiss. Don't kiss. No, no,
don't. You're gonna kiss.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.977
I can't watch. I can't watch.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.313
I can't watch.
I can't watch. I can't watch.

00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:29.081
Don't. No, don't. Don't.

00:02:29.114 --> 00:02:31.184
What's happening?

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:33.085
What's happening?
Did you...?

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:34.887
That's the kiss of death.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.622
You understand me?

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:39.559
Now go out there
and ask some real questions.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.427
Okay, um...

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.297
Um...

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.999
Let me, uh... let me shift gears
a little bit.

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:48.868
Do you think
that he has the potential

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.770
to become a great president?

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:51.871
Not potential.

00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:53.873
Um...
best quality, worst quality.

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:55.374
TRUMP:
What are you doing?

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:57.109
-Just the best quality.
-JASON: Uh...

00:02:57.142 --> 00:03:00.813
Jason, I want you to turn
to the women and say, "We need

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:02.548
to do the rest of this topless."

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:05.084
-PENCE: No, sir, he can't
do that. -TRUMP: It's shirts

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:08.020
-and skins, and all the women
are the skins. -Sir, no.

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:10.323
TRUMP: Jason, please.
We all got to see it.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.791
Don't look at this mirror.
Do not look

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.326
at this mirror.
Don't say "no" to me.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.493
I'm so sorry, Jason.

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:16.128
I'm the president
of the United States.

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:17.863
I'm really sorry. We're just
having a technical error.

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:19.899
-I'm just gonna be... -TRUMP:
Jason, eat a bunch of nuts

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:21.400
-and hold them in your mouth.
-Okay. No!

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:22.969
-You can't do this.
-What the hell are you doing?

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.203
-You asked them to take
their tops off. -Get the...

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:25.538
-Get out of here.
-No. You want to make 'em...

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:26.739
Get the hell out of here.

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:27.974
-You're fired.
-(Jason mumbles)

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:29.242
-Get out of here, Jason.
-Oh, definitely...

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.443
Get out of here, Jason!

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.877
I should have never kissed you!

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.879
-I should have never
kissed you! -Shh.

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:35.381
-I will go in... I will go in.
-Go in there.

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:37.450
-I will go in. I will go in.
-You stay in here. You got 'em.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:40.453
-(indistinct chatter)
-Hello. Hi.

00:03:40.486 --> 00:03:42.288
Sorry about that.
That was, uh...

00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:45.658
Jason had to, um... had to go.

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.493
TRUMP:
This is how you do it, okay?

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.095
If you want to get
the right answers.

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.397
Just overall, a question
about the president.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.832
(belches)

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:54.934
(quiet groan)
Oh, God. Is, um...

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:57.069
how great of a job is he doing?

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:58.537
On a scale of...

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.741
-Seven to 11.
-seven... to 11...

00:04:06.612 --> 00:04:09.115
So Pence is doing better...
than Trump.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.983
-What?! No. Say no.
-Okay. I've heard that.

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:12.585
-That's not true.
-That's a perfect answer.

00:04:12.618 --> 00:04:13.719
-No.
-That's great.

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:15.388
-God...
-And then, uh... Bill?

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.989
TRUMP: Mike,
what the hell are you doing?

00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:18.357
She said I was doing an 11,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.559
-Get out. Get out.
-and that you were doing a ten.

00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:21.927
-You're out of here.
-And Bill agreed.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.663
-Get her out.
-Bill also said 11 to ten.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.665
What a disappointing bunch
of people.

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:28.367
And I want you all to leave
who didn't agree with me now.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.669
Get up and leave. Get out.

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.504
George, get out of here
for real.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:32.872
Get out, Greg.

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:34.874
Then shut the door.

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:36.876
Back to the survey.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.913
Who here believes
that Donald J. Trump

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:44.884
