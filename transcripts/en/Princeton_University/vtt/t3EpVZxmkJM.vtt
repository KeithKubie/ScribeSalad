ROSE HUBER: Welcome
from Dublin, Ireland.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.110
We are here from day one of the
Princeton-Fung Global Forum.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.360
My name is Rose Huber, from
the Woodrow Wilson School,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.340
and I'm here with four wonderful
students from Princeton.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.850
So not to put you guys on the
spot, but I do want to ask,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.780
did you have a particular panel
that really interested you

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.020
today from what we saw?

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.500
And you kind of touched
on history a little bit,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.470
but was there a panel
that really stuck out,

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.290
or person on a panel
that you thought, wow,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.000
I really need to
connect with that person

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.430
tonight and talk to them?

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.900
Do you have any
reactions to that?

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.590
SUBJECT 1: I think
the obvious one for me

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.260
that was like star
for me was Margaret

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.220 position:59%
Chan, the Director-General of the WHO.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.110
So it was very cool to
hear her perspective,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.690
and also contrasting it, how
she was very much involved

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.080
in the SARS epidemic--
or the outbreak--

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.090
and then being
involved in Ebola

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.310
and also being asked
very tough questions.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.690
And so, it was cool because
my thesis adviser, Professor

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.920
JoÃ£o Biehl, was also here,
and then to see him go up

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.920
and ask her questions and
to see the interaction

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.340
between academia,
people who are handling

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.710
these issues in the real world.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.460
Also, just at dinner,
I was sitting next

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.380
to a journalist at
NPR, so just seeing

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.660
all these different
worlds interact was great.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.720
ROSE HUBER: So we went on
a walking tour of Dublin

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.350
yesterday, so what
are your impressions

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.240
of Dublin, and
just the conference in general?

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.060
You've kind of already
shared, but what

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.360
do you think about being
here at this conference?

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.980
Is it your first Fung
Forum conference?

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.380
Is it your first
time in Ireland?

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.250
SUBJECT 2: Very beautiful city.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.420
The walking tour is great.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.320
We got to see a lot of the
historical sights of Dublin.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.010
We saw the castle.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.440
We saw Trinity
College, very nice.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.230
SUBJECT 3: It's really
warm and sunny here,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.200
which I think people
are surprised about.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.700
Everyone's surprised
that the weather's nice.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.940
Apparently it's usually
really dreary and rainy here.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.230
ROSE HUBER: Everybody thought
it would be rainy and cold.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.520
SUBJECT 3: Yeah, it's
been a pleasant time.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.150
SUBJECT 2: I read in
the New York Times

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.090
that apparently there's like
an unseasonal amount of fog

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.730
right now in Europe?

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.010
ROSE HUBER: Yeah.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.800
SUBJECT 4: We did learn
on the walking tour

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.660
that the largest Viking
historical-- I guess-- dig up

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.540
is right here in Dublin,
so that was cool.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.080
There's a picture
on Instagram of all

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.060
of us laying in the
Viking beds, ten across

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.440
on each side of the home.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.010
So we checked that out.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.300
ROSE HUBER: So any last
reflections before we close up.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.360
We need to get
back to our dinner,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.320
but we wanted to say hi
to everybody back home.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.060
We miss you.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.880
We're having a great time.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.760
Any other thoughts
before we close out?

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.450
SUBJECT 4: I was going to answer
your question a little bit

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.220
before.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.510
I really enjoyed
Elizabeth Levine,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.130
who was from the CDC
and working

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.120
on the ground during the
politics session.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.870
I think it was the
second section.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.610
ROSE HUBER: The science,
yeah, science session.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.480
SUBJECT 4: I'm sorry.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.690 position:83%
At science and plagues session; politics is tomorrow.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.180
Yeah, so she was
super interesting,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.640
and I think that, for me, that
was definitely the highlight

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.690
of the event so far.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.800
ROSE HUBER: Yeah, a lot
of on-the-ground kind

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.710
of stories that we're getting
to hear at this conference,

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.450
which is really great, paired
with some academic discussions.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.570
It's really a nice mix of
academics, people in the field.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.370
So we have more tomorrow, more
anthropologists tomorrow, which

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.580
we're all looking forward to.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.600
So goodnight from Dublin,
or good afternoon to you,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.100
and thanks so much
for joining us.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.890
SUBJECT 3: See you.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.450
ROSE HUBER: Bye.
