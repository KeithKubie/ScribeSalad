 9 auto industry is    is really
 heating         heating up.  I 

00:53:36.202 --> 00:53:39.232
think that's no secret.  We see 
cars rapidly         rapidly 

00:53:39.233 --> 00:53:42.339
transforming from      from

 We also      also see a

[ Applause ].  We're seeing 

00:56:03.103 --> 00:56:04.025
       seeing strong growth 
       growth on the developer 

00:56:04.026 --> 00:56:06.222
          developer front as 
well.  In fact we've seen a 50% 

00:56:06.573 --> 00:56:08.915
% increase in the auto mf   
             in the auto-enabled

00:56:12.888 --> 00:56:15.507
  But            year.  But none
 of this would matter        

00:56:15.508 --> 00:56:16.973
matter if    if we didn't   
        we didn't have users  

00:56:16.974 --> 00:56:18.730
     users, right?  I'm     I'm 
happy to say Android Auto      

00:56:18.731 --> 00:56:20.533
Auto usage is    is growing 
        growing like crazy      

00:56:20.534 --> 00:56:27.998
 crazy as well.  Heefr       
Heefr's where we were at Google 

00:56:27.999 --> 00:56:30.365
I/O 2016, and here is    is 
where we are today       today 

00:56:30.366 --> 00:56:34.882
at I/    I/O2017.  We've seen a 
10X growth        growth in 

00:56:34.883 --> 00:56:37.904
usage       usage over the last 
     last year along and the 

00:56:37.905 --> 00:56:40.139
strong trajectory            
trajectory continues.  But this 

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:43.320
is    is just the beginning.  
And we're really more excited 

00:56:43.321 --> 00:56:46.897
about       about where Android 
is    is going on the road ahead

00:56:47.031 --> 00:56:51.623
       ahead.  Last      Last 
year at IO we announced 

00:56:51.924 --> 00:56:53.924
          announced that we're 
building          building auto 

00:56:54.079 --> 00:56:55.715
     automotive      motive 
features          features right

00:56:55.716 --> 00:56:57.559
 into the Android platform 
         platform to make it a 

00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.407
turn      turnkey solution  
        solution for cars.  

00:56:59.408 --> 00:57:02.617
Every bit as much      much as 
automotive platform          

00:57:02.618 --> 00:57:04.570
platform as it is a mobile 
platform today       today.  

00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:06.442
We're doing this because        
 because we believe open 

00:57:06.443 --> 00:57:08.817
platform          platforms are 
powerful          powerful   

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:11.493
       powerful enablers of eco 
    ecosystems.  They reduce the

00:57:11.494 --> 00:57:15.069
 cost      cost of development 
and they speed time to market.  

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.532
In a sense they accelerate

01:04:40.247 --> 01:04:42.862

01:04:42.863 --> 01:04:44.674
important           important 
for us    us to create

create a completely seamless 
solution          solution, 

01:04:47.844 --> 01:04:51.578

where the user experience is    

01:04:51.579 --> 01:04:53.741
is at the heart of everybody

design of the        of the UX 

01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:08.863
system plays of course an 
enormous important           

01:05:08.864 --> 01:05:11.278
important role.  But at the part
 of it, it's the operating 

01:05:11.357 --> 01:05:14.181
          operating system.  And
 here we strongly          

01:05:14.182 --> 01:05:16.211
strongly believe that together  
        together with Google we 

01:05:16.212 --> 01:05:19.830

to life in the future cars.  So 
be with us    us here and show 

01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:45.262
that we can make the best      
best connected infotainment

01:07:19.904 --> 01:07:23.226
really excited about       about
 that.  With the Android

revolutionize               
revolutionize the way we stay 

01:07:36.461 --> 01:07:38.198
connected           connected in

everywhere.  But a big part of 

01:07:42.005 --> 01:07:46.734
the             part of the 
driver's digital life, as Henrik

01:07:47.191 --> 01:07:48.390
 and Alfons said, is    is the 
applications

01:07:53.015 --> 01:07:55.666
 And                     other 
devices and we need to bring 

01:07:55.875 --> 01:07:57.875
      bring the eco     
ecosystem along for the ride.  I

01:07:58.028 --> 01:08:00.332
 would like to welcome         
welcome up on stage AJ Kimbembe 

01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:02.501
from      from the Android Auto
      Auto UX team to talk about

01:08:02.699 --> 01:08:04.633
       about what this all means
 for developer           

01:08:04.634 --> 01:08:06.634
developers.  
[ Applause ]

01:08:12.011 --> 01:08:13.946
         Patrick.  And hi    hi,
 everyone          everyone.  My

01:08:13.947 --> 01:08:16.052
 name is AJ    AJ and I'm 
           AJ and I am the lead 

01:08:16.053 --> 01:08:18.210
designer          designer for 
Android         Android in-     

01:08:18.211 --> 01:08:19.563
in-car infotainment.  Patrick 
already         already detailed

01:08:19.564 --> 01:08:22.343
          detailed how we've 
been hard at work to make 

01:08:22.344 --> 01:08:24.778
Android         Android the best
      best possible infotainment

01:08:24.779 --> 01:08:26.762
 platform          platform with
 improvement             

01:08:26.763 --> 01:08:28.518
improvement to Bluetooth   
        Bluetooth, boot time, 

01:08:28.519 --> 01:08:31.255
car controls          controls, 
radio, car sensors, cluster 

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.352
        clusters and so on.  But
 Android is    is not only a 

01:08:34.353 --> 01:08:36.595
great platform          
platform.  It's also      also 

01:08:36.596 --> 01:08:39.531
an entire eco     ecosystem of 
aps                  ecosystem 

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:41.428
of apps and services          
services.  But first I would 

01:08:41.429 --> 01:08:43.429
like to talk about why     why 
are we doing this.  So this is 

01:08:44.472 --> 01:08:49.399
   is natural         natural 
photo of our field research.  

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:51.741
This driver is trying        
trying to catch Pokemons  

01:08:51.812 --> 01:08:53.801
        Pokemons while at the 
wheel and you can see the family

01:08:53.802 --> 01:08:55.649
 crossing          crossing in 
the background            

01:08:55.650 --> 01:08:56.337
background.  Don't  
                  background.  

01:08:56.338 --> 01:08:57.872
Don't worry       worry, 
everybody is safe      safe.  

01:08:57.873 --> 01:09:00.223
This is    is not a stock image 
      image.  This is    is our 

01:09:00.224 --> 01:09:02.800
researchers             
researchers in the car with the 

01:09:02.801 --> 01:09:06.097
drivers out on the roads       
roads.  Now if    if this is 

01:09:06.098 --> 01:09:07.450
happening           happening 
with our researchers            

01:09:07.451 --> 01:09:13.918
 researchers in the vehicle.  
Our internal research shows  

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.211
     shows our people drivers 
want to stay connected          

01:09:17.212 --> 01:09:19.217
 connected and they may resort 
to use their phones        

01:09:19.218 --> 01:09:21.728
phones to do so and that can 
lead to situations that are     

01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:23.123
are fundamental             
fundamentally unsafe        

01:09:23.124 --> 01:09:25.916
unsafe.  We want to help drivers
 stay connected           

01:09:25.917 --> 01:09:27.637
connected with interfaces that 
are safe      safe and 

01:09:27.638 --> 01:09:29.952
predictable             
predictable.  So I want to talk 

01:09:29.953 --> 01:09:31.802
about       about three things 
       things here.  First, why

01:09:31.803 --> 01:09:34.535
     why it's complex to design 
services          services for 

01:09:34.536 --> 01:09:37.118
the car.  What Android is    is 
doing to help as a platform then

01:09:37.259 --> 01:09:39.559
      then, and finally         
finally what are the various 

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.776
ways you can integrate with 
Android auto as a developer 

01:09:43.972 --> 01:09:46.494
          developer.  Okay.  
What is    is making        

01:09:46.495 --> 01:09:49.483
making designing apps and 
services          services for 

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:51.507
the car specific, exciting   
       exciting but also      

01:09:51.508 --> 01:09:53.327
also challenging             
challenging?  Android is    is a

01:09:53.328 --> 01:09:54.853
 plample              is a 
platform          platform for 

01:09:54.854 --> 01:09:56.306
infotainment across        
across wide range of possible 

01:09:56.307 --> 01:09:58.467
surface         surfaces, shapes
        shapes, aspect        

01:09:58.468 --> 01:10:00.782
aspect ratio could be different 
density         densities, Fidel

01:10:00.909 --> 01:10:03.977
       Fidelitys.  A car 
interior is    is a meticulous  

01:10:04.489 --> 01:10:05.778
          meticulously crafted 
experience.  Everything is    is

01:10:05.779 --> 01:10:07.992
 optimize          optimized for
 safety        safety of course,

01:10:08.462 --> 01:10:10.448
         course, but also      
also to provide a specific 

01:10:10.449 --> 01:10:12.298
experience for each brand and 
price points        points.  

01:10:12.299 --> 01:10:15.708
Display         Displays can be 
       can be big, small, wide, 

01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:17.783
tall, integrated            
integrated or heads-        

01:10:17.784 --> 01:10:19.528
heads-up display         
displays.  Android is    is a 

01:10:19.529 --> 01:10:20.639
plample              is a 
platform          platform that 

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:26.103
support all of this along with 
the outputs, the input methods  

01:10:26.295 --> 01:10:28.983
       methods are multiple as 
well.  Touch screens         

01:10:28.984 --> 01:10:32.321
screens are more common in the 
car, but inputs such      such 

01:10:32.322 --> 01:10:34.612
as rotary        rotary and 
touch pads can be        can be 

01:10:34.613 --> 01:10:37.183
found as well.         well.  
Android is    is a platform 

01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:39.482
         platform that      that
 supports that as well. 

01:10:42.598 --> 01:10:43.187
      well.  
Safety          

01:10:43.188 --> 01:10:45.396
Safety of course is    is our 
priority          priority.  We 

01:10:45.397 --> 01:10:47.675
work really hard to reduce 
driver disstruks  

01:10:48.115 --> 01:10:51.245
                driver 
distraction, visual distraction,

01:10:51.432 --> 01:10:53.718
 manual and cognitive           
cognitive distraction.  

01:10:53.798 --> 01:10:55.557
              distraction.  Our 
internal research team works  

01:10:55.558 --> 01:10:57.612
     works closely         
closely with the broader        

01:10:57.741 --> 01:10:59.575
 broader team to strengthen 
              to strengthen 

01:10:59.576 --> 01:11:00.878
understanding               
understanding of driver-        

01:11:00.879 --> 01:11:02.879
 driver-vehicle                
driver-vehicle interaction.  And

01:11:03.731 --> 01:11:08.563
 so to get our feature         
feature developments, our team 

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:09.777
conduct research studies        
 studies the needs       needs 

01:11:09.778 --> 01:11:11.555
assessment            
assessment, usability           

01:11:11.556 --> 01:11:12.749
usability evaluations 
            evaluations 

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:14.184
quantitative              
quantitative survey        

01:11:14.185 --> 01:11:15.919
surveys and formal        formal
 driver distraction tefl  

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.522
                       driver 
distraction testing         

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:18.933
testing as well.  A positive 
working         working 

01:11:18.934 --> 01:11:21.826
relationship with 
                  relationship 

01:11:21.827 --> 01:11:25.135
with external organization and 
stays up to date with standards 

01:11:25.136 --> 01:11:27.010
so we do all that.  So partners 
         partners and developer

01:11:27.011 --> 01:11:30.385
           developers don't have
 to do it.  So you can see     

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:31.989
see our driving         driving 
simulator is    is an expense

01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:38.314
 ive           expensive set    
 setup tha      up that 

01:11:38.315 --> 01:11:41.193
simulates driving conditions 
           conditions.  We use 

01:11:41.194 --> 01:11:43.310
it for many things including 
          including detection 

01:11:43.655 --> 01:11:44.542
          detection response 
task      task which is    is 

01:11:44.543 --> 01:11:47.673
one way we use to evaluate 
cognitive loads       loads.  We

01:11:47.674 --> 01:11:50.788
 also      also use it for eye 
tracking          tracking.  You

01:11:50.789 --> 01:11:59.271
 can see     see.  And we use 
the glasses to see     see the 

01:11:59.272 --> 01:12:00.523
driver focusing          
focusing on the road and 

01:12:00.524 --> 01:12:03.465
glancing          glancing at 
the UI.  What I would like to 

01:12:03.466 --> 01:12:05.382
say it's a complex and expense 
ive           expensive endeavor

01:12:05.383 --> 01:12:07.383
          endeavor and we are 
doing all that so our partners 

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:08.902
         partners and drivers 
don't have to worry       worry 

01:12:08.903 --> 01:12:10.903
so much about       about it. 

01:12:14.591 --> 01:12:18.046
 Okay.  So now on to what 
Android is    is doing to add 

01:12:18.047 --> 01:12:21.138
developer           developers. 
 So like we said earlier        

01:12:21.139 --> 01:12:23.144
 earlier, we know drivers want 
to stay connected           

01:12:23.145 --> 01:12:26.898
connected and want to have them
      them with interfaces that 

01:12:26.899 --> 01:12:28.815
are safe      safe and 
predictable             

01:12:28.816 --> 01:12:30.837
predictable.  The content
         content, the context 

01:12:30.838 --> 01:12:33.895
and the fluid nature of digital 
services          services can 

01:12:33.896 --> 01:12:35.896
make that a challenge.  The 
content         content of in-

01:12:35.926 --> 01:12:38.084
     in-car infotainment used  
    used to be more predictable 

01:12:38.515 --> 01:12:40.451
            predictable.  Now we
 find we are designing          

01:12:40.452 --> 01:12:42.910
 designing a system that is    
is red toy safe      safely 

01:12:42.911 --> 01:12:45.456
bring into cars the services 
         services that we know 

01:12:45.457 --> 01:12:48.638
and use on platform          
platforms and that we like as 

01:12:48.639 --> 01:12:50.519
well.  Android is    is a great 
platform          platform for 

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.029
modern        modern digital 
services          services, on 

01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:55.013
phones        phones, atablets 
         atablets, on    on TVs 

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:57.998
    TVs, on wearables and now we
 are bringing          bringing 

01:12:57.999 --> 01:13:03.288
that to cars as well.  The key 
to adapt quickly         quickly

01:13:03.715 --> 01:13:05.624
 and efficiently             
efficiently to the widedy ters 

01:13:05.625 --> 01:13:08.489
            wide diversity is   
 is modularity            

01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:10.081
modularity.  Android is    is ab
 straking          straking away

01:13:10.082 --> 01:13:12.644
      away                     
is abstracting             

01:13:12.645 --> 01:13:15.323
abstracting away      away the 
inputs or outputting            

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:16.539
outputs so developer           
developers don't have to worry 

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:19.235
about       about screen shapes
        shapes or size      

01:13:19.236 --> 01:13:20.752
sizes or weather         weather
 something is    is touch or 

01:13:20.753 --> 01:13:23.051
rotary        rotary.  Android
         Android provides an in-

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:25.323
     in-car platform          
platform so divide        

01:13:25.324 --> 01:13:26.894
            platform so 
developer           developers 

01:13:26.895 --> 01:13:30.608
can focus on building          
building innovative apps without

01:13:30.609 --> 01:13:34.519
 worrying about       about the 
details       details. 

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.033
One way Android         Android 
does the heavy lifting         

01:13:36.034 --> 01:13:37.728
lifting for developer           
developers is    is through 

01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:38.938
templates           templates. 
             templates.  We've 

01:13:38.939 --> 01:13:40.996
designed          designed a 
system that enable automotive 

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.663
           automotive grade 
templates t             

01:13:43.664 --> 01:13:45.647
templates.  Those templates   
        templates are designed 

01:13:45.648 --> 01:13:48.705
         designed to    to 
accommodate a variety of 

01:13:48.706 --> 01:13:51.411
regulatory concerns          
concerns.  Like I don't have to 

01:13:51.412 --> 01:13:53.003
worry about       about what is
    is the size      size tap 

01:13:53.004 --> 01:13:55.192
targets         targets or how 
many      many items can be 

01:13:55.274 --> 01:13:57.764
       can be display         
displayed on one screen in a 

01:13:57.765 --> 01:14:01.438
country or region.  We take care
 of that.  Another way we make 

01:14:01.439 --> 01:14:04.563
Android a predictable  
           predictable 

01:14:04.564 --> 01:14:06.539
experience is    is with apps.  
Although          Although 

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:09.396
powerful          powerful, the 
app grid is    is not the most 

01:14:09.473 --> 01:14:10.734
     most suitable          
suitable metaphor for the 

01:14:10.735 --> 01:14:12.364
automotive            automotive
 space.  We've identified 

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:13.956
           identified           
 identified the key areas       

01:14:13.957 --> 01:14:16.307
areas for the car and made it 
easy to switch between them     

01:14:16.308 --> 01:14:18.846
 them.  And it's not only in our
 own Android Auto platform 

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.457
         platform.  You can see 
this today       today for 

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:23.758
example in the best      best in
 class systems designed         

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.799
 designed by our partners  
        partners Audi      Audi 

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.761
and Volvo       Volvo be sure to
 check out the demo      demo s

01:14:28.844 --> 01:14:31.593
        demos right outside.  
Here the most      most commonly

01:14:31.865 --> 01:14:33.666
 used      used functions 
          functions are elevated

01:14:33.667 --> 01:14:35.331
          elevated so drivers 
can quickly         quickly and 

01:14:35.332 --> 01:14:37.370
safe      safely switch between 
them      them without having to

01:14:37.371 --> 01:14:39.966
 make their       their way to 
an           way to an app grid 

01:14:41.133 --> 01:14:44.374
     grid.  We also      also 
want the experience to feel 

01:14:44.375 --> 01:14:46.984
personal and tailored          
tailored.  We work hard to make 

01:14:46.985 --> 01:14:48.375
sure that Android understands 
            understands when a 

01:14:48.376 --> 01:14:51.052
driver is    is in the car and 
can optimize itself        

01:14:51.053 --> 01:14:54.421
itself to safely        safely 
bring the driver's apps and 

01:14:54.422 --> 01:14:57.205
services          services.  
Android is already built-       

01:14:57.206 --> 01:14:59.948
 built-in with multiuser 
support.  It's been a few years

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:02.244
       years now and we are 
fully leverage ing            

01:15:02.245 --> 01:15:03.104
leveraging this framework 
          framework in the 

01:15:03.105 --> 01:15:05.106
vehicle         vehicle to 
enable frictionless             

01:15:05.303 --> 01:15:05.759
 frictionless personalization 
                personalization.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.753
  We want to get to the point 
where a driver can step into a 

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:11.836
rental        rental car and 
have an experience that is    is

01:15:11.837 --> 01:15:12.737
 personalize             
personalized and ready       

01:15:12.738 --> 01:15:17.903
ready to drive.      
Now on to the last      last 

01:15:17.904 --> 01:15:20.366
portion.  What are the different
 ways that you can bring your 

01:15:20.367 --> 01:15:22.389
app or service into cars. 

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.661
 Android          .  Prauf 
             cars.  

01:15:27.662 --> 01:15:29.520
Android is    is a common 
platform          platform that 

01:15:29.521 --> 01:15:30.410
millions of developer           
developers already         

01:15:30.411 --> 01:15:32.411
already know how to build for.  
If you are already invest       

01:15:33.721 --> 01:15:35.788
 invested in the Android        
 Android ecodemocrat            

01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:38.810
 ecosystem, we want to make 
things        things easy for 

01:15:38.811 --> 01:15:40.452
you.  Android         Android as
 a platform          platform 

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:41.785
does the heavy lifting         
lifting and provides          

01:15:41.786 --> 01:15:44.876
provides a set of tools       
tools and API     APIs to 

01:15:44.877 --> 01:15:47.367
integrate easily with the car.  
Our goal is    is to have      

01:15:47.368 --> 01:15:48.738
have one sinl               have
 one single platform          

01:15:48.739 --> 01:15:50.309
platform across        across 
every car.  Let's look      look

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:53.886
 at that in more details.    
      details.  

01:15:53.887 --> 01:15:56.307
We want to be respectful of the 
       of the time and resources

01:15:56.308 --> 01:15:58.767
 developer           developers 
commit to bring their       

01:15:58.768 --> 01:16:00.703
their app and services          
services to the car.  That's why

01:16:00.704 --> 01:16:03.574
     why there are multiple ways
 you can integrate with Android 

01:16:03.575 --> 01:16:04.956
Auto      Auto.  Depending 
          Depending on the 

01:16:04.957 --> 01:16:09.014
nature of your service, of 
course.  For a few of those apps

01:16:09.281 --> 01:16:10.495
 it will require         require
 a lot more effort        

01:16:10.496 --> 01:16:12.417
effort, a lot more design time 
and possibly          possibly 

01:16:12.418 --> 01:16:14.164
more cost      cost as well.  
       well.  But for most of 

01:16:14.165 --> 01:16:18.703
the        of the app, it will 
be         will be less time 

01:16:18.704 --> 01:16:21.321
involved          involved.  
What we call full apps are 

01:16:21.322 --> 01:16:23.918
services          services that 
are full control of what is    

01:16:23.919 --> 01:16:25.811
is display         displayed on 
the screen.  I would take an 

01:16:25.812 --> 01:16:33.064
example         example here n 
       here.  Google maps  

01:16:33.285 --> 01:16:37.308
  Maps is using dynamic         
dynamic s           dynamics, 

01:16:37.309 --> 01:16:40.048
bringing          bringing a 
full app experience

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:46.944
 necessity a huge      huge 
amount of human and technical 

01:16:46.945 --> 01:16:48.659
          technical resources.  
You have to think about       

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:50.676
about tap target size      size,
 contrast          contrast, 

01:16:50.677 --> 01:16:54.167
type size      size, day and 
night mode, all of these things 

01:16:54.168 --> 01:16:56.864
require         require full 
testing         testing 

01:16:56.865 --> 01:16:58.558
capability            
capabilities to ensure        

01:16:58.559 --> 01:17:01.090
ensure the app is    is up to 
the standards regarding 

01:17:01.272 --> 01:17:02.736
          regarding driver 
distraction             

01:17:02.737 --> 01:17:05.442
distraction.  Waze        
            distraction.  

01:17:05.443 --> 01:17:05.772
Waze 
                   distraction. 

01:17:07.408 --> 01:17:09.950
 example of full app control. 

01:17:13.491 --> 01:17:16.026
 Not all the apps              
all the aps             all the 

01:17:16.027 --> 01:17:18.639
apps      apps are application 
though        though.  We've 

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.456
create        created a set of 
templates           templates 

01:17:20.457 --> 01:17:22.287
that safe      safely offer 
      offer all the functional 

01:17:22.288 --> 01:17:23.733
           functionalities in a 
simple        simple, 

01:17:23.734 --> 01:17:25.734
predictable             
predictable and safe manner  

01:17:25.793 --> 01:17:28.055
      manner.  Here I would like
 to give      give the example 

01:17:28.056 --> 01:17:30.056
of the

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:33.600
 Audi      Audi sport concept 
that is    is on demo      demo 

01:17:33.601 --> 01:17:37.105
as well.  You can see our Audi 
     Audi elegant         

01:17:37.106 --> 01:17:39.106
elegantly implemented

01:17:40.334 --> 01:17:43.465
 the API     API that they can 
use to bring their       their 

01:17:43.466 --> 01:17:47.465
media Alfons Pfaller into cars. 
 The template          template 

01:17:47.466 --> 01:17:49.466
are working         working on 
screen density         densities

01:17:49.712 --> 01:17:53.064
 and inputs and they are retion 
       retionly tested for 

01:17:53.065 --> 01:17:54.954
driver distraction.  And the 
thing is    is all of the       

01:17:54.955 --> 01:17:56.955
 of the application that are 
already         already working 

01:17:57.057 --> 01:17:59.363
        working with an drud 
             with Android Auto

01:17:59.598 --> 01:18:04.374
      Auto for your car screen 
and for your phone screen, they 

01:18:04.375 --> 01:18:06.436
are working         working here
 as well without extra work from

01:18:06.666 --> 01:18:08.784
      from our developer  
         developers.  And you 

01:18:08.785 --> 01:18:13.604
can see media braus             
media browse        browse and 

01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:18.021
you can find your con tekt      
tekt easily and safe      

01:18:18.022 --> 01:18:20.022
safely. 

01:18:21.146 --> 01:18:22.741
        safely.  
Messaging is    is one of the 

01:18:22.742 --> 01:18:26.998
       of the major use cases in
 the car.  For SMS but also 

01:18:26.999 --> 01:18:28.804
WhatsApp          WhatsApp or 
Facebook          Facebook or 

01:18:28.805 --> 01:18:30.505
Allo, the integration is 
               integration with 

01:18:30.506 --> 01:18:32.629
auto is simple        simple and
 based on Android         

01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:33.345
Android notification 
             notifications.  All

01:18:33.346 --> 01:18:36.444
 that is    is necessary is    
is to integrate with our car 

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:38.992
extend        extender object to
 enable safe      safe, voice- 

01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:39.980
       voice-centric  
             voice-centric 

01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:41.537
messaging           messaging 
experience for users       

01:18:41.538 --> 01:18:46.891
users.  This is    is an example
 of the        of the media 

01:18:46.892 --> 01:18:50.189
station.  Here you can see 
WhatsApp          WhatsApp 

01:18:50.190 --> 01:18:56.021
notification showing         
showing up.  Which is    is 

01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:57.594
working safe      safe and 
predictable             

01:18:57.595 --> 01:18:59.669
predictable on a phone that is  
  is mounted         mounted on 

01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:01.670
the dashboard           
dashboard of your car. 

01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:07.134
 For WhatsApp          WhatsApp 
you can meek  

01:19:07.135 --> 01:19:08.826
                     WhatsApp 
you can make it work and that is

01:19:08.827 --> 01:19:10.716
    is working         working 
for touch but also      also 

01:19:10.717 --> 01:19:16.394
focused-          focused-based 
system.  Another way to 

01:19:16.395 --> 01:19:18.341
integrate with auto    Auto is 
   is through the Google 

01:19:18.342 --> 01:19:21.097
Assistant           Assistant.  
Assistant-            

01:19:21.098 --> 01:19:22.140
Assistant-base ed   d apps      
apps and services          

01:19:22.141 --> 01:19:24.141
services are inherent          
inherently cross-platform    

01:19:24.142 --> 01:19:25.397
            cross-platform and 
their       their voice-        

01:19:25.398 --> 01:19:26.591
voice-centric               
voice-centric nature makes them 

01:19:26.592 --> 01:19:28.442
     them ideally         
ideally suited for in-     

01:19:28.443 --> 01:19:30.692
in-car use.  The next present
         presenter is    is 

01:19:30.693 --> 01:19:32.910
going to talk more about       
about that so I will not explain

01:19:33.977 --> 01:19:37.842
 it in more detail        detail
 here.       here.  

01:19:37.843 --> 01:19:40.159
So that'            
So that's what we are working  

01:19:40.356 --> 01:19:45.746
       working hard on to enable

Auto      Auto team.  I'm     
I'm here to tell you about      

01:20:15.587 --> 01:20:19.174
 about how you the #2k68       
#2k68ers can engage with users 

01:20:19.175 --> 01:20:22.049
in the car.  See if    if this 
scenario sounds        sounds 

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.157
familiar.  You're        You're 
running         running late for

01:20:23.158 --> 01:20:26.142
 work and     and you rush out 
the door.  On your drive you 

01:20:26.143 --> 01:20:28.143
think back to yourself          
yourself, did     did I actually

01:20:28.607 --> 01:20:30.729
          actually lock the 
front door?  Wouldn't          

01:20:30.730 --> 01:20:32.273
Wouldn't it be awesome         
awesome if you could       could

01:20:32.274 --> 01:20:36.974
 talk to your car and say okay
    Okay Google, did     did I 

01:20:36.975 --> 01:20:39.500
lock the door?  Or maybe on that
 same commute you're        

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.501
you're thinking          
thinking, what meters  

01:20:41.517 --> 01:20:42.936
                     thinking, 
what meeting         meetings am

01:20:42.937 --> 01:20:45.387
 I               meetings am I
      am I actually          

01:20:45.388 --> 01:20:47.661
actually rushing         rushing
 to or I better not forget 

01:20:48.072 --> 01:20:50.674
       forget to buy milk before
 I go home.  It would be great 

01:20:50.675 --> 01:20:53.046
if you could       could talk to
 your car and say what's my next

01:20:53.047 --> 01:20:56.389
 meeting         meeting or 
remind me to buy milk before I 

01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:57.686
go home.         home.  These 
are all things        things 

01:20:57.687 --> 01:20:59.687
that the Google Assistant 
          Assistant can help you

01:20:59.819 --> 01:21:01.605
 with.  And more important 
          importantly, you as 

01:21:01.606 --> 01:21:03.606
the developer           
developer can make your services

01:21:03.851 --> 01:21:04.961
          services available is 
to                          

01:21:04.962 --> 01:21:07.655
services available via     via 
the assistant           

01:21:07.656 --> 01:21:11.512
assistant.            assistant.

01:21:11.513 --> 01:21:13.525
As AG as mentioned before, voice
 input is    is critical 

01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:15.532
         critical in the car.  
For safety reasons         

01:21:15.533 --> 01:21:18.265
reasons, we want to make sure 
the users       users cape their

01:21:18.507 --> 01:21:22.061
       their eyes on the road 
and hands on the wheel.  While 

01:21:22.062 --> 01:21:24.948
the users are on this journey 
        journey, we want to make

01:21:25.082 --> 01:21:27.431
 sure the user stays connected 
          connected.  They can 

01:21:27.432 --> 01:21:32.742
get things        things done, 
and stay entertained.  The 

01:21:32.743 --> 01:21:35.239
Google Assistant           
Assistant can provide that 

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:37.976
intelligent             
intelligent and conversational 

01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:42.403
voice as we move from      from 
a mobile first to an AI first 

01:21:42.404 --> 01:21:45.362
world.  We want it to be the 
ultimate copilot         copilot

01:21:45.363 --> 01:21:49.173
 for the user in the car.  Users
       Users are spending 

01:21:49.174 --> 01:21:51.669
precious          precious time 
in the car, and we're making

01:21:52.145 --> 01:21:53.585
        making the assistant
           assistant help the 

01:21:53.586 --> 01:21:55.778
user complete the mission and 
make the journey         journey

01:21:56.817 --> 01:22:00.543
 fun.      fun.  
With the feature         feature

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:04.931
 called my  My day   Day, you 
can say okay Google, tell me 

01:22:04.932 --> 01:22:07.547

the assistant         Assistant 

01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:10.123
will tell you about       about 
upcoming          upcoming 

01:22:10.124 --> 01:22:12.912
calendar events, reminders, 
commute traffic so you can hit 

01:22:12.913 --> 01:22:17.028
the ground running         
running when you get to work.  

01:22:17.029 --> 01:22:18.627
On the road, your assistant 
          assistant can tell you

01:22:18.628 --> 01:22:21.265

 you need to make a pit stop.  

01:22:27.730 --> 01:22:29.296
     stop.  
If you're           

01:22:29.297 --> 01:22:31.297
If you're board you can ask     
ask

                and podcasts 

01:22:38.544 --> 01:22:41.978
         podcasts.  We know that
 staying         staying 

01:22:41.979 --> 01:22:45.179
connected is very 
important           important 

01:22:41.979 --> 01:22:43.460
for users       users on the 
road, so we make calling        

01:22:43.461 --> 01:22:46.498
 calling and messaging          
 messaging easy with voice 

01:22:46.499 --> 01:22:50.031
actions like call mom, send a 
kwhaes               send a 

01:22:50.032 --> 01:22:52.348
WhatsApp          WhatsApp 
message or read my messages 

01:22:53.516 --> 01:22:55.516
         messages. 

01:22:57.299 --> 01:22:59.174
          messages.  
Many of these experiences are 

01:22:59.175 --> 01:23:00.108
only possible because         
because developer           

01:23:00.109 --> 01:23:01.928
developers like you have 
implemented             

01:23:01.929 --> 01:23:03.921
implemented the right API     
APIs.  So thank you for helping 

01:23:03.922 --> 01:23:06.922
us    us create        create 
that great user experience. 

01:23:12.572 --> 01:23:15.521
            experience.  
Since the assistant is    is 

01:23:15.522 --> 01:23:18.476
cross-        cross-surface 
              cross-surface   

01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:20.485
            cross-surface, it 
will help the user get things 

01:23:20.486 --> 01:23:23.090
       things done, whenever thr
              whenever they are.

01:23:23.091 --> 01:23:26.169
  In the home and on the go.  
Patrick           

01:23:26.170 --> 01:23:27.895
Patrick and AJ    AJ have talked
 about       about messaging  

01:23:27.896 --> 01:23:29.688
         messaging and media aps
               and media apps 

01:23:29.689 --> 01:23:35.153
     apps for integrating    
         integrating with auto 

01:23:35.398 --> 01:23:37.177
     auto, the template         
 templated and notification 

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:39.392
             notifications apps 
     apps in AJ    AJ's pyramid

01:23:39.569 --> 01:23:42.796
         pyramid that want to 
show a UI.  There are tons of 

01:23:42.797 --> 01:23:44.875
other aps     aps that don't 
fall under these 

01:23:44.876 --> 01:23:47.034
category          categories.  
How can you as a developer 

01:23:47.115 --> 01:23:48.880
          developer get your 
experience in the car without 

01:23:48.881 --> 01:23:50.598
having to deal with      with 
the complexity            

01:23:50.599 --> 01:23:52.599
complexity of building          
building a full automotive 

01:23:52.871 --> 01:23:55.320
           automotive app and 
having to accommodate different 

01:23:55.321 --> 01:23:57.261
screen size      sizes, various 
inputs        inputs and out 

01:23:57.262 --> 01:24:00.924
puts      puts?                 
and out     outputting 

01:24:01.246 --> 01:24:02.543
           outputs?  
If      

01:24:02.544 --> 01:24:04.194
If your service can be        
can be voice-        

01:24:04.195 --> 01:24:06.045
voice-centric               
voice-centric in the car and you

01:24:06.046 --> 01:24:07.233
 want a lightweight      weight 
integration             

01:24:07.234 --> 01:24:09.234
integration for reaching     
     reaching these users 

01:24:10.958 --> 01:24:15.224
      users, then      then the 
Google Assistant is    is a good

01:24:10.958 --> 01:24:11.889
 option.  How do you build for 
the Google Assistant           

01:24:11.890 --> 01:24:14.475
Assistant?            Assistant?

01:24:14.476 --> 01:24:16.699
Actions On Google is    is the 
platform          platform for 

01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:17.803
developer           developers 
to build for the Google 

01:24:17.804 --> 01:24:20.096
Assistant           Assistant.  
The platform              The 

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:22.097
platform          platform will 
allow       allow developer 

01:24:22.476 --> 01:24:24.057
          developers to reach 
users wherever          wherever

01:24:24.058 --> 01:24:26.084
 the assistant is    is 
available.  The platform  

01:24:26.263 --> 01:24:27.913
        platform uses cloud 
execution           execution so

01:24:27.914 --> 01:24:31.818
 users       users don't need to
 pre-      pre-install any app 

01:24:31.819 --> 01:24:34.146
when they ask     ask for your 
service by name, you'll be 

01:24:34.147 --> 01:24:36.817
connected           connected 
immediate ly              

01:24:36.818 --> 01:24:38.818
immediately.  Many developer 
          developers are already

01:24:38.948 --> 01:24:41.614
         already building
          building for Actions 

01:24:41.615 --> 01:24:42.413
On Google        Google.  When 
building          building for 

01:24:42.414 --> 01:24:44.672
Actions On Google        Google,
 there are     are three key 

01:24:44.673 --> 01:24:47.887
pieces that need to be defined 
by the developer           

01:24:47.888 --> 01:24:49.566
developer.  Invocation 
           Invocation triggers 

01:24:49.567 --> 01:24:50.502
         triggers, dialogs 
                  triggers, 

01:24:50.503 --> 01:24:53.141
dialog        dialog, and 
fulfillment             

01:24:53.142 --> 01:24:56.649
fulfillment.  Let me illustrate 
with an example         example.

01:24:56.650 --> 01:24:59.298
  I like coding        coding 
and I like fortune cookie       

01:24:59.710 --> 01:25:02.072
 cookies.  So I want to build a 
service that gives       gives 

01:25:02.073 --> 01:25:04.073
me a daily            me a daily
 dose of coding 

01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:08.452
       coding fortune 
cookie        cookies.    

01:25:08.453 --> 01:25:09.576
      cookies.  
So the first step is    is I 

01:25:09.577 --> 01:25:11.785
needed        needed to find my 
invocation            invocation

01:25:11.786 --> 01:25:15.264
 trigger         trigger.  How 
does the user connect to my 

01:25:15.265 --> 01:25:16.432
service?            service?  
What do         What do they 

01:25:16.433 --> 01:25:19.208
actually          actually have 
to say?  In this case I'll make 

01:25:19.209 --> 01:25:20.827
it simple        simple, 
whenever          whenever the 

01:25:20.828 --> 01:25:24.652
use     use arer says talking 
        talking coding        

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:25.794
coding fortune cookie        
cookie, then      then the 

01:25:25.795 --> 01:25:27.306
Google Assistant           
Assistant will connect the user 

01:25:27.307 --> 01:25:30.171
to my service.  
The next step is    is dialogs 

01:25:30.818 --> 01:25:32.136
        dialogs.  So once the 
user is    is connected  

01:25:32.137 --> 01:25:35.451
         connected to my 
service, how do I talk to them 

01:25:36.582 --> 01:25:38.205
     them?  What kind of 
information am I asking        

01:25:38.206 --> 01:25:39.397
asking and what kind of 
responses           responses am

01:25:39.398 --> 01:25:43.967
 I      am I expecting          
 expecting?  What are valid 

01:25:44.042 --> 01:25:46.042
      valid responses           
responses and what are invalid 

01:25:46.224 --> 01:25:47.375
        invalid responses 
          responses?  In this 

01:25:47.376 --> 01:25:50.364
case I'm     I'm going make it a
 simple        simple question 

01:25:50.365 --> 01:25:53.290
do they want a Java      Java or
 a C + +  

01:25:53.865 --> 01:25:57.931
them?  What kind of information 
am I asking and what kind of 

01:25:53.865 --> 01:25:58.131
responses am I expecting?  What 
are valid responses and what are

01:25:53.865 --> 01:25:57.931
 invalid responses?  In this 
case I'm going make it a simple 

01:25:53.865 --> 01:25:54.480
question do they want a Java or 
a C + + fortune cookie        

01:25:54.481 --> 01:25:55.886
cookie.  So there are only two 
    two valid       valid 

01:25:55.887 --> 01:25:59.553
responseness              
responseness this case.  So 

01:25:59.554 --> 01:26:03.801
let's       let's suppose that 
the user picked Java      Java. 

01:26:04.006 --> 01:26:07.042
 We can move on to the third 
step which is    is fulfillment 

01:26:07.122 --> 01:26:08.253
            fulfillment.  For 
fulfillment             

01:26:08.254 --> 01:26:11.014
fulfillment I have all the 
information that I need, so how 

01:26:11.015 --> 01:26:13.015
do I go about       about 
committing            committing

01:26:13.221 --> 01:26:15.224
 that transaction or computing
           computing that action

01:26:15.466 --> 01:26:15.966
 on behalf of the 
                 on behalf of 

01:26:15.967 --> 01:26:18.488
the use er        user so in 
this case I'm     I'm going to 

01:26:18.489 --> 01:26:21.631
look      look in my bank of 
Java      Java fortunes and I'm 

01:26:21.702 --> 01:26:23.702
    I'm going to pick one out 
for today       today.  Random 

01:26:23.739 --> 01:26:26.526
       Random one.  
Today         

01:26:26.527 --> 01:26:30.724
Today's for               
Today's fortune says Codefucious

01:26:31.111 --> 01:26:33.215
             Codefucious says 
for true happiness           

01:26:33.216 --> 01:26:35.208
happiness, prefer interfaces 
over abstract          abstract 

01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:38.660
classes.  That's one I actually 
         actually use every day.

01:26:42.342 --> 01:26:47.076
Actions On Google        Google.
  The Google assistant          

01:26:47.346 --> 01:26:49.346
 assistant and Actions On Google
        Google are coming       

01:26:49.656 --> 01:26:51.672
 coming to Android Auto      
Auto and will open up a wide 

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:53.576
possibility             
possibility of use cases.  

01:26:53.577 --> 01:26:54.910
Agents and services that are 
built       built on top of the 

01:26:54.911 --> 01:26:58.873
platform will transfer          
transfer over.  If you think 

01:26:58.874 --> 01:27:00.831
that users       users will 
interact with your agent or 

01:27:00.832 --> 01:27:04.446
service            or service in
 the car, it's a good idea to 

01:27:04.447 --> 01:27:07.321
start thinking about       about
 what is    is the user 

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:10.649
experience that you want to 
build for that special context. 

01:27:12.143 --> 01:27:14.277
 One car-      car-specific 
consideration is    is safety 

01:27:14.502 --> 01:27:16.224
       safety and driver 
distraction             

01:27:16.225 --> 01:27:20.439
distraction.  How can you build 
a user experience that both 

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.976
minimize          minimizes 
driver distraction             

01:27:21.977 --> 01:27:23.940
distraction and alaw users      
 users to get things        

01:27:23.941 --> 01:27:28.950
things done and     and stay 
entertained.  

01:27:28.951 --> 01:27:30.361
Let's         
Let's think about potential 

01:27:30.362 --> 01:27:32.040
          potential use cases 
for engaging          engaging 

01:27:32.041 --> 01:27:35.735
with users       users in the 
car.  What is    is possible 

01:27:35.736 --> 01:27:37.736
here?   

01:27:39.828 --> 01:27:41.828
        here?  
One idea is    is reservations 

01:27:42.010 --> 01:27:42.525
             reservations.  It's
 a Friday        Friday night 

01:27:42.526 --> 01:27:44.123
and I'm     I'm meeting         
meeting up with my husband   

01:27:44.124 --> 01:27:45.866
      husband for dinner.  We 
pick out a restaurant           

01:27:45.867 --> 01:27:48.714
 restaurant and on the way there
 I would love to be able to say,

01:27:49.035 --> 01:27:52.341
 book a table, and have that 
table waiting for me by the time

01:27:52.593 --> 01:27:55.546
 I get there.  What would be 
even      even more awesome 

01:27:55.631 --> 01:27:57.871
        awesome and magical is 
if    if the Google Assistant 

01:27:58.097 --> 01:28:00.166
          Assistant and that 
third-party             

01:28:00.167 --> 01:28:03.114
third-party service can suggest 
a good reservation time that 

01:28:03.115 --> 01:28:06.850
takes       takes into account 
my location          location, 

01:28:06.851 --> 01:28:09.246
traffic, and maybe parking 
availability              

01:28:09.247 --> 01:28:13.423
availability.  So I make a make 
a reservation for a time I can 

01:28:13.424 --> 01:28:18.357
definitely make.       make.  
Another idea is    is food 

01:28:18.358 --> 01:28:19.718
ordering          ordering.  I'm
     I'm working         working

01:28:19.719 --> 01:28:23.470
 late on a week night and I'm 
too     too lazy to cook.  On my

01:28:23.471 --> 01:28:26.748
 way home I would love to be 
able to put in an order at my 

01:28:26.749 --> 01:28:28.471
favorite restaurant            
restaurant and have that food 

01:28:28.472 --> 01:28:31.011
delivered and arrived         
arrived at my home by the time I

01:28:31.012 --> 01:28:32.978
 get there.  Saves       Saves 
on time, saves       saves on 

01:28:32.979 --> 01:28:34.979
cooking         cooking. 

01:28:38.624 --> 01:28:39.934
 earlier, how many      many 
times have you driven        

01:28:39.935 --> 01:28:41.935
driven away from      from your 
house and can't remember whether

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:45.012
 you've actually locked        
locked the front door?  It would

01:28:45.013 --> 01:28:47.013
 be very 

01:28:48.551 --> 01:28:51.817
     very cool if you 
could       could say okay 

01:28:48.551 --> 01:28:52.002
Google, check my door.  Or did 
    did I lock my door?  Just 

01:28:52.003 --> 01:28:56.670
lock it.     it.  
Another one is lights        

01:28:56.671 --> 01:28:58.671
lights.  I'm driving         
driving home and I actually    

01:28:59.012 --> 01:29:01.246
      actually hate walking into
 a dark house.  I'm     I'm 

01:29:01.247 --> 01:29:06.187
actually          actually 
afraid of the dark.  It would be

01:29:06.188 --> 01:29:08.546
 great if from      from the car
 I could       could say turn on

01:29:08.904 --> 01:29:10.904
 my living room lights        
lights or turn on my dining 

01:29:11.053 --> 01:29:12.727
       dining room lights       
 lights and     and I never have

01:29:12.728 --> 01:29:16.657
 to walk into a dark house 
again.  

01:29:16.658 --> 01:29:18.658
Games         
Games

01:29:21.484 --> 01:29:25.684
 and entertainment              
 entertainment.  How many      

01:29:21.484 --> 01:29:25.550
many times have you been on long
 road trips       trips with 

01:29:21.484 --> 01:29:22.617
kids      kids where you 
struggle          struggle to 

01:29:22.618 --> 01:29:25.103
find a way to keep them      
them entertained?  Wouldn't 

01:29:25.176 --> 01:29:26.967
         Wouldn't it be awesome 
        awesome if you could 

01:29:26.968 --> 01:29:30.665
      could say okay Google, 
entertain my kids      kids and 

01:29:30.666 --> 01:29:32.283
have games that are     are age-
appropriate                 

01:29:32.284 --> 01:29:34.377
age-appropriate for different 
kids      kids so they can play 

01:29:34.378 --> 01:29:38.323
whatever they want.  They stay 
entertained and I can focus on 

01:29:38.324 --> 01:29:40.324
the road. 

01:29:42.368 --> 01:29:44.488
      road.  
These are just some ideas       

01:29:44.489 --> 01:29:46.397
ideas on ways developer 
          developers can engage 

01:29:46.398 --> 01:29:48.672
with users       users in the 
car.  I look      look forward 

01:29:48.673 --> 01:29:50.395
to what creative

ANDRE VALENTE:            
VALENTE:  Good afternoon 

01:48:16.277 --> 01:48:20.277
everyone          everyone.  
Welcome         Welcome to our 

01:48:16.277 --> 01:48:19.206
session on stand out on Google 
Search        Search with 

01:48:19.207 --> 01:48:22.171
structured data      data and 
search.  My name is    is Andre 

01:48:22.172 --> 01:48:23.864
Valente and this is Duncan 
Osborn        Osborn a product 

01:48:23.865 --> 01:48:25.421
manager         manager in 
search.  Thanks        Thanks 

01:48:25.422 --> 01:48:26.735
for joining us today       
today.  

01:48:26.736 --> 01:48:28.691
So the first thing       thing I
 want to do is give      give a 

01:48:28.692 --> 01:48:31.120
little bit of perspective 
            perspective as to 

01:48:31.121 --> 01:48:33.868
how we arrived         arrived 
at where we are by going a 

01:48:33.869 --> 01:48:35.813
little bit back to the evolution
           evolution of search. 

01:48:35.814 --> 01:48:41.780
 As you know Google's mission is
    is to organize the world's 

01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:43.781
information and make it 
accessible            accessible

01:48:43.836 --> 01:48:46.351
 and useful but how we are doing
 this is    is changing         

01:48:46.352 --> 01:48:48.352
 changing over

01:48:49.436 --> 01:48:51.007
 time.  Users are not satisfied 
          satisfied with us    

01:48:51.008 --> 01:48:53.549
us anymore a link to a possible 
answer.  They want us    us to 

01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:54.967
provide the answers whenever
          whenever possible and 

01:48:54.968 --> 01:48:56.881
help them      them navigate 
through the space of possible 

01:48:56.882 --> 01:48:58.854
answers         answers, the 
possible alternative            

01:48:58.855 --> 01:49:01.362
 alternatives.  And in fact you 
can see that many of our 

01:49:01.363 --> 01:49:02.979
products          products 
including           including of

01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:04.251
 course the assistance 
           assistance are having

01:49:04.252 --> 01:49:08.215
 the steam       steam of gool 
providing           providing 

01:49:08.216 --> 01:49:12.274
assistance            assistance
 to our users.  So before and in

01:49:12.539 --> 01:49:16.563
 fact until now what you have if
 you put a search like this     

01:49:16.659 --> 01:49:19.990
 this to recipes is    is    is 
a set of links that you can 

01:49:19.991 --> 01:49:22.082
explore, you can try out, and 
you have some snippets          

01:49:22.083 --> 01:49:24.410
snippets to try to give      
give you an idea of what is    

01:49:24.411 --> 01:49:25.483
is behind those links 
                   behind those 

01:49:25.484 --> 01:49:29.176
links       links.  The users 
      users that land on their  

01:49:29.286 --> 01:49:31.523
             land on your beige 
              on your page don't

01:49:31.730 --> 01:49:34.241
 have enough        enough 
context and it's not clear their

01:49:34.404 --> 01:49:37.756
       their intent.  We tried 
      tried to make this better 

01:49:37.757 --> 01:49:39.799
and we launch        launched 
the idea of Richards            

01:49:39.875 --> 01:49:42.531
 of rich cards       cards.  The
 idea is    is visual module 

01:49:42.624 --> 01:49:44.562
       modules that organize 
information about       about 

01:49:44.563 --> 01:49:48.119
what used      used to be a blue
 link in wha        in something

01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:50.111
 that is    is simpler         
simpler to read, easier        

01:49:50.112 --> 01:49:54.027
easier to navigate.  And these 
cars were sometimes           

01:49:54.028 --> 01:49:55.592
sometimes organized           
organized into carousel         

01:49:55.593 --> 01:49:59.813
 carousels like you see here so 
you can scroll        scroll 

01:49:59.814 --> 01:50:02.606
right       right or left to see
 visual answers         answers 

01:50:02.607 --> 01:50:04.546
to your query       query.  And 
now particularly in the last 

01:50:04.547 --> 01:50:07.578
     last year or so we have 
evolved even      even further 

01:50:07.579 --> 01:50:09.134
into this notion        notion 
of immersive           

01:50:09.135 --> 01:50:11.932
immersives.  These are sort f   
of mini applications 

01:50:12.181 --> 01:50:14.375
             applications you 
have where       where you can 

01:50:14.376 --> 01:50:16.382
explore a range of answers 
        answers.  Not only you 

01:50:16.383 --> 01:50:17.815
have the visual components 
           components but you 

01:50:17.816 --> 01:50:20.788
also      also have things 
       things like these step 

01:50:20.789 --> 01:50:23.140
targets         targets.  So you
 can find your query       query

01:50:23.482 --> 01:50:27.247
 and say not only do I      do I
 want a straw       strawberry 

01:50:27.248 --> 01:50:29.868
tart      tart recipe, I want 
someone         someone that is 

01:50:29.869 --> 01:50:35.673
glut      gluten        gluten 
free.  What happens heefr 

01:50:35.789 --> 01:50:37.324
                   What happens 
however is    is in addition 

01:50:37.325 --> 01:50:40.346
         addition to all the 
information that Google has in 

01:50:40.347 --> 01:50:42.347
its knowledge engine        
engine, what happens if    if we

01:50:42.515 --> 01:50:45.219
 use a lot of structure  
         structure third-party 

01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:47.791
structured data      data to 
power this.  And what that means

01:50:47.792 --> 01:50:49.157
 is    is that there's         
there's an opportunity 

01:50:49.158 --> 01:50:53.349
            opportunity for you.
  If          you.  If you have 

01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:55.843
a site where you have 
information you can try to 

01:50:55.844 --> 01:50:57.596
organize and optimize          
optimize its performance 

01:50:57.597 --> 01:50:59.713
            performance in such
      such a role that you can 

01:50:59.714 --> 01:51:02.734
participate in these features
          features.  What we 

01:51:02.735 --> 01:51:04.810
have found is    is that the 
sites       sites that implement

01:51:04.811 --> 01:51:06.506
 structured data      data 
typically           typically 

01:51:06.507 --> 01:51:10.042
see increased click-        
click-through-                

01:51:10.043 --> 01:51:11.269
click-through rates       rates 
and increased           

01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.966
increased engagement            
engagement.  In other words

01:51:11.967 --> 01:51:14.132
       words, the users       
users that come to you     you 

01:51:14.133 --> 01:51:16.740
are better users       users.  
So, for example here is    is 

01:51:16.741 --> 01:51:20.819
one use case that we found.     
     found.  Rotten        

01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:22.820
Rotten tomato        tomatoes 
implemented structured data     

01:51:22.962 --> 01:51:25.248
 data in more than 1 hundred 
thousand                    

01:51:25.249 --> 01:51:27.598
100,000 pages.  But the most    
          But the more important

01:51:27.686 --> 01:51:28.826
                    the more 
interesting             

01:51:28.827 --> 01:51:31.448
interesting part is    is these 
pages resulted          resulted

01:51:31.449 --> 01:51:34.313
 in 25% % higher click-        
click-through rate compared  

01:51:34.423 --> 01:51:36.103
        compared with the rages 
they have that didn't        

01:51:36.104 --> 01:51:38.776
didn't have structured data     
 data.  In other words       

01:51:38.777 --> 01:51:41.908
words, you can do some good 
results         results for you.

01:51:41.909 --> 01:51:44.228
  Later       Later on we'll 
have more case studies         

01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:46.120
studies that will explain the 
details.  Now the remainder  

01:51:46.121 --> 01:51:48.121
         remainder of this talk 
we're going       going to teach

01:51:48.286 --> 01:51:50.120
 you how we can use structured 
data      data to optimize 

01:51:50.121 --> 01:51:51.794
         optimize          
optimize your site's performance

01:51:51.795 --> 01:51:53.703
             performance.  We're
 going to tell you how you can 

01:51:53.704 --> 01:51:57.165
use this to stand out, pick up 
the right mark      markup, and 

01:51:57.166 --> 01:51:58.663
how     how to measure         
measure the impact        impact

01:51:58.664 --> 01:52:03.010
 once you implement this.       
this.  

01:52:03.011 --> 01:52:08.345
Now next Duncan is    is going 
to talk to you about Google 

01:52:08.346 --> 01:52:10.132
Search        Search appears    
     appears and give      give 

01:52:10.133 --> 01:52:11.812
you more details.

Thanks        Thanks, Andre 

01:52:14.017 --> 01:52:16.535
      Andre.  Hi    Hi there, 
I'm Duncan Osborn.  I'm a 

01:52:16.536 --> 01:52:19.662
product manager         manager 
on search.           search.  

01:52:19.663 --> 01:52:21.273
So      
So Andre is    is going to get 

01:52:21.274 --> 01:52:23.627
into how you implement and 
measure structured data      

01:52:23.628 --> 01:52:25.902
data in just a second but tirs 
                second        

01:52:25.903 --> 01:52:27.573
second but first I thought
         thought we would go 

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:29.862
through the futures         
futures so you can see how it 

01:52:29.863 --> 01:52:31.955
appears         appears to users
       users and we will go 

01:52:31.956 --> 01:52:32.678
through the implementation
                implementation 

01:52:32.679 --> 01:52:37.091
later       later.  
So we have a broad set of 

01:52:37.092 --> 01:52:39.774
vertical          verticals 
          verticals that support

01:52:40.686 --> 01:52:44.435
 structured data      data in 
them      them.  There are a 

01:52:44.436 --> 01:52:46.709
fairly large vertical          
verticals and we have a good set

01:52:46.710 --> 01:52:48.541
 of partners          partners 
at each one so there's         

01:52:48.542 --> 01:52:50.167
there's a good base to learn 
from      from and we're 

01:52:50.168 --> 01:52:52.128
constant          constantly 
thinking          thinking of 

01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:55.539
new vertical          vertical s
            verticals. 

01:52:55.540 --> 01:53:01.419
So I chose just a couple of ways
 to    to show off a            

01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:03.981
show off.  Let's       Let's get
 started from      from recipes.

01:53:03.982 --> 01:53:05.545
  So this is    is a great 
example         example of a 

01:53:05.546 --> 01:53:07.314
vertical          vertical where
 we've invest        invested in

01:53:07.315 --> 01:53:08.113
 structured 
                       invested 

01:53:08.114 --> 01:53:09.392
in structured data      data 
features          features at 

01:53:09.393 --> 01:53:11.003
several levels        levels, 
naming                levels, 

01:53:11.004 --> 01:53:13.724
namely        namely the page 
level, the domain        domain 

01:53:13.725 --> 01:53:16.347
level and finally         
finally the result level.  So 

01:53:16.348 --> 01:53:21.209
I'll walk through each one of 
those.  It's dangerous to show 

01:53:21.210 --> 01:53:23.488
cookie        cookies at snack 
      snack time, but here we 

01:53:23.489 --> 01:53:25.445
go.  This is    is at page 
level.  In this case we've taken

01:53:25.446 --> 01:53:27.425
       taken all the recipe leaf
 results         results as we 

01:53:27.426 --> 01:53:31.613
kael            as we call them 
     them, which just means a 

01:53:31.614 --> 01:53:34.522
single recipe result and we 
assemble them      them into a 

01:53:34.523 --> 01:53:35.424
single carousel          
carousel at the top of the 

01:53:35.425 --> 01:53:36.662
       of the page which makes  
     makes it easier        

01:53:36.663 --> 01:53:40.026
easier for users       users to 
access all the recipes in one 

01:53:40.027 --> 01:53:42.027
single place and make their  
     their decision and finally 

01:53:42.057 --> 01:53:43.275
        finally land on the one 
they've         they've chosen

01:53:43.276 --> 01:53:45.972
        chosen.  You can see 
here we're feature ing several  

01:53:46.079 --> 01:53:47.360
       several different kinds  
     kinds of structured data  

01:53:47.361 --> 01:53:49.101
    data.  We have the rating 
       rating, the calorie 

01:53:49.102 --> 01:53:51.986
county                calorie 
count and the cook time.  All of

01:53:52.397 --> 01:53:54.460
 those are sourced directly from
      from the mark-       

01:53:54.461 --> 01:53:56.244
mark-up on the third-party 
            third-party site.  

01:53:56.245 --> 01:53:57.743
It's also important           
important to note that one click

01:53:57.744 --> 01:53:59.559
 away from      from this 
experience is    is another 

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:01.587
interface that we've even      
even more heavily         

01:54:01.588 --> 01:54:02.757
heavily optimize          
optimized for browse ing  

01:54:02.758 --> 01:54:04.155
        browsing large numbers 
        numbers of recipes in 

01:54:04.156 --> 01:54:08.585
this case.  And here again we're
 using       using the same 

01:54:08.586 --> 01:54:10.561
types       types of mark      
markup but we've just 

01:54:10.562 --> 01:54:14.125
restructured them      them so 
they fit better in the UX we've 

01:54:14.126 --> 01:54:16.206
cheesen         cheesen in this 
case.  One of the things 

01:54:16.207 --> 01:54:17.865
important           important 
we've seen several  

01:54:17.866 --> 01:54:19.599
                  we've seen 
several         several visual 

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.253
ramifications structure   
        structure here in terms 

01:54:21.254 --> 01:54:23.176
of rating        rating and 
calorie         calorie count, 

01:54:23.177 --> 01:54:24.721
but what's behind this 
experience is    is actually

01:54:24.722 --> 01:54:27.033
          actually the mark     
 markup at the page level which 

01:54:27.034 --> 01:54:30.103
tells us    us that it's a leaf 
     leaf result, a recipe page 

01:54:30.104 --> 01:54:31.881
so that allow       allows us   
 us to make decisions about 

01:54:31.882 --> 01:54:34.301
      about how we then present 
them      them to users       

01:54:34.302 --> 01:54:35.543
users.  So both kinds       
kinds are important           

01:54:35.544 --> 01:54:38.191
important, the signal and how we
 decorate that result for users 

01:54:38.290 --> 01:54:43.443
      users.  So that's at page 
level.  

01:54:43.444 --> 01:54:45.447
Now we move      move to domain 
       domain level.          

01:54:45.448 --> 01:54:47.448
level.  At this point we're 
assembling            assembling

01:54:47.685 --> 01:54:49.182
 all the results         results
 but the results that are     

01:54:49.183 --> 01:54:51.592
are in a single lifting         
            in a single listing 

01:54:51.696 --> 01:54:56.268
        listing page of recipes 
which comes from      from one 

01:54:56.269 --> 01:54:59.372
single page.  We now give      
give the site owner       owner 

01:54:59.373 --> 01:55:00.573
a single property for their 
      their content         

01:55:00.574 --> 01:55:05.450
content.  So once again       
again, we've all of the        

01:55:05.451 --> 01:55:07.802
of the content         content 
you see here, just in a smaller

01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:10.067
         smaller card format 
       format.  A good example 

01:55:10.068 --> 01:55:11.813
        example of how we're 
fairly flexible          

01:55:11.814 --> 01:55:13.091
flexible in how we display  
       display this data      

01:55:13.092 --> 01:55:14.675
data.  But the other interesting
             interesting point 

01:55:14.676 --> 01:55:20.831
here is    is that this list of 
content is    is custom miizable

01:55:21.813 --> 01:55:23.076
 both in contents and order.  
That gives       gives you a 

01:55:23.077 --> 01:55:25.432
very      very visible         
visible level of    of control 

01:55:25.433 --> 01:55:26.988
over how your results         
results appear        appear in 

01:55:26.989 --> 01:55:29.509
search, which is    is pretty 
cool.  

01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:30.954
Okay.  That's domain        
domain.  And finally         

01:55:30.955 --> 01:55:33.039
finally at the result level.  If
    If we have a result that 

01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:37.142
rank      ranks, it's just a   a
 single leaf      leaf page, we 

01:55:37.143 --> 01:55:40.095
won't          we won't just 
leave it as a blue link, we'll 

01:55:40.096 --> 01:55:43.239
use any data      data we have 
to decorate the results         

01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:44.835
results and also      also allow
       allows users       users 

01:55:44.836 --> 01:55:46.792
to make decisions directly on 
the search results         

01:55:46.793 --> 01:55:51.320
results page.       page.  
And the next one I wanted to 

01:55:51.321 --> 01:55:53.535
show you, moving        moving 
on from      from cookie        

01:55:53.536 --> 01:55:56.098
cookies to something to make you
 even      even hungry        

01:55:56.099 --> 01:55:58.094
hungrier is restaurants
                is restaurants 

01:55:58.095 --> 01:56:00.832
            restaurants in SF, 
which is    is what cool people 

01:56:00.833 --> 01:56:03.411
kal San Francisco           
Francisco.  So in this case we 

01:56:03.412 --> 01:56:05.270
again have the domain        
domain level results         

01:56:05.271 --> 01:56:06.733
results.  So    So we've taken 
      taken all the restaurants 

01:56:06.734 --> 01:56:08.848
that are     are in the listing 
        listing page and 

01:56:08.849 --> 01:56:10.136
assemble          assembled 
them      them into a carousel

01:56:10.137 --> 01:56:12.799
          carousel.  But what's 
interesting             

01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:14.765
interesting here in this case 
the site owner       owner has 

01:56:14.766 --> 01:56:16.004
only just provided          
provided the title       title 

01:56:16.005 --> 01:56:20.246
and we just shrink the card to 
adapt to that kind of data      

01:56:20.247 --> 01:56:21.612
data.       data.  
But       

01:56:21.613 --> 01:56:24.438
But in this case the site owner
       owner can also      also 

01:56:24.439 --> 01:56:26.595
add things        things like 
the cuisine         cuisine type

01:56:26.786 --> 01:56:27.741
 or the location for the 
restaurant            

01:56:27.742 --> 01:56:29.952
restaurant.  So it's generally a
 good idea to take a look      

01:56:29.953 --> 01:56:31.683
look at our developer           
developer guidelines            

01:56:31.684 --> 01:56:33.952
guidelines to see what's 
possible for a given data      

01:56:33.953 --> 01:56:36.629
data type and you can decide in 
that case how you want us    us 

01:56:36.630 --> 01:56:38.587
to render        render the 
cards       cards.  For example,

01:56:38.588 --> 01:56:40.265
 they could have also      also 
added ratings         ratings 

01:56:40.266 --> 01:56:42.188
and those would appear        
appear before the location and 

01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:45.457
the title       title.        
title.  

01:56:45.458 --> 01:56:47.696
And then      then one other 
point here when you're        

01:56:47.697 --> 01:56:49.911
you're doing domain        
domain level mark      markup, 

01:56:49.912 --> 01:56:50.745
you're        you're only affect
ing           affecting your 

01:56:50.746 --> 01:56:52.746
results         results.  We 
don't actually          actually

01:56:53.314 --> 01:56:54.470
 switch the results         
results.  

01:56:54.471 --> 01:56:56.225
So to burn off the calorie 
        calories we're now 

01:56:56.226 --> 01:56:58.226
moving        moving to running 
shoes       shoes and we're also

01:56:58.378 --> 01:57:00.433
 switching           switching 
to a different product.  In this

01:57:01.659 --> 01:57:04.097
 case, imagine               
case, image       image search. 

01:57:04.535 --> 01:57:06.320
 So here I went to the image 
      image search tab and I 

01:57:06.321 --> 01:57:09.739
searched          searched for 
Nike      Nike free

01:57:14.782 --> 01:57:18.933
 which is    is a shoe.  They're
         They're exploring 

01:57:19.005 --> 01:57:19.968
          exploring options 
        options and comparing 

01:57:19.969 --> 01:57:22.442
          comparing how they 
visually look      look.  But at

01:57:22.443 --> 01:57:25.324
 a certain point they want to 
move to the #30i7b9         

01:57:25.325 --> 01:57:27.874
#30i7b9 where they make a 
purchase.  There you need 

01:57:27.875 --> 01:57:29.798
additional            additional
 information as a buyer and that

01:57:29.799 --> 01:57:32.157
 is    is where structured data 
comes       comes in handy      

01:57:32.628 --> 01:57:36.634
 handy.  So here in this case 
we've included the price and the

01:57:36.635 --> 01:57:39.737
 rating        rating once I 
tapped on the shoe I wanted to 

01:57:39.738 --> 01:57:41.606
buy.  And of course there's 
        there's the link at the 

01:57:41.607 --> 01:57:43.338
bottom of the page that allow   
    allows me to visit       

01:57:43.339 --> 01:57:47.262
visit and eventually            
eventually purchase.           

01:57:47.365 --> 01:57:48.909
purchase.  
Great.  Let's       Let's wrap 

01:57:48.910 --> 01:57:51.498
up these example         
examples with a brand new 

01:57:51.499 --> 01:57:52.872
feature         feature that we 
launch        launched just 

01:57:52.873 --> 01:57:55.441
about       about a week ago.  
This is    is for events.  In 

01:57:55.442 --> 01:57:57.141
this case I searched          
searched for concerts          

01:57:57.142 --> 01:58:00.142
concerts in NYC where I live, 
and here at the top of the 

01:58:00.282 --> 01:58:02.424
       of the page we have a 
single box that assemble 

01:58:02.524 --> 01:58:04.039
         assembles all of the
        of the events for my 

01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:06.217
query       query.  So again 
we've assemble          

01:58:06.218 --> 01:58:07.904
assembled things        things 
but we rely on structured data

01:58:07.905 --> 01:58:09.596
      data to make this look 
     look good.  So much of the 

01:58:09.597 --> 01:58:14.774
data      data that we see here 
     here, the date, time, 

01:58:14.775 --> 01:58:16.250
location, and even      even the
 image       image are provided 

01:58:16.251 --> 01:58:17.741
         provided to us    us by
 the site owner       owner.  So

01:58:17.742 --> 01:58:20.651
 this is    is again one of 
these great features          

01:58:20.652 --> 01:58:22.495
features that we can provide to 
users       users based on the 

01:58:22.496 --> 01:58:25.699
data      data that we're able 
to share with publish         

01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:27.700
publishers. 

01:58:29.796 --> 01:58:31.796
            publishers.  
Andre is    is here      here to

01:58:31.814 --> 01:58:34.248
 walk you through how to 
implement all     all of this 

01:58:34.249 --> 01:58:36.173
mark      markup mvrnlths 
                markup. 

01:58:36.174 --> 01:58:37.485
ANDRE VALENTE:            
VALENTE:  Thank you.  I'm     

01:58:37.486 --> 01:58:39.424
I'm going to walk you through 
sort of the        of the 

01:58:39.425 --> 01:58:42.224
journey         journey of 
implementing              

01:58:42.225 --> 01:58:44.225
implementing this on your site, 
on your

01:58:46.659 --> 01:58:49.605
 property.  Before I do that, I 
want to highlight           

01:58:49.606 --> 01:58:52.835
highlight and piggy       piggy 
back on a couple of elements 

01:58:52.929 --> 01:58:54.558
         elements of what is 
strurt           is structured 

01:58:54.559 --> 01:58:56.114
data      data, what does it 
look      look like.  Most      

01:58:56.115 --> 01:58:57.748
Most of you are developers 
           developers, but just 

01:58:57.749 --> 01:59:02.507
in case.  You see here on the 
left side a specific card with a

01:59:02.954 --> 01:59:04.433
 helpspy and on the right side 
I'm     I'm going to highlight

01:59:04.434 --> 01:59:05.776
           highlight a few 
elements          elements so 

01:59:05.777 --> 01:59:09.396
you can see how they match.  You
 can see this is    is a script 

01:59:09.397 --> 01:59:12.164
tag in JSON-       JSON-LD and 
tit specifies           

01:59:12.165 --> 01:59:17.971
specifies this is    is a recipe
 according to schema        

01:59:17.972 --> 01:59:20.429
schema and each of the        of
 the property is    is going to 

01:59:20.430 --> 01:59:21.515
match components            
components that can go into the 

01:59:21.516 --> 01:59:25.810
cards       cards.  In this case
 this is    is a basic 

01:59:25.811 --> 01:59:28.872
quesadilla recipe becomes     
    becomes the title       

01:59:28.873 --> 01:59:31.575
title.  You see here as we 
continue more tags, the imagine 

01:59:31.576 --> 01:59:34.706
gives       gives you          
                   tags, image 

01:59:34.809 --> 01:59:36.646
            tags, the image 
      image we're going to 

01:59:36.647 --> 01:59:38.307
display         display and the 
description can give      give 

01:59:38.308 --> 01:59:40.308
you elements          elements 
we can use in the smip      smip

01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:44.635
                 use in the 
snippet         snippet.  

01:59:44.748 --> 01:59:45.900
        snippet.  
This is    is how you would 

01:59:45.901 --> 01:59:48.601
specify         specify an 
aggregate and translate the 

01:59:48.602 --> 01:59:50.885
information to the stars       
stars and the number of review 

01:59:50.994 --> 01:59:54.234
       reviews that you see on 
the left.  And then      then 

01:59:54.235 --> 01:59:57.017
timely, you here have the total 
time, the cooking         

01:59:57.018 --> 01:59:58.980
cooking time the 10 minutes as 
well as the number of calorie 

01:59:58.981 --> 02:00:03.998
        calories.  So the lesson
 learned hoor is    is         

02:00:04.107 --> 02:00:06.783
        learned here is    is 
each specific mark      markup, 

02:00:06.784 --> 02:00:10.062
in this case each recipe is    
is going to have its own 

02:00:10.063 --> 02:00:11.869
specification and you can see 
how they translate into the 

02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:15.506
elements of the        of the 
card.  This is    is sort of the

02:00:16.086 --> 02:00:17.404
 overall         overall journey
 of the        of the 

02:00:17.405 --> 02:00:18.702
implementation                
implementation process and we're

02:00:18.703 --> 02:00:21.961
 going to walk you through each 
element of it.  The first one 

02:00:21.962 --> 02:00:23.544
you want to identify          
identify the best      best mark

02:00:23.545 --> 02:00:26.344
      mark      markup match.  
Throughout            Throughout

02:00:26.522 --> 02:00:28.287
 this journey         journey I 
will talk about       about 

02:00:28.288 --> 02:00:30.679
different tools       tools and 
here's a summary         

02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:33.857
summary.  There's         
There's the search gallery, the 

02:00:33.858 --> 02:00:35.858
structured data      data 
testing         testing tool and

02:00:36.490 --> 02:00:37.953
 the search console         
console are available to you    

02:00:37.954 --> 02:00:39.522
 you.  Hopefully           
Hopefully you can take a moment 

02:00:39.523 --> 02:00:43.755
and try those out     out after 
we talk.  

02:00:43.756 --> 02:00:45.530
The first starting          
starting point is    is the 

02:00:45.531 --> 02:00:46.882
search gallery.  It basically 
          basically allow       

02:00:46.883 --> 02:00:50.381
allows you to figure out what 
are the closest way you can add 

02:00:50.382 --> 02:00:53.217
structured data      data and 
the kind of things        things

02:00:53.218 --> 02:00:54.529
 that you can do.  The first 
party       party want to 

02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:56.709
highlight           highlight on
 the left top, this is    is a 

02:00:56.710 --> 02:00:59.788
brand new version of the        
of the search gallery that's 

02:00:59.789 --> 02:01:01.996
been published           
published this week.  You see 

02:01:01.997 --> 02:01:02.793
these enhancements              
enhancements and these are 

02:01:02.794 --> 02:01:06.229
things        things that you 
can do more or less dependent 

02:01:06.383 --> 02:01:08.383
          dependent on the kind 
of information you have.  If you

02:01:08.532 --> 02:01:12.374
 have recipes on your site, but 
these rs things        things 

02:01:12.375 --> 02:01:12.721
that can enhance your results
                      enhance 

02:01:12.722 --> 02:01:14.507
your results         results in 
Google Search        Search 

02:01:14.508 --> 02:01:15.530
independently               
independently on what you do.  

02:01:15.531 --> 02:01:17.818
For instance          instance 
you can improve how the bread 

02:01:17.819 --> 02:01:21.076
crumbs        crumbs are 
structured            

02:01:21.077 --> 02:01:24.283
structured, corporate           
corporate contacts logos       

02:01:24.284 --> 02:01:26.284
logos. 

02:01:29.859 --> 02:01:31.467
       logos.  
Once you look      look at these

02:01:31.468 --> 02:01:32.765
 opportunities               
opportunities, low-      

02:01:32.766 --> 02:01:34.126
low-hanging fruits        
fruits, probably everyone 

02:01:34.127 --> 02:01:36.835
         everyone can do that.  
And then      then you see the 

02:01:36.836 --> 02:01:38.350
second part      part, the 
vertical          vertical 

02:01:38.351 --> 02:01:40.141
content types       types that 
Duncan        Duncan was 

02:01:40.142 --> 02:01:42.087
describe ing            
describing to.  You have data 

02:01:42.088 --> 02:01:44.411
              You have events, 
pod evidence 

02:01:44.502 --> 02:01:46.119
                     events, 
podcasts          podcasts, so 

02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:48.528
this is    is the documentation
               documentation for

02:01:48.862 --> 02:01:51.379
 recipes and you see there is 
several kinds       kinds of 

02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:54.881
mark      markup I can have.  On
 the left side it's like a 

02:01:54.882 --> 02:01:57.788
single recipe or a single query
       query and on the top 

02:01:57.789 --> 02:02:01.024
extreme right we see a list.  So
           list.  So Duncan 

02:02:01.111 --> 02:02:02.444
       Duncan was talking 
about       about how you can 

02:02:02.445 --> 02:02:05.218
make a list page.  This is    is
 how it would look      look 

02:02:05.219 --> 02:02:08.246
like.  Look             like.  
Look        

02:02:08.247 --> 02:02:10.312
Look carefully           
carefully at the specification 

02:02:10.313 --> 02:02:12.166
here.  This is    is all on the 
Google website         website 

02:02:12.167 --> 02:02:14.294
and towards the bottom we always
 show you the property.  Early 

02:02:14.378 --> 02:02:15.894
      Early on I was talking 
about       about the schema  

02:02:15.895 --> 02:02:18.519
      schema.  Here we kind of 
give      give you a summary of 

02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:21.762
the things        things we 
expect and it takes       takes 

02:02:21.763 --> 02:02:23.763
special care to look      look 
     look at which things       

02:02:23.833 --> 02:02:25.148
 things are required          
required.  If you don't have all

02:02:25.149 --> 02:02:27.221
 the required elements          
elements, they won't            

02:02:27.222 --> 02:02:28.254
they won't actually          
actually be pushed 

02:02:28.255 --> 02:02:29.318
                   actually be 
published           published.  

02:02:29.319 --> 02:02:31.851
And of course it's a good idea 
for you to put the recommended 

02:02:31.852 --> 02:02:33.316
fields        fields as well 
because         because that 

02:02:33.317 --> 02:02:35.134
will increase the quality of the
        of the result, the 

02:02:35.135 --> 02:02:37.824
quality of the card that we 
could       could show and we 

02:02:37.825 --> 02:02:42.284
make you look      look better. 
 So like number of calorie 

02:02:42.402 --> 02:02:46.294
        calories in a recipe, 
the information would be added 

02:02:46.295 --> 02:02:48.737
as Duncan describe          
described.  

02:02:48.738 --> 02:02:50.798
Once you identify          
identify the kind of mark      

02:02:50.799 --> 02:02:52.338
markup you want to have, the 
incomes         incomes step is

02:02:52.339 --> 02:02:54.631
    is to actually             
to act --        act -- next 

02:02:54.632 --> 02:02:56.409
step is    is to actually 
         actually draft it and 

02:02:56.410 --> 02:03:00.356
play with it.  Back to the page 
of the        of the 

02:03:00.357 --> 02:03:06.217
documentation is    is you see 
these these links with a C mark-

02:03:06.403 --> 02:03:09.031
       mark-up.  For each of 
these we give      give you a 

02:03:09.032 --> 02:03:10.141
skample               you a 
sample        sample of what the

02:03:10.142 --> 02:03:12.225
 mark-       mark-up is    is 
for that kind of structural data

02:03:12.341 --> 02:03:15.485
      data.  And that will bring
 you     you to the second tool

02:03:18.724 --> 02:03:20.724
. 

02:03:21.791 --> 02:03:23.740
 It opens       opens with a 
sample        sample of that 

02:03:23.741 --> 02:03:27.593
specific kind of page so you can
 use it as a starting          

02:03:27.594 --> 02:03:29.711
starting point.  The idea is    
is you can kind of play with it,

02:03:29.837 --> 02:03:32.153
 see what it look      looks 
like.  Generally try to make it 

02:03:32.154 --> 02:03:33.871
complete so it has all the 
components            

02:03:33.872 --> 02:03:36.355
components.  And you can use 
this to as sort of a starting 

02:03:36.453 --> 02:03:38.111
         starting point.  We 
recommend to you     you that 

02:03:38.112 --> 02:03:40.290
you create        create a 
version of a sample        

02:03:40.291 --> 02:03:41.904
sample page.  I'll take a page 
of your site, for instance 

02:03:41.905 --> 02:03:44.132
         instance, that has a 
recipe or something, and then 

02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:47.040
     then add the mark      
markups to that and test it out.

02:03:47.041 --> 02:03:48.868
  So you can actually give      
give the address of the        

02:03:48.869 --> 02:03:54.759
of the page, an SDTT will go 
pick up that page, analyze it 

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:58.708
and tell you what happened 
         happened with it and 

02:03:58.709 --> 02:04:00.222
give      give you whatever 
warning         warnings might 

02:04:00.223 --> 02:04:05.807
exist       exist.  If    If 
you're           If you aren't 

02:04:05.896 --> 02:04:08.259
       aren't ready       ready 
to publish yet     yet, you can 

02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:10.295
cut and paste       paste and 
still test it.  It's just a 

02:04:10.296 --> 02:04:13.076
little more cumbersome 
           cumbersome.   

02:04:15.869 --> 02:04:18.426
                cumbersome.   
Once your page verify        

02:04:18.427 --> 02:04:20.766
verifies, your next step is    
is    is to see how it look     

02:04:20.942 --> 02:04:22.942
 looks like.  You have this 
preview         preview function

02:04:23.723 --> 02:04:26.047
 here.  Once you click preview 
        preview you see a simple

02:04:26.671 --> 02:04:28.767
        simple card.  It depends
 how much information 

02:04:28.849 --> 02:04:30.000
            information you 
display         display you can 

02:04:30.001 --> 02:04:31.818
see what your elements          
elements will look      look 

02:04:31.819 --> 02:04:35.503
like in realistic card that 
would be shown       shown in 

02:04:35.504 --> 02:04:40.398
search.  And that helps you also
 tweak       tweak your context.

02:04:40.399 --> 02:04:43.327
  Maybe try different pictures 
or see what's the best      best

02:04:43.681 --> 02:04:46.887
 way to show      showcase your 
structured data      data.  So 

02:04:46.888 --> 02:04:48.891
at this point we understand 
           understand what we 

02:04:48.892 --> 02:04:52.340
want to do.  We tested one to 
see what it looks like.  And now

02:04:52.595 --> 02:04:55.571
 the next step is    is to 
deploy        deploy this for 

02:04:55.572 --> 02:05:01.223
some pages       pages or.  We 
generally recommend you don't do

02:05:02.074 --> 02:05:05.124
 this for everything at once.  
Get a subset of your site -- 

02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:07.227
        site -- actually 
         actually can you go one

02:05:07.394 --> 02:05:10.180
 page back?  That you use a 
subset of your site and use that

02:05:10.346 --> 02:05:12.346
 to try out. 

02:05:14.385 --> 02:05:15.053
 So add this to just perhaps 
--            perhaps -- just to

02:05:15.054 --> 02:05:17.301
 get a notion        notion of 
what it would look      look 

02:05:18.392 --> 02:05:19.514
like.  
Now       

02:05:19.515 --> 02:05:20.830
Now, more technical           
technical.  So there's         

02:05:20.831 --> 02:05:24.024
there's actually two     two 
ways in which you can add the 

02:05:24.025 --> 02:05:26.378
structured data      data.  One 
is    is the script I showed 

02:05:26.599 --> 02:05:30.695
       showed you earlier 
        earlier in Json-       

02:05:30.696 --> 02:05:32.909
Json-LD you can put in a script 
tag and it's actually          

02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:34.597
actually the most      most 
common way.  And the other one 

02:05:34.598 --> 02:05:40.688
is    is you can use micro daust
       daust like this.   

02:05:40.779 --> 02:05:43.977
                           use 
micro data      data like this. 

02:05:46.609 --> 02:05:48.988
manually          manually but 
that's not a great idea.  What 

02:05:48.989 --> 02:05:51.794
you would like to do is    is 
use your CMS.  I imagine most   

02:05:51.884 --> 02:05:54.619
   most of you who     who have 
large or size      sizeable or 

02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:59.693
not large, have a management 
           management system to 

02:05:59.694 --> 02:06:01.732
manage your content         
content.  But you want to the 

02:06:01.733 --> 02:06:04.394
most      most common way we 
have found people do it is    is

02:06:04.846 --> 02:06:08.286
 that they pick up a suitable 
structured data      data CMS 

02:06:08.287 --> 02:06:12.573
plug      plugin.  There's 
        There's many CMS's that 

02:06:12.574 --> 02:06:15.893
have plug-       plug-ins that 
you can get.  The idea is    is 

02:06:15.894 --> 02:06:17.279
we published              we 
publish         publish your 

02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:20.163
content         content but it 
then      then publish         

02:06:20.164 --> 02:06:21.969
publishes the structured data 
     data with it so you don't 

02:06:21.970 --> 02:06:26.030
have to manage things        
things one by one.      one.  

02:06:26.031 --> 02:06:29.309
So once you     you put this in 
a specific subset of your site, 

02:06:29.310 --> 02:06:31.200
it's time for you to review 
       review        review the 

02:06:31.201 --> 02:06:33.962
stats and for that we get to a 
third tool which is    is the 

02:06:33.963 --> 02:06:37.555
search console         console. 
         console.  

02:06:37.556 --> 02:06:40.222
Search console is    is similar 
to Google analytics           

02:06:40.223 --> 02:06:41.889
analytics but it focuses on 
Google Search        Search.  It

02:06:41.890 --> 02:06:44.479
 tells       tells you how 
search looks at your      your 

02:06:44.480 --> 02:06:46.024
site and what elements          
elements appear        appear 

02:06:46.025 --> 02:06:48.025
and how many      many times it 
appears        

02:06:52.266 --> 02:06:56.332
 appears, et cetera.  Different 
from      from the structure 

02:06:52.266 --> 02:06:54.266
data testing         testing, 
the console         console has

02:06:55.019 --> 02:06:57.793
     has a   a little bit of set
 up because         because you 

02:06:57.794 --> 02:06:59.804
have to sign up    up and verify
 properties            

02:06:59.805 --> 02:07:01.297
properties.  How many      many 
of you     you have verify 

02:07:01.298 --> 02:07:03.180
       verified or used      
used search console         

02:07:03.181 --> 02:07:07.283
console to get an idea?  Not as 
many.  Maybe a third or a fourd 

02:07:07.753 --> 02:07:08.733
                 third or a 
fourth        fourth.  So I'll 

02:07:08.734 --> 02:07:10.551
give      give you a little bit 
of detail        detail and 

02:07:10.552 --> 02:07:13.276
there's         there's more to 
it than      than that.  The 

02:07:13.277 --> 02:07:15.607
first step for you is    is to 
get associated with an account. 

02:07:15.751 --> 02:07:19.719
 So you have anybody         
anybody can get an account on 

02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:21.393
search console         console 
but then      then what you have

02:07:21.394 --> 02:07:24.558
 is    is the verification 
process that provides          

02:07:24.559 --> 02:07:26.768
provides you have rights        
rights to the site that you want

02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:29.504
 to test or use on search 
console         console, much  

02:07:29.598 --> 02:07:32.170
    much like Google analytics 
is    is the same process.  

02:07:32.171 --> 02:07:33.802
Commonly          Commonly you 
do this by uploading           

02:07:33.803 --> 02:07:36.487
uploading some special file to 
your site or perhaps         

02:07:36.488 --> 02:07:37.422
perhaps to the main one of the 
       of the components 

02:07:37.423 --> 02:07:38.956
           components of your 
domain        domain name 

02:07:38.957 --> 02:07:41.264
provider          provider.  
         provider.  

02:07:41.265 --> 02:07:42.841
Now       
Now you might want to, if you 

02:07:42.842 --> 02:07:45.321
have a large organization, you 
might want to check, it's 

02:07:45.322 --> 02:07:46.663
frequently            frequently
 the case that somebody         

02:07:46.664 --> 02:07:49.496
 somebody else might have used  
    used and set it up and in 

02:07:49.497 --> 02:07:51.460
this case they can authorize 
          authorize you and it 

02:07:51.461 --> 02:07:53.930
makes       makes life a slilt  
            life a little simple

02:07:54.019 --> 02:07:57.977
        simpler.  Once you 
register          register the 

02:07:57.978 --> 02:08:01.339
ability         ability to 
manage your site through search 

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.720
console         console you want
 to add site maps      maps.  

02:08:03.721 --> 02:08:05.818
And site maps      maps are a 
way for us    us to look      

02:08:05.819 --> 02:08:08.562
look and see what information 
you have.  Of course we already 

02:08:08.563 --> 02:08:10.625
look      look at site maps if
    if they're         they're 

02:08:10.626 --> 02:08:13.035
vulnerable            vulnerable
 but this helps.  For instance 

02:08:13.127 --> 02:08:15.280
         instance, imaging 
        imaging display         

02:08:15.281 --> 02:08:19.589
display some new stuff, you use 
that to figure out what      

02:08:19.590 --> 02:08:23.929
what the components            
components are of your site.  

02:08:23.930 --> 02:08:25.579
You can do this for a section of
 your site while you figure 

02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:28.289
things        things out.  
This is    is what search 

02:08:28.290 --> 02:08:30.304
console looks like.  Much      
Much like Google analytics 

02:08:30.415 --> 02:08:32.873
          analytics.  There's 
        There's a lot of stuff 

02:08:32.874 --> 02:08:33.984
here.  Different reports        
 reports and it's not always 

02:08:33.985 --> 02:08:37.135
very      very easy to find.  
But let me walk you through some

02:08:37.397 --> 02:08:40.741
 ways in which you can dig into 
the data      data for your 

02:08:40.742 --> 02:08:42.596
implementation                
implementation.  First      

02:08:43.429 --> 02:08:45.946
use the rich cards       cards 
report and that monitor         

02:08:45.947 --> 02:08:47.403
monitors which elements 
                        monitors

02:08:47.404 --> 02:08:49.579
 steward data elements          
elements were correctly 

02:08:49.661 --> 02:08:52.114
          correctly found on 
your pages after a crawl       

02:08:52.115 --> 02:08:54.115
crawl.  And the first thing   
    thing you want to do is look

02:08:54.135 --> 02:08:57.311
      look at issues were found.
  The structured data      data 

02:08:57.312 --> 02:09:00.200
testing         testing allow 
      allowed you to test one  

02:09:00.295 --> 02:09:02.295
   one specific mark      mark
up.  Looks at what elements   

02:09:02.374 --> 02:09:04.583
       elements are on your site
 and what do         what do 

02:09:04.584 --> 02:09:07.124
they look      look like.  
Keeping         Keeping in mind 

02:09:07.125 --> 02:09:09.792
it takes       takes a while to 
crawl       crawl your site.  

02:09:09.793 --> 02:09:12.549
You might want to leave a couple
 of days to catch up to this.  

02:09:12.550 --> 02:09:14.315
What you want to do is    is to 
look      look at all the 

02:09:14.316 --> 02:09:17.138
critical          critical 
issues, remember those sort of 

02:09:17.139 --> 02:09:19.139
obligatory            obligatory
 or necessary properties 

02:09:19.146 --> 02:09:21.324
           properties.  So for 
instance          instance you 

02:09:21.325 --> 02:09:22.963
may want to look      look at 
those because         because 

02:09:22.964 --> 02:09:25.036
those things        things may 
actually          actually 

02:09:25.037 --> 02:09:27.400
prevent those from showing 
structured data      data into a

02:09:28.437 --> 02:09:30.437
 card. 

02:09:31.807 --> 02:09:33.973
 Let's              card.  
Let's look      look at the 

02:09:33.974 --> 02:09:36.122
issues that were affecting     
      affecting the type.  See 

02:09:36.123 --> 02:09:42.102
below the           below the 
specific site both recipes.  If

02:09:42.503 --> 02:09:45.189
              recipes.  If you 
click       click on recipe you 

02:09:45.190 --> 02:09:49.082
get a subset of a report and you
 can see there's         there's

02:09:49.083 --> 02:09:51.144
 218 invalid cards       cards 
and in the bottom you see the 

02:09:51.145 --> 02:09:53.130
problems          problems that 
were found.  These were a very  

02:09:53.131 --> 02:09:56.533
    very good idea of what it is
 that you need to fix.  As you 

02:09:56.534 --> 02:09:57.996
see in this case there's        
 there's a bunch of 

02:09:57.997 --> 02:09:59.305
opportunities               
opportunities that you might 

02:09:59.306 --> 02:10:02.181
have missed in terms of adding
        adding nutrition.  But 

02:10:02.182 --> 02:10:04.395
the most important is    is 
there's         there's 218 

02:10:04.396 --> 02:10:06.599
pages in fact all of the        
of the ones because         

02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:08.883
because they seem to be missing 
        missing a field in this 

02:10:08.884 --> 02:10:11.116
case, imagine.  If              
      case, image       image.  

02:10:11.117 --> 02:10:15.120
If you click on    on that same 
line, you can dig even deep     

02:10:15.524 --> 02:10:19.649
 deeper and find example        
 examples.  Search console can 

02:10:19.650 --> 02:10:22.851
guide you to specific pages on 
your site where that problem was

02:10:23.210 --> 02:10:25.057
 found.  In addition          
addition if you click on one of 

02:10:25.058 --> 02:10:28.096
those further, you can actually
          actually get a dialog 

02:10:28.194 --> 02:10:30.318
       dialog that may 
eventually            eventually

02:10:30.444 --> 02:10:36.991
 leave you to the            you
 to figure out exactly         

02:10:36.992 --> 02:10:41.252
exactly where that went wrong.  
To try to help you develop this 

02:10:41.253 --> 02:10:42.627
at a relatively            
relatively fine grain       

02:10:42.628 --> 02:10:44.354
grain level.  For instance   
       instance in this case you

02:10:44.355 --> 02:10:48.190
 see on the left side you're 
       you're missing         

02:10:48.191 --> 02:10:51.991
missing, on the right side 
you'll see marked in blue on the

02:10:52.346 --> 02:10:54.710
 list of ischemia             of
 schema        schema, the 

02:10:54.711 --> 02:10:57.562
property was not dpild       
dpild and it's obligatory  

02:10:57.664 --> 02:10:59.016
          obligatory.  Try to 
sort of connect the lowest 

02:10:59.017 --> 02:11:02.567
       lowest level of the    
    of the specific page to do 

02:11:02.568 --> 02:11:04.020
implementation                
implementation of your site.  

02:11:04.021 --> 02:11:11.806
So now you want to fix and 
launch index

02:11:14.531 --> 02:11:16.870
       index.  Keep in mind it 
could       could take days to 

02:11:16.871 --> 02:11:18.727
get to all of it.  Now you're   
     you're ready       ready 

02:11:18.728 --> 02:11:20.937
and you publish         publish 
the stuff, the question for you 

02:11:20.938 --> 02:11:23.008
the most important           
important one is    is how do I 

02:11:23.009 --> 02:11:24.687
know my return on investment   
         investment.  How do I 

02:11:24.688 --> 02:11:26.685
know this was useful and how do 
I know what the results         

02:11:26.686 --> 02:11:29.282
results are in terms of the 
effort        effort that I put 

02:11:29.283 --> 02:11:32.027
in    in.  
So these are           these are

02:11:32.028 --> 02:11:36.275
 some of the        of the key 
stats.  Certain things        

02:11:36.276 --> 02:11:39.003
things for web pages, clicks, 
impressions,              

02:11:39.004 --> 02:11:42.537
impressions, the number of times
 the information was shown, 

02:11:42.538 --> 02:11:44.538
click through rate, average 
positioning

02:11:47.559 --> 02:11:50.637
 and you can get out of this 
through t   the search analytics

02:11:50.917 --> 02:11:57.253
           analytics report.  
And sich analytic          

02:11:57.254 --> 02:11:59.587
analytics report        report 
gives       gives information 

02:11:59.588 --> 02:12:00.749
how each part of the            
 part of the site did     did.  

02:12:00.750 --> 02:12:03.708
And in fact it also      also 
can help you do both with and 

02:12:03.709 --> 02:12:05.664
without the mark      markup 
which is    is a great way for 

02:12:05.665 --> 02:12:09.047
you to compare and one of the 
       of the way s       ways 

02:12:09.048 --> 02:12:11.729
was used      used to figure out
 what happened          

02:12:11.730 --> 02:12:13.551
happened.  So view impressions  
           impressions, clicks 

02:12:13.552 --> 02:12:16.981
       clicks, as we discuss 
        discussed before and you

02:12:16.982 --> 02:12:18.859
 can filter        filter based 
on search feature         

02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:24.796
feature type.  So a rich      
rich and non-      non-rich 

02:12:24.797 --> 02:12:27.365
result depending           
depending on the context.  And 

02:12:27.366 --> 02:12:32.504
you want to try to analyze that 
have the high CTR     CTR.  You 

02:12:32.505 --> 02:12:34.256
can         You can use this to 
detect what is    is working

02:12:34.257 --> 02:12:35.631
         working well.  What is
                well.  What are 

02:12:35.632 --> 02:12:36.958
the places where your 
implementation                

02:12:36.959 --> 02:12:38.959
implementation have the best 
results         results. 

02:12:42.717 --> 02:12:45.453
         results.  
The search appearance filter 

02:12:45.563 --> 02:12:48.422
       filter in which case you 
can select the results         

02:12:48.423 --> 02:12:50.694
results that have structured 
data      data.  You can also 

02:12:51.393 --> 02:12:53.944
     also filter        filter 
based on a pattern         

02:12:53.945 --> 02:12:55.945
pattern, so perhaps

02:12:58.302 --> 02:13:01.678
 maybe it's under a specific 
folder        folder or a 

02:13:01.679 --> 02:13:03.712
specific UR    URL pattern  
       pattern         pattern 

02:13:03.713 --> 02:13:06.075
you can specify         specify 
this here and     and compare 

02:13:06.076 --> 02:13:07.388
how it looks compared          
compared to the rest of the  

02:13:07.389 --> 02:13:10.741
      of the site.  You can also
 look      look at date ranges 

02:13:10.742 --> 02:13:13.274
which can be used      used if 
you implemented             

02:13:13.275 --> 02:13:16.199
implemented this one week and 
the following week      week you

02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:18.200
 can compare like before and 
after. 

02:13:22.449 --> 02:13:23.577
       after.  
This is    is an roefr 

02:13:23.578 --> 02:13:27.920
            is an overview of 
process among structured daert 

02:13:28.001 --> 02:13:29.877
                 structured data
      data and now Duncan is    

02:13:29.878 --> 02:13:31.878
is going to tell a little more 
about       about the sites   

02:13:31.989 --> 02:13:33.706
    sites that have implemented 
            implemented what 

02:13:33.707 --> 02:13:36.969
kind of R   ROI do they get.  
&gt;&gt;DUNCAN OSBORN:  Thanks        

02:13:36.970 --> 02:13:42.148
Thanks.  Okay.  Final stretch.  

02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:45.909
I'm       
I'm going to walk you through 

02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:48.314
partners          partners 
across several         several 

02:13:48.315 --> 02:13:49.963
different vertical          
vertical s            verticals 

02:13:49.964 --> 02:13:52.294
to show the diversity           
diversity of success we've seen 

02:13:52.295 --> 02:13:54.247
so far.  Let's       Let's start
 with the one that you just saw.

02:13:54.248 --> 02:13:56.369
  Rotten        Rotten tomato 
       tomatoes.  Again, a good 

02:13:56.370 --> 02:13:57.763
adoption          adoption of 
structured data      data which 

02:13:57.764 --> 02:14:00.306
led to        led to a 25% % 
higher click-        

02:14:00.307 --> 02:14:02.072
click-through rate for those 
results         results.  But 

02:14:02.073 --> 02:14:08.146
they went to one, here we saw 
food.com          food.com.  

02:14:08.147 --> 02:14:10.162
They also      also had good 
kovrnltion            kovrnltion

02:14:10.163 --> 02:14:11.573
 of structured data 

02:14:11.574 --> 02:14:12.571
        had good dovrnlg  
                had good 

02:14:12.572 --> 02:14:14.141
govrnlg                  had 
good coverage of structured data

02:14:14.142 --> 02:14:19.485
      data with 80% % and they 
saw a 35% % increase of CTR     

02:14:19.486 --> 02:14:21.673
CTR which is    is super 
encouraging             

02:14:21.674 --> 02:14:25.009
encouraging.              
encouraging.  

02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:27.821
Next going over to Europe       
 Europe, in this case local 

02:14:27.822 --> 02:14:30.861
restaurant            restaurant
 listing         listings.  A 

02:14:30.862 --> 02:14:35.932
mark-       mark-up on 90% % and
 they saw a fairly high increase

02:14:36.825 --> 02:14:38.876
 in CTR        in CTR.  Moving 
       Moving back to recipes 

02:14:38.877 --> 02:14:41.207
but over to Japan       Japan.  
So here is            So here 

02:14:41.208 --> 02:14:43.074
this is    is an interesting 
            interesting case 

02:14:43.075 --> 02:14:43.233
because         because not only
 did     did they see an 

02:14:43.234 --> 02:14:45.869
increase in interaction on those
 results         results, but 

02:14:45.870 --> 02:14:47.265
the resulting           
resulting session as users      

02:14:47.266 --> 02:14:49.890
 users landed        landed on 
those pages was of higher 

02:14:49.891 --> 02:14:51.954
quality.  So if    if you're
        you're in one of those 

02:14:51.955 --> 02:14:53.955
vertical          verticals it 
depends on the quality of the   

02:14:53.979 --> 02:14:55.591
     of the user landing        
 landing on those pages.  This 

02:14:55.592 --> 02:14:58.040
is    is a great sign.  
And finally         finally 

02:14:58.041 --> 02:15:02.229
moving        moving to South 
America         America         

02:15:02.230 --> 02:15:06.855
America 82% % higher CTR     
CTRs.  This is    is super 

02:15:06.856 --> 02:15:08.070
encouraging             
encouraging.  And hopefully 

02:15:08.071 --> 02:15:10.465
          hopefully we'll see 
some of you on this list next 

02:15:10.598 --> 02:15:11.305
talk.  
So we covered         covered 

02:15:11.306 --> 02:15:13.045
three things        things in   
 in this talk.         talk.  

02:15:13.046 --> 02:15:13.908
The first is    is the 
opportunity             

02:15:13.909 --> 02:15:15.019
opportunity which is    is 
literally           literally to

02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:18.200
 stand out on search        
search.  One of the        of 

02:15:18.201 --> 02:15:19.027
the rare opportunities  
             opportunities you 

02:15:19.028 --> 02:15:20.836
have to customize           
customize your results         

02:15:20.837 --> 02:15:23.160
results visually for Google 
users       users.  And we have 

02:15:23.161 --> 02:15:25.252
quite a few vertical          
verticals for now and we're 

02:15:25.253 --> 02:15:26.631
constant          constantly 
thinking          thinking of 

02:15:26.632 --> 02:15:27.723
new vertical          verticals.
  So if you're           if 

02:15:27.724 --> 02:15:29.741
you're not on the list that I 
showed        showed before, 

02:15:29.742 --> 02:15:31.643
stay tuned       tuned.  
Senld               tuned.  

02:15:31.644 --> 02:15:34.128
Second, we show you the tools 
      tools that you can use to 

02:15:34.129 --> 02:15:35.581
implement all of that structured
 data      data and to measure

02:15:35.582 --> 02:15:37.457
         measure the impact 
       impact and of course the 

02:15:37.458 --> 02:15:39.797
results         results as we've
 seen can be very      very 

02:15:39.798 --> 02:15:43.516
promising           promising.  
So just to wrap up, this is    

02:15:43.517 --> 02:15:46.207
is a quick reminder of the 
       of the links that can 

02:15:46.208 --> 02:15:47.839
hopefully           hopefully 
help you get started if you 

02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:50.743
haven't already         already.
  The search gallery to see what

02:15:50.868 --> 02:15:52.868
 the options         options 
are.  It's good to click through

02:15:52.971 --> 02:15:55.121
 the content         content 
that corresponds to the content 

02:15:55.198 --> 02:15:58.472
        content you have on your
 site.  Second, one you start to

02:15:58.473 --> 02:16:00.120
 implement structured data      
data, the testing         

02:16:00.121 --> 02:16:03.252
testing tool is    is there to 
diagnose and indicate any 

02:16:03.253 --> 02:16:04.772
rear          any error       
errors you have in your mark 

02:16:04.773 --> 02:16:07.437
     markup and guide you 
through the correct practices to

02:16:07.609 --> 02:16:08.969
 make sure it's working         
working properly          

02:16:08.970 --> 02:16:11.046
properly.  And finally         
finally in search console, once 

02:16:11.047 --> 02:16:13.360
you manage        manage to ship
 all of your structured data  

02:16:13.452 --> 02:16:14.834

enjoy your results

02:48:09.796 --> 02:48:11.609
SPEAKER:  Good afternoon 
everyone          everyone.  I'm

02:48:11.610 --> 02:48:13.910
 Gerardo Capiel        Capiel 
and I lead product management 

02:48:13.994 --> 02:48:15.905
           management for 
consumer payment products 

02:48:15.906 --> 02:48:18.545
         products here at 
Google.  And with me is    is my

02:48:18.546 --> 02:48:20.879
 partner         partner in 
crime, Varouj Chitilian who is  

02:48:21.122 --> 02:48:24.888
  is the engineering            
 engineering side.  

02:48:24.889 --> 02:48:26.308
Payments            
Payments are at the heart of 

02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:28.852
commerce          commerce.  If
    If I want to buy a cup of 

02:48:28.853 --> 02:48:31.759
coffee        coffee, I've got 
to pay for it.  Payments 

02:48:31.852 --> 02:48:35.613
         Payments are that link 
between desire and fulfillment 

02:48:36.772 --> 02:48:40.162
            fulfillment.  And 
that link is    is paramount 

02:48:40.500 --> 02:48:42.059
          paramount to making 
       making your apps      

02:48:42.060 --> 02:48:45.505
apps grow and your businesses 
thrive        thrive.  

02:48:45.506 --> 02:48:51.448
Unfortunately that link is also
      also a major pain point 

02:48:51.449 --> 02:48:55.157
for many of you.  Particularly 
on the mobile web, where 

02:48:55.158 --> 02:48:58.320
conversion rates       rates are
 a third of what they are on 

02:48:58.321 --> 02:49:01.991
desk      desktop.  We're 
constant          constantly 

02:49:01.992 --> 02:49:03.843
thinking about       about how

faster        faster, and safe 

02:49:08.207 --> 02:49:12.179
     safer.  
Today we're going             

02:49:12.180 --> 02:49:15.267
we're going to be talking to you
 about       about the 

02:49:15.268 --> 02:49:17.172
foundation that we built       
built with Android         

02:49:17.173 --> 02:49:19.723
Android pay   Pay, and about 
      about how we're expanding

02:49:20.139 --> 02:49:23.163
           expanding our API    
 APIs to enable richer commerce 

02:49:23.344 --> 02:49:30.340

store.  Take it away      away. 

02:49:34.193 --> 02:49:37.011
CHITILIAN:  The foundation as 
Gerardo         Gerardo 

02:49:37.012 --> 02:49:38.724
mentioned is Android         
Android pay.  Our solution   

02:49:38.725 --> 02:49:40.725
       solution for fast      
fast and secure mobile paements 

02:49:40.868 --> 02:49:42.061

mobile payments          

02:49:42.062 --> 02:49:47.341
payments.  Over the past      
past year, the team has been 

02:49:47.342 --> 02:49:49.635
working         working around 
the clock to scale       

02:49:49.849 --> 02:49:52.006
         clock to expand        
expand this foung gloek       

02:49:52.007 --> 02:49:55.561
gloekly               foung 
globally and I'm     I'm praud 

02:49:55.562 --> 02:49:58.256
to say that Android         
Android Pay is    is available 

02:49:58.257 --> 02:50:00.401
in 10 markets         markets.  
But we're not stopping          

02:50:00.402 --> 02:50:02.402
stopping there.  In the coming 
       coming months we'll      

02:50:02.468 --> 02:50:05.117
 we'll be launching           
launching in Brazil        

02:50:05.118 --> 02:50:08.867
Brazil, Canada, Russia        
Russia, Spain       Spain and 

02:50:08.868 --> 02:50:12.473
Taiwan.           Taiwan.  So 
the momentum is    is 

02:50:12.474 --> 02:50:15.452
incredible.  
[ Applause ] 

02:50:15.453 --> 02:50:16.990
I'm       
I'm personally very      very 

02:50:16.991 --> 02:50:18.846
excited about       about Brazil
        Brazil, because         

02:50:18.847 --> 02:50:21.697
because it will be         will 
be the first Latin American 

02:50:21.698 --> 02:50:26.629
country and I really want to 
visit       visit there.        

02:50:26.889 --> 02:50:28.073
there.  
We're not just strengthening 

02:50:28.074 --> 02:50:29.259
              strengthening the 
foundation by expanding 

02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:30.957
          expanding it.  We're 
strengthing             

02:50:30.958 --> 02:50:33.467
strengthing it also through 
partnership             

02:50:33.468 --> 02:50:34.897
partnerships.  One example 
        example of this is    is

02:50:34.898 --> 02:50:37.511
 a push provisioning poi  
                provisioning API

02:50:37.662 --> 02:50:41.594
     APIs.  These API     APIs 
allow       allow issuers 

02:50:41.758 --> 02:50:47.202
        issuers to em    embed 
core functionalities into their 

02:50:47.888 --> 02:50:51.371
      their own apps      apps. 
 For example in this case a 

02:50:51.372 --> 02:50:56.386
discover app user can click the 
link      link, this will 

02:50:56.387 --> 02:50:59.073
provision their       their card
 to this device and they can go 

02:50:59.074 --> 02:51:03.459
into the score, tap and pay to 
purchase a good, without ever 

02:51:03.460 --> 02:51:04.861
having instaud                
having installed           

02:51:04.862 --> 02:51:09.400
installed the Android         
Android pay app.  There's  

02:51:09.481 --> 02:51:10.765
       There's been phenomenal 
           phenomenal success 

02:51:10.766 --> 02:51:15.819
and we're really proud of this 
API     API.      API.  

02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:17.038
We're also      also strengthen
ing               strengthening 

02:51:17.039 --> 02:51:18.859
this foundation by partnering 
           partnering with app 

02:51:18.860 --> 02:51:22.599
developer           developers. 
 We're doing this through the 

02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:28.459
Android         Android Pan     
Pay in-     in-app poi     

02:51:28.542 --> 02:51:31.010
       in-app API     APIs that 
thousand          thousands of 

02:51:31.011 --> 02:51:33.852
apps      apps have integrated 
           integrated with.  

02:51:33.853 --> 02:51:37.388
They are bringing seamless  
        seamless, stream lined 

02:51:37.389 --> 02:51:41.423
strooth               lined 
smooth        smooth check      

02:51:41.424 --> 02:51:46.173
 checkout.  For example the 
jet.com app has seen      seen a

02:51:46.357 --> 02:51:48.228
 3.5X conversion            
conversion rate increase just by

02:51:48.229 --> 02:51:51.093
 implementing              
implementing these in-     

02:51:51.094 --> 02:51:53.194
in-app API     APIs in their  
     their check       checkout 

02:51:53.195 --> 02:51:56.737
flow.       flow.  
We're also expanding           

02:51:56.738 --> 02:51:59.433
expanding this foundation to the
 mobile web and we're bringing 

02:51:59.434 --> 02:52:02.004
Android         Android Pay     
Pay to the mobile web.  And 

02:52:02.005 --> 02:52:04.830
we're bringing          bringing
 it to the API request         

02:52:04.831 --> 02:52:06.975
requests in chrome      Chrome. 
 So we're very      very excited

02:52:06.976 --> 02:52:11.410
 about       about that.  And 
recently Washington            

02:52:11.411 --> 02:52:13.411
Washington post

02:52:15.233 --> 02:52:17.332
 instituted            
instituted these API     APIs 

02:52:17.333 --> 02:52:22.408
and we've seen a             
          APIs.  We're very     

02:52:22.556 --> 02:52:23.681
 very excited about       about 
all the momentum          

02:52:23.682 --> 02:52:24.535
momentum we're seeing        
seeing in building          

02:52:24.536 --> 02:52:25.892
building this foundation that we
 have built       built over the

02:52:25.893 --> 02:52:28.330
 past      past year.       
year.  

02:52:28.331 --> 02:52:30.967
Now I would like to pass it over
 to Gerardo         Gerardo so 

02:52:30.968 --> 02:52:32.191
he can talk about       about 
how we're building          

02:52:32.192 --> 02:52:34.916
building on top of this 
foundation that we have, so we 

02:52:34.917 --> 02:52:38.811
can expose our users to even  
    even greater mobile payment 

02:52:38.929 --> 02:52:42.640
        payment experiences.  
GERARDO CAPIEL:  Thanks        

02:52:42.641 --> 02:52:45.598
Thanks, Varouj        Varouj.   

02:52:45.599 --> 02:52:49.334
Great.  So let's       let's 
start with online.  As many of 

02:52:49.335 --> 02:52:51.962
you know rges               you 
know, having a stream lined 

02:52:52.415 --> 02:52:53.988
             stream        
streamlined check       checkout

02:52:53.989 --> 02:52:56.742
 experience is    is critical 
         critical for your 

02:52:56.743 --> 02:52:59.860
websites          websites to 
grow and for your business to 

02:52:59.861 --> 02:53:03.844
thrive        thrive.  We want 
to make it easier        easier 

02:53:03.845 --> 02:53:06.674
for you to make it easier       
 easier for your      your users

02:53:07.774 --> 02:53:10.674
       users to transact 
         transact online and not

02:53:11.033 --> 02:53:15.687
 have to deal with on    onerous
 forms       forms.  And we're 

02:53:15.688 --> 02:53:21.211
going to do that two     two 
ways.         ways.  First, 

02:53:21.212 --> 02:53:22.582
we're collaborating  
             collaborating with 

02:53:22.583 --> 02:53:25.622
the a major payment platform 
         platforms.  Last      

02:53:25.623 --> 02:53:27.880
Last year we announced          
 announced initiative           

02:53:27.881 --> 02:53:30.701
 initiatives with visa      visa
 and master      MasterCard

02:53:30.781 --> 02:53:34.559
            MasterCard.  And as 
you might have heard in Sr      

02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:36.433
 in Sridhar            in 
Sridhar's key neat earlier 

02:53:36.434 --> 02:53:39.294
                              in
 Sridhar's key note earlier 

02:53:40.401 --> 02:53:42.721
        earlier, we're adding 
       adding pay pal to that 

02:53:42.722 --> 02:53:45.071
list.  As we role out those 
integration             

02:53:45.072 --> 02:53:47.448
integrations, users will be   
      will be able to link 

02:53:47.449 --> 02:53:49.895
either visa      visa check
       checkout, master pass or 

02:53:49.896 --> 02:53:52.791
pay pal to their Android        
 Android pay account and they 

02:53:52.792 --> 02:53:55.397
will enjoy       enjoy a stream
        streamlined 

02:53:55.398 --> 02:53:56.616
authentication                
authentication and payment 

02:53:56.617 --> 02:53:59.442
        payment experience.  And
 the best      best part is    

02:53:59.443 --> 02:54:01.443
is they don't have to do any 
additional            additional

02:54:01.547 --> 02:54:03.547
 work.  If    If they're already
         already accepting 

02:54:03.651 --> 02:54:06.734
          accepting visa    Visa
 check       checkout, master 

02:54:06.918 --> 02:54:10.423
     Master pass    Pass or pay 
pal.  

02:54:10.424 --> 02:54:11.796
So let's       let's take a look
      look at how that works

02:54:11.797 --> 02:54:16.820
       works.        works.  
We flip the phone, please?  All 

02:54:16.821 --> 02:54:18.659
right       right.  
So it's starting          

02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:21.325
starting to get hot out there 
already         already.  Summer

02:54:21.326 --> 02:54:23.728
 is    is around the corner 
       corner.  And I'm     I'm 

02:54:23.729 --> 02:54:25.189
starting          starting to 
think about       about it's 

02:54:25.190 --> 02:54:27.827
time to spend some time around 
the pool      pool.  So what do

02:54:27.979 --> 02:54:30.975
         what do I like to have 
around the pool      pool?  

02:54:30.976 --> 02:54:33.630
Well, marg Rita      Ritas, 
that's for sure.  So earlier 

02:54:33.631 --> 02:54:37.601
today       today I went and 
started looking         looking 

02:54:37.602 --> 02:54:40.394
around for some m            for
 some Ma                    

02:54:40.395 --> 02:54:43.466
around for some margar        
margarita           margarita 

02:54:43.467 --> 02:54:48.216
mix and I have some in my 
shopping          shopping cart.

02:54:48.217 --> 02:54:52.300
  Williams Sonoma        Sonoma,
 great e-commerce            

02:54:52.301 --> 02:54:55.733
e-commerce site.  I think I have
 enough margarita economics  

02:54:55.940 --> 02:54:57.268
         economics and I'm     
I'm ready       ready to check 

02:54:57.269 --> 02:55:02.325
out.  Now I see a visa    Visa 
check       checkout button.  

02:55:02.326 --> 02:55:06.525
When I click that      that 
button, voila       voila I see 

02:55:06.526 --> 02:55:07.691
my visa cards already         
already.  I didn't          I 

02:55:07.692 --> 02:55:12.079
didn't have to enter in my user 
name or my pass      pass      

02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:13.799
password.  It's that simple  
      simple.  And the best     

02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:16.144
 best part is    is to finish 
       finish, I just apply 

02:55:16.234 --> 02:55:19.388
      apply my fingerprint, and 
voila       voila again, I'm    

02:55:20.452 --> 02:55:23.217
 I'm done.  Just a really 
fantastic           fantastic 

02:55:23.218 --> 02:55:25.910
experience.  And like I said, 
the best      best      best 

02:55:25.911 --> 02:55:27.911
part is    is, that

02:55:31.082 --> 02:55:37.135
      that Williams Sonoma 
already         already has visa

02:55:37.689 --> 02:55:38.731
      visa check did you 
                   visa check 

02:55:38.732 --> 02:55:41.367
      checkout, so when we real 
out the integration             

02:55:41.368 --> 02:55:42.711
integration, they'll         
they'll be ready       ready to 

02:55:42.712 --> 02:55:47.173
go.  Nothing else to do.      
But we're not stepping 

02:55:47.322 --> 02:55:48.660
                   we're not 
stopping          stopping 

02:55:48.661 --> 02:55:50.766
there.  As you probably         
 probably heard earlier today 

02:55:50.870 --> 02:55:54.891
      today, our users       
users have saved       saved 

02:55:54.892 --> 02:55:58.087
hundreds of millions of payment 
        payment instruments to 

02:55:58.088 --> 02:56:02.371
their       their Google 
account.  And they do that when 

02:56:02.372 --> 02:56:05.245
they're         they're making  
      making purchases on Google

02:56:06.269 --> 02:56:08.269
 play, on YouTube         
YouTube, or transacting 

02:56:08.412 --> 02:56:11.382
            transacting in 
Chrome        Chrome.  And the 

02:56:11.383 --> 02:56:14.480
benefit of that is    is that 
they get a simplified           

02:56:14.481 --> 02:56:17.106
 simplified check       checkout
 experience on future purchases.

02:56:17.107 --> 02:56:23.044
  It's really great experience. 
 So what if we could       could

02:56:23.631 --> 02:56:25.270
 bring that simplified 
           simplified check 

02:56:25.271 --> 02:56:28.420
      checkout experience to 
your apps and the website 

02:56:28.519 --> 02:56:32.113
        websites that you built 
      built.  Well, as hopefully

02:56:32.289 --> 02:56:33.967
           hopefully you heard 
in the earlier         earlier 

02:56:33.968 --> 02:56:35.784
key #2k9                  
earlier key     keynote, today 

02:56:35.785 --> 02:56:38.327
      today we announced 
          announced the Google 

02:56:38.328 --> 02:56:43.773
payment API     API.  And when 
you implement that API     API, 

02:56:43.774 --> 02:56:47.105
your customers will be         
will be able to quickly         

02:56:47.106 --> 02:56:49.596
quickly check out using       
using any of the cards       

02:56:49.597 --> 02:56:52.256
cards in their       their 
Google account.  Just super 

02:56:52.257 --> 02:56:55.102
simple        simple.  And 
that's going to work, as I said,

02:56:55.103 --> 02:57:00.337
 in apps      apps, on the web, 
and as you'll see in a bit, the 

02:57:00.338 --> 02:57:02.872
assistant           assistant.  
So let's       let's take a look

02:57:03.024 --> 02:57:06.769
      look at that.  
I'm       

02:57:06.770 --> 02:57:10.389
I'm going to pop over here.  
Rand let's               

02:57:10.464 --> 02:57:12.880
         over      over here.  
And I'm     I'm going to fire up

02:57:14.009 --> 02:57:17.765
 one of my favorite apps, the 
wish app.  And wish has been 

02:57:17.766 --> 02:57:19.785
testing         testing this API
     API with us    us over the 

02:57:19.786 --> 02:57:22.115
last      last couple of months.
  And so I was talking about 

02:57:22.273 --> 02:57:27.486
      about summer.  The pool
      pool, I need some pool  

02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:30.923
    pool toys.  I love this 
inflatable lounge        

02:57:30.924 --> 02:57:34.446
lounger.  But unfortunately last
      last year I jump      

02:57:34.447 --> 02:57:37.533
jumped off the diving board, 
belly flopped on to the lounge  

02:57:37.957 --> 02:57:41.872
      lounger and popped it so I
 need another one.  Fraef 

02:57:42.382 --> 02:57:44.109
            one.  
So I have it in my shopping 

02:57:44.110 --> 02:57:45.029
         shopping cart already
         already ready       

02:57:45.030 --> 02:57:47.817
ready to go.  And if    if I see
 at the bottom of the screen 

02:57:47.818 --> 02:57:53.102
there is a pay with Google 
button.  When I click that 

02:57:53.103 --> 02:57:57.039
button, I see one of the last   
   last card that I used      

02:57:57.040 --> 02:58:00.577
used, but if    if I click 
further, I can see all the cards

02:58:01.119 --> 02:58:03.720
       cards in my Google 
account, including           

02:58:03.721 --> 02:58:06.285
including those that I added 
through an                  

02:58:06.286 --> 02:58:11.162
added through Android         
Android pay   Pay.  Hit 

02:58:11.163 --> 02:58:14.275
continue, and voila       voila 
again, transaction is    is 

02:58:14.276 --> 02:58:16.276
complete.  
[ Applause ]

02:58:19.459 --> 02:58:19.799
  .  Hit continue, and voila 
again, transaction is complete. 

02:58:20.006 --> 02:58:21.677
It's really fantastic           
fantastic.  Super simple        

02:58:21.678 --> 02:58:25.061
simple.  Love it.  
So in the next few months we're 

02:58:25.062 --> 02:58:28.609
going to be piloting          
piloting the Google payment API

02:58:28.755 --> 02:58:30.686
     API with a number of 
leading merchants           

02:58:30.687 --> 02:58:36.685
merchants and apps      apps, 
and we want all of you to be 

02:58:36.686 --> 02:58:39.797
able to pilot       pilot this 
app and implement           

02:58:39.798 --> 02:58:42.179
implement it and to accelerate 
that process, we're partnering  

02:58:42.273 --> 02:58:43.742

 API and what fantastic 

02:59:03.886 --> 02:59:07.760
          fantastic conversion

02:59:07.962 --> 02:59:09.549
 we're going to be uploading 
          uploading our 

02:59:09.550 --> 02:59:11.026

meantime          meantime I 

02:59:12.974 --> 02:59:17.309
encourage you all to go to

 available so you can get going.
        going.  

02:59:30.741 --> 02:59:32.867
Now as I've mentioned, this also
 works       works on websites

all to go get a cup of coffee 
       coffee, free on us    us.

02:59:42.292 --> 02:59:46.964
  You don't have to pay for I

up that early       early, and 

02:59:54.272 --> 02:59:57.399
I'll be up that early       
early.  I'll be there.  We have 

02:59:57.400 --> 02:59:59.400

 there.        there.  

03:00:09.773 --> 03:00:12.200
So now that yeef               
now that you've seen how easy it

03:00:12.352 --> 03:00:13.877
 is to do the transactions  
            transactions on the 

03:00:13.878 --> 03:00:18.939
web and in app sz,            in
 app s       apps, let's       

03:00:18.940 --> 03:00:21.243
let's talk about       about how
 seamless          seamless the 

03:00:21.244 --> 03:00:24.176
transactions can be        can 
be in the the assistant  

03:00:24.555 --> 03:00:27.321
         assistant.  I hope a 
lot of you here in the crowd own

03:00:27.541 --> 03:00:30.261
 a Google home, and if you do, 
you've hopefully           

03:00:30.262 --> 03:00:31.751
hopefully had the opportunity
             opportunity to buy 

03:00:31.752 --> 03:00:36.082
every       everyday essentials 
from      from over 50 merchants

03:00:36.303 --> 03:00:37.490
           merchants, including 
          including whole foods 

03:00:37.491 --> 03:00:39.516
      foods and Walgreens 
          Walgreens.  Soon we're

03:00:39.736 --> 03:00:42.228
 going to be adding even      
even more merchants who     who 

03:00:42.229 --> 03:00:45.177
have integrated            
integrated with      with our 

03:00:45.178 --> 03:00:50.194
Google shopping API     APIs.   

03:00:50.195 --> 03:00:52.558
But       
But we're taking        taking 

03:00:52.559 --> 03:00:56.968
it one step further.  We're also
      also going to enable you 

03:00:56.969 --> 03:00:59.627
all to build purchase actions.  
                   purchase 

03:00:59.628 --> 03:01:01.264
actions with the assistant    
       assistant.  And in case 

03:01:01.265 --> 03:01:06.523
you didn't        didn't see it
    it, at the last session, 

03:01:06.524 --> 03:01:11.674
here's how it works       works.
  So the user simply says I want

03:01:12.241 --> 03:01:14.718
 to talk to Pan        to Panera
           to Panera.  They 

03:01:14.719 --> 03:01:18.519
specify         specify what 
they want to order.  Panera  

03:01:18.815 --> 03:01:20.099
      Panera might even      
even suggest some drinks        

03:01:20.100 --> 03:01:24.020
drinks that they might want to 
go with that order.  And then 

03:01:24.950 --> 03:01:27.003
     then the user is    is able
 to complete the transaction 

03:01:27.004 --> 03:01:29.004
using       using the cards 
      cards in their       their

03:01:29.526 --> 03:01:32.838
 Google account and authenticate
 with their finger        finger

03:01:33.850 --> 03:01:35.837
print.  That simple        
simple.  Fantastic           

03:01:35.838 --> 03:01:39.987
Fantastic experience.  
So now you see how we're making

03:01:40.177 --> 03:01:44.414
        making the assistant an 
even      even greater platform

customers a better in-     
in-store experience.  

03:04:05.694 --> 03:04:06.923
           experience.  
At the center        center of 

03:04:06.924 --> 03:04:12.904
it all is loyalty         
loyalty.  Loyalty is    is a 

03:04:12.905 --> 03:04:16.443
connection between you, the 
merchant, and your customers.  

03:04:16.598 --> 03:04:19.873

 like to help you one, with 
enrollment            

03:04:29.050 --> 03:04:35.181

 loyalty programs to Android 

03:04:35.264 --> 03:04:37.108
        Android pay   Pay users 
      users and signing them  

03:04:37.109 --> 03:04:38.211
    them up.  
Two       

03:04:38.212 --> 03:04:39.846
Two, with engagement 
                with engagement 

03:04:39.847 --> 03:04:41.639
           engagement.  Once the
 Android         Android pay 

03:04:41.640 --> 03:04:43.607
  Pay user has your loyalty 
        loyalty card associated 

03:04:43.608 --> 03:04:47.982
in their account, being       
being able to

03:04:51.938 --> 03:04:54.349
 push to them that are     are

earning of loyalty points       

03:04:58.239 --> 03:05:00.959
 points and offer       offers. 
 So that just with a simple 

03:05:01.239 --> 03:05:07.562
       simple NFC tap, what we 
call a smart tap, the user with 

03:05:07.563 --> 03:05:11.244
Android         Android pay can 
transmit loyalty         loyalty

03:05:11.245 --> 03:05:14.270
 and offer       offer 
information just as easily as 

03:05:14.271 --> 03:05:17.063
they paid today       today with
 Android         Android Pay    

03:05:17.064 --> 03:05:19.353
 Pay.  So let's look      look 
at each of these three 

03:05:19.354 --> 03:05:21.354
individually              
individually.   

03:05:26.758 --> 03:05:29.663
        Android Pay     Pay 
user.  And I need to go to 

03:05:29.664 --> 03:05:33.136
Walgreens           Walgreens to
 pick up some shampoo         

03:05:33.137 --> 03:05:36.181
shampoo.  It's for my daughter 
         daughter, of course.  

03:05:36.182 --> 03:05:38.182
[ Laughter ]

03:05:41.594 --> 03:05:43.828
    Pay will send the following 
notification              

03:05:43.829 --> 03:05:47.360
notification.  It says fast     
 faster check       checkout at 

03:05:47.361 --> 03:05:50.656
Walgreens           Walgreens.  
Add your balance for an easier 

03:05:50.784 --> 03:05:54.418
       easier way to save.  
Balance rewards is    is a 

03:05:54.419 --> 03:05:56.089
loyalty         loyalty program 
for Walgreens           

03:05:56.090 --> 03:05:57.104
Walgreens and Walgreens  
         Walgreens has 

03:05:57.105 --> 03:05:59.799
implemented             
implemented our smart tap 

03:05:59.800 --> 03:06:02.239
technology at their payment 
        payment terminals.  So 

03:06:02.240 --> 03:06:03.907
with one tap on this 
notification              

03:06:03.908 --> 03:06:06.598
notification and a few things 
       things in the Android   

03:06:06.972 --> 03:06:08.655
      Android pay 57 
               Android pay app, 

03:06:08.656 --> 03:06:10.786
we can easily sign up the 
Android         Android pay user

03:06:11.525 --> 03:06:13.842
 for the rewards         rewards
 program.  So super exciting  

03:06:14.211 --> 03:06:16.119
        exciting.  But we ever
      ever taken       taken it 

03:06:16.120 --> 03:06:18.120
a step further. 

03:06:22.825 --> 03:06:24.952
 Say I'm     I'm a balance 
rewards         rewards member 

03:06:24.953 --> 03:06:26.625
and I'm     I'm an Android 
        Android pay user.  But 

03:06:26.626 --> 03:06:27.945
you haven't             you 
haven't connected           

03:06:27.946 --> 03:06:30.491
connected my balance rewards 
        rewards card to my an 

03:06:30.492 --> 03:06:33.466
Android         Android pay.  So
 let's       let's move to the 

03:06:33.467 --> 03:06:35.467
demo      demo. 

03:06:44.320 --> 03:06:46.320
 The second cast. 

03:07:05.575 --> 03:07:07.575
 There we go.  Great. 

03:07:20.893 --> 03:07:23.203
 Let me try some magic here. 

03:07:38.216 --> 03:07:41.683
 There uh-uh   -uh             
There you go.  These are demo 

03:07:41.684 --> 03:07:44.273
slides        slides, I guess.  
Perfect         Perfect.  

03:07:44.274 --> 03:07:48.475
So we're on cast 2 now.  So now 
I'm buying        buying a bag 

03:07:48.476 --> 03:07:52.294
of nuts and I have to remember 
my phone number here. 

03:08:00.926 --> 03:08:04.069
 I it was a land line that I had
 four years       years ago. 

03:08:08.237 --> 03:08:10.237
 Now I tap

03:08:17.486 --> 03:08:22.056
 so now I've tapped the pay but 
I've entered my information 

03:08:22.057 --> 03:08:23.886
manually          manually.  
Wouldn't          Wouldn't it be

03:08:23.887 --> 03:08:26.683
 magical if    if I was somehow 
        somehow told that I can 

03:08:26.684 --> 03:08:29.812
somehow         somehow add this
 balance rewards         rewards

03:08:30.029 --> 03:08:32.029
 card that I have entered 
        entered into Android 

03:08:32.066 --> 03:08:33.070
        Android automatically 
              automatically.  

03:08:33.071 --> 03:08:36.034
Wow     Wow, that's pretty cool.
  We just got notification from

03:08:36.537 --> 03:08:39.496
      from an Android         
Android pay.  And with a single 

03:08:39.497 --> 03:08:44.590
click in the app, we can now 
save this balance rewards   

03:08:44.676 --> 03:08:47.224
      rewards card that I used
      used manually          

03:08:47.225 --> 03:08:51.189
manually into an Android pay so 
some subsequent visits 

03:08:53.023 --> 03:08:54.371
                 so on 
subsequent visits        visits 

03:08:54.372 --> 03:09:00.666
I don't have to punch in my 
phone number and remember what 

03:09:00.667 --> 03:09:02.667
it was years       years ago. 

03:09:06.789 --> 03:09:09.036
     ago.  
So second pillar        pillar 

03:09:09.037 --> 03:09:11.384
of loyalty         loyalty and 
the second area      area we

03:09:32.074 --> 03:09:34.129
 For this we have another demo

 What I'll do is    is I'll save

in many countries           

03:13:47.837 --> 03:13:50.073
countries worldwide           
worldwide.  Now, we'll be 

03:13:50.074 --> 03:13:52.668
supporting            supporting
 smart tap in two        in two 

03:13:52.669 --> 03:13:55.600
ways.  First, in our open 
payments playoff  

03:13:55.765 --> 03:13:56.708
                payments 
platform          platform.  

03:13:56.709 --> 03:13:59.083
This allow       allows these 
devices here that I'll demo     

03:13:59.321 --> 03:14:02.748
 demo here in a moment to be 
able to do smart tap 

03:14:02.749 --> 03:14:04.355
interactions              
interactions.  And so we're also

03:14:04.356 --> 03:14:06.356
      also happy to announce 
that two     two of our partners

03:14:07.147 --> 03:14:10.001
          partners, shop keep 
and by    bypass mobile will be

03:14:10.809 --> 03:14:12.576
         will be building 
         building smart-        

03:14:12.577 --> 03:14:14.420
smart-tap enabled experiences 
through the clover platform 

03:14:14.421 --> 03:14:17.333
         platform.  
Secondly            

03:14:17.334 --> 03:14:18.947
Secondly, the clover      Clover

03:14:18.948 --> 03:14:21.837

products          products, 

03:14:21.838 --> 03:14:23.305
through that suite       suite 
of products          products 

03:14:23.306 --> 03:14:26.775
we'll       we'll be enabling 
         enabling smart tap 

03:14:26.776 --> 03:14:28.193
technology to a vast      vast 
array            vast array 

03:14:28.194 --> 03:14:29.841
      array of our small 
businesses            businesses

03:14:29.842 --> 03:14:33.228
 in the U.S.        U.S.  We've 
shipped over 5 hundred thousand 

03:14:33.317 --> 03:14:34.843
                   500,000 
devices to small businesses 

03:14:34.844 --> 03:14:36.511
           businesses in the 
U.S.        U.S.  And through 

03:14:36.512 --> 03:14:38.774
this consumers           
consumers and merchants will 

03:14:38.775 --> 03:14:40.821
have some fantastic           
fantastic users       users 

03:14:41.007 --> 03:14:43.132
experiences.  
Now, there's         there's 

03:14:43.133 --> 03:14:47.906
three things about       about 
smart tap     tap that I really 

03:14:47.907 --> 03:14:50.725
like.  First is    is simplicity
            simplicity.  It 

03:14:50.726 --> 03:14:54.613
doesn't get simpler than      
than tapping         tapping to 

03:14:54.614 --> 03:14:58.292
earn, redeem and pay.  It can 
hardly        hardly be simpler.

03:14:59.683 --> 03:15:02.104
real value for merchants 
          merchants.  When a 

03:15:02.105 --> 03:15:05.544
customer          customer 
         customer enrolls 

03:15:05.545 --> 03:15:07.091
through         through smart 
tap, what the merchant will be 

03:15:07.092 --> 03:15:09.575
        will be able to do is   
 is push offer       offer s   

03:15:09.935 --> 03:15:14.751
      offers and rewards        
 rewards collectly into an drad 

03:15:15.593 --> 03:15:17.139
                       collectly
 into Android         Android 

03:15:17.140 --> 03:15:19.140
pay   Pay for those consumers  
         consumers.  It can also

03:15:19.297 --> 03:15:21.052
      also send offer       
offers, if    if you say you 

03:15:21.053 --> 03:15:22.308
have a lapsed        lapsed 
customer          customer and 

03:15:22.309 --> 03:15:25.385
you want to incent them      
them to come back to your store.

03:15:25.386 --> 03:15:28.000
          store.  So and it's 
really a marketing           

03:15:28.001 --> 03:15:30.001
marketing technology that I 
personally            personally

03:15:30.596 --> 03:15:34.923
 want.  It's both convenient   
         convenient and it's in 

03:15:34.924 --> 03:15:38.969
context.  So last      lastly, 
it also      also does one other

03:15:38.970 --> 03:15:41.664
 thing       thing.  It enables 
all sorts       sorts of other 

03:15:41.665 --> 03:15:43.004
innovation            
innovation.  You can imagine a 

03:15:43.005 --> 03:15:45.765
scenario          scenario where
 you buy something online, it 

03:15:45.766 --> 03:15:47.964
could be on the mobile web, it 
could be in a native        

03:15:47.965 --> 03:15:50.899
native app, and say you buy it 
online and then      then you 

03:15:50.900 --> 03:15:55.993
want to redeem in store, pick it
 up instore.  You can save to 

03:15:55.994 --> 03:15:58.281
Android         Android pay 
  Pay, come in and tap to 

03:15:58.282 --> 03:16:00.804
present         present proof of
 purchase.  There's         

03:16:00.805 --> 03:16:02.609
There's many other things       
 things that we've been thinking

03:16:02.610 --> 03:16:05.357
 about       about online to 
offline commerce          

03:16:05.358 --> 03:16:07.541
commerce that are really enabled
         enabled by this. 

03:16:10.710 --> 03:16:12.908
 So need to build anything 
         anything that touches 

03:16:12.909 --> 03:16:14.894
consumers           consumers on
 the other side of the county  

03:16:14.895 --> 03:16:17.256

Thank you, John.  

03:16:25.564 --> 03:16:26.835
[ Applause ] 
At this point I know two things 

03:16:26.836 --> 03:16:29.431
       things for certain about 
      about every member of the 

03:16:29.432 --> 03:16:30.892
audience          audience here.
  One, everyone          

03:16:30.893 --> 03:16:34.990
everyone can use a snack       
snack, right?  And number two 

03:16:35.718 --> 03:16:37.718
    two, everyone          
everyone wants to check out some

03:16:37.809 --> 03:16:40.375
 of these loyalty         
loyalty features in Android 

03:16:40.493 --> 03:16:43.691
        Android pay   Pay that 
we've been talking about       

03:16:43.692 --> 03:16:46.408
about.  Of course, right?  So 
we've got something special for 

03:16:46.409 --> 03:16:49.992
you.  We've create        
created a game called tap for 

03:16:49.993 --> 03:16:53.790
treats        treats.  All you 
have to do is download          

03:16:53.791 --> 03:16:58.649
download the I/    I/O loyalty 
        loyalty card from   

03:16:58.734 --> 03:17:03.025
        card and you have to 
find the clover      Clover 

03:17:03.026 --> 03:17:05.777
smart tap terminals around the 
venue       venue and if    if 

03:17:05.778 --> 03:17:09.768
you find all five      five of 
these terminals, you will get a 

03:17:09.769 --> 03:17:13.823
limited         limited edition 
Android         Android robot 

03:17:13.824 --> 03:17:15.824
that look      looks like me.  
[ Laughter ] 

03:17:19.193 --> 03:17:20.630
    ]
It's not sold in stores        

03:17:20.631 --> 03:17:23.340
stores.  So I highly        
highly encourage you do that.  

03:17:23.341 --> 03:17:25.517
And I would like to see if    if
 John could       could show us

03:17:25.761 --> 03:17:28.039
    us    us how the smart tap 
works

03:17:31.583 --> 03:17:33.275
 on a clover      Clover 
terminal 

03:17:33.276 --> 03:17:35.395
&gt;&gt;               terminal 
SPEAKER:              

03:17:35.396 --> 03:17:39.679
SPEAKER:  Sure.  What I have 
here is    is a tap for treats 

03:17:39.843 --> 03:17:40.897
       treats.  Here I have a 
customer          customer 

03:17:40.898 --> 03:17:43.767
facing        facing device.  It
 happens to be based on clover 

03:17:43.842 --> 03:17:47.506
     Clover OS.  And then      
then on this side is    is our 

03:17:47.507 --> 03:17:48.426
merchant-           
merchant-facing                 

03:17:48.427 --> 03:17:52.591
merchant-facing device.  So is 
I'm     I'm going to take this. 

03:17:52.592 --> 03:17:55.310
 I'm     I'm simply going to 
hold this here.  I'm     I'm 

03:17:55.311 --> 03:17:57.665
going to tap, you'll see here 
     here and that it welcome   

03:17:57.761 --> 03:17:59.761
      welcomes me by name. 

03:18:04.685 --> 03:18:06.377
 One thing       thing I forget 
       forget to mention that I 

03:18:06.378 --> 03:18:08.386
love about       about smart tap
 is    is it enables additional

03:18:08.844 --> 03:18:10.264
            additional 
personalization                 

03:18:10.265 --> 03:18:12.424
personalization at point of sale
      sale.  Over here on the 

03:18:12.425 --> 03:18:14.041
merchant side this is    is a 
prototype           prototype 

03:18:14.042 --> 03:18:17.585
and what will certainly improve 
this, but it has my name here.  

03:18:17.586 --> 03:18:19.450
You can imagine you can do 
things        things like pull 

03:18:19.451 --> 03:18:21.451
up my previous order, the mrnt

03:18:24.633 --> 03:18:27.410
                 order, the 
merchant can greet me by name 

03:18:27.411 --> 03:18:30.104
and ask     ask me if    if I 
want my usual.  I'm     I'm 

03:18:30.105 --> 03:18:31.725
going to check on it 
               to check out real

03:18:31.726 --> 03:18:33.726

 user get things done, whenever 
they are.  In the home and on 

03:45:35.040 --> 03:45:37.773
the go.  
Patrick and AJ have talked about

03:45:35.040 --> 03:45:38.840
 messaging and media apps for 
integrating with auto, the 

03:45:35.040 --> 03:45:36.092
templated and notifications apps
 in AJ's pyramid that want to 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:40.226
show a UI.  There are tons of 
other aps that don't fall under 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:39.759
these categories.  How can you 
as a developer get your 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:39.693
experience in the car without 
having to deal with the 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:40.026
complexity of building a full 
automotive app and having to 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:39.759
accommodate different screen 
sizes, various inputs and 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:38.293
outputs?  
If your service can be 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:40.359
voice-centric in the car and you
 want a lightweight integration 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:40.226
for reaching these users, then 
the Google Assistant is a good 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:39.626
option.  How do you build for 
the Google Assistant?  

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:39.893
Actions On Google is the 
platform for developers to build

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:40.293
 for the Google Assistant.  The 
platform will allow developers 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:39.893
to reach users wherever the 
assistant is available.  The 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:40.359
platform uses cloud execution so
 users don't need to pre-install

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:40.026
 any app when they ask for your 
service by name, you'll be 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:40.159
connected immediately.  Many 
developers are already building 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:40.159
for Actions On Google.  When 
building for Actions On Google, 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:39.959
there are three key pieces that 
need to be defined by the 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:39.493
developer.    Invocation 
triggers, dialogs         

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:38.493
dialog, and 
fulfillment             

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:40.359
fulfillment.  Let me illustrate 
with an example.  I like coding 

03:45:36.093 --> 03:45:36.190
and I like fortune cookies.  So 
I want to build a service that 

03:45:36.191 --> 03:45:39.524
gives me a daily dose of coding 
fortune cookies.  

03:45:36.191 --> 03:45:40.324
So the first step is I needed to
 find my invocation trigger.  

03:45:36.191 --> 03:45:36.338
How does the user connect to my 
service?  What do they actually 

03:45:36.339 --> 03:45:40.605
have to say?  In this case I'll 
make it simple, whenever the use

03:45:36.339 --> 03:45:36.429
 arer says talking coding 
fortune cookie, then the Google 

03:45:36.430 --> 03:45:39.630
Assistant will connect the user 
to my service.  

03:45:36.430 --> 03:45:40.563
The next step is dialogs.  So 
once the user is connected to my

03:45:36.430 --> 03:45:40.696
 service, how do I talk to them?
  What kind of information am I 

03:45:36.430 --> 03:45:36.519
asking and what kind of 
responses am I expecting?  What 

03:45:36.520 --> 03:45:40.586
are valid responses and what are
 invalid responses?  In this 

03:45:36.520 --> 03:45:36.611
case I'm going make it a simple 
question do they want a Java or 

03:45:36.612 --> 03:45:40.145
a C + + fortune cookie.  So 
there are only two valid 

03:45:36.612 --> 03:45:36.694
responseness this case.  So 
let's suppose that the user 

03:45:36.695 --> 03:45:40.428
picked Java.  We can move on to 
the third step which is 

03:45:36.695 --> 03:45:36.791
fulfillment.  For fulfillment I 
have all the information that I 

03:45:36.792 --> 03:45:40.658
need, so how do I go about 
committing that transaction or 

03:45:36.792 --> 03:45:41.058
computing that action on behalf 
of the user so in this case I'm 

03:45:36.792 --> 03:45:36.892
going to look in my bank of Java
 fortunes and I'm going to pick 

03:45:36.893 --> 03:45:36.981
one out for today.  Random one. 

03:45:36.982 --> 03:45:37.079
Today's fortune says Codefucious
 says for true happiness, prefer

03:45:37.080 --> 03:45:40.946
 interfaces over abstract 
classes.  That's one I actually 

03:45:37.080 --> 03:45:40.013
use every day.  
That's a high level view of 

03:45:37.080 --> 03:45:41.280
Actions On Google.  The Google 
assistant and Actions On Google 

03:45:37.080 --> 03:45:37.170
are coming to Android Auto and 
will open up a wide possibility 

03:45:37.171 --> 03:45:40.971
of use cases.  Agents and 
services that are built on top 

03:45:37.171 --> 03:45:41.237
of the platform will transfer 
over.  If you think that users 

03:45:37.171 --> 03:45:37.272
will interact with your agent or
 service in the car, it's a good

03:45:37.273 --> 03:45:37.419
 idea to start thinking about 
what is the user experience that

03:45:37.420 --> 03:45:40.753
 you want to build for that 
special context.  One 

03:45:37.420 --> 03:45:41.553
car-specific consideration is 
safety and driver distraction.  

03:45:37.420 --> 03:45:37.519
How can you build a user 
experience that both minimizes 

03:45:37.520 --> 03:45:41.320
driver distraction and alaw 
users to get things done and 

03:45:37.520 --> 03:45:37.697
stay entertained.  
Let's think about potential use 

03:45:37.698 --> 03:45:41.698
cases for engaging with users in
 the car.  What is possible 

03:45:37.698 --> 03:45:40.298
here?  
One idea is reservations.  It's 

03:45:37.698 --> 03:45:37.788
a Friday night and I'm meeting 
up with my husband for dinner.  

03:45:37.789 --> 03:45:42.055
We pick out a restaurant and on 
the way there I would love to be

03:45:37.789 --> 03:45:41.989
 able to say, book a table, and 
have that table waiting for me 

03:45:37.789 --> 03:45:37.888
by the time I get there.  What 
would be even more 

03:45:37.889 --> 03:45:41.422
awesome         awesome and 
magical is if the Google 

03:45:37.889 --> 03:45:37.981
Assistant and that third-party 
service can suggest a good 

03:45:37.982 --> 03:45:38.058
reservation time that takes into
 account my location, traffic, 

03:45:38.059 --> 03:45:42.325
and maybe parking availability. 
 So I make a make a reservation 

03:45:38.059 --> 03:45:38.241
for a time I can definitely 
make.  

03:45:38.242 --> 03:45:42.508
Another idea is food ordering.  
I'm working late on a week night

03:45:38.242 --> 03:45:42.375
 and I'm too lazy to cook.  On 
my way home I would love to be 

03:45:38.242 --> 03:45:42.175
able to put in an order at my 
favorite restaurant and have 

03:45:38.242 --> 03:45:38.341
that food delivered and arrived 
at my home by the time I get 

03:45:38.342 --> 03:45:41.142
there.  Saves on time, saves on 
cooking.  

03:45:38.342 --> 03:45:38.416
Like I mentioned earlier, how 
many times have you driven away 

03:45:38.417 --> 03:45:42.283
from your house and can't 
remember whether you've actually

03:45:38.417 --> 03:45:42.417
 locked the front door?  It 
would be very cool if you could 

03:45:38.417 --> 03:45:38.518
say okay Google, check my door. 
 Or did I lock my door?  Just 

03:45:38.519 --> 03:45:41.052
lock it.  
Another one is lights.  I'm 

03:45:38.519 --> 03:45:42.785
driving home and I actually hate
 walking into a dark house.  I'm

03:45:38.519 --> 03:45:38.603
 actually afraid of the dark.  
It would be great if from the 

03:45:38.604 --> 03:45:42.537
car I could say turn on my 
living room lights or turn on my

03:45:38.604 --> 03:45:38.691
 dining room lights and I never 
have to walk into a dark house 

03:45:38.692 --> 03:45:41.225
again.  
Games and entertainment.  How 

03:45:38.692 --> 03:45:38.790
many times have you been on long
 road trips with kids where you 

03:45:38.791 --> 03:45:42.924
struggle to find a way to keep 
them entertained?  Wouldn't it 

03:45:38.791 --> 03:45:38.965
be awesome if you could say okay
 Google, entertain my kids and 

03:45:38.966 --> 03:45:42.299
have games that are 
age-appropriate for different 

03:45:38.966 --> 03:45:42.499
kids so they can play whatever 
they want.  They stay 

03:45:38.966 --> 03:45:41.766
entertained and I can focus on 
the road.  

03:45:38.966 --> 03:45:43.032
These are just some ideas       
ideas on ways developers can 

03:45:38.966 --> 03:45:39.064
engage with users       users in
 the car.  I look forward to 

03:45:39.065 --> 03:45:43.331
what creative          creative 
ideas you come up with.         

03:45:39.065 --> 03:45:39.151
with.  Please check out the 
Actions On Google site where 

03:45:39.152 --> 03:45:43.285
there are actually code samples 
and tools       tools to help 

03:45:39.152 --> 03:45:39.230
you build the dialog and 
triggers and fulfillment steps 

03:45:39.231 --> 03:45:43.497
so that makes it easier to bring
 up your service.  We also have 

03:45:39.231 --> 03:45:39.327
demos at the IoT and Android 
domes.  We'll actually be 

03:45:39.328 --> 03:45:43.194

 that I just talked about 

03:45:39.328 --> 03:45:39.417
including controlling Hue lights
 and August door locks directly 

03:45:39.418 --> 03:45:39.521

It's really exciting to see a 
new way for developers to easily

03:45:39.522 --> 03:45:39.691
 extend their services into 
cars.  With conversational voice

03:45:39.692 --> 03:45:39.806
new types of apps in use cases. 
 You also heard from AJ how 

03:45:39.807 --> 03:45:43.607
media and messaging apps can 
extend through the car in a 

03:45:39.807 --> 03:45:43.940

about to get a whole lot bigger 

03:45:40.227 --> 03:45:44.360
with the Google Assistant.  With
 10x growth in users over the

03:45:40.227 --> 03:45:44.293
 directly into their cars, we 
know that developers are going 

03:45:40.227 --> 03:45:40.405
to have plenty of eager drivers 
out there who want to stay

03:48:00.001 --> 03:48:03.346
SPEAKER:  Welcome         
Welcome to Google IO.  Hope you 

03:48:03.347 --> 03:48:07.134
have a great time.  
You're        You're still a 

03:48:07.135 --> 03:48:11.544
wave        awave my name is 
Alex Danilo        Danilo. 

03:48:15.200 --> 03:48:17.930
 #50i78 very              .  I'm
 very      very excited about 

03:48:17.931 --> 03:48:22.635
WebAssembly             
WebAssembly.  Even though       

03:48:23.038 --> 03:48:24.971
 though I love JavaScript 
           JavaScript as I'm

03:48:24.972 --> 03:48:26.573
        as I'm sure most      
most of you do, I have to 

03:48:26.574 --> 03:48:28.431
confess I'm     I'm a real 
performance             

03:48:28.432 --> 03:48:30.379
performance freak.  So I love 
native        native code 

03:48:30.380 --> 03:48:31.997
juch                  native 
code just as much      much.  

03:48:31.998 --> 03:48:33.860
The beauty about WebAssembly is 
   is that it lets      lets 

03:48:33.861 --> 03:48:36.280
developer           developers 
compile from      from C and C 

03:48:36.281 --> 03:48:43.433
plus plus      plus or other 
languages into that we can loud 

03:48:43.434 --> 03:48:46.063
into a web browse        
browser. 

03:48:50.637 --> 03:48:53.031
         browser.  
Okay.  So why     why?  Why     

03:48:53.032 --> 03:48:55.056
Why do we even      even have 
WebAssembly             

03:48:55.057 --> 03:48:56.319
WebAssembly?  I can tell you 
probably          probably 

03:48:56.320 --> 03:48:58.668
wondering why     why you're
        you're at this session. 

03:48:58.669 --> 03:49:00.795
 The thing about JavaScript is 
because         because it's a 

03:49:00.796 --> 03:49:06.706
dynamic         dynamic ly
            dynamically typed  

03:49:06.794 --> 03:49:08.226
     typed language there are 
limits        limits.  Over the 

03:49:08.227 --> 03:49:11.218
past      past few years       
years the engine        engines 

03:49:11.219 --> 03:49:13.302
have done amazing things        
things to puch                

03:49:13.303 --> 03:49:15.042
things to push the envelope
          envelope of 

03:49:15.043 --> 03:49:17.148
performance             
performance. 

03:49:32.828 --> 03:49:34.089
             performance.  
When you think about       about

03:49:34.090 --> 03:49:36.319
 progressive             
progressive web apps      apps 

03:49:36.320 --> 03:49:39.643
as a kind of switch towards a 
native        native app like 

03:49:39.644 --> 03:49:41.721
experience, it's about       
about better you are, it's 

03:49:41.722 --> 03:49:42.191
about       about higher 
performance             

03:49:42.192 --> 03:49:44.192
performance.  One of the things 
       things, one of the       

03:49:44.665 --> 03:49:45.951
 of the bottle        bottle
necks is    is the JavaScript

03:49:45.952 --> 03:49:48.921
            JavaScript.  So are 
there any abnormal   

03:49:49.142 --> 03:49:51.044
                 there       
there any native        native 

03:49:51.045 --> 03:49:53.040
app developer           
developers in the crowd?  A show

03:49:53.041 --> 03:49:56.502
 of hands.  Not too much 
                     hands.  Not

03:49:56.503 --> 03:49:58.503
 too many      many. 

03:50:00.726 --> 03:50:03.379
 There are many millions of app 
developer           developers 

03:50:03.380 --> 03:50:05.605
out in the world.  They're using
       using C + +

03:50:06.249 --> 03:50:10.449
higher performance.  One of the 
things, one of the bottlenecks 

03:50:06.249 --> 03:50:10.382
is the JavaScript.  So are there
 any native app developers in 

03:50:06.249 --> 03:50:10.249
the crowd?  A show of hands.  
Not too many.  There are many 

03:50:06.249 --> 03:50:10.449
millions of app developers out 
in the world.  They're using C +

03:50:06.249 --> 03:50:08.030
 +.  They are very      very 
great library         libraries 

03:50:08.031 --> 03:50:10.371
for image       image processing
            processing.  All 

03:50:10.372 --> 03:50:12.440
this kind of thing       thing. 
 Now imagine how it would be if

03:50:12.617 --> 03:50:14.425
    if you could       could 
take your existing          

03:50:14.426 --> 03:50:17.125
existing application code for 
your an drad                  

03:50:17.126 --> 03:50:19.345
for your Android         Android
 app or whatever and cross 

03:50:19.346 --> 03:50:20.864
compile         compile it to 
deploy        deploy in a 

03:50:20.865 --> 03:50:23.627
browse        browser.  That's 
what WebAssembly is    is.  It 

03:50:23.628 --> 03:50:26.463
lets      lets you take existing
          existing C plis

03:50:26.728 --> 03:50:27.416
                 existing C + +

03:50:27.924 --> 03:50:31.990
it would be if you could take 
your existing application code 

03:50:27.924 --> 03:50:32.190
for your Android app or whatever
 and cross compile it to deploy 

03:50:27.924 --> 03:50:31.657
in a browser.  That's what 
WebAssembly is.  It lets you 

03:50:27.924 --> 03:50:29.668
take existing C + + code deploy 
       deploy it in a brouds

03:50:29.669 --> 03:50:37.875
        broudser and have it run
 what's exciting is    is all 

03:50:37.876 --> 03:50:41.809
the engine        engines are 
doing it.  You don't have to 

03:50:37.876 --> 03:50:42.215
rewrite         rewrite your 
code      code.  Okay.  So I 

03:50:42.216 --> 03:50:45.281
just want to start       start 
with a little interdution 

03:50:45.382 --> 03:50:45.770
                   little 
introduction              

03:50:45.771 --> 03:50:51.909
introduction to have    have. 
Now take this tiny      tiny 

03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:54.280
little function here.  Let's
       Let's just add in two 

03:50:54.281 --> 03:50:56.281
things together and     and 
running it    it.  This is 

03:50:56.594 --> 03:50:57.825
                         and run
 Republicaning                  

03:50:57.826 --> 03:51:03.128
     and returnling it.  Can nen
              it.  Can anyone 

03:51:03.129 --> 03:51:05.058
here guess what happens when 
JavaScript            JavaScript

03:51:05.059 --> 03:51:08.445
 sees that plu               
sees that plus      plus?  It 

03:51:08.446 --> 03:51:09.398
horrify         horrifies me 
whenever          whenever I 

03:51:09.399 --> 03:51:10.677
look      look at it because
         because it look      

03:51:10.678 --> 03:51:16.254
looks something like this.   
      this.  This is    is the

03:51:20.448 --> 03:51:24.037
                    this.  
Because JavaScript is    is a 

03:51:24.038 --> 03:51:26.871
human written         written 
language ids kind of designed 

03:51:26.966 --> 03:51:28.185
         designed to be easy to 
write and convenient            

03:51:28.186 --> 03:51:30.565
convenient, you have to do all 
these type coercion          

03:51:30.566 --> 03:51:33.003
coercions, you have to doo     
doo all these look-       

03:51:33.004 --> 03:51:35.236
look-ups.  I might be adding
        adding a double        

03:51:35.237 --> 03:51:38.250
double to a string, all these 
things        things have to be 

03:51:38.251 --> 03:51:39.200
dealt with by the JavaScript 
           JavaScript 

03:51:39.201 --> 03:51:41.603
engine        engine.  So what 
happens in modern        modern 

03:51:41.604 --> 03:51:44.523
engine        engines is    is 
they try really hard to shorten

03:51:44.705 --> 03:51:47.608
         shorten         shorten
 this path to as small as 

03:51:47.609 --> 03:51:53.511
possible but it's really hard to
 do.  So what we need is    is a

03:51:53.512 --> 03:51:57.629
 way to get closer        closer
 to the middle.  WebAssembly is

03:51:57.886 --> 03:52:00.420
    is not about       about 
running         running code in 

03:52:00.421 --> 03:52:02.436
WebAssembly             
WebAssembly.  Nobody writes in 

03:52:02.437 --> 03:52:05.572
assembly          assembly.  On 
a normal computer          

03:52:05.573 --> 03:52:07.365
computer people wrote computers 
          computers in the 60 

03:52:07.366 --> 03:52:09.033
          in the 60s and then 
             60s and then      

03:52:09.034 --> 03:52:13.702
then they wrote high level 
language.  

03:52:13.703 --> 03:52:17.065
All right       right.  So basic
 principle           principle 

03:52:17.066 --> 03:52:19.338
of mine, if you want your code 
to wrun              code to run

03:52:19.339 --> 03:52:21.922
 faster        faster, do less. 
 It's very      very obvious 

03:52:22.008 --> 03:52:24.008
        obvious.  Very simple  
      simple.  When it comes   

03:52:24.081 --> 03:52:28.174
    comes down to it, what I 
would like ultimately is    is 

03:52:28.175 --> 03:52:28.985
to write A + 

03:52:28.986 --> 03:52:32.319
the 60s and then they wrote high
 level language.  

03:52:28.986 --> 03:52:33.119
All right.  So basic principle 
of mine, if you want your code 

03:52:28.986 --> 03:52:32.919
to run faster, do less.  It's 
very obvious.  Very simple.  

03:52:28.986 --> 03:52:33.052
When it comes down to it, what I
 would like ultimately is to 

03:52:28.986 --> 03:52:30.806
write A + B in my code and have 
the + 

03:52:31.284 --> 03:52:34.550
 level language.  
All right.  So basic principle 

03:52:31.284 --> 03:52:35.350
of mine, if you want your code 
to run faster, do less.  It's 

03:52:31.284 --> 03:52:35.350
very obvious.  Very simple.  
When it comes down to it, what I

03:52:31.284 --> 03:52:35.350
 would like ultimately is to 
write A + B in my code and have 

03:52:31.284 --> 03:52:34.837
the + convert to a single CPU 
instruction.  That's the 

03:52:34.838 --> 03:52:38.297
ultimate aim.  That gives       
gives you the limit of 

03:52:38.298 --> 03:52:40.863
optization            optization
 and that's what web assembly 

03:52:41.034 --> 03:52:43.017
         assembly can do.  You 
can add things together         

03:52:43.018 --> 03:52:45.339
 together and ends up with a 
single machine instruction.  

03:52:45.340 --> 03:52:47.340
It's basically           
basically at the limit of what's

03:52:48.353 --> 03:52:50.560
 possible.  
This kind of portable          

03:52:50.561 --> 03:52:52.711
portable code idea of running
         running on different 

03:52:52.712 --> 03:52:53.946
architecture              
architectures and being       

03:52:53.947 --> 03:52:55.809
being portable          portable
 has a long history         

03:52:55.810 --> 03:52:58.839
history that pre-      pre-dates
 the web so I'll run through a 

03:52:58.840 --> 03:53:00.591
few earlier         earlier 
attempts          attempts to 

03:53:00.592 --> 03:53:03.096
set the     the stage for     
for how WebAssembly             

03:53:03.097 --> 03:53:06.052
WebAssembly does what it does.  
Back in the 1970             in 

03:53:06.053 --> 03:53:09.465
the 1970s we had a thing       
thing       thing called p-    

03:53:09.466 --> 03:53:11.083
p-code and it was an idea of an 
abstraction             

03:53:11.084 --> 03:53:13.243
abstraction of a machine that 
could then      then generate p-

03:53:13.894 --> 03:53:15.388
    p-code and this intermediate
              intermediate code 

03:53:15.389 --> 03:53:17.025
would compile         compile 
down to the particular 

03:53:17.026 --> 03:53:18.310
architecture              
architecture on which you were 

03:53:18.311 --> 03:53:20.169
running         running.  Fast
      Fast forward a few years

03:53:20.170 --> 03:53:22.170
       years later       later 
we ended       ended up with byt

03:53:22.298 --> 03:53:26.675
     byte-       byte-code.  Or 
the do the               Or the 

03:53:26.676 --> 03:53:33.619
dot     dot net run time.  
If you look      look around in 

03:53:33.620 --> 03:53:35.122
the play store, we've done 
analysis          analysis of 

03:53:35.123 --> 03:53:37.123
native apps      apps, native 
apps that are     are actually

03:53:37.154 --> 03:53:39.069
          actually in the store.
  If you look      look at the 

03:53:39.070 --> 03:53:41.347
top thousand apps      apps, the
 vast      vast majority     

03:53:41.456 --> 03:53:42.898
     majority of them      them 
are using       using the native

03:53:42.899 --> 03:53:46.750
        native development kid 
or the NDK.  So they compiling

03:53:47.186 --> 03:53:47.960
           compiling the C + 
+                           

03:53:48.284 --> 03:53:52.284
store, we've done analysis of 
native apps, native apps that 

03:53:48.284 --> 03:53:52.284
are actually in the store.  If 
you look at the top thousand 

03:53:48.284 --> 03:53:52.550
apps, the vast majority of them 
are using the native development

03:53:48.284 --> 03:53:48.602
 kid or the NDK.  So they 
compiling the C + +, the 

03:53:48.603 --> 03:53:50.697
majority of the                 
majority of the        of the 

03:53:50.698 --> 03:53:52.679
logic is    is in C + plution

03:53:52.680 --> 03:53:56.946
of native apps, native apps that
 are actually in the store.  If 

03:53:52.680 --> 03:53:56.746
you look at the top thousand 
apps, the vast majority of them 

03:53:52.680 --> 03:53:56.546
are using the native development
 kid or the NDK.  So they 

03:53:52.680 --> 03:53:53.251
compiling the C + +, the 
majority of the logic is in C + 

03:53:53.252 --> 03:53:53.626
+ 

03:53:53.627 --> 03:53:57.893
of native apps, native apps that
 are actually in the store.  If 

03:53:53.627 --> 03:53:57.693
you look at the top thousand 
apps, the vast majority of them 

03:53:53.627 --> 03:53:57.493
are using the native development
 kid or the NDK.  So they 

03:53:53.627 --> 03:53:57.427
compiling the C + +, the 
majority of the logic is in C + 

03:53:53.627 --> 03:53:57.886
+.  They're         They're not 
using much Java      Java at 

03:53:57.887 --> 03:54:02.084
all.  The reason        reason 
these people on an drad

03:54:02.337 --> 03:54:03.567
            on Android is    is 
doing this is    is for 

03:54:03.568 --> 03:54:08.199
performance             
performance.  But these kind of 

03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:10.367
devices are installed           
installed on a closed        

03:54:10.368 --> 03:54:12.475
closed system and what we have 
is    is the open web so that 

03:54:12.476 --> 03:54:14.852
brings        brings a whole new
 set of challenges like security

03:54:15.081 --> 03:54:18.504
 and privacy         privacy.  
There are plenty        plenty 

03:54:18.505 --> 03:54:20.438
of previous attempts          
attempts to run native        

03:54:20.439 --> 03:54:24.146
native code in the browse       
 browsier          browser and 

03:54:24.147 --> 03:54:26.219
I'll run through them because
         because it gives       

03:54:26.220 --> 03:54:28.220
gives you an idea where they're 
coming from

03:54:31.052 --> 03:54:36.116
      from.  And what you can do
 with it as well.  Okay.  

03:54:36.117 --> 03:54:36.760
So      
So current WebAssembly 

03:54:36.761 --> 03:54:39.507
            WebAssembly as it 
stands today       today runs at

03:54:39.508 --> 03:54:42.034
 1.2 times the speed of 
native        native code.  

03:54:42.035 --> 03:54:44.420
Which is    is an       is an 
astandishing              

03:54:44.421 --> 03:54:45.742
astandishing number when you 
think about       about it.  

03:54:45.743 --> 03:54:49.093
This is    is a format        
format that is compiled         

03:54:49.094 --> 03:54:51.173
 compiled into a sandbox        
 sandbox save environment.  Runs

03:54:51.449 --> 03:54:53.307
 into a whole lot of 
constraints             

03:54:53.308 --> 03:54:56.448
constraints to make sure it    
it has no security vulnerability

03:54:56.887 --> 03:54:58.302
               vulnerabilities 
and yet                         

03:54:58.303 --> 03:55:02.279
vulnerabilities and yet     yet 
it's only a small slow-       

03:55:02.280 --> 03:55:04.280
slow-down. 

03:55:05.666 --> 03:55:07.666
 The #250e78s              The 
teams       teams are working 

03:55:07.791 --> 03:55:09.925
        working really hard to 
speed that up a little bit more.

03:55:09.926 --> 03:55:11.773
  But the most important 
          important point I want

03:55:11.774 --> 03:55:14.224
 to get home to you     you 
right now is    is that      

03:55:14.225 --> 03:55:16.865
that this is    is not one 
browse        browser.  All the 

03:55:16.866 --> 03:55:19.047
four browse        browser 
engine        engines have done 

03:55:19.048 --> 03:55:21.767
this and they are seeing very 
     very similar execution 

03:55:21.861 --> 03:55:23.359
          execution times.  So 
this is    is really exciting  

03:55:23.360 --> 03:55:26.458
        exciting.  Before we go 
into the details, what did     

03:55:26.459 --> 03:55:28.112
did we learn from      from the 
past      past that got us    us

03:55:28.113 --> 03:55:31.694
 to where we are?  Well, many 
years       years ago the only 

03:55:31.695 --> 03:55:33.638
way              the only way to
 get high performance 

03:55:33.639 --> 03:55:35.783
            performance on the 
web was with plug               

03:55:35.784 --> 03:55:36.868
was with plugins         
plugins.  We had lots      lots 

03:55:36.869 --> 03:55:38.357
of plugins         plugins for 
different things        things. 

03:55:38.358 --> 03:55:43.196
 We had flash, we also      also
 had Java      Java with its 

03:55:43.197 --> 03:55:47.098
virtual         virtual machine,
 lots      lots of things       

03:55:47.206 --> 03:55:48.877
 things like that.  Plugins 
        Plugins were great in 

03:55:48.878 --> 03:55:52.433
their       their day.  However 
plugins aren't very      very 

03:55:52.434 --> 03:55:54.645
good for today       today.  And
 the reason is    is, even      

03:55:54.646 --> 03:55:56.916
even when we put a pliven 
             put a plugin       

03:55:56.917 --> 03:56:01.439
 plugin into a sand      sandbox
 environment, we still cop 

03:56:01.440 --> 03:56:03.655
security who else      
                 cop security 

03:56:03.656 --> 03:56:04.968
holes.  It's really hard to 
control.            control.  

03:56:04.969 --> 03:56:07.690
The other thing is    is that 
plugin        plugins do not 

03:56:07.691 --> 03:56:10.109
play nicely        nicely with 
the web poi             the web 

03:56:10.110 --> 03:56:12.828
API     APIs.  We have lots     
 lots of web API     APIs we 

03:56:12.829 --> 03:56:14.829
have mowing                we 
have

03:56:17.261 --> 03:56:21.261
 motion detection           
detection, stuff you can do with

03:56:17.261 --> 03:56:17.742
 the camera        camera.  A 
lot that are native        

03:56:17.743 --> 03:56:19.720
native to the browse        
browser, but you can't get that 

03:56:19.721 --> 03:56:24.083
from      from the plugins 
        plugins.  And so this 

03:56:24.084 --> 03:56:26.084
kind of   

03:56:27.955 --> 03:56:28.691
 of disjoint model       model 
doesn't work well.  But the 

03:56:28.692 --> 03:56:30.851
single reason plugins aren't
        aren't a          aren't

03:56:30.852 --> 03:56:34.773
 a great idea is    is these 
things        things.  They just

03:56:35.093 --> 03:56:37.381
 don't run on mobile.  So it's 
very      very hard to give     

03:56:38.671 --> 03:56:41.714
 give your users       users a 
performant   ant experience from

03:56:42.048 --> 03:56:44.048
      from a plugin        
plugin that doesn't exist

03:56:47.460 --> 03:56:50.287
       exist.  On top of that 
people have to install 

03:56:50.288 --> 03:56:54.063
plugin        plugins.  And we 
moved       moved on later      

03:56:54.064 --> 03:56:56.897
 later to this thing       thing
 that Google built       built 

03:56:56.898 --> 03:56:58.925
called native        native 
client.  So what native        

03:56:58.926 --> 03:57:01.776
native client was, it was a 
target for compiled          

03:57:01.777 --> 03:57:04.697
compiled code.  To run in the 
web krouz                  in 

03:57:04.698 --> 03:57:08.867
the web browse        browser.  
So it was a sand      sandboxed 

03:57:08.868 --> 03:57:11.672
compile         compiler target.
  So it was safe      safer than

03:57:11.993 --> 03:57:13.993
      than proper native        
native code.  Ran pretty fast

03:57:14.176 --> 03:57:16.392
      fast but again it had the 
limitations             

03:57:16.393 --> 03:57:18.667
limitations that it didn't    
    didn't talk to other web API

03:57:18.833 --> 03:57:21.288
     APIs so didn't        
didn't really work with your 

03:57:21.289 --> 03:57:24.884
dumb objects.  And it only ran 
in Chrome        Chrome, which 

03:57:24.885 --> 03:57:26.574
is    is one browse        
browser.  We tried       tried 

03:57:26.575 --> 03:57:27.866
for a few years       years to 
evolve        evolve this.  We 

03:57:27.867 --> 03:57:29.174
developed           developed 
portable          portable 

03:57:29.175 --> 03:57:32.138
native        native client.  If
 you remember portable          

03:57:32.139 --> 03:57:34.114
portable native        native 
client, that actually          

03:57:34.115 --> 03:57:37.510
actually let you target        
target        target in 

03:57:37.511 --> 03:57:40.055
intermediate              
intermediate code that could be 

03:57:40.056 --> 03:57:41.925
compiled          compiled on 
the client               on the 

03:57:41.926 --> 03:57:44.398
client side.  That has its own 
set of problems          

03:57:44.399 --> 03:57:45.669
problems.  Once you have the 
compile         compiler in the 

03:57:45.670 --> 03:57:48.813
browse        browser, that 
could be vulnerable            

03:57:48.814 --> 03:57:50.814
vulnerable to security holes so 
you have to put the compile 

03:57:51.388 --> 03:57:52.435
        compiler itself        
itself into a sandbobs          

03:57:52.436 --> 03:57:55.157
sandbox.  It was an incredibly
            incredibly complex 

03:57:55.158 --> 03:57:56.065
architecture              
architecture and none of the 

03:57:56.066 --> 03:57:57.632
       of the web browse        
browsers wanted to do it because

03:57:57.633 --> 03:58:00.832
         because it was too     
too difficult.  

03:58:00.833 --> 03:58:07.925
So along came a few smart guys 
with a research praj 

03:58:08.021 --> 03:58:11.791
                a research 
project         project.  The 

03:58:11.792 --> 03:58:14.921
early thing       thing of

03:58:18.403 --> 03:58:27.253
 asm     asm.js        asm.js.  
So what asm     asm.js        

03:58:27.254 --> 03:58:29.316
asm.js does is    is it takes 
      takes C + 

03:58:29.317 --> 03:58:29.560
+                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
complex architecture and none of

03:58:29.561 --> 03:58:33.761
 the web browsers wanted to do 
it because it was too difficult.

03:58:29.561 --> 03:58:33.694
with a research project.  The 
early thing of asm.js.  So what 

03:58:29.561 --> 03:58:30.938
asm.js does is it takes C + +, 
compile         compiles it down

03:58:30.939 --> 03:58:32.869
 into a tiny      tiny subset of
 JavaScript            

03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:35.467
JavaScript that contains 
         contains a bunch of 

03:58:35.468 --> 03:58:36.888
annotations             
annotations and the JavaScript  

03:58:36.889 --> 03:58:38.789
          JavaScript engine 
       engines attempt to 

03:58:38.790 --> 03:58:40.772
compile         compile that 
into fast      fast native 

03:58:40.773 --> 03:58:42.288
       native code.  However   
      However one of the        

03:58:42.289 --> 03:58:44.558
of the limitations             
limitations of asm     asm.js is

03:58:44.687 --> 03:58:48.908
    is the different engine 
       engines ran with 

03:58:48.909 --> 03:58:50.366
different performance
             performance.  So 

03:58:50.367 --> 03:58:57.207
let's       let's just see how s
       how asmm      asmm.js 

03:58:57.533 --> 03:58:58.833
        asmm.js and WebAssembly
             WebAssembly differ 

03:58:58.834 --> 03:59:00.834
in the world.  This is    is an 
example         example of an as

03:59:00.988 --> 03:59:05.837
m        an asm.js is    is an 
output.  This first line of the 

03:59:05.955 --> 03:59:10.069
       of the function, that's a
 hint telling         telling 

03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.934
the JavaScript            
JavaScript engine        engine 

03:59:10.935 --> 03:59:13.293
that that is    is an integer 
        integer.  So that ng  

03:59:13.562 --> 03:59:19.217
          So that can help 
compile because         because 

03:59:19.218 --> 03:59:22.130
it's explicitly            
explicitly annotate          

03:59:22.131 --> 03:59:23.182
annotated.              
annotated.  But to understand 

03:59:23.183 --> 03:59:26.130
why WebAssembly is    is a 
better model than      than this

03:59:26.131 --> 03:59:27.727
 or a fast      faster model 
      model, we have to look 

03:59:27.728 --> 03:59:29.485
     look at how JavaScript  
          JavaScript engine 

03:59:29.486 --> 03:59:35.284
works       works and what it 
does when it sees this.         

03:59:35.285 --> 03:59:37.052
this.  
So within V8, any JavaScript 

03:59:37.053 --> 03:59:38.989
           JavaScript program 
you write, this is    is the 

03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:40.787
first thing       thing that 
happens.  On the left we have 

03:59:40.788 --> 03:59:42.788
some JavaScript            
JavaScript source containing 

03:59:42.846 --> 03:59:44.082
           containing a bunch of
 JavaScript            

03:59:44.083 --> 03:59:45.155
JavaScript functions           
functions.  The first thing 

03:59:45.156 --> 03:59:47.156
      thing we need to do is

03:59:51.671 --> 03:59:53.723
 pass.  And generates           
generates this thing       thing

03:59:53.940 --> 03:59:58.194
 called an abstract          
abstract syntax        syntax 

03:59:58.195 --> 04:00:01.049
tree.  The abstract          
abstract syntax        syntax 

04:00:01.050 --> 04:00:03.298
tree is    is a representation 
of the logic       logic of your

04:00:05.445 --> 04:00:09.660
 program.            program.  
Once yeef      yeef generated 

04:00:09.756 --> 04:00:12.632
          generated this 
internal representation, you 

04:00:12.633 --> 04:00:18.221
then      then go straight to 
machine code.  But that's a very

04:00:18.745 --> 04:00:21.761
 fast      fast operation and 
there is    is no real attempt 

04:00:21.762 --> 04:00:23.466
made      made to speed that up.

04:00:23.467 --> 04:00:25.017
If      
If we take all of that and 

04:00:25.018 --> 04:00:30.018
squish        squish it up and 
go to the next surgeon         

04:00:30.019 --> 04:00:32.076
surgeon, this is    is what the 
VI pipeline          pipeline 

04:00:32.077 --> 04:00:35.016
does.  We have this thing       
thing called turbo       turbo 

04:00:35.017 --> 04:00:36.935
fan.  What happens is    is the 
steps       steps in the 

04:00:36.936 --> 04:00:43.498
beginning there to the left, 
where the first red blob is    

04:00:43.499 --> 04:00:44.388
is, while your JavaScript 
           JavaScript 

04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:45.615
application is    is running 
        running, there's        

04:00:45.616 --> 04:00:48.741
 there's a lot of code inside V8
 and        V8 and other engines

04:00:48.988 --> 04:00:50.121
         engines do similar 
things        things, looking  

04:00:50.122 --> 04:00:51.710
       looking at what's running
         running slow, looking

04:00:51.711 --> 04:00:53.302
         looking at the hot 
functioning                 hot 

04:00:53.303 --> 04:00:55.125
functions           functions 
going this one is    is bad and 

04:00:55.126 --> 04:00:56.377
when we identify          
identify slow functions 

04:00:56.378 --> 04:00:59.082
          functions, we then   
   then reoptimize them      

04:00:59.083 --> 04:01:02.487
them.  So we push them      them
 through this back end here 

04:01:02.488 --> 04:01:07.628
which is    is an optimize 
         optimize ed            

04:01:08.755 --> 04:01:10.563
 optimized.  The one thing      
 thing I want to emphasize  

04:01:10.564 --> 04:01:13.898
         emphasize here is    is
 that this action of analyze ing

04:01:13.994 --> 04:01:15.625
           analyzing the code 
and deciding          deciding 

04:01:15.626 --> 04:01:19.631
what to optimize          
optimize, that will cost      

04:01:19.632 --> 04:01:22.622
cost CPU cycle           CPU 
cycles and that means it uses 

04:01:22.623 --> 04:01:26.078
battery on the mobile device.  
In the asm            In the 

04:01:26.079 --> 04:01:34.127
asm.js        asm.js case it 
woms      woms in through the 

04:01:34.128 --> 04:01:40.527
pasm      pasm stage.  If you 
use WebAssembly, it look      

04:01:40.528 --> 04:01:43.455
looks like this.  
So what happens is    is the 

04:01:43.456 --> 04:01:44.443
WebAssembly             
WebAssembly has already         

04:01:44.444 --> 04:01:50.095
already gone through optimize 
ation              optimization 

04:01:50.096 --> 04:01:51.404
through the compile         
compile face.  There is no pause

04:01:51.405 --> 04:01:55.663
 as such      such.  So we're 
seening                  So 

04:01:55.664 --> 04:01:58.168
we're seeing        seeing 10 or
 12 seconds         seconds load

04:01:58.322 --> 04:02:01.857
 time for a reasonably size     
 sized application.  So you 

04:02:01.858 --> 04:02:04.153
eliminate that pause time.  And 
what you have is    is optimize

04:02:04.246 --> 04:02:09.405
          optimized b   
binary        binary which would

04:02:09.718 --> 04:02:12.892
 generate the machine code and 
all the optimize ation

04:02:12.987 --> 04:02:14.157
              optimizations have
 been done by the compile 

04:02:14.158 --> 04:02:18.857
        compiler at the front 
end.  So this particular picture

04:02:19.051 --> 04:02:21.265
 within V8 shows       shows 
what happens is    is when you 

04:02:21.266 --> 04:02:23.648
load the JavaScript            
JavaScript engine        engine 

04:02:23.649 --> 04:02:26.215
and load the web assembly 
                 the web 

04:02:26.216 --> 04:02:27.806
WebAssembly             
WebAssembly module        module

04:02:27.807 --> 04:02:29.201
 we can compile         compile 
the whole thing       thing in 

04:02:29.202 --> 04:02:32.582
one hit and everything runs     
 runs at full speed.  Some other

04:02:32.583 --> 04:02:34.672
 JavaScript            
JavaScript engine        engines

04:02:34.877 --> 04:02:38.336
 like chakra        chakra and 
edge take           edge take a 

04:02:38.337 --> 04:02:40.274
different approach.  They leave 
      leave the module        

04:02:40.275 --> 04:02:42.830
module in memory and the first 
time a function is    is called 

04:02:42.831 --> 04:02:45.268
they compile         compile it 
at that point.  So they kind of 

04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:47.920
trade it ahead       ahead of 
time compile delay       delay 

04:02:47.921 --> 04:02:51.257
with small hiccup        hiccups
 on the way.  

04:02:51.258 --> 04:02:57.157
Anyway.  Moving        Moving 
on.  I'll just kind of try and 

04:02:57.158 --> 04:02:58.997
explain WebAssembly             
WebAssembly as a concept now.  

04:02:58.998 --> 04:03:01.027
So what actually is    is it.  
And the one thing       thing 

04:03:01.028 --> 04:03:02.716
I've been asked       asked 
multiple times in the last      

04:03:02.717 --> 04:03:05.388
last few days is    is does this
 mean we don't have to write 

04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:07.389
JavaScript            JavaScript
 anymore and the answer is    is

04:03:07.743 --> 04:03:10.028
 no.  Not it's a complement to 
JavaScript            

04:03:10.029 --> 04:03:12.316
JavaScript.  It's a way for 
people to take C + + 

04:03:12.525 --> 04:03:16.725
asked multiple times in the last
 few days is does this mean we 

04:03:12.525 --> 04:03:16.658
don't have to write JavaScript 
anymore and the answer is no.  

04:03:12.525 --> 04:03:16.058
Not it's a complement to 
JavaScript.  It's a way for 

04:03:12.525 --> 04:03:15.335
people to take C + + or C or 
rust      rust code or any other

04:03:15.603 --> 04:03:17.952
 type of language and compile 
        compile it down to a 

04:03:17.953 --> 04:03:19.756
module        module that you 
can call from JavaScript 

04:03:19.757 --> 04:03:22.916
           JavaScript.  So they 
work together          together.

04:03:22.917 --> 04:03:25.593
           together.  
One of the things is also      

04:03:25.594 --> 04:03:29.279
also when we were developing 
           developing this was 

04:03:29.280 --> 04:03:31.809
that people realize         
realized the short#k078g      

04:03:32.341 --> 04:03:35.195
       shortcoming      comings 
of native        native client. 

04:03:35.413 --> 04:03:38.950
 It was developed           
developed by the same people.  

04:03:38.951 --> 04:03:41.040
The people that built  

04:03:41.041 --> 04:03:42.931
people.  They all worked 
together          together to 

04:03:42.932 --> 04:03:44.647
build what we have today       
today.  

04:03:44.648 --> 04:03:47.072
So what we actually          
actually do with it is    is, 

04:03:47.073 --> 04:03:48.055
it's tightly         tightly 
integrated            integrated

04:03:48.056 --> 04:03:49.959
 into the web platform          
platform.  It's a new capability

04:03:49.960 --> 04:03:52.436
            capability.  You 
have to think of it as that.  

04:03:52.437 --> 04:03:54.813
It's not meant to replace 
JavaScript            

04:03:54.814 --> 04:03:56.382
JavaScript.  It also      also, 
that also      also means you 

04:03:56.383 --> 04:04:00.271
can talk to all the web API     
APIs.  You can call all the 

04:04:00.272 --> 04:04:01.162
standard dumb functions 
          functions or all the 

04:04:01.163 --> 04:04:04.622
API     APIs from      from your
 web asem reply                

04:04:04.623 --> 04:04:06.605
web asem blii                   
      from your WebAssembly 

04:04:06.606 --> 04:04:10.493
            WebAssembly code.  
It does have a few differences. 

04:04:10.766 --> 04:04:13.300
 And in the future there's   
      there's a plan to add 

04:04:13.301 --> 04:04:17.218
threading           threading 
and multiple instruction at the 

04:04:17.219 --> 04:04:22.046
same time.  So it's kind of it 
in a small nutshell          

04:04:22.316 --> 04:04:23.784
nutshell.  
But I'm about       about to go 

04:04:23.785 --> 04:04:25.939
through a through technical 
slides        slides that are 

04:04:25.940 --> 04:04:29.092
very      very dry and boring 
       boring so feel free to go

04:04:29.093 --> 04:04:30.573
 to sleep for the next four 
slides        slides if you're

04:04:30.574 --> 04:04:33.649
           if you're not a total
 geek      geek.  This is pretty

04:04:33.650 --> 04:04:36.308
 much      much the goals       
goals of the design of 

04:04:36.309 --> 04:04:37.495
WebAssembly             
WebAssembly.  The first thing   

04:04:37.496 --> 04:04:41.145
    thing was to be smaller than
 asm     asm.js        asm.js.  

04:04:41.146 --> 04:04:43.146
Right now the WebAssembly  
           WebAssembly module is

04:04:44.033 --> 04:04:49.835
    is smaller than             
 smaller over the wire.  It 

04:04:49.836 --> 04:04:51.934
wanted to be easy to verify
        verify.  We're not 

04:04:51.935 --> 04:04:53.744
talking about       about verify
        verify.  What that means

04:04:53.745 --> 04:04:55.403
 is    is verifying           
verifying that the program is 

04:04:55.404 --> 04:04:58.103
safe      safe.  This is    is 
actually          actually 

04:04:58.104 --> 04:05:01.426
designed          designed to be
 run in a kind of sandbongs 

04:05:01.536 --> 04:05:03.962
          sandbox environment.  
So one of those things        

04:05:03.963 --> 04:05:05.317
things with running         
running in a sand      sandbox 

04:05:05.318 --> 04:05:07.701
is    is that you can't let 
stray       stray accesses out 

04:05:07.702 --> 04:05:09.892
of the        of the memory of 
the        of the executing   

04:05:09.983 --> 04:05:11.983
        executing program 
happen.  So affect 

04:05:12.061 --> 04:05:13.335
                   happen.  So 
effective           effectively 

04:05:13.336 --> 04:05:18.394
you can run through the 
WebAssembly b               

04:05:18.395 --> 04:05:21.671
WebAssembly binary        binary
 code and validate there are no 

04:05:21.672 --> 04:05:23.056
accesses outside of the        
of the bounds of the        of 

04:05:23.057 --> 04:05:25.131
the memory block it's contained 
          contained in.  You 

04:05:25.132 --> 04:05:28.213
don't have to do it that way, 
but it is possible in the 

04:05:28.214 --> 04:05:29.456
design.  Same thing       thing 
for the compilation             

04:05:29.457 --> 04:05:31.002
compilation.  You should be able
 to compile         compile it 

04:05:31.003 --> 04:05:33.355
with one pass through the file. 
 As I said before, other 

04:05:33.356 --> 04:05:34.676
JavaScript            JavaScript
 engine        engines have 

04:05:34.677 --> 04:05:37.162
chosen        chosen to compile 
        compile piece by piece 

04:05:37.163 --> 04:05:39.774
for their       their own design
 reasons         reasons.  

04:05:39.775 --> 04:05:41.799
The other thing is also      
also it needs       needs to be 

04:05:41.800 --> 04:05:43.758
extensible            
extensible.  So right now there 

04:05:43.759 --> 04:05:46.086
are very      very small number
        number of primitive    

04:05:46.169 --> 04:05:48.958
       primitives, which I'll 
show you in a minute, but the 

04:05:48.959 --> 04:05:50.882
whole design        design was 
built       built around adding 

04:05:50.883 --> 04:05:51.444
       adding new thiijs 
                  adding new 

04:05:51.445 --> 04:05:53.572
things        things later      
 later.  

04:05:53.573 --> 04:05:55.344
So let's       let's take a look
      look at the basic       

04:05:55.345 --> 04:05:56.640
basics of the        of the 
memory model       model.  This 

04:05:56.641 --> 04:05:58.842
is    is a little bit of a scary
       scary slide, that's why

04:05:58.970 --> 04:06:01.718
     why I warned        warned 
you in advance.  But basically 

04:06:01.811 --> 04:06:03.819
          basically the memory 
for a C + + 

04:06:04.273 --> 04:06:08.206
the whole design was built 
around adding new things later. 

04:06:04.273 --> 04:06:08.339
basics of the memory model.  
This is a little bit of a scary 

04:06:04.273 --> 04:06:08.406
slide, that's why I warned you 
in advance.  But basically the 

04:06:04.273 --> 04:06:04.840
memory for a C + + program 
compiled          compiled into 

04:06:04.841 --> 04:06:08.376
WebAssembly look      looks like
 a type to JavaScript           

04:06:08.717 --> 04:06:12.264
           a typed array       
array to JavaScript            

04:06:12.265 --> 04:06:13.579
JavaScript.  One of the        
of the features          

04:06:13.580 --> 04:06:15.586
features of WebAssembly 
            WebAssembly that 

04:06:15.587 --> 04:06:17.704
helps with security is    is 
this concept of an execution 

04:06:17.705 --> 04:06:19.614
stack       stack, which is    
is separate from      from the 

04:06:19.615 --> 04:06:22.653
linear        linear memory.  So
 if you think about       about 

04:06:22.654 --> 04:06:23.528
a normal C + +  

04:06:23.529 --> 04:06:27.062
program compiled into 
WebAssembly looks like a typed 

04:06:23.529 --> 04:06:27.662
array to JavaScript.  One of the
 features of WebAssembly that 

04:06:23.529 --> 04:06:27.462
helps with security is this 
concept of an execution stack, 

04:06:23.529 --> 04:06:27.462
which is separate from the 
linear memory.  So if you think 

04:06:23.529 --> 04:06:26.219
about a normal C + + program, 
you have a heap      heap.  And 

04:06:26.220 --> 04:06:28.124
you allocate memory from      
from the bottom of the heap     

04:06:28.125 --> 04:06:29.933
 heap and you grow the stack 
from      from the top of the 

04:06:29.934 --> 04:06:32.730
heap      heap.  And it's 
possible to take a pointer 

04:06:32.825 --> 04:06:34.970
        pointer and look      
look up into the stack       

04:06:34.971 --> 04:06:36.649
stack memory and start playing 
        playing with variable 

04:06:36.650 --> 04:06:38.275
         variables that you're  
      you're not supposed to be 

04:06:38.276 --> 04:06:41.053
playing         playing with and
 do all sorts       sorts of 

04:06:41.054 --> 04:06:45.314
nefarious things.  WebAssembly 
            WebAssembly has a 

04:06:45.315 --> 04:06:46.680
completely            completely
 different model       model.  

04:06:46.681 --> 04:06:48.559
The execution stack is    is 
isolated from      from the 

04:06:48.560 --> 04:06:50.560
WebAssembly             
WebAssembly program itself 

04:06:50.607 --> 04:06:52.161
       itself so there is no way
 you can actually          

04:06:52.162 --> 04:06:55.702
actually poke into it and change
 things.           things.  That

04:06:56.048 --> 04:06:57.611
's a really cool security 
feature         feature.  

04:06:57.612 --> 04:06:58.686
Also        
Also the functions           

04:06:58.687 --> 04:07:02.002
functions themselves            
themselves, these integer 

04:07:02.189 --> 04:07:03.979
        integer offset        
offsets.  They don't actually 

04:07:03.980 --> 04:07:06.903
         actually have pointers.
  They're         They're 

04:07:06.904 --> 04:07:09.213
numbered functions           
functions which point into a 

04:07:09.214 --> 04:07:11.248
table.  And those indirect 
calculated numbers jump      

04:07:11.249 --> 04:07:12.854
jump into the functions 
          functions themselves 

04:07:12.855 --> 04:07:14.426
inside the module        module.
  And the reason        reason 

04:07:14.427 --> 04:07:18.635
it's built       built that way 
is    is so that you can load 

04:07:18.636 --> 04:07:20.548
multiple modules         modules
 side by side so you offset 

04:07:20.549 --> 04:07:21.817
       offset all the index 
      indexes and everything 

04:07:21.818 --> 04:07:25.943
works beautiful           
beautifully.  

04:07:26.245 --> 04:07:27.408
            beautifully.  
One of the things        things 

04:07:27.409 --> 04:07:29.984
that is very important          
 important to point out here as 

04:07:29.985 --> 04:07:32.361
well is    is that the 
WebAssembly             

04:07:32.362 --> 04:07:34.597
WebAssembly module        module
 has no access to any plemple 

04:07:34.687 --> 04:07:37.965
               to any platform 
API     APIs.  So back in the 

04:07:37.966 --> 04:07:40.669
bad old days of plug   
           days of plugins 

04:07:40.755 --> 04:07:43.382
        plugins you can call any
 API     API you wanted.  

04:07:43.383 --> 04:07:45.116
WebAssembly             
WebAssembly has no such      

04:07:45.117 --> 04:07:46.522
such access.  Everything is    
is mediated          mediated 

04:07:46.523 --> 04:07:47.537
through JavaScript            
JavaScript which means you're 

04:07:47.538 --> 04:07:49.411
       you're in control and 
basically JavaScript is    is 

04:07:49.412 --> 04:07:51.130
the boss and WebAssembly 
            WebAssembly just 

04:07:51.131 --> 04:07:53.131
does the job it's told

04:07:55.825 --> 04:07:57.825
 to.   

04:07:59.989 --> 04:08:03.522
        to.   
So here's what we look      look

04:08:04.152 --> 04:08:05.939
 at the        at the memory 
when we compile         compile.

04:08:05.940 --> 04:08:08.001
  There is no direct addressing 
           addressing, all the 

04:08:08.002 --> 04:08:10.321
pointer         pointer 
addresses can be        can be 

04:08:10.322 --> 04:08:12.839
bounced         bounced checked.
  What that means is    is you 

04:08:12.840 --> 04:08:14.840
actually          actually have

04:08:17.163 --> 04:08:18.835
 have a big address number.  You
 have an offset        offset.  

04:08:18.836 --> 04:08:21.676
Since we know the block of 
memory is    is this big, we can

04:08:21.677 --> 04:08:24.149
 very      very quickly         
quickly check that that number 

04:08:24.150 --> 04:08:27.129
falls in that range to guarantee
           guarantee that we're 

04:08:27.130 --> 04:08:30.707
not outside our memory block.  
That also      also means that 

04:08:30.708 --> 04:08:35.872
that check is    is cheap.  When
 jumping         jumping into a 

04:08:35.873 --> 04:08:37.880
function, to do that little 
bounds check is    is really 

04:08:37.881 --> 04:08:39.621
trivial         trivial.  And 
also      also one of the       

04:08:39.622 --> 04:08:41.622
 of the other features          
features of this is    is at the

04:08:41.682 --> 04:08:44.409
 moment when assembly          
assemblies of 32 address space. 

04:08:44.597 --> 04:08:46.860
 So if you're           if 
you're running         running 

04:08:46.861 --> 04:08:49.260
on a 64 bit device you can load 
the WebAssembly             

04:08:49.261 --> 04:08:51.603
WebAssembly module        module
 into memory, put two     two 

04:08:51.604 --> 04:08:54.674
hardware          hardware 
guards on each set of the       

04:08:56.312 --> 04:08:58.156
 of the address space and if 
anything          anything was 

04:08:58.157 --> 04:09:00.936
going to escape        escape 
the 32 bit address space, you 

04:09:00.937 --> 04:09:03.133
get that safety        safety at
 0      at 0 run     runtime 

04:09:03.134 --> 04:09:06.373
costs       costs.  Which is    
is a fantastic           

04:09:06.374 --> 04:09:10.212
fantastic ability         
ability.          ability.  

04:09:10.213 --> 04:09:12.981
So this is pretty much      much
 WebAssembly             

04:09:12.982 --> 04:09:14.726
WebAssembly in a nutshell
          nutshell.  This is    

04:09:14.727 --> 04:09:18.736
is all we have.         have.  
One page.  One slide.  So I'll 

04:09:18.737 --> 04:09:25.663
quickly         quickly run 
through.  As I pointed         

04:09:25.664 --> 04:09:28.388
pointed out before, the 64 bit 
integer         integers are a 

04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:30.388
great thing       thing for C + 
+ 

04:09:30.712 --> 04:09:34.378
So this is pretty much 
WebAssembly in a nutshell.  This

04:09:30.712 --> 04:09:34.778
 is all we have.  One page.  One
 slide.  So I'll quickly run 

04:09:30.712 --> 04:09:34.645
through.  As I pointed out 
before, the 64 bit integers are 

04:09:30.712 --> 04:09:32.338
a great thing for C + +.  It's 
not available in JavaScript 

04:09:32.339 --> 04:09:36.030
           JavaScript.  The 
functions           functions 

04:09:36.031 --> 04:09:38.031
are

04:09:39.075 --> 04:09:41.225
 bound, I talked about       
about the direction for the call

04:09:41.641 --> 04:09:44.146
 in.  And we have a bunch of 
standard operations            

04:09:44.147 --> 04:09:45.828
operations.  All the standard 
operations            operations

04:09:45.829 --> 04:09:48.194
 you would expect on integer 
        integers, adding        

04:09:48.195 --> 04:09:49.479
adding, subtraction             
subtraction, multiplication 

04:09:49.480 --> 04:09:50.349
               multiplication, 
shifting          shifting.  

04:09:50.350 --> 04:09:52.350
Also      Also contains

04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:56.222
 square root and float and 
ceiling         ceiling and it's

04:09:56.223 --> 04:09:58.235
 pretty much      much 
conversion            

04:09:58.236 --> 04:10:03.012
conversions to do casting   
      casting.  It's kind of a 

04:10:03.013 --> 04:10:05.148
load store model       model.  
The actual WebAssembly 

04:10:05.242 --> 04:10:06.992
            WebAssembly virtual 
        virtual machine model is

04:10:06.993 --> 04:10:09.311
    is a stack       stack 
machine.  So if    if people 

04:10:09.312 --> 04:10:11.085
have heard of virtual machines 
         machines, there are two

04:10:11.086 --> 04:10:12.693
 types       types.  There are 
stack machines          machines

04:10:12.694 --> 04:10:14.450
 and there are registered-  
           registered-based 

04:10:14.451 --> 04:10:15.792
virtual machines          
machines.  It's actually 

04:10:15.793 --> 04:10:17.265
         actually a stack       
stacked machine based model 

04:10:17.266 --> 04:10:19.164
      model.  And there's
         there's a bunch of 

04:10:19.165 --> 04:10:21.056
structured            structured
 control flow that's brought  

04:10:21.057 --> 04:10:27.054
       brought on yadda ya   
       yadda yadda       yadda. 

04:10:31.208 --> 04:10:34.649
 what you're        you're all 
here for.  Can you use

04:10:38.866 --> 04:10:42.932
 this stuff.  And the answer 
is    is a resounding           

04:10:38.866 --> 04:10:39.616
 resounding yes.  This is    is 
monumental            monumental

04:10:39.617 --> 04:10:42.273
 to get four      four large 
browse                   four 

04:10:42.274 --> 04:10:45.304
large browse        browser 
engine        engines to work 

04:10:45.305 --> 04:10:45.471
together          together to 
bring       bring something t   

04:10:45.472 --> 04:10:49.578
t market.  It's really amazing
         amazing.  And at the 

04:10:49.579 --> 04:10:52.106
moment these engine        
engines like Chrome        

04:10:52.107 --> 04:10:57.054
Chrome implements the binary 
       binary format        

04:10:57.055 --> 04:10:58.726
format.  But at the moment 
there's         there's a lot of

04:10:58.727 --> 04:11:00.591
 work going on about       about
 integrating             

04:11:00.592 --> 04:11:03.050
integrating with post message 
for web asem reply 

04:11:03.148 --> 04:11:04.042
                   for web 
assembly          assembly 

04:11:04.043 --> 04:11:06.043
module        modules and being 
      being able to install them

04:11:06.193 --> 04:11:08.734
      them index       index DB.
  In the works       works 

04:11:08.735 --> 04:11:13.153
there's         there's a stream
ing API     API and on the 

04:11:13.154 --> 04:11:17.099
priority          priority left 
as well.  

04:11:17.100 --> 04:11:19.814
As far as tools       tools you 
people are developer           

04:11:19.815 --> 04:11:22.214
developers love developer tools 
I'm hoping        hoping anyway.

04:11:22.215 --> 04:11:23.954
  In any way                    
 anyway.  In any case, LLVM is 

04:11:23.955 --> 04:11:27.482
   is the compile         
compiler of choice today       

04:11:27.483 --> 04:11:29.473
today.  There are actually
          actually a lot of 

04:11:29.474 --> 04:11:32.528
schools there are things        
things called em script        

04:11:32.529 --> 04:11:34.380
script ennen 
                       called em

04:11:34.381 --> 04:11:37.972
    em script em which people 
may be familiar with.  There's 

04:11:38.075 --> 04:11:45.507
        There's another cool 
called by    binaryen          

04:11:45.508 --> 04:11:47.166
binaryen.  It's a stand       
standalone     alone tool but 

04:11:47.167 --> 04:11:48.418
could be used      used with 
other compile         compilers 

04:11:48.419 --> 04:11:51.551
such      such as GCC.  There 
are other tools       tools as 

04:11:51.552 --> 04:11:54.579
well that take the binary       
 binary format        format and

04:11:54.580 --> 04:11:56.475
 disassemble             
disassemble it into something 

04:11:56.476 --> 04:11:58.137
that's human readable and vice 
versa       versa.  There are 

04:11:58.138 --> 04:12:00.407
lots      lots of things        
things you can play with if you 

04:12:00.408 --> 04:12:02.400
want to experiment.  If you're  
         If you're a really hard

04:12:02.401 --> 04:12:03.961
      hardcore developer 
          developer you might 

04:12:03.962 --> 04:12:06.926
want to have a look      look at
 the

04:12:13.075 --> 04:12:14.468
     the.  
The W       

04:12:14.469 --> 04:12:15.902
The W3C is    is working        
 working         working on 

04:12:15.903 --> 04:12:18.801
formalize ing             
formalizing the spec.  This 

04:12:18.802 --> 04:12:20.843
standard was developed          
 developed through a W     a W3C

04:12:20.997 --> 04:12:21.890
 community group, which is 
                group, which 

04:12:21.891 --> 04:12:23.836
isn't                    group, 
which is    is an easy forum   

04:12:23.837 --> 04:12:25.880
    forum to get started with 
new features          features. 

04:12:26.065 --> 04:12:28.292
 So now that we've progressed to
 implementation                

04:12:28.293 --> 04:12:29.206
implementations, it's moving 
       moving to a working 

04:12:29.207 --> 04:12:33.051
        working group for proper
 formalization               

04:12:33.052 --> 04:12:34.635
formalization.     
           formalization.  

04:12:34.636 --> 04:12:40.871
Okay.  So I'm     I'm just going
 to do a bref demo      demos.  

04:12:40.872 --> 04:12:43.174
This is    is    is the Conway 
       Conway's game of life is 

04:12:43.289 --> 04:12:47.332
   is one of these classic games
       games.  And what's cool 

04:12:47.333 --> 04:12:49.338
about       about it is    is 
it's one of the        of the 

04:12:49.339 --> 04:12:51.087
first things        things you 
learn       learn in computer 

04:12:51.088 --> 04:12:52.752
science         science.  The 
reason        reason I wanted to

04:12:52.753 --> 04:12:54.881
 show it to you is because 
        because I had a good 

04:12:54.882 --> 04:12:56.679
friend of mine      mine an 
engineer          engineer 

04:12:56.680 --> 04:12:58.820
called Sam who     who decided  
       decided he would try to 

04:12:58.821 --> 04:13:01.521
make it as small as    as 
possible as WebAssembly 

04:13:01.635 --> 04:13:02.869
            WebAssembly module 
       module to prove 

04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:05.253
something.  So he compiled 
         compiled it without the

04:13:06.708 --> 04:13:07.893
 standard C library         
library and the WebAssembly 

04:13:07.894 --> 04:13:10.458
            WebAssembly module 
is two k   kilobyt         

04:13:10.459 --> 04:13:13.121
kilobytes           kilobytes.  
I'll show you it running        

04:13:15.180 --> 04:13:17.180
 running. 

04:13:30.380 --> 04:13:31.407
         running.  
This is basically           

04:13:31.408 --> 04:13:33.408
basically a simple        simple
 game of life and it's running 

04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:35.287
        running here in Chrome 
       Chrome and as you can see

04:13:35.288 --> 04:13:37.956
 the performance is    is not so
 fast      fast.  The little 

04:13:37.957 --> 04:13:41.582
glider is gliig       gliig down
 the bottom there.  You get a 

04:13:41.583 --> 04:13:45.243
rough idea how fast      fast 
that runs.  So that's pretty 

04:13:45.435 --> 04:13:47.860
good.  
Now of course if    if this was 

04:13:47.861 --> 04:13:49.317
a one browse        browser 
story       story it would be 

04:13:49.318 --> 04:13:53.491
not a very interesting story.   
       story.  So so we'll light

04:13:53.702 --> 04:13:55.532
 up Firefox         Firefox 
here.  And Firefox is    is 

04:13:55.533 --> 04:13:57.929
lighting          lighting up   
 up the WebAssembly             

04:13:57.930 --> 04:14:01.213
WebAssembly module        module
 running         running the 

04:14:01.214 --> 04:14:03.214
same code

04:14:04.631 --> 04:14:06.051
 performance is basically 
          basically identical 

04:14:06.052 --> 04:14:07.960
          identical.  Two browse
        browser engines         

04:14:07.961 --> 04:14:09.961
engines.  Already         
          engines.  All right 

04:14:11.540 --> 04:14:13.540
      right. 

04:14:17.588 --> 04:14:22.843
       right.  
Here we have sfary            

04:14:22.844 --> 04:14:26.026
have safari        safari and lo
    lo and behold it's running 

04:14:26.027 --> 04:14:28.027
as well.  The same module       
 module, running beautiful 

04:14:28.044 --> 04:14:30.292
          beautifully.  Not a 
problem whatsoever            

04:14:30.293 --> 04:14:31.939
whatsoever.  You'll notice here 
that execution           

04:14:31.940 --> 04:14:33.378
execution speed is basically 
          basically identical   

04:14:33.379 --> 04:14:37.611
        identical between all of
 them      them.  And just to 

04:14:37.612 --> 04:14:39.941
round out the four          the 
four, I'll run it in a virtual 

04:14:40.110 --> 04:14:42.592
        virtual machine in edge 
   Edge.  This runs a little bit

04:14:43.196 --> 04:14:44.734
 slower only because         
because it's within a virtual 

04:14:44.735 --> 04:14:46.735
        virtual machine but it 
is edge    Edge and it works

04:14:46.839 --> 04:14:50.481
       works.  So this, I just 
want to bring       bring home 

04:14:50.482 --> 04:14:52.482
the point --         

04:14:54.799 --> 04:14:54.946
 point -- 
[ Applause ] 

04:14:54.947 --> 04:15:02.347
                                                                            and
 it works.  So this, I just want

04:14:54.947 --> 04:14:57.680
 to bring home the point -- 
[ Applause ] 

04:14:54.947 --> 04:14:58.301
Thank you.  
So I just wanted to show that 

04:14:58.302 --> 04:15:00.539
this is    is a real thing      
 thing and it actually          

04:15:00.540 --> 04:15:03.232
actually does run in all browse 
       browsers. 

04:15:06.280 --> 04:15:10.184
 If    If we could       could 
switch back to a slide for one s

04:15:10.328 --> 04:15:14.122
   sec.  So this is    is 
another demo      demo.  This is

04:15:14.548 --> 04:15:17.941
    is another classic computer 
science         science 10    

04:15:17.942 --> 04:15:25.035
101, which is    is a manned l  
 will             manned will 

04:15:25.036 --> 04:15:30.922
brat                  manned 
            is a manned he 

04:15:31.003 --> 04:15:34.492
               is a Mand        
a Mandelbrot              a 

04:15:34.493 --> 04:15:37.312
Mandelbrot set.  It's the 
perfect candidate           

04:15:37.313 --> 04:15:38.216
candidate for a WebAssembly 
            WebAssembly module 

04:15:38.217 --> 04:15:40.217
       module.  This is    is in
 C.          is in C + + 

04:15:40.781 --> 04:15:44.914
browsers.  If we could switch 
back to a slide for one sec.  So

04:15:40.781 --> 04:15:45.047
 this is another demo.  This is 
another classic computer science

04:15:40.781 --> 04:15:45.047
 101, which is a Mandelbrot set.
  It's the perfect candidate for

04:15:40.781 --> 04:15:42.626
 a WebAssembly module.  This is 
in C + +.  Can we switch it to 

04:15:42.627 --> 04:15:44.627
the laptop again

04:15:46.795 --> 04:15:48.174
 please?  And so this is yufr 
     yufr classic Mandelbrot  

04:15:48.175 --> 04:15:50.952
          Mandelbrot.  I'll 
click through and start zooming

04:15:51.057 --> 04:15:53.988
         zooming         zooming
 in on it to give      give you 

04:15:53.989 --> 04:15:57.752
the idea how fast      fast the 
computation is    is. 

04:16:00.836 --> 04:16:03.138
 This is    is how fast      
fast I can run it using 

04:16:03.139 --> 04:16:04.521
WebAssembly             
WebAssembly.  It would be nice 

04:16:04.522 --> 04:16:06.268
to compare to JavaScript
            JavaScript, but in 

04:16:06.269 --> 04:16:08.499
any case if    if anyone has 
played with this stuff before 

04:16:08.500 --> 04:16:10.815
they would understand           
 understand. 

04:16:21.873 --> 04:16:22.854
 Prach                    
understand.  Switch back to the 

04:16:22.855 --> 04:16:24.855
slides        slides again.  
One more little gem 

04:16:24.944 --> 04:16:26.454
                more little demo
      demo for you and this is 

04:16:26.455 --> 04:16:28.193
   is fantastic           
fantastic.  This is    is a 

04:16:28.194 --> 04:16:30.646
wonderful           wonderful 
open source community project.  

04:16:30.647 --> 04:16:34.118
It's by someone who             
someone whose               

04:16:34.213 --> 04:16:38.414
                  project.  It's
 called web DSP.  And what this 

04:16:38.415 --> 04:16:46.831
actually is is    is a browse  
      browser.  This will 

04:16:46.832 --> 04:16:48.721
showcase what you can really do 
with WebAssembly             

04:16:48.722 --> 04:16:55.741
WebAssembly.  Can we hit the 
laptop again please?  So what 

04:16:55.742 --> 04:17:00.255
this is    is, this is    is 
like live video just play it in 

04:17:00.256 --> 04:17:04.355
the brousz                  it 
in the browse        browser.  

04:17:04.356 --> 04:17:07.871
The right-hand side      side we
 have these graphs.  Right now 

04:17:07.872 --> 04:17:10.614
we're just playing         
playing the video. 

04:17:21.783 --> 04:17:24.390
 This is    is amazing         
amazing, it has a whole lot of 

04:17:24.391 --> 04:17:28.026
little effects.  Doing edge     
 edge detection           

04:17:28.027 --> 04:17:30.396
detection.  This is    is all 
running         running         

04:17:30.397 --> 04:17:31.115
running in a WebAssembly  
           WebAssembly module  

04:17:31.116 --> 04:17:33.139
      module. 

04:17:38.405 --> 04:17:44.357
 Nk             module.  To 
prove it's not a canned demo  

04:17:44.447 --> 04:17:46.563
    demo, we can actually 
         actually switch to a 

04:17:46.564 --> 04:17:52.289
web cam.  I can do things       
 things to myself and make 

04:17:52.290 --> 04:17:57.970
myself look      look horrible. 
 Do kind of like edge de    

04:17:57.971 --> 04:18:01.085
dedetection             
dedetection.  We're still 

04:18:01.086 --> 04:18:04.159
pulling 58 frames        frames 
a second with web assembly

04:18:20.428 --> 04:18:22.522
          assembly.  Fantastic 
          Fantastic.  Back to 

04:18:22.523 --> 04:18:24.523
the slides       

04:18:26.364 --> 04:18:28.364
 slides. 

04:18:31.311 --> 04:18:33.610
        slides.  
The WebAssembly             

04:18:33.611 --> 04:18:37.629
WebAssembly video edit      
editor, jip on that web address 

04:18:37.630 --> 04:18:39.642
and have a look      look if you
 like.  Also      Also we have 

04:18:39.643 --> 04:18:41.940
an open source project at Google
 which is    is all about       

04:18:41.941 --> 04:18:45.608
about compressing             
compressing 3-    3-D.  So it's 

04:18:45.609 --> 04:18:48.987
a great thing       thing to 
use.  And the team that was 

04:18:48.988 --> 04:18:52.284
building          building it 
have done a whole lot     lot of

04:18:52.285 --> 04:18:53.502
 bench marking         marking. 
 What you're seeing        

04:18:53.503 --> 04:18:55.353
seeing at the top is their 
WebAssembly             

04:18:55.354 --> 04:18:56.199
WebAssembly code compiled   
       compiled and the bottom 

04:18:56.200 --> 04:19:02.180
is asm     asm.js        asm.js.
  The whole point of showing 

04:19:02.265 --> 04:19:04.265
        showing you this is    
is that this is    is actually

04:19:04.376 --> 04:19:09.229
          actually quite a 
really intense thing       

04:19:09.230 --> 04:19:12.743
thing.  Like really amazing     
    amazing.  And it decodes  

04:19:12.845 --> 04:19:14.927
       decodes the model       
model in 12s seconds         

04:19:14.928 --> 04:19:18.195
seconds but asm     asm.js takes
       takes 18 seconds         

04:19:18.196 --> 04:19:21.063
seconds.  The point of this is 
WebAssembly             

04:19:21.064 --> 04:19:23.230
WebAssembly runs in two-thirds 
of the        of the time as the

04:19:23.231 --> 04:19:23.767
 ee equilibrium 
                      as the 

04:19:23.768 --> 04:19:28.336
equivalent asm     asm.js       
 asm.js.  This is    is just the

04:19:28.499 --> 04:19:31.230
 run time.  Virtual past 
             Virtual pass time 

04:19:31.231 --> 04:19:32.505
is    is not county 
              is not counted 

04:19:32.506 --> 04:19:36.527
        counted here and that's 
much      much, much      much 

04:19:36.528 --> 04:19:38.528
here. 

04:19:39.736 --> 04:19:40.310
      here.  
Enough          

04:19:40.311 --> 04:19:42.053
Enough of my talking         
talking and demoing         

04:19:42.054 --> 04:19:43.868
demoing.  I guess you probably 
         probably want to work 

04:19:43.869 --> 04:19:45.733
out how you can build a 
WebAssembly             

04:19:45.734 --> 04:19:46.992
WebAssembly medicinual 
           medicinual for    

04:19:48.434 --> 04:19:52.492
modelual for your application.  
If you want to get set up on 

04:19:52.493 --> 04:19:56.082
your development machine.  The 
Mandelbrot            Mandelbrot

04:19:56.083 --> 04:20:00.310
 demo      demo and Conway   
     Conway game, while you're 

04:20:00.402 --> 04:20:03.602
       you're here go over and 
have a go.  Otherwise           

04:20:03.603 --> 04:20:06.317
Otherwise when you get home you 
can get it set up on your own 

04:20:06.318 --> 04:20:12.123
machine.  So right now the 
compile         compiler is    

04:20:12.124 --> 04:20:15.146
is your best      best friend.  
So if you visit       visit this

04:20:15.986 --> 04:20:17.718
 link, download          
download the compile         

04:20:17.719 --> 04:20:20.764
compilers, build a tool chain.  
Once you've installed           

04:20:20.765 --> 04:20:22.765
installed it and built       
built it all, you probably 

04:20:22.829 --> 04:20:25.130
         probably want to do 
something with C lus            

04:20:25.131 --> 04:20:27.131
with C + + 

04:20:27.515 --> 04:20:31.515
you get home you can get it set 
up on your own machine.  So 

04:20:27.515 --> 04:20:31.581
right now the compiler is your 
best friend.  So if you visit 

04:20:27.515 --> 04:20:31.248
this link, download the 
compilers, build a tool chain.  

04:20:27.515 --> 04:20:31.581
Once you've installed it and 
built it all, you probably want 

04:20:27.515 --> 04:20:29.788
to do something with C + + code.
  Once you've done this, it's 

04:20:29.789 --> 04:20:32.461
pretty easy.  
Here are two     two command 

04:20:32.462 --> 04:20:35.885
lines, one to build a C filesen
             a C file and one to

04:20:36.077 --> 04:20:36.945
 build a C + +  

04:20:36.946 --> 04:20:41.212
chain.  Once you've installed it
 and built it all, you probably 

04:20:36.946 --> 04:20:41.079
want to do something with C + + 
code.  Once you've done this, 

04:20:36.946 --> 04:20:40.346
it's pretty easy.  
Here are two command lines, one 

04:20:36.946 --> 04:20:37.792
to build a C file and one to 
build a C + + file.  It's as 

04:20:37.793 --> 04:20:43.050
easy as that.  It's all you have
 to do.  The minus       minus S

04:20:43.051 --> 04:20:44.871
 in the command line there, 
that's the thing       thing 

04:20:44.872 --> 04:20:46.872
that tells       tells 
emscripten            emscripten

04:20:47.752 --> 04:20:48.686
 to generate WebAssembly 
            WebAssembly module

04:20:48.687 --> 04:20:53.721
        modules.  The output of 
this will be two             

04:20:53.722 --> 04:20:58.531
will be two files.  Hello       
Hello.js          Hello.js 

04:20:58.532 --> 04:21:01.332
contains all the gu        the 
gui code so it makes       makes

04:21:02.187 --> 04:21:03.815
 it all semple               it 
all simple        simple and 

04:21:03.816 --> 04:21:06.259
I'll show you how you call the 
module        module.  

04:21:06.260 --> 04:21:11.108
So here is    is like what you 
    you put inside your C++     

04:21:11.109 --> 04:21:13.215
C++ code something like this.  
If you want to pass data      

04:21:13.216 --> 04:21:16.468
data in and out you can use a 
thing       thing called bind.  

04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:18.065
In this thing               In 
this this case we're exporting

04:21:18.066 --> 04:21:20.057
           exporting a function 
called my function and from     

04:21:20.058 --> 04:21:22.966
 from that function we're 
returning           returning a

04:21:23.144 --> 04:21:26.477
             returning a type to
 memory view.  A JavaScript 

04:21:26.566 --> 04:21:28.542
           JavaScript that will 
look      look like a typed 

04:21:28.543 --> 04:21:30.851
array       array.  The beauty 
       beauty of this when you 

04:21:30.852 --> 04:21:34.260
pass the memory from Dr.   
       from C + + 

04:21:34.455 --> 04:21:38.255
  In this this case we're 
exporting a function called my 

04:21:34.455 --> 04:21:38.721
function and from that function 
we're returning a type to memory

04:21:34.455 --> 04:21:38.521
 view.  A JavaScript that will 
look like a typed array.  The 

04:21:34.455 --> 04:21:34.629
beauty of this when you pass the
 memory from C + + back to 

04:21:34.630 --> 04:21:35.907
JavaScript            JavaScript
 land, there's         there's 

04:21:35.908 --> 04:21:41.604
no copy yg         copying 
        copying.  It's just a 

04:21:41.605 --> 04:21:46.273
direct access.  It's a rivrns
        rivrns.  So inside your 

04:21:46.274 --> 04:21:53.246
actual        actual file you 
put a script like this.  It 

04:21:53.247 --> 04:21:54.869
creates         creates a thing 
      thing called module       

04:21:54.870 --> 04:21:58.321
 module.  So when you call in 
your function you go module   

04:21:58.417 --> 04:22:01.389
     module.m          module.my
 function in this case the wid

04:22:01.594 --> 04:22:05.743
     wid and height           
              case the width and

04:22:06.017 --> 04:22:09.053
 height and that data variable 
is    is a reference that I can 

04:22:09.054 --> 04:22:12.677
work with.  Of course you might 
want to do the opposite.  

04:22:12.678 --> 04:22:14.215
Because         Because of 
course this is    is part of the

04:22:14.216 --> 04:22:15.167
             part of the web 
platform          platform.  And

04:22:15.168 --> 04:22:17.138
 one of the        of the beauty
        beauties of WebAssembly 

04:22:17.139 --> 04:22:19.640
is    is that you can interact 
with all of the        of the 

04:22:19.641 --> 04:22:22.055
web API     APIs that already 
exist       exist.  Here's a 

04:22:22.056 --> 04:22:26.573
fairly simple example         
example of using       using 

04:22:26.574 --> 04:22:28.954
EMASM which is    is a chunk   
    chunk of JavaScript 

04:22:29.039 --> 04:22:30.820
           JavaScript that gets 
called from      from the code. 

04:22:30.821 --> 04:22:33.388
 You can also      also directly
 map your C + +  

04:22:34.105 --> 04:22:38.171
interact with all of the web 
APIs that already exist.  Here's

04:22:34.105 --> 04:22:38.105
 a fairly simple example of 
using EMASM which is a chunk of 

04:22:34.105 --> 04:22:37.905

directly map your C + + classes 
to JavaScript            

04:22:34.957 --> 04:22:37.407
JavaScript objects and you can 
input JavaScript            

04:22:37.408 --> 04:22:40.557
JavaScript function names into 
the C + + 

04:22:40.652 --> 04:23:00.318
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    APIs
 that already exist.  Here's a 

04:22:40.652 --> 04:22:44.452
fairly simple example of using 
EMASM which is a chunk of 

04:22:40.652 --> 04:22:44.452
JavaScript that gets called from
 the code.  You can also 

04:22:40.652 --> 04:22:44.785
directly map your C + + classes 
to JavaScript objects and you 

04:22:40.652 --> 04:22:40.925
can input JavaScript function 
names into the C + + code.  

04:22:40.926 --> 04:22:42.737
       code.  It require        
 requires a little more boiler 

04:22:42.738 --> 04:22:44.738
       boiler plate code but 
that's perfect         perfectly

04:22:45.075 --> 04:22:49.952
 possible.  
So there are a bunch of really 

04:22:49.953 --> 04:22:53.476
cool resources here.  If you 
want to follow up a little more.

 scary       scary but you might

04:23:13.754 --> 04:23:14.924
 find it interesting            
 interesting.  And if you want 

04:23:14.925 --> 04:23:15.787
to get involved          
involved with the community, 

04:23:15.788 --> 04:23:18.664
because         because the 
community is    is where it was 

04:23:18.665 --> 04:23:20.415
originally developed           
developed.  And it's a friendly 

04:23:20.416 --> 04:23:22.589
         friendly environment.  
You can go in and ask     ask 

04:23:22.590 --> 04:23:24.183
questions and get answers 
        answers or make 

04:23:24.184 --> 04:23:30.813
suggestions for future changes. 
 In any case, when you first 

04:23:30.814 --> 04:23:33.229
build yourself          yourself
 a   a nice WebAssembly

04:23:33.444 --> 04:23:35.444
             WebAssembly module 
       module, and you import it

04:23:35.581 --> 04:23:37.800
 into your app, whether it's a 
progressive             

04:23:37.801 --> 04:23:41.545
progressive web app or not, it's
 if              not, if    if 

04:23:41.546 --> 04:23:43.421
it's a progressive             
progressive web app you know 

04:23:43.422 --> 04:23:45.475
what your users       users are 
going to say to you     you?  I 

04:23:45.476 --> 04:23:47.756
can't believe that's not a 
native        native app.  

04:23:47.757 --> 04:23:50.459
Anyway, with that I'll open the 
floor for questions.  And thank 

04:23:50.460 --> 04:23:52.460
you.
