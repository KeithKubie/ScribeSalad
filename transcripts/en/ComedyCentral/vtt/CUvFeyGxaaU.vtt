00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:03.637
[bell rings]

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.772
[indistinct chatter]

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:08.976
- [laughs]
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.214
WHY YOU READIN', BITCH?

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:16.617
- BECAUSE I LIKE TO READ,
AND THIS IS A REALLY GOOD BOOK.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.453
- YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD BITCH,
BITCH.

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.054
- WHY YOU GOTTA
BOTHER ME, MAN?

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.223

[dramatic piano music]

00:00:23.257 --> 00:00:25.425
I'M NOT DOING
VERY WELL IN SCHOOL.

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:27.227
I'M READING
AT A THIRD-GRADE LEVEL.

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:29.796
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO GET LEFT BACK,

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.965
SO WHEN I SEE SOMEBODY
READING FOR FUN,

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.268
IT MAKES ME FEEL
THAT MUCH MORE STUPID!

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:37.271
AND THEN I GET MAD!
[music stops]

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:40.007
- UM, I DIDN'T
KNOW THAT. I--

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.642
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR OPENING UP TO ME--

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:42.643
- SHUT UP, QUEER!

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:44.411
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:45.979
WHY--I MEAN,
WHY YOU GOTTA GO THERE?

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:47.814
[piano music]

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.249
- I'VE BEEN HAVING
SEXUAL FANTASIES

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:50.984
ABOUT SOME OF
THE OTHER GUYS AT SCHOOL.

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:52.419
- WHAT?
- GIMME THAT!

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:55.656
I'M AFRAID OF THESE FEELINGS
AND WHAT THEY MIGHT MEAN.

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:57.457
IT'S LIKE, BECAUSE
I HATE MYSELF SO MUCH,

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:59.159
I GOTTA
POINT THAT HATE OUTWARD

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:01.695
TOWARDS YOU!
[snickers]

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.063
[music stops]

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.898
- YOU UNDERSTAND THIS
ON SUCH A DEEP LEVEL THAT--

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.800
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND [bleep]!
- WHOA!

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.168
- NOW I'M GONNA
PUNISH YOU PHYSICALLY

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.670
FOR ACKNOWLEDGING
MY EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS!

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:10.971
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.673
I WAS GONNA SAY IF YOU
UNDERSTAND YOURSELF SO WELL,

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.741
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TRY WORKING ON CHANGING IT.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:16.844
- OF COURSE
I WANT TO CHANGE IT!

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.179
BUT IT'S THE ONLY
DEFENSE MECHANISM I HAVE

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:22.482
AGAINST DEEPER, MORE TERRIFYING
PROBLEMS BURIED INSIDE OF ME!

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:24.518
[brakes squeak]

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.189
YOU'RE LUCKY MY DAD'S HERE.
[piano music]

00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:31.458
- [banging]
GET IN THE DAMN TRUCK, SON.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.861
I NEED TO TAKE YOU HOME AND BEAT
ON YOU 'CAUSE I HATE MYSELF.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:36.129
AND YOU LOOK LIKE
YOUR MOTHER WHO LEFT ME.

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:37.297
THEN I'M GONNA BLOCK OUT
THE GUILT I FEEL

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:40.901
OVER MISTREATING YOU
WITH A RIVER OF VODKA.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.302
- I'M GONNA INTERNALIZE THAT

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:44.638
AND UNKNOWINGLY TRANSFER IT
ONTO YOU TOMORROW.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:50.110
â™ª

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:53.146
COMING RELUCTANTLY.
