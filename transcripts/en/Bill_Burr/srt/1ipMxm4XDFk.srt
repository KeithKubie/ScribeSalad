00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,770
So I got a bunch of Shit I have to do.
You know, you know when you got family,

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,630

We have a Brabant with the family.

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,420
Baggaged the Vegas
fucking mafioso line ever.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,420
I'm not going to say, you know, cause
I want to shit on the fucking writers.

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,030
I'm like shit on people that
I'm in this industry sort of.

14
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:50,000
That was the laziest fucking writing
ever. You see sort of a mob guy?

15
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:54,530
Yeah. Nah, they're having family
problems with the family back east.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,790
How Far East you're in La.

17
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,940
Are you having problems
with the family in Nevada

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,690
and problems with the family baggy? Um,

19
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,580
I'm in construction. Oh, it's
not that movie. All right.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,590
Anyways, it's not the one,

21
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:22,591
you think it was more
recent and they evidentaly

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:23,980
yeah.

23
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,980
From what I gathered from the writing
was they were having problems with the

24
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:33,910
family. Baggies, sorry, I'm going to
kill this thing here. Um, anyways,

25
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:36,790
you know, when you, when you got
fucking relatives coming out,

26
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:40,240
you know what the deal is? You got to
fucking clean your house up. You know,

27
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,590
you, you got to get all spiffy,
go out and get a haircut of you,

28
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,740
meet you shave it down,
right. You're looking at,

29
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,280
in my head how successful
I'm doing. Well, right.

30
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,660
You gotta track him to
all these fucking spots.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,690
You got to try to
impress people, you know.

32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,083
Okay.

33
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,230
Kinda hit me yesterday as I
was, I was scampering you know,

34
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,720
somebody don't do a lot
scampering something.

35
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:09,770
Usually a marsupial does
up a tree, I believe, um,

36
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,610
scamper around the house, just trying
to fucking make it look like I,

37
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:17,390
I don't live in a world of clutter.
And at one point I'm just saying, I,

38
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,540
you know, built, nobody
gives a shit about you.

39
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,250
Nobody is coming out to see you.
Nobody gives a fuck what you're doing.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,540
It's all about your daughter.
And I was like, I was just great.

41
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,520
It's perfect. She's the
headliner. I'm just hosting. Hey,

42
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,610
how's everybody doing?
You want a burger? Boom.

43
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,980
Let's keep this show moving
right along. Put the act.

44
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:42,710
Y'All came here to seek my lovely
daughter. That's all I got to do.

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,120
All you have to do is host to show
those to show. As long as she's cute,

46
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,240
what she can help. As long as
she smiles, when she can help,

47
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:53,150
that's all she does is smile and laugh.
She's the fucking greatest kid ever.

48
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:55,550
I'll be fine. So there you go.

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,360
Why am I trying to do all
the dishes? It was funny.

50
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,670
All you really do, whenever you have
company over, you have like that, the,

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,040
that one fucking closet.

52
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,190
You throw everything in or maybe one
closet and every room you just take all of

53
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,570
all of the clutter and you
just throw it into the closet.

54
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:18,340
Like for some reason as this pressure
that your house has to look like,

55
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:22,600
you know, like a show room
at a furniture store. Like,

56
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,610
we don't have any knickknacks,

57
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,340
we are living a minimalist lifestyle.
Everything is neat and is in order.

58
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,860
Everything is in its proper place.
Harmony is what you're experiencing here.

59
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,730
We never fight is never
a look crossword, um,

60
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,853
day. He can't live up to it.

61
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,980
So I just decided I got to a certain
level of clean. I'm like, all right,

62
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,210
well this is what it looks like. You
know, what are you gonna do? Oh God,

63
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,540
I'm still nervous. Anyways. Um,

64
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,930
let's get down to the fucking
tax that are brass here. Um,

65
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,440
oh boy. The city of Washington
DC, the district of Columbia.

66
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,040
Oh, their morning today. Jesus Christ.

67
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,620
I actually went to a city Gab with Josh.

68
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,640
He had a mys and um, this is
how big a hockey fan I am.

69
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,250
The Celtics were playing the
wizard jested at game five.

70
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:16,420
I thought it was game six.

71
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,960
I got lost with all the sleep deprivation
from all cutie cakes downstairs.

72
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,650
Right. Um, and I actually,

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,860
we went in the cigar bar and we were
watching the game seven and in between

74
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:30,910
periods we would click in to the
Celtics. I know Bradley had a huge game.

75
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,020
I know that the wizards went up like
four to nothing and then that was it.

76
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:39,810
We gave him the old right there, Fred
and kept our foot on their neck. Right.

77
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,350
So that was the biggest night in
Washington d c sports perhaps ever.

78
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,440
I had fun cause I woke up
cause I was supposed to, um,

79
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,470
yesterday I woke up early by Doodoodoo
dude and I was supposed to call 'em a

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,270
Regina, Saskatchewan, cause I'm
going up there for some shows. Uh,

81
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,970
I don't know where the fuck I'm
going. I think I'm in Winnipeg.

82
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,480
And then I'm driving all the
way up to fucking Saskatoon,

83
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,540
which is like an eight and a half hour
drive and I'm doing it and everyone's

84
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:14,350
like, Oh you don't go bug the toy. Good
to put your farms. I don't give a shit.

85
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,070
I'm going to have a great time. He
and Nick Craig, we're going to go up,

86
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:21,880
there's gotta be some sort of ice cream
store of some fucking stupid tourist

87
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,330
attraction along the way. And even
if there isn't, who gives a shit?

88
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,240
I like driving that stuff.
Seen it, that it exists.

89
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,210
I did the drive one time from
California to El Paso, Texas, and, uh,

90
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,240
that's one of the great drives
over dead, especially I believe,

91
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,150
I don't know if it was in Arizona or
New Mexico when you just get into the

92
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:43,660
badlands. I always thought
the badlands meant, you know,

93
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:47,470
some Badass dudes live there and
it's just bad as far as like,

94
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:52,090
you can't grow anything
that's like scorched earth.

95
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,180
It's like basically the direction
we're headed in. If we keep fucking,

96
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,670
and I don't know if you
believe Al Gore, I mean,

97
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,590
I tend to believe a man who invented
the Internet, you know, anyways.

98
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,230
Um, so we're going to be doing that
drive. And uh, so I had to call,

99
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,050
cause they added,

100
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,050
they added another show in Regina
because who the fuck ever goes to

101
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:20,060
Saskatchewan? You know, nobody. So
people are excited. Like, Holy Shit,

102
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,740
this guy's not my favorite, but he
fucking showed up. Let's go. Right.

103
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,240
They and Brahms, we fear me baggies.
So they added a second show.

104
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:29,811
So now I gotta,

105
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,660
I gotta put on my top hat and my
tales and I gotta fucking sell it.

106
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:35,360
So I'm waiting to call the
radio. This is such a long story.

107
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,730
So I'm thinking in my head
right now, I'm like, wow,

108
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,100
this is the biggest day in
Washington DC sports history.

109
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,780
I should call the fucking sports
junkies. I'm going to do it. I called in,

110
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,270
talked to larch and everybody yet, uh, I
thought the capitals were going to win.

111
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,710
I just thought how badly
they beat the penguins

112
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,210
in a, in game six. I just
thought that they, uh,

113
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,930
they was shutting down their offense,
that the penguins were frustrated.

114
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,990
You know, I knew the fucking
flower they was going to have,

115
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,080
was going to have a good game,

116
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:12,680
but I just thought they just needed to
break the seal. They had to get that one,

117
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,310
give him a little bit of happy feet,
give him some to fucking think about it.

118
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,193
So I called in there,

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,650
then it called and Randy a Bauman
and bill Crawford at wd DV.

120
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,140
And uh, I wasn't a contact on either
one of them. My team side of it.

121
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,760
I'm not going to try to be a killjoy, you
know, I, this is the deal. I actually,

122
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,160
I don't know what happened. I
used to hate the fucking penguins.

123
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:37,070
I don't anymore. It's a combination
that they don't really have any,

124
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:40,670
like overtly cheap fucking
knee breakers anymore.

125
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:44,570
And I got a lot of friends that
either live in Pittsburgh or you know,

126
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,810
out here that are from them. Fucking
pardon me. I can't root against partners.

127
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,410
So I go to the cigar bar and I, uh,

128
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,610
I'm watching it with fucking Josh, Adam
Meyers, and he's just like, you know,

129
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,250
I said, look, dude, I'm not going to
lie to you. I hope you go one in one.

130
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,420
I want the Celtics to win and I'm
going to root for the capitals.

131
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,550
I'm sitting here with you. I'll
fucking root for them, you know,

132
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,930
secretly I'm like,
well, if they don't win,

133
00:08:05,931 --> 00:08:09,320
I'm happy for fucking Randy Crawford
and partner. Can those guys, what,

134
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,480
what do I care? I'm, my
fucking team's not in it.

135
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,370
So we sit there and Josh
is fucking losing his shit.

136
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,130
And um, it was just
unbelievable. You know,

137
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:24,920
I call him the flower all the time.
I forget his fucking name already.

138
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,480
Mark Andre Flurry. What
a fucking game he had.

139
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,900
They just, Oh my God,
fucking captive, just snake.

140
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:35,990
But even when they had the guy beat,
even when they had them fucking beat,

141
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,280
they just couldn't get it on this day.

142
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:40,460
They was wide open and kicked the
fucking thing and I just couldn't do it.

143
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,660
They couldn't do it. But I have to say
right now, game seven, NHL playoffs,

144
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,700
I will put that up against any,
uh, any sport out there. Um,

145
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,830
the NHL playoffs, you
know, and I actually,

146
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,010
I actually totally missed the Edmonton
ducks one because I had to go and I had

147
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:59,430
to do a couple of shows and I thought
I taped the game and I fucked up.

148
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:04,431
I didn't someone have to go on the NHL
app today and Rewatch that game knowing

149
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:08,430
full well that the ducks won, which I
had a feeling they were going to do.

150
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,200
I just thought they had a
little more experienced.

151
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:12,170
They'd been there and that
type of shit. So yeah.

152
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:14,893
Um,

153
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,420
the fucking Josh, Jesus Christ, he was
just like, you know, by the end of it,

154
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:22,810
he was just like, you know what, fuck
this. He goes, I'm just going to stress,

155
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:26,260
eat a fucking large pizza and I'm
going to go home and watch cops.

156
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,790
Um, I dunno, having said that, I
still don't have confidence, you know,

157
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,630
with the Celtics and the wizards
I have, I have no idea. Like, uh,

158
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,490
this is a weird series. Um, it kind of
seems like the teams are gonna hold,

159
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,570
serve, you know, and hopefully that
happens and we'll win a game. Seven,

160
00:09:49,571 --> 00:09:53,410
I have no idea. But just
watching like a DC sports fan,

161
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:54,670
it reminds me I beat,

162
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:58,960
I always have empathy for all of those
people cause that was my life right up

163
00:09:58,961 --> 00:10:02,530
until basically 2004, I guess the Patriots
had already won one at that point.

164
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:04,210
But um, yeah,

165
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:08,380
that was kind of my life as a sports
fan for the longest fucking time.

166
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,893
Um,

167
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,570
yeah.

168
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,570
So my condolences to the
city of Washington DC still
got the wizard GNR out of

169
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:20,930
it. Congratulations to Pittsburgh. Oh,
this is going to kill me to say this.

170
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:23,870
Congratulations to Anaheim.

171
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,150
Whatever you are down there,
whatever that is, Orange County,

172
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:31,300
whatever the fuck that is down there.

173
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,720
I don't even, I don't even,

174
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,580
it's just one of the most soulless
fucking places I've ever made me know what

175
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm judging the place. I always
drive down there, you know,

176
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,660
to do the Improv or whatever.

177
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,973
Um,

178
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,110
bought me hockey stuff down there. They
got fucking Disneyland's down there.

179
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:52,260
It's just, I don't know what it is.
It just looks like a giant movie set.

180
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:53,490
It doesn't look like I'm,

181
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,060
it's like when I went to San Jose and
they had that little mall area where they

182
00:10:57,061 --> 00:11:01,110
had all that high end shit. They tried
to make it look vaguely fucking, I dunno,

183
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,730
European and you just like this.

184
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,780
This was clearly all built at the
same time and there's no history here.

185
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,210
I don't know what happened cause
I read a Steve Martin's book.

186
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,970
I'm born standing up I the
hardcover original version.

187
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:21,000
I loaned it to my neighbor and I never
got it back. What a fucking asshole.

188
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,850
That's still bugs me that I did that. Um,

189
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,610
but he was talking about how he grew up
in Orange County and riding his bicycle

190
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,420
to Disneyland past all the orange
groves and just the way he painted the

191
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,180
pictures, like, wow, that
sounded like a beautiful place.

192
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,310
And now you go down there
and it's just, you know,

193
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:44,360
one fucking strip mall after another.
I mean, it was getting hold. I mean,

194
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:45,980
human beings had done a
lot of unpretty, you know,

195
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:48,980
a lot of fucking lot unprotected
sex since then. And uh,

196
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,910
just kind of push the oranges out really
bill, is that what happened? I mean,

197
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:55,744
evidently,

198
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,420
evidently as far as I
can surmise. Um, anyway,

199
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:07,140
so I did two shows last night, did a
benefit at the laugh factory and I did a,

200
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,850
and I did the all things comedy
network show at, uh, the comedy store.

201
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,740
And I had also done a show Monday night
where I ran the whole hour and at the

202
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:22,540
risk of sounding like a
fucking bald, arrogant cont,

203
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,550
uh, the new hour is crushing
the man, a great time.

204
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,811
Somewhere in the,

205
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:31,990
during those Cleveland shows that put me
over the top and now I have confidence

206
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:32,410
that uh,

207
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,720
people aren't going to feel like they're
getting ripped off when they go to see

208
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,470
me. So, um, anyways, I dunno,

209
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,680
I got a bunch of fucking shit on my mind
cause I got to go down to the fucking

210
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:46,080
airport. I got to pick up some, I
gotta pick up the fee and we babies.

211
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,350
Um, oh by the way, my
apology to a MotoGP fence.

212
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,150
I didn't even know there was a race
this past week and I went on to my, uh,

213
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:58,480
my DVR or whatever the hell you call
it. And low and behold, there it is,

214
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,710
you know,

215
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,280
and the way my whole laugh just watches
whatever the hell she wants and now

216
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:06,180
deletes it. I didn't feel
like I had to include her now.

217
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,160
Like she likes motorcycle
racing or anything. So, um,

218
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,630
I believe they were in spanked.

219
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,680
I just sat there with my daughter and I
watched all three races back to back the

220
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,310
moto to the three in the fucking GP race
and they will all fucking great races.

221
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,000
You know, it's funny.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,360
At first I didn't like moto three with
their little skinny bicycle tires.

223
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,070
Now I'm fucking into it. All three of
them were great races. The motto too,

224
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,560
I think the model two
was the one with the guy.

225
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,900
The guy in the lead fucking
just dumped the bike.

226
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:39,180
He fucked up coming out of a turn. Um,

227
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,530
and then the other guy was just
up to him not to blow it. And uh,

228
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,400
I don't know. I loved all of it and I'm
just watching the, uh, the MotoGP race.

229
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:52,040
All of a sudden it goes up towards,
I got thousand CCS. Valentino Rossi,

230
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,300
you haven't probably, Hey Nini, what's up?

231
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,980
How are you? I'm flailing over here.

232
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:03,640
I got like another 16 minutes to go and
I'm so stressed and I gotta go to the

233
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:07,660
fucking airport then I'm
all, I'm all over the map.

234
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,100
Um, Valentino Rossi, I was so
weird watching everybody pass him.

235
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,070
He had problems with like his tires.
This is why this guy's this shit.

236
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,710
He's been doing it for, he's been
doing it for so fucking long.

237
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:18,940
I even know who this guy is.

238
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,450
And he came in 10th place and
he's still in first place.

239
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,370
That's pretty God damn impressive.
This early into the season. And uh,

240
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,500
I kind of became a fan of that. Yohan,

241
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,020
Yohan Asarco I like the bike,

242
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,370
all black and he just was fucking
passing everybody. He ended up being,

243
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,780
I don't know what he finished like
fourth, maybe he's a French guy.

244
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:43,990
I like the French, you know, I
don't know, but I'm totally into it.

245
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:48,070
I don't know any of the fucking
names. I know mark my cares. Right.

246
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,400
That's it. I'm looking at all these
other, I've got 'em all a whole list here.

247
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,920
I could pretend like I know these
guys off the top of my head. I don't,

248
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:58,940
I have no idea, but one of these guys
are, but I will tell you, like, he,

249
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,610
I mean if you think racing is boring,

250
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:04,700
motorcycle racing is a good one to
start with because, uh, you know,

251
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,970
if you're not into racing, you want
to see some crashes and uh, you know,

252
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,930
motorcycle race exists.

253
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,940
I mean literally the guy he just imagined
with every fucking stock car race,

254
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,450
every time there was an accident,
the guy like flew out of the car.

255
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,660
Okay.

256
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,780
I mean I'm not sitting there saying
I want to see anybody get hurt.

257
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:24,160
But I mean it is riveting.

258
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,363
Yeah.

259
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,530
It's just fast. Like first of all,

260
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,940
the level of technology of the suit
that they can be going like 150 miles an

261
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:35,700
hour, lay the bike down.
You know, they lean too far.

262
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,430
They fucking hit their knee or some shit.

263
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:40,880
I don't know what happens is I've done
it. That handlebar hits the ground,

264
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,843
there's so low

265
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,460
and they causes the bike to slide out
from underneath them and then they go in

266
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:49,730
like whatever hundred 30 miles an hour,

267
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,790
just slide in and dig pop right back up.

268
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,153
Okay.

269
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,280
Cause the suits are
made out of space. Age.

270
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,330
You know, it was funny when I was, uh,

271
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,940
when I had my brief motorcycle riding
career out here in la before I smartened

272
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:12,920
up and realized that, uh, I'm not a
motorcycle guy. I am a fan, but I am.

273
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,610
I just,

274
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,420
I was riding scared and
everybody's texting and
something bad was gonna happen,

275
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:21,590
man. Um, I, uh,

276
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,420
I actually was going like trying to
think of how to protect myself and I was

277
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:30,560
thinking I was going to get either a
Ducati or I was going to get that Harley,

278
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,400
uh, that throwback seventies one. And uh,

279
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:36,710
I was gonna buy one of those MotoGP suits.

280
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,180
We'd probably gonna cost more than
the bike. I thought it would be.

281
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:43,900
Larry's just be riding a
Harley wearing a GP suit.

282
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,280
You look like he's supposed
to dress like, you know,

283
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,730
you used to be in a biker gang. There's
something about being on a Harley.

284
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:51,080
You have to wear like jeans.

285
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,640
It's like not acceptable to have the
leather on leather suit. Hello. Lovely.

286
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,940
Hello handsome. What's going on?
Another thing I was just going to say,

287
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:04,870
you know what's even more
boring than watching racing?

288
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,810
You just, you just don't
like it at all. Well,

289
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:10,930
listening to you talk about
racing, it's probably more boring.

290
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,010
Wow.

291
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,300
[inaudible]

292
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,890
like four hours. It feels like
there's a swarm of killer bees.

293
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:26,910
That's what it sounds like
does no. Like what, how,

294
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:30,630
why you're just, we're waiting
to watch the crash. Right. I was,

295
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:31,860
I was hearing you from the kitchen.

296
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:35,400
Did you like that's literally what
you're at. Cause it's so fucking boring.

297
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,820
Like that's the level to which like
the boredom you feel when you watch it.

298
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:42,660
Like you're waiting for an accident.

299
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,660
Like that's all your mind goes with
dark plays cause you're so bored.

300
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:49,770
You're like what is this? Someone
does like crash. No, no, no, no.

301
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,610
It's boring. God it's
boring. No, no I was,

302
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,910
I was saying when you first
sit down and watch it,

303
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,790
that's what you're hoping for. Cause
you don't understand what's going on.

304
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,400
But when you, once you start
on just hoping for that,

305
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,590
nobody's hoping for it when they watch it.

306
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,430
Is that why people watch what I'm
saying? If you're not into it,

307
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,640
that's why you would watch, she'd
be like, well I'll see an accident.

308
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:12,720
I mean nobody likes an accident.

309
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,890
Everybody like when they
see somebody changing,

310
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:20,750
a fucking tire will cause
four lanes of, you know,

311
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,510
traffic people going, oh is he
the car gonna fall on his head.

312
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,620
What's going on over there?
Yeah. The rubbernecking,

313
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,760
the most interesting part of the racing
now that I've watched with you is when

314
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,550
is it Lewis Hamilton?
He's the champion. Right?

315
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,810
He Know Nico Rosberg is the ferning
champion, but his wife told him, well,

316
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:39,750
now that you won the championship, it's
time for you to pay attention to me.

317
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,810
And he fucking retired.
Or he was like, oh,

318
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,050
I don't want to deal with Lewis again.
And he just left. Hmm. Well, anyway,

319
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:50,250
I'm here wasn't him that I stout
his team mate and they were like,

320
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:53,100
these two have it spoken
at over six months. Yeah.

321
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,070
It was like a whole days of thunder
thing last year that the dead or the day.

322
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:02,700
Yeah. There's all of that stuff goes
on. There's the pride of the country,

323
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:05,430
the Ferrari's, the Mercedes,
right. All of that shit.

324
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,220
And then once you get into
like the different tires,

325
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:12,990
when to pit the strategy of it and all
of that, it's amazing. And this year, um,

326
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,450
the adjustments that they've made
on the cars is way more passing.

327
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,960
I'll tell you last year was it was a
little boring where it's like, what was,

328
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,380
it was a race to the first turn.

329
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:24,381
Whoever got to their first just to held
that position for the rest of the race

330
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,890
because you couldn't
pass them. Wow. Riveting.

331
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,200
Well, listen, I'm going to go. All
right. She's crying. She's crying. Go,

332
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,830
go, go. I don't mean to
trash your your interests.

333
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,150
I just thought it'd be funny to come in.

334
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,850
You don't find it interesting with them
what those motorcycles go on that fast

335
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:44,910
like the balls at that takes
the fucking balls. I don't,

336
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:49,260
I don't find it
interesting. No doubt balls,

337
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,940
but not interesting. All right,

338
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,980
so you'd rather watch a bunch of balloon
tinted horse screaming at each other.

339
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,640
Yeah, near and Renee Hill. Everybody.

340
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,360
There you go. And that's why
that's there. Right there.

341
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:08,040
That is the fissure in our relationship.
That's the fault line right now.

342
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,610
You know what?

343
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,910
At some point we're going to talk about
the fact that you spend like hours

344
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:15,630
watching people fight each other on
Worldstar and all these other kind of

345
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,231
websites.

346
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:19,260
But then you want to come at me because
I watch real housewives and people are

347
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:19,891
arguing. Well,

348
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:22,830
they never get to the fight every time
they've already to fight a cameraman

349
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,470
breaks it up. If those women would
beat the shit out of each other,

350
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,320
I'd watch it. If you just sit there
and say mean shit to one another.

351
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,510
Well somebody dabs at
the rise with tissues.

352
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,370
It still bugs me to this day that that
white woman spitting fucking Miss New

353
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,250
York's face and they owed it to her.

354
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,780
They owed it to her to give her
a couple of fucking swings. Oh,

355
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:45,060
the way she did the about face,
like that was the end of it.

356
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:49,060
After she spit in somebody's face. True.
They should, uh, let her beat her ass.

357
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,900
Oh, there you go. That's why I
don't like reality TV pop off

358
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,180
all of them. Like she down
there just, it drives me nuts.

359
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,860
It's like you order to ignore reality
TV is, it's just like fucking,

360
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,090
it's like blue balls the whole time
he comes to fight, he comes to fight,

361
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,640
they're starting to swing. I bring
it up, break it up, break it up.

362
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,810
The tension just keeps building
and it never happens. It's like,

363
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:17,920
you know when there's a big
fucking UFC fight coming up, right?

364
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,490
Imagine if they just kept running the
promo and Joe Rogan just kept getting more

365
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:26,380
and more amped up about how great the
fight was going to be and then it never

366
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:29,920
happened. Right. As they went to
fight, Dana white comes out, hey,

367
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,870
there'll be enough of that.
That'll be enough for that.

368
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,490
And then you had to deal with the two
fighters fucking talking to the camera.

369
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,130
I just felt like for me, I wanted to
have a fight to decide it, but you know,

370
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,740
for me, all

371
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,091
right, I'm sorry. Let's,

372
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:52,640
let's read a little bit at that stead
is the number one fucking expression in

373
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,590
reality TV. I know I say it all
the time, nineties feeling for me.

374
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,700
For me. I just feel like for
me, that for me, I need to like,

375
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,210
I need to just do that, but
I am not doing it for her.

376
00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:07,310
I'm doing it for me.

377
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,830
Um, all right. Let's, uh, let's

440
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,890
Mandy's Mandy's riding a motor bike

if you've been settling for store bought
underwear, five packs, I've noticed it.

455
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:21,060
Why? Why would you be
subtly for that? You know,

456
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:24,630
isn't it enough that some poor bastard
had to sell those things together and

457
00:27:24,631 --> 00:27:28,500
then his fucking six month old had to
put them in that plastic bag so you could

bridges, but it's only one.

490
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,930
By the way, the London Bridge
is not the tower bridge.

491
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:37,740
Everybody thinks to tower bridge is the
London Bridge. That's the tower bridge.

492
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,100
Alright?

493
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,980
The London Bridge is the London Bridge
and it looks like a fucking footpath that

ever go to London, all right,

That would be me. Should you stab
your computer screen with your phone?

545
00:32:54,231 --> 00:32:58,040
a sort of 80s pop thing
with the 2017 flare.

546
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:02,000
If I do say so myself, we're gonna
be getting all current low right.

547
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,180
And dive trooper telling you

569
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,360
the only one.

570
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,640
Sometimes Sheila comes talking too much.

571
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,903
[inaudible]

572
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:34,420
yes. Got me in trouble with
fiance's family. Uh, hey there.

573
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,330
Billary Brrrum Clinton.
I'm I fucked up man.

574
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:44,410
As you can probably guess from the
subject line cue the o g a m as a little

575
00:35:47,751 --> 00:35:48,231
background,

576
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:52,580
I'm getting married next month to my
fiance who was wonderful love of my life

577
00:35:52,581 --> 00:35:56,390
and all that. We were visiting her family
last night and playing board games,

578
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:01,000
which we often do. Oh Jesus. [inaudible]
what happened? We had drinking.

579
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,390
Did you get competitive? Huh?
She accused her mom of cheating.

580
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,850
Uh, he goes, I'll spare you the details,

581
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:10,640
but we were playing a card game
with a bunch of characters.

582
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,650
Everyone gets the same people,

583
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,120
but when you use them is
really the key to the game.

584
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:22,220
There was a particularly powerful card I
had held onto until the very last stage

585
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:26,630
of the game. The character's
name was granny Wada,

586
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,643
um,

587
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,000
pronounced Gary water.

588
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:35,350
I gave you the pronunciation and accent
so you wouldn't fuck it up. Well,

589
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:40,100
it is spelled w a t a granny. Ah,

590
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,130
it's the last round of the game and
everyone's going around revealing their

591
00:36:45,131 --> 00:36:45,760
card.

592
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,760
I was last and my plan had worked
perfectly as I went to reveal it,

593
00:36:51,491 --> 00:36:56,050
my inner bill bird took over and I really
got excited. I flipped it over. Oh,

594
00:36:56,051 --> 00:37:00,640
you did it? He goes, oh
no. Oh No. He goes, I said,

595
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,870
it's granny fucking

596
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,363
whoa.

597
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,240
Don't you drop the F pub? Oh my God,

598
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:13,820
I wish I had podcast tee
shirts. I'd send one to you.

599
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,183
Okay.

600
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,890
No, you did. He goes, silence
followed as an echo through the house.

601
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,310
My fiance's family were stunned.

602
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,660
They're not super uptight
people, but people just don't,

603
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,870
just don't throw fucks around
during a board game. You know?

604
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,340
From there it only got worse. My
fiance is listen to your podcast,

605
00:37:35,341 --> 00:37:37,470
so she knows I was imitating you.

606
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,370
She tried to stammer out
an explanation. Oh No.

607
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:43,710
She had to explain away your behavior.

608
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,613
Ah, dude.

609
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,020
He goes, but it didn't really do anything.
I also tried to apologize sheepishly.

610
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,790
Then on top of that,

611
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:59,170
that move gave me enough points
to win the game over everyone,

612
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,280
so I had to awkwardly mark my
score, which made me the winner.

613
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,290
Wow, dude.

614
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,940
When you're getting married next month,

615
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:12,900
so the fucking taste of this is still
going to be in their mouth. He goes,

616
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:14,730
we left almost immediately after,

617
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:18,690
and of course I got yelled at all
the way home. I knew I deserved it,

618
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:20,370
so I didn't even put up much of a fight.

619
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:24,780
That's your first good move in
this story. Oh Wow. He goes,

620
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:29,730
my question is do I try and go out of
my way to remedy the situation or do I

621
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:32,400
just hope everyone forgets
about it and moves on?

622
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,350
We're getting married in six weeks,

623
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:36,790
so it's not like I can
avoid them for very long.

624
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,480
I'm pissed because I fucking
crushed the impression too.

625
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,500
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

626
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,820
Sorry for the Hillary Clinton reference
in the open or I think she's a cunt to a

627
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,340
, I don't think she's a contractor.
Just don't think she's an honest person.

628
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,120
And I don't think just because of
the fact that we've never had a woman

629
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,480
president that that's reason enough to
elect someone is dishonest and as phony

630
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:05,800
as her. Um, anyways, though,
you know what? I would,

631
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,920
I would actually, uh, without your wife.

632
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:12,010
I would just drive over there and
just say, listen, I got to apologize.

633
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,250
I listened to this podcast.
I'm a big fan of the guy. Um,

634
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,690
I was making a joke and in the moment
I didn't realize that you guys didn't

635
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,430
listen to the podcast if you want.

636
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,460
And just Cav a cue up a
clip where you have it,

637
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,990
which might be a bad thing to do,

638
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:30,370
but like just have me
like save something else.

639
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:34,840
Dr cabbies, easy shave butter, but any
might be fuck cause I don't say fuck,

640
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,700
um, [inaudible]

641
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,890
just say, just tell him you're
really embarrassed or whatever.

642
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,410
I think if you went over
there by yourself, I think a,

643
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,980
especially her dad, because I
think that's the big one there.

644
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,240
I think there's, there's something
extra when it's, you know,

645
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:59,480
it's always extra, you know, when,
when you're getting married like a,

646
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,610
you know, if you're a
guy, you know, the, the,

647
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:07,340
the dad's going to be looking at you twice
as hard and the moms can be like, oh,

648
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:08,810
he's, no, it's relaxed, you know.

649
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:12,770
And then the other way around is if you
know they have a son and he brings a

650
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:13,581
woman around,

651
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:16,490
like the mother's going to be fucking
looking at her to see if she's a fucking,

652
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:20,180
you know, and evil little whore. You know,

653
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,740
the dad's going to be looking at you like,

654
00:40:21,741 --> 00:40:25,300
is this guy going to be overbearing
and slap my fucking daughter around or

655
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:29,840
whatever. You know what I mean? I see
a piece of shit, right. Um, oh my God,

656
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:31,010
dude. Wow.

657
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,880
You said it's granny fucking water.

658
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,140
Oh God. Dude, if you film that, oh my God.

659
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,190
Okay.

660
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,870
Jesus Christ. Dude, I got to give, I
got it. My tip of the cap for you there,

661
00:40:48,871 --> 00:40:50,850
man, for doing that. Holy Shit.

662
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,460
I'm getting uncomfortable just thinking
about that. Well, can I, I'll apologize.

663
00:40:56,461 --> 00:40:59,390
Can I apologize to your fiance
for being a bad fucking a

664
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,213
okay.

665
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,300
A bad, um, influence. Hey,
you know what? Play this to a,

666
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,760
play this to your year, your future
in-laws. Dear future in laws.

667
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,700
Hello, I'm bill burr. I'm the
one who says granny defin.

668
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:18,520
I say this type of stuff. I have been
the bad influence. Don't be mad at him.

669
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:21,970
I'm sure he's a wonderful human
being. I'm sorry you missed up.

670
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,470
He messed up your little
cad game there. Um, yeah,

671
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,750
he's gonna make a great
son in law. You know why?

672
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,020
Cause he uses Dr cabbies easy. Shane

673
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,830
don't play that to them. That's
not going to get yet anything.

674
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,410
Just can say he listens to
morons. He must be a moron.

675
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,850
Are they going to have half a moron?

676
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,363
[inaudible]

677
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,350
be like walking up.

678
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,560
[inaudible] it's gone.

679
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,640
It's still bar and a, this is
not the Monday morning podcast.

680
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:51,930
This is the replacement

681
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,120
for the podcasts that I fucking
made yesterday. That uh,

682
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:00,841
oh and I completed this.

683
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:03,630
I already tried to fucking do this
and I just been talking for fucking 20

684
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:05,430
minutes and I looked down
and I wasn't recording.

685
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:08,280
So this is actually the third
fucking time I'm trying to do this.

686
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:13,110
So I'm going to get right to the point
on what the fuck is going on in my life

687
00:43:13,111 --> 00:43:14,520
right now. Uh, kind of like, you know,

688
00:43:14,521 --> 00:43:17,820
when you break your arm or the
first time you tell the story,

689
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,040
you got every fucking detail, right?

690
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,700
Then the next time you tell it there's
a little less detail and then by the

691
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:27,840
fifth time you just pissed and you want
to smash your cast over the fucking

692
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:31,900
person who asked you, how'd you
break your arm dude? Y'All do?

693
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:37,040
What'd you do that for?
Did it hurt? All right,

694
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,870
this is what happened. I recorded
a podcast on Monday. All right.

695
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,700
And um,

696
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,660
I was actually really excited because
somebody sent me this really cool MP3 that

697
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:51,110
they had made where it
was an amalgam of, uh,

698
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,740
all the podcasts I'd done in the
background, you know, in the past. I mean,

699
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,610
you know, just made this really cool
like 92nd thing. So I was like, you know,

700
00:43:58,611 --> 00:43:59,181
that's awesome.

701
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:02,120
This is going to be a great new thing
that I can add to the podcast. Right.

702
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,680
Start it off with my little 16 year old
chick flip flown, you know, cell phone,

703
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,430
those awful podcasts. And
I bought the Olympus ls 10.

704
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:13,070
Then I got a mixer and
a microphone, you know,

705
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:16,000
and you guys are probably sitting there
going, how the fuck can he take this to,

706
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:21,030
to an even higher level. There's no
way. And I was about ready to go.

707
00:44:21,031 --> 00:44:24,180
Like, yeah, there is a
way you mother fuckers,

708
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:28,140
I'm going to fucking have MP3 of the
week and start having people send me in

709
00:44:28,141 --> 00:44:30,870
these mp3s and I fucking
put it into garage.

710
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,480
I edited the whole thing in and I
turned it into a fucking MP three.

711
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,100
And for some reason g cast is not
taking it. I don't know what's going on,

712
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,420
but uh, you know, I'm sure it's
me, so always ends up being me.

713
00:44:43,421 --> 00:44:48,050
So I'm going to figure out
how to do that. And uh,

714
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,810
in the meantime, I will
tell you a quick story.

715
00:44:50,811 --> 00:44:54,630
This is only going to be
like a 20 minute podcast, um,

716
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,370
of what I'm dealing with to my
life right now. I, uh, I got a dog,

717
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,220
I'm just pausing right now waiting for
all the animal lovers out there to stop

718
00:45:03,221 --> 00:45:06,950
going. Oh my God. So that's,

719
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:12,070
could it be so good for him? That
keys can be so good for him? Um, yeah,

720
00:45:12,071 --> 00:45:15,220
it has been good. Um, except for,
you know, a number of things. Uh,

721
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,010
one I didn't pick out the
dog, I was on the road.

722
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,970
This is a typical female thing, you
know, her heart was in a good place.

723
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:26,010
She's like, you know,
he wants to get a dog.

724
00:45:26,011 --> 00:45:30,210
He just doesn't know how to do it cause
he wasn't hugged or loved as a child.

725
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:34,260
So I know what I'm gonna do. I'm
gonna go, I go get a little fuzzy.

726
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,011
Why's he dog?

727
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:37,560
And I'm just going to have it here and
I'm going to surprise or whatever the

728
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:38,610
fuck she was thinking. Right.

729
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:43,860
So basically I'm on the road and it's
typical how women do shit like this.

730
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,400
Okay. I don't know what they
call it. Like a, you know,

731
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:50,640
a finagling manipulation, whatever the,

732
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:55,550
it's whatever the euphemism is.
It's, they lie to you, you know,

733
00:45:55,551 --> 00:45:59,690
and they tell you in bits and pieces,
what the fuck is really going on?

734
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,630
This is, this is how she did it. She
left a message and she said, hey honey,

735
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:10,220
it's knee. Um, I did something
and it involves both of us. Um,

736
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,440
but don't worry, I think you're gonna
like it actually. You're gonna love it.

737
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,380
You're gonna love it. Just call
me. I'll tell you what it is. Okay.

738
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:17,330
By click right. Call her
up. And she says, listen,

739
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:21,890
a friend of a friend of mine has a dog
and she needs us to watch it for a week.

740
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:24,520
And I was like, perfect. That is awesome.

741
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,350
I'm a commitment phobe one week, you know,

742
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:33,570
that works perfectly for me.
So, uh, I go, yeah, fuck it.

743
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,430
Let's get it right. And
she goes, great. Awesome.

744
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:39,300
Great to only be here for a week, you
know, I'm like, cool. Next phone call.

745
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:44,430
Yeah. So anyways, I got the dog. She's
so cute. Above, above, above, uh,

746
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:47,160
yeah. And we keep it for a week
and at the end of the week,

747
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:49,680
if we want to keep it, we
can have it. And if not,

748
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:54,590
they take it to a shelter and it gets
put down. And I'm like, what? What? Wait,

749
00:46:54,591 --> 00:46:58,890
wait, what? You just got us a dog, right?

750
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:01,450
She got a rescue dog.

751
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:05,290
The exact thing I've been making fun of
in my act that the joke I did on Conan

752
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,280
that got me all that mail from
all the dog lovers. And uh,

753
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:14,160
not only that, it's a pit
bull. Isn't that great? Huh?

754
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,380
I'm just waiting for it to be like, dude,
what do you, how do you fucking mind?

755
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:20,010
He already fuck them out.
Fucking two hoes fucking dogs to,

756
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,550
I'm trying to fuck a loyal dude,

757
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,930
but I'm telling you one day you
look the other way. They did.

758
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:28,830
They just fucking snap too. One time I
heard about this guy, there was this guy,

759
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:32,350
right? [inaudible]. There was this
guy and he got a pit bull, right?

760
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,810
There was this guy and he
had a pit bull shut up.

761
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,563
So anyways,

762
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:41,560
we've got this fucking pit
bull and evidently they
found it down by the La River

763
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:47,020
and a, yeah, it's a fucking awesome dog.
I can't even, I can't even lie to you.

764
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,830
It's a fucking great dog. It's a scary
looking dog. I'm not gonna lie to you.

765
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,460
It looks like it wasn't by the La
River was more by the fucking river.

766
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:00,620
Haiti's it's definitely looks like a hell
hound, but it is a fucking sweetheart.

767
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:06,810
And uh, you know, by the second
day, I love the thing. I'm like,

768
00:48:06,811 --> 00:48:09,920
fuck this. We're keeping it. I
loved it. I walk it down the street,

769
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:13,960
people cross the street. It's great.
It's fucking great. So Kevin, a gun that,

770
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,243
that you can pet.

771
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:23,790
It's a fucking awesome dog.

772
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,480
And uh, you know, I've had
other dogs have charged it.

773
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:32,140
It hasn't freaked out yet. You know,
it's gonna Freak out to fucking time.

774
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:34,930
Bomb them out of my mind. I
should give this dog back.

775
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:37,340
I'm out of my fucking mind. This,

776
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,340
you just know there's a
lawsuit at the end of this.

777
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:41,380
The only way it ends with a pit bull.

778
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:46,850
It ends with a lawsuit in a missing limb
in a second cousin that never talks to

779
00:48:46,851 --> 00:48:47,570
you again.

780
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:50,840
And the only time you see him is when he
drives down the street and his fucking

781
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:51,280
customer,

782
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,800
El Camino that he bought with the 50
grand you gave him and he gives you the

783
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:57,080
finger. He takes his one
arm off the steering wheel,

784
00:48:57,081 --> 00:49:02,081
gives you the fucking finger and continues
on down the street and his lime green

785
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:07,160
fucking Elderado. Um, anyways,
so this dog is this shit.

786
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,770
I love having an around.
I fucking love this dog.

787
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,600
She's awesome and I want to keep
it, but this is the problem. Um,

788
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,590
when we leave, it fucks up
the apartment or it has twice.

789
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,340
It scratched the door and it's
scratched something else in the back.

790
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:28,400
And it's like, dude, I
don't own this place. Okay,

791
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,340
I have a deposit. Do you understand that?

792
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:33,430
And one day the landlord's going
to come over to me and be like,

793
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:34,420
what the fuck is that?

794
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:36,970
And then I'm going to point at
you and you don't have a wallet.

795
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,360
And not only do you not have a wallet,
you don't have, you don't have money,

796
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,590
you don't have any money.
All right? You dumb fuck.

797
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,010
Which means it's coming
out of my deposit. Okay.

798
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:51,900
And that's what I've dealt with on
the last week is literally watching my

799
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:54,510
deposit slowly disappearing. You know,

800
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:57,640
you ever been up like two grand
playing blackjack, you know,

801
00:49:57,641 --> 00:50:00,900
and you just sit in there like
it's never gonna end, you know,

802
00:50:00,901 --> 00:50:03,720
and your buddies like dope,
dope. We'll walk away dude.

803
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:07,700
I'm telling you kick you up to a
grandkid walkway, do sweet money.

804
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:08,720
It's free money. Right.

805
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:12,140
And he keep fucking sitting there and
the horrors coming over there with the

806
00:50:12,141 --> 00:50:13,880
whiskey and you keep drinking. Right.

807
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:19,370
Then some vacuum cleaner salesman sits
down and starts hitting on 17 and you

808
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:22,130
start doing that dumb shit
going dude, that was my car.

809
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:26,920
Cause you guys taken all my cards. You
know like if that fuck wasn't there,

810
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,150
you would continue to when you wouldn't.

811
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,810
All right do the fucking math.

812
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,160
How do you think they keep the lights on
all day long with the air conditioning

813
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:41,510
on and the fucking doors open in the
middle of the desert and they still can

814
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:43,520
afford to do it. Cause dumb fucks.

815
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:47,410
Like you sit there and
the longer you sit there,

816
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:51,980
it's simple fucking math
dude. I got it. System.

817
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,150
Um, so anyways, so I was like, listen,
I have, we, I'll, I'll keep the dog,

818
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,940
but we gotta put this thing in a
fucking cage when we go to leave. Okay.

819
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:04,140
So I go over to Petco. Okay. And um,

820
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,040
I didn't want to go there. There
was a local pet store. You know me,

821
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,480
I want to go to the mom and pop
store, but my girls just like, oh,

822
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,280
it's right around the corner. Everywhere
I work. Yeah, they got all this,

823
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:17,000
you know, they start doing that shit
and you just feel all the fucking,

824
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,990
you literally feel the fucking energy
draining out of your legs. You just like,

825
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:26,200
all right, we'll go where
you want to go. Right.

826
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:30,760
And then they do this shit. Well, she
said, if you don't want to go there,

827
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,340
we're good. No, forget it. We'll go there.

828
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:38,410
I don't know why you have to get mad.
I'm like, well, if you just fucking,

829
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,220
why do you ask me where I want to go?

830
00:51:42,221 --> 00:51:45,340
If you already know where we want to go
and you were going to go there anyways.

831
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,230
Why do you put me through
that fucking test?

832
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,050
It's like fucking verbal
waterboarding. It's brutal. So anyways,

833
00:51:53,051 --> 00:51:56,020
so we go over to fucking PETCO
and it's a typical corporation.

834
00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:01,020
It's 90,000 square feet and they got
two people on the floor. All right.

835
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,010
And there's literally like,

836
00:52:03,011 --> 00:52:07,300
people are gathered around the one person
with the fucking apron that's the same

837
00:52:07,301 --> 00:52:09,520
color as the sign outside. So you like,

838
00:52:09,521 --> 00:52:13,270
obviously they work here cause they
have a fucking apron that matches.

839
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:16,120
It's the same color.
Blue is the fucking sign.

840
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,110
And there's literally people gathered
around this person, like they're famous,

841
00:52:20,111 --> 00:52:23,620
like they're waiting for an autograph
when the reality is is they're trying to

842
00:52:23,621 --> 00:52:28,621
find a fucking flea collar and this
fucking Goddamn mega church that they have

843
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:32,510
for fucking dogs, right? Jesus Christ.

844
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:35,490
I almost fucking spun out of control
with all the references here anyways,

845
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,980
and we plow ahead here. Was that even
remotely funny? Anyways, let's go.

846
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:44,020
So anyways, get to the
point bill. So I'm fucking,

847
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,200
they said the guy's like,
all right, I go, listen,

848
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:48,570
I need I gotta I gotta I
got a fucking pit bull.

849
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:49,940
Evidently it's a pit bull mixed,

850
00:52:49,941 --> 00:52:52,950
but I think it's mixed with another pit
bull cause it fucking looks like a pit

851
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:55,590
bull to me. The guy's like, hey
sir, don't worry, I'm gonna,

852
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,870
I'm going to be over there just about
10 minutes. Don't worry about it.

853
00:52:57,871 --> 00:53:01,500
So I say fine. And I stand over there
for about seven minutes and I'm like,

854
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:04,830
you know what? This dude's not fucking
showing up. He's not fucking showing up.

855
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:07,710
So I just grabbed the biggest fucking
cage I can find cause I want it to be nice

856
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:11,900
and Roomy, you know, be a responsible
pet owner. I don't want to be cruel.

857
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,680
I don't wanna act like a fucking puppy
mill. You know, fuck a thing's huge.

858
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:20,310
You could fit a fucking Jacuzzi in the
corner. All right, it's a big cage.

859
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:25,230
So I bring the thing home,
air dam. Lo and behold,

860
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,300
a buddy of mine calls me up, says,

861
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,820
tells me he's got a Gig back
east for the whole summer

862
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,370
directing a bunch of actors
and some bullshit. So He's,

863
00:53:33,371 --> 00:53:36,900
he's having a Gig and he wants me to
come by and say goodbye. So I say,

864
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:41,100
absolutely. My girl's not around. So I
go, I fucking stick the dog in the cage.

865
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,460
All right? And I feel awful. The dog
standing there shaking like a leaf.

866
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,500
I literally get the
thing to go in the cage.

867
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,470
It's facing the back of the
cage and it's not moving.

868
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,260
It's just standing there
shaking like you know,

869
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,230
like it knows a fucking earthquake
is coming or something. Okay.

870
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,340
So I'm sitting there trying to
convey to the dog like, dude,

871
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,160
I know you scared right now. You
know, I know you were abandoned,

872
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:07,730
but I'm not going to abandon
you. Do you understand?

873
00:54:07,731 --> 00:54:10,040
You're just fucking up my
apartment and I can't have that.

874
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:12,600
So how do you say that? And how do,

875
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:17,170
how would the dog whisper convey that?
You know, I don't know how to do it.

876
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,750
All right dude. Um, I'm coming back.

877
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:24,430
Notice I'm leaving and I'm not
bringing you with me in the cage.

878
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:25,630
I could see if I was doing that.

879
00:54:25,631 --> 00:54:29,550
I could see then you've fucking do it.

880
00:54:29,551 --> 00:54:33,010
Just stop shaking it right. You know
that if you feel awful, stop, please,

881
00:54:33,011 --> 00:54:34,420
please stop shaking. So I leave,

882
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:36,670
I go to the party in the
party for two fucking hours.

883
00:54:36,671 --> 00:54:40,720
All I can think about as a goddamn dog
being scared in the cage and it's killing

884
00:54:40,721 --> 00:54:42,820
me. It's ripping my heart out. So
I'm following. It's like, dude,

885
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,620
I got to get out of here.
I got this dog. I can't,

886
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:49,360
I can't fucking leave it alone. It's
killing me. So I fucking drive back

887
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:53,170
and I'm taking all this dogs and
be self psych to see me. You know,

888
00:54:53,171 --> 00:54:55,060
that's the best thing when you
come home, when you have a dog,

889
00:54:55,061 --> 00:54:56,650
the dog is fucking psych to see it, right?

890
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:01,270
So I come home and I opened the door and
who's fucking sitting on the other side

891
00:55:01,271 --> 00:55:05,580
of the door is the God damn dog
just sitting there wagging its tail,

892
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,150
thumping it on the floor, you know,

893
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,500
completely, you know, normal look on his
face like, hey bill, what's going on?

894
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:18,040
You want an egg? You know, stick
it about making a lake breakfast.

895
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:21,520
What'd you get into tonight?
Height. And you get some pussy.

896
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:22,383
What's going on with you and you?

897
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,330
I've just fucking regular and
I'm looking at the dog like,

898
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:32,030
did I dream that I did? I not put
you in a fucking cage. The fuck is,

899
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,250
you know what the fuck
is going on here? Right.

900
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,760
So I walk out to the kitchen and I
don't know how to describe this without

901
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:40,621
pictures.

902
00:55:40,621 --> 00:55:45,360
The only way I can describe it is it
looked like the cage got raped and then

903
00:55:45,361 --> 00:55:47,100
thrown in front of a locomotive.

904
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,860
The fuck was like, it
was lopsided. It was,

905
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:55,110
there was a big chunk
taken out of the side.

906
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,510
And then there was these all
this blood on the floor. And um,

907
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:05,790
I was beside myself. I was,
I couldn't believe it. And I,

908
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:08,880
I want to say that the
cage door was still closed.

909
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,400
She just, she just fucked this thing up.

910
00:56:12,401 --> 00:56:15,550
And now I'm sitting there freaking out
going, oh my God, she hurt herself.

911
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:18,610
There's blood all over the goddamn
floor, the amount of blood on the floor.

912
00:56:18,611 --> 00:56:20,620
I would have thought that she'd
be laying there unconscious.

913
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,950
And she just sitting
there looking at me wagon,

914
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,670
his fucking tail on the Goddamn
linoleum now. So I, you know,

915
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:32,100
I'm looking at its mouth and there's
nothing in there. There's a little bit,

916
00:56:32,101 --> 00:56:34,600
it's like one of the fucking x-men.
What's that extra. And you know, you,

917
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,710
you cut it and just automatically
heals. That's what it looks like.

918
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,420
It's just completely fine. So

919
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:47,640
I didn't, I don't know. I was
like, I was like half. Yeah,

920
00:56:47,641 --> 00:56:50,040
I was definitely bummed cause I
was out a couple hundred bucks,

921
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,140
especially with all the fucking fuzzy,

922
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,470
let's make this cage a home
shit that I bought to put in it,

923
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,420
but a part of me respected it. I was
like, God damn, this is a fucking dog,

924
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:05,850
you know? And uh, I was like, all right.

925
00:57:05,851 --> 00:57:10,650
Evidently I bought the wrong
fucking cage. So Jesus Christ,

926
00:57:10,651 --> 00:57:12,630
I don't even know any more than
fucking two days later. Right.

927
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,690
I haven't left the house. We haven't
left the house and left her alone.

928
00:57:15,691 --> 00:57:18,120
We keep bringing her in the, in the
Goddamn car. And that's another thing.

929
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,990
Bring in the car. She fucking stands
there. She shaking like, Oh fuck.

930
00:57:21,991 --> 00:57:25,320
What did I do this time, man? I'm getting
a bandaid again with the fuck man.

931
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,800
You know, we're like, dude,
we're not abandoning you.

932
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:33,650
We just fucking relax and stick
your face out the fucking window.

933
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:38,090
Like a regular dog. Jesus Christ you,
you know, you're making me nervous,

934
00:57:38,091 --> 00:57:42,980
you know? So finally we're like,
look, we need to have a life. Okay.

935
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:47,760
You know, I have to go out and do stand
up. You have to be able to go work.

936
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,430
I have to have, you know,
we got to get another cage.

937
00:57:50,431 --> 00:57:55,110
So I finally go to Petco again and I find
one of those douchebags with the Blue

938
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:58,110
Apron or whatever and I go listen to
actually brought the dog. I'm like,

939
00:57:58,111 --> 00:57:58,980
this is what I have.

940
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:02,100
This is what I bought and this
is what the fuck it did to it.

941
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:05,760
Do you have anything to help me? Okay.
The guys are like, yeah, no problem.

942
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:06,600
No problem. A,

943
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,290
it was all dealt well that we get one
of those wire cages and we'll get it a

944
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:12,750
muzzle. Cause that was a big
thing with me. I was like,

945
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:16,080
I don't want the dog to get hurt
trying to get out of the cage.

946
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:20,820
I want a cage that can't break out of and
I want to leave the dog in a situation

947
00:58:20,821 --> 00:58:23,040
where it can't get hurt. So it gives me,

948
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:26,520
it gives me this muscle to put
on the dog where can still drink,

949
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:31,050
relax you fucking animal on loving
jackasses. It can still drink.

950
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:36,540
Okay. It could vomit if it had to. So
it's not going to die like John Bonam,

951
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,340
you know, a lot of people don't know that.

952
00:58:38,341 --> 00:58:40,260
Not only did he have
32 shots of vodka, he,

953
00:58:40,261 --> 00:58:45,000
they actually found him slumped
over in a doggy cage. All right. Um,

954
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:46,560
face down in a fucking water dish.

955
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:50,663
Okay.

956
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:51,241
All right.

957
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:53,920
I can't believe I just said that about
one of the guys I love the most anyways.

958
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:59,050
Um, so we get all the shit. I
get the fucking cage. All right.

959
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,320
And this time we're doing
like dog whisperer shit.

960
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,380
So literally an hour last
night we work with this doc.

961
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:10,520
We walked the dog by the cage,
we walked it back past the cage,

962
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:14,280
you know, and it's freaking out looking
at the cage and the cage has two doors.

963
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:18,750
So I got my girls got both doors open so
she's got half a body in the cage going

964
00:59:18,751 --> 00:59:20,760
can make Cleo comedically. Oh good girl.

965
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,780
And she would sort of come close to the
cage and put her head down and wouldn't

966
00:59:23,781 --> 00:59:24,614
go in it.

967
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:29,360
And then we'd walk away and we just
over and over and over and then one half

968
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,610
hour into it, nothing but
positive reinforcement.

969
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:36,380
All of a sudden it was like magic. It's
like a fucking afterschool special.

970
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:38,720
She just crawled, walked, you know,

971
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:41,110
like a little fucking marine
trying to go underneath barbwire,

972
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:45,050
went into the cage and we will like
that's a good girl, we will pet in it.

973
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:45,980
And you know,

974
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:50,210
my girl rubbed its head
till it fell asleep a little
bit and then when it got up

975
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,380
and wanted to get out of the cage,

976
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:54,020
we let it get out of the cage just
so it had that vibe, you know,

977
00:59:54,021 --> 00:59:56,750
like this is your home, this
is, you're not being punished.

978
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:03,610
So then we do that exercise a
number of times. Another five, six,

979
01:00:03,611 --> 01:00:07,030
seven fucking times. Kept walking
into the cage, praising it,

980
01:00:07,031 --> 01:00:08,740
telling it was a good girl scratching it.

981
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:10,420
And then when I wanted
to get out of the cage,

982
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,520
we let it out of the cage right down the
fucking dog whispering numbers on how

983
01:00:15,871 --> 01:00:19,680
to do this shit. So the
end of the night comes,

984
01:00:19,681 --> 01:00:23,190
we slide this big mother
fucking cage. Okay.

985
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:28,050
Um, at the foot of the bed, she likes
to sleep on the foot of the bed.

986
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:31,020
We take the two pillows that she likes
to sleep on, we put them in the cage,

987
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,320
we put her in there and uh,

988
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:38,610
and we closed the cage and
she's sitting there and uh,

989
01:00:38,611 --> 01:00:41,540
we caught out the lights
and then she just,

990
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:46,520
she whined sort of panted
in wine for like two hours.

991
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,800
Just gone. Just like that.

992
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,990
I couldn't believe we didn't pass out.
That's how quickly he was breathing.

993
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:58,200
Literally. Is that annoying to listen
to if you're on a plane right now?

994
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,520
That's what the fuck that thing did
for two hours to the point. I was like,

995
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:05,460
Jesus Christ in here. Let's just let
the thing out of the fucking cage.

996
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:06,960
And she's like, no. If we do that,

997
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:10,740
then it's gonna learn that that's all
it has to do is that annoying sound,

998
01:01:10,741 --> 01:01:14,920
which I won't do again to fucking make
you guys fucking teeth hurt, you know?

999
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:19,900
So anyways, she finally
ends up going to sleep.

1000
01:01:19,901 --> 01:01:22,450
We go to sleep the next morning, she
wakes up, we let her out of the cage,

1001
01:01:22,451 --> 01:01:25,950
he's all excited. And I've been doing
what I've been doing with this dog.

1002
01:01:25,951 --> 01:01:29,130
I fucking run it up a god Damn Mountain
and I've run it right back down.

1003
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:34,320
You know, fucking thing is all
muscle. It's the shit, right?

1004
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:39,960
Fucking dog is awesome. Um,
so anyways, no roids either.

1005
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:43,500
This is all natural. So anyways,

1006
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:49,100
so today I get up and uh,

1007
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,310
my beautiful girls got to go to
work and I had a meeting, you know,

1008
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:55,940
trying to come up with a show idea,
trying to get a show on the air,

1009
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,520
trying to come up with a better idea
so it won't get squashed like a bug,

1010
01:01:59,521 --> 01:01:59,741
like a,

1011
01:01:59,741 --> 01:02:03,900
my last fucking idea did right at the
last second when I thought I was home

1012
01:02:03,901 --> 01:02:05,760
free, you know,

1013
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:10,140
gliding along free as a bird than
smash right into fucking windshield.

1014
01:02:10,141 --> 01:02:13,650
That's what I have my last idea. But
we, that's a whole nother podcast.

1015
01:02:13,651 --> 01:02:17,360
We won't get into that
shit. So anyways, we uh,

1016
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,970
bring the dog, the cage.

1017
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,930
She's definitely don't put the muzzle on
it so it won't hurt itself if it tries

1018
01:02:23,931 --> 01:02:27,380
to get out, which we know it's going
to try to, I put it's water in there.

1019
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,730
We close the door,

1020
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:33,680
we tell it to just tell her she's a
good girl and a, we saw it, you know,

1021
01:02:33,681 --> 01:02:35,270
I went out did, you know,

1022
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:38,780
had my breakfast out in the kitchen and
I kind of peaked in the bedroom and it

1023
01:02:38,781 --> 01:02:39,740
was laying down.

1024
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,820
The muzzle on thing was
totally cool and I thought,

1025
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:48,390
I thought everything's great. This is
awesome. We have our lives back. You know,

1026
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:48,811
I like to,

1027
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:52,980
I gotta be able to do stand up and I
like to play drums in that type of shit.

1028
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:56,460
I like doing that shit during the day
when I fucking can't stare at the walls

1029
01:02:56,461 --> 01:02:57,294
anymore.

1030
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:02,810
So a off we go into the wild blue yonder,

1031
01:03:02,981 --> 01:03:05,260
I dropped my girl off at
work, I go and I, you know,

1032
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:07,750
hanging out with this other comic,

1033
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,230
we're trying to come up with the TV
show idea and I actually brought my shit

1034
01:03:11,231 --> 01:03:15,280
along with me cause I'm feeling free.
I can go play drums. The dog is cool.

1035
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:17,680
And I was actually thinking
halfway through, right?

1036
01:03:17,681 --> 01:03:20,050
Just like when I was at the parties
like, Oh man, I gotta get home, man.

1037
01:03:20,051 --> 01:03:22,600
I feel bad. The dogs in the
cage. I fucking love that dog.

1038
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,900
I fucking love that dog. I got to let
the dog out of the cage. I'll hang out.

1039
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:30,530
You know, I'll play some guitar and
stead right then I'll watch the Bruins.

1040
01:03:30,531 --> 01:03:33,830
Hopefully beat the fucking hurricanes
tonight and game six, right? That's,

1041
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:36,620
that was my game plan. And uh,

1042
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:39,500
so I come home like this dogs and be
so fucking psyched on it, you know,

1043
01:03:39,501 --> 01:03:42,740
and I show up, let it out of the
cage. It's going to be flipping out,

1044
01:03:42,741 --> 01:03:44,600
jumping all around. It's
awesome. It's awesome.

1045
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:47,300
When you come home and you got
a dog, right? So I come home,

1046
01:03:47,301 --> 01:03:50,120
I open the back door and
then we had this other doors,

1047
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:54,350
got this big glass window and I go to
put the key in and I looked down and who

1048
01:03:54,351 --> 01:03:55,460
the fuck is sitting there?

1049
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:58,910
Right on the other side of the door
just sitting there wagging its tail.

1050
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,470
The fucking Goddamn Cleo. And
I'm looking at the dog going,

1051
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,860
are you fucking shitting
me? And I look at its face.

1052
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:13,980
It's got a little bit of dried blood on
its muzzle and right by its eye and it's

1053
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:19,090
happy as shit. It doesn't give a fuck.
It's just wagging his tail. Hey Bill,

1054
01:04:19,091 --> 01:04:22,000
how was your meeting? You know, did
you come up with any ideas? You know,

1055
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:24,670
don't give up man. I'm telling you,
you're going to get a TV show idea.

1056
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:28,900
You want to go for a jog, right?

1057
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,750
And I'm sitting here looking at
this fucking thing like, dude,

1058
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:35,740
you gotta be shitting me. You
got to be fucking kidding me.

1059
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:40,830
And I walk into the bedroom and here is
this fucking cage that this Douche bag

1060
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:45,810
down at Petco said I would
be fine. Oh by the way,

1061
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,750
the fucking thing still has
the muzzle, but it's off.

1062
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:53,870
It got it off and it's hanging down
around its fucking neck. Like a Bandanna,

1063
01:04:53,871 --> 01:04:57,950
like some douchebag in prince's
band way back in the day.

1064
01:04:57,951 --> 01:05:00,380
Remember that guy who played
the fucking guitar keyboard?

1065
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:03,410
The guy in the revolution,
prince and the revolution, right?

1066
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:05,060
That's the way the muzzle is.

1067
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:09,770
All I needed to be was like some sort
of fucking neon leopard print and that

1068
01:05:09,771 --> 01:05:11,000
thing was good to go. Right.

1069
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:16,960
So I come walking in and I can't even
describe to you how fucked up this cage

1070
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:22,100
was. And there was blood all over
the fucking floor. And once again,

1071
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:24,680
I'm checking her mouth.
I'm checking her paws.

1072
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,040
There are areas where there's
sort of dried blood on her fur,

1073
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:31,430
but she's not bleeding. This dog is,

1074
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:36,920
is not from this planet, but this cage is,

1075
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,570
and you know, I took a fucking picture
of it. I should put it up on my,

1076
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:47,140
on my myspace page. This,
yeah. I don't know what it did.

1077
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:52,560
I don't know if it just fucking started
jumping up and down and slam it into the

1078
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:53,710
sides of it. But this,

1079
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:59,790
I'm looking at it right now. I can't,

1080
01:05:59,791 --> 01:06:04,340
there's like metal is just twisted
around. It's, it's wreckage.

1081
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:07,940
That's what the fuck I have. It looks
like the rest of the cage is fine.

1082
01:06:07,941 --> 01:06:11,240
It looks like this. The front of the
cage had a front end fucking collision

1083
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:16,220
with another car. I, so I don't know
what I'm going to do. People I have,

1084
01:06:16,221 --> 01:06:19,970
I have a situation because you
know I'm all for rescue on a dog,

1085
01:06:19,971 --> 01:06:24,971
but I didn't sign up for this shit and
I've blown over $300 in cages and I've

1086
01:06:25,821 --> 01:06:29,830
used both of them once
and this dog fucks him up.

1087
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,660
And you know, I'm telling you,

1088
01:06:32,661 --> 01:06:36,220
you can't talk to animal lovers because
they're fucking crazy because they will

1089
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:41,200
tell you anything just to get
you to keep the fucking dog,

1090
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,830
you know? Oh it's just
because it's scared.

1091
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,190
It's scared that it's
going to be abandoned.

1092
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,400
You have to build up the
trust and it's like, you know,

1093
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:56,450
that's not my fucking problem. I
want to keep this dot. But what the,

1094
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:00,800
what the fuck am I supposed to do? Okay,
so there's my a, this isn't a podcast,

1095
01:07:00,801 --> 01:07:04,830
this is just me telling you why. Well,

1096
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,710
I guess this has no reason to do why
there was no podcast. There's no podcast.

1097
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:10,860
Cause I couldn't figure out how to go
from garage band to g cast and make it

1098
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:12,990
work. So if you can help me with that.

1099
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:16,920
And if somebody out there has rescued
a fucking pit bull and has gone through

1100
01:07:16,921 --> 01:07:20,400
this shit and they somehow
figured out how to get the dog

1101
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:26,790
to, to be cool in a cage

1102
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,660
because, uh, not only is
it cost me a lot of money,

1103
01:07:30,661 --> 01:07:33,570
this dog is injuring itself
and it's fucking killing me.

1104
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:38,550
So if you can help me out,
I would appreciate it. Uh,

1105
01:07:38,551 --> 01:07:41,520
and that is it. That is,
this is a very special

1106
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:48,840
Monday morning podcast done on a
Tuesday. I actually have a cause. Okay.

1107
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:50,281
Oh, by the way,

1108
01:07:50,281 --> 01:07:54,870
if you've got any new mp3s or any type
of shit that you want to send me, uh,

1109
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:56,790
you know, go ahead and send them.
I don't know. You know what?

1110
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:57,750
Don't send it to me yet.

1111
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,750
Just wait til I get my first one up there
that I understand how to fucking know.

1112
01:08:00,751 --> 01:08:03,270
If you know how to do it,
please let me know. That is it.

1113
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:07,170
I hope all you guys have a good week and
hope I have some good news for the next

1114
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,540
week. All right, dude. Bye
Daddy. Say, dude. All right.

1115
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,010
And you'll see what I mean beside myself.

1116
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,713
Alright, bye

1117
01:08:59,210 --> 01:08:59,210
[inaudible].
