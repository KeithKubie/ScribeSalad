00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:07.220
SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.360
Welcome to another amazing
"Talks at Google" event.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.420
It doesn't take a
very detailed search

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.750
to see that the news
headlines these days are

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.850
rather troubling on the
international front.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.010
We're seeing in many
cases an assault

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.690
on the international system--

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.410
50 years of peace and prosperity
from things like the European

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.880
Union to NATO--

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.370
and where do we
stand with all that?

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.450
What is the impact on
governments on corporations?

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.250
Today we're very
thrilled to have

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.000
Bob Amsterdam with us today
to talk about this very issue.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.420
Bob is an international lawyer
specializing in corporate law

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.550
and also advising governments.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.120
His career has been very
storied across a dozen countries

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.180
from Asia, Africa,
Europe, and Latin America,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.490
and today he's here to
talk about disruption

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.760
in the international
system, arguing

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.260
that the political
pressure being applied

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.440
against the judicial systems
and prosecutors today

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.090
have resulted in a crisis
of legitimacy that's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.511
weakened institutions.

00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:11.260
So we'll start out by
talking a little bit

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.820
about the current
situation and then

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.810
some thoughts for the future.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.190
And with that, thank you very
much and welcome to Google.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.648
ROBERT AMSTERDAM:
Thanks very much.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.470
Thank you very much.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.120
I'm going to be talking
today about essentially how

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:38.910
corporations can thrive in the
upcoming trade wars and issues

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.110
that have been raised by the
rise of populism in the world,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.910
not just in the United States
with the Trump election,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.230
but in Europe with Brexit
and now potentially Frexit.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.590
In the Philippines with Duterte.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.490
In Mexico.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.140
We've seen this rising
tide of populism,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.000
and of course, now, six
weeks after the election,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.680
we're seeing a tremendous
level of discourse

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.120
in the United States
concerning Russia's impact

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.810
on American politics.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.420
And I thought, given
how current that topic

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.750
is, that we might take a
few minutes to discuss it.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.290
I have spent most of
my life studying Russia

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.530
and was involved in the
Yukos case in Russia in 2003

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.500
when the Russian government
essentially stole

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.010
the assets of Yukos
and jailed its founder.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.690
And I was working with him and
one of the defense team for him

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.620
for many years and was arrested
in Russia in September of 2005.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.770
And one of the things
that has hit me

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.860
about the present scenario
in the United States

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.560
that seems to have
been missed by many

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.940
is that the Trump
agenda substantively is

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.080
a mirror of the Putin agenda.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:18.260
And not only does it go against
Americans' policy of open door

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.030
capitalism, but it goes against
what this country has defined

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.500
as its national
interests, particularly

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.600
the embrace of Nigel
Farage, the embrace of those

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.980
who want to see the EU split.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.270
This is from page one of
Vladimir Putin's gamebook.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.440
This is what he was trying to
do with his energy diplomacy.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.510
This is what he's been trying to
do with the invasion of Ukraine

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.390
and the seizure of Crimea.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.390
And in my view, the attack on
the American electoral system

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.960
that took place was
never meant to be

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.420
an attack that would actually
place Donald Trump in power.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.580
It was meant to
be an attack that

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.910
would undermine not
only Hillary Clinton,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.829
but the political institutions
of the United States.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.050
And to that extent, it's
been a tremendous success.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.050
We are seeing the United
States and the Democrats using

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.890
this series of
incidents in particular

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.920
to move very aggressively--

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.460
today, demanding the
resignation of Sessions,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.590
over the last number of weeks
working very hard in a manner

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.970
reminiscent of the Tea
Party to, if you will,

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.470
de-legitimize the
Trump administration

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.180
at its earliest point.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.110
But let's talk about
some of Trump's policies

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.660
because firstly his
massive army build up,

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.300
again, copies exactly
what Vladimir Putin has

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.460
done in Russia.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.530
The xenophobic attacks, the
immigration attacks, again,

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.930
are almost identical.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.440
The issues with respect
to NGOs and the media--

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.090
in fact, going so far
as to call the media

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.030
the enemy of the
people is actually

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:38.110
to use a term really framed by
Stalin in the '30s and hearkens

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.710
back to some of
these commonalities.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.410
And what is perhaps
most disturbing and most

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:54.970
did de-legitimizing is the
lying, the seeming inability

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.840
to capture reality, but
when you have studied Russia

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.070
for a long time, you understand
that the lying cynically

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.140
can mean something very
much more than that.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.350
There's a recent book that came
out, "Black Wind, White Snow--

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.170
The Rise of Russia's
New Nationalism."

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.720
And there is a quote from
that book that is, I think,

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.640
really important to read in
terms of the Putin mindset.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.040
Quote, "Putin has
correctly surmised

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.100
that lies unite rather
than divide Russia's

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.750
political class.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.030
The greater and more
obvious the lie,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.670
the more his subjects
demonstrate their loyalty

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.740
by accepting it
and the more they

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.570
participate in the great
sacral mystery of Kremlin power

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.180
by believing it."

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.300
Hannah Arendt in "The
Origins of Totalitarianism"

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.640
stated "one could
make people believe

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.040
the most fantastic
statements one day

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.630
and trust that if
the next day they

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.450
were given irrefutable
proof of their falsehood

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.670
they would take
refuge in cynicism.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.400
Instead of deserting the
leaders who had lied to them,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.710
they would protest that
they had known all along

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.080
that the statement
was a lie and would

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.200
admire the leaders for their
superior tactical cleverness."

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.260
Make no mistake that
this constant absence

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:25.410
of the truth from the White
House, unless it is corrected,

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.680
is extraordinarily
corrosive, but also

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.340
a mimic of some of
Vladimir Putin's most

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.270
significant tactics
in having truly

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.510
destroyed most of
Russian civil society

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:47.340
in the period that dates from
2003 and the seizure of Yukos.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.920
The economic
nationalism, however--

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.180
the economic nationalism
both of Putin's Russia,

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.910
which you can understand
because Putin's Russia

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:01.260
is an economy that is based
on the extractive industries.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.260
Putin's Russia is
an economy where

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.180
there must be a constant
mobilization against the other,

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.530
whoever that other may be, in
order for Mr. Putin to stay

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.970
in power.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.680
People often don't realize
that the real central node

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.140
of Russian foreign policy
isn't geopolitics alone.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.920
It is mobilizing
the domestic elite

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.260
to pursue a foreign outcome.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:37.150
That was one of the major
drives behind the Syrian attack.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.880
So these substantive
similarities

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.590
between Trump and Putin
need to be assessed

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.320
with the same rigor
and seriousness

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.470
that we are attempting to
piece together what happened

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.130
in terms of the collusion.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.090
For one, I'll say that tracing
this issue of collusion,

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.320
I think, is less significant
than focusing on Trump's

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.840
policies and behavior.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:13.240
I think, frankly, the Democrats
are making a strategic error

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.010
in going too far into this
before a lot of hard evidence

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.630
has been discovered.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:24.200
And I think in political
campaigns and political issues

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.160
you are constantly
dealing with momentum,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.300
and there's a tremendous
danger in this particular case

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:37.300
that, if the smoking gun is not
found, the Democrats will have

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:44.050
taken an early and very
dangerous situation

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.690
and made it so that
their future attacks will

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.240
be less significant,
less important,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.290
because remember,
up until today,

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.660
outside of the issue
of immigration,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.870
most of the attacks have
followed about Russia.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.880
We haven't spoken about China.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.180
We haven't spoken about the
environment, the Arctic.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.566
We haven't spoken about
entitlements and equality.

00:10:07.566 --> 00:10:09.190
We haven't really
focused because there

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.520
hasn't been any
substantive legislation yet

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.790
on issues such as the
nuts and bolts of where

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.990
health care is going.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:23.150
But outside of the parameter
of Russia and the United States

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.960
today, one of the things I want
to mention I think is important

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.530
is what I call the
presumption of regularity.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.750
So often when we
talk about Russia

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:39.000
or when we talk about China,
we presume that these countries

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.760
and governments operate
the way our own does,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.590
and that's just not the case.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.600
When you're working
internationally,

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.120
either corporately or
as a lawyer on behalf

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.360
of a client, one of the most
important things you have to do

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.250
is disaggregate the power
centers within the country

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.140
with which you are engaged.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.540
There is no such thing, in many
ways, as Russia in the sense

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.940
that, if you're trying
to intelligently analyze

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.970
where power is, you need
to analyze the people

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.950
around Vladimir Putin.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.430
We're the real sources
of strength and weakness.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:21.260
And in Russia's case, you
have to follow the money,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.760
because in so many countries,
it's the corruption

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.740
and it's the money rather than
it is the political ideology

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.880
that actually masks
or determines what

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.430
the next steps are
in trying to protect

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.830
your individual corporate
or your individual asset.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.450
In terms of other countries
and other scenarios,

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.240
what we've been
advocating for our clients

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.750
is what we call a
corporate foreign policy,

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.260
and we've been doing this since
we set up that blog in 2011.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.110
We've been talking about
the need for corporations

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.520
to understand that
in today's world

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.000
neutrality does not exist.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.180
The image we have
of corporations

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.940
acting in a neutral
manner hearkens back

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.350
to an era of very
strong sovereignty.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.480
Hearkens back to an era
when your nation state

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.360
would be the one to
fight the fights for you

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.770
with your particular
industry or area of interest.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:29.600
That has gone to a
significant extent,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.590
and it's been taken away by
a wide variety of factors.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:37.190
Number one-- a lot of
international governance,

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.500
but number two--

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:45.010
the downloading of
governmental responsibilities

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.750
to private industry.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:51.070
I don't think we fully assess
how important that's been.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.180
From private prisons
to private armies,

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.650
the governments,
especially since 2008,

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.640
have been offloading many
of their responsibilities,

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.790
and they've been doing it not
only because of the budget

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.690
issues, but because of
the legitimacy issues.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:16.120
Americans need to understand
that brand America is badly

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:21.640
wounded and that the
war on terror combined

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.600
with the economic
collapse of 2008

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.130
has horribly wounded our
legitimacy and our ability

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.310
to have a bully pulpit
in the world with respect

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:38.110
to critical issues such as
human rights and rule of law.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:43.420
We are not believed in the
world when it comes to our role

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.700
as a pillar of rule of law.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.160
We simply are not
believed, which

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:55.150
is one of the reasons Donald
Trump's embrace of Putin

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.360
has been endorsed by
so many Republicans--

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:05.220
because there has been this
drive for a powerful leader

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:10.950
with a real movement
away from the respect

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.230
for the political
institutions, and that's

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:20.590
tremendously dangerous to
individual corporations--

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.370
especially larger
corporations, such as Google,

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:28.290
such as this one, where, in
fact, governments are looking--

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.790
other governments are looking
for points of retaliation.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.640
They are looking
for points or places

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.790
where they can
essentially set up

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:43.300
a hostage for American
foreign policy.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.630
And one of the incredible
points of interest

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:52.530
in the Trump campaign and
now in the Trump presidency

00:14:52.530 --> 00:15:00.780
is that the attacks on Mexico,
the attacks on Australia,

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.230
the renunciation of the TPP--

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:11.070
all of these steps seem not to
follow from a coordinated game

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.120
plan.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.890
We seem to be pushing a
tremendous amount of legitimacy

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:20.190
away from the United States,
a tremendous amount of what

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:26.220
attracted people to brand
America, not just with respect

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:31.650
to the politics
of these demands,

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:35.580
but with respect to the
lack of follow through,

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:40.600
the lack of consideration,
the lack of competence.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.730
It is a very worrying
sign that the president,

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:50.700
who is well armed with
serious experts on China--

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:56.040
that his first move with respect
to China was to court Taiwan,

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.090
and then within a
matter of a few weeks

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.390
to get on the phone
with the leader of China

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.820
with the quid pro
quo for that phone

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.540
call essentially being a
recognition of the One China

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.620
policy.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:18.760
It is equally concerning that,
in welcoming Bibi Netanyahu

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:24.930
to the United States, he was
so willing to talk about a one

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.860
nation solution and yet
a few days later reassert

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.040
the necessity of a
two state solution.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.250
These are not minor
issues that can be

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.640
bandied about by a president.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:46.120
These are the most substantive
core issues around which

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:50.320
American lives have been lost
and billions upon billions

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.220
of dollars have been spent.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.780
One of the things
that one looks at when

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.800
one looks at the
present scenario,

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:09.630
however, is the fact that, with
this present situation in terms

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:14.700
of trading blocks and in terms
of Trump's new philosophy

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.589
and new methodology of
dealing with the world,

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:25.710
that those corporates who adopt
some form of policy, who allow

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:29.430
themselves to some extent to be
disaggregated away from certain

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:34.320
of the government's policies,
may well have opportunities,

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.340
but it is a tremendous
necessity now

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.540
to move for corporations
to start adopting policies

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:48.130
and start accepting within
their own organization

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:53.370
the fact that compliance, which
has been massively extended

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.400
by American corporations
internationally trying

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:02.610
to deal with laws such
as the FCPA compliance,

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:06.240
has to morph into
policy, because one

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.250
of the other problems that
the United States has faced

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.330
in this loss of
legitimacy has often

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:21.150
been the willingness
inside the United States

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.710
to target political
prosecutions, prosecutions

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.640
such as many under the FCPA.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.510
The Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:39.870
is an act which is very long on
policy, very short on case law,

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:45.510
and involves a tremendous amount
of prosecutorial discretion

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:49.620
often exercised against
foreign corporates.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.830
9 out of 10 of the
largest penalties

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.900
that have been given
have been those

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.190
that have been given
against foreign corporate,

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.990
and this continuing
diminution, where,

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.780
in fact with
respect to the FCPA,

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.980
prosecutors understand that they
can go with what they consider

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.720
to be a credible case and
get corporates to roll over--

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.830
time and time again
that methodology

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.950
hasn't been lost
in other countries.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.250
When the United States
started to push the FCPA,

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.150
some of the most corrupt
rulers followed suit.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:35.280
Kenya's ruler, arap Moi,
used anti-corruption to go

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.330
after his political
opponents, and in Russia, it

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:43.200
was anti-corruption that led
to the destruction of Yukos

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.680
and led to the ongoing
level of corporate raiding

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:53.970
that we've seen in Russia today
that continues to escalate.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:59.160
I think one of the
important issues that

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.090
follow from this
de-legitimization

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:08.070
and this change in
attitude is something

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.770
we've called the dual state.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:15.370
The dual state, which
is operative in Russia

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.620
and operative in
many other countries,

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.580
is a concept which
relates to part

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.130
of the activities of
the state appearing

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:30.280
to be law abiding, appearing
to be based on rules,

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.630
and regulations, and
foreseeability, and then

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:39.190
part of the conduct of the state
being completely ungoverned.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.410
It was a concept
that was designed

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.900
to deal with Nazi
Germany, where you

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:49.330
had this tremendous level of
judicial competence sitting

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:54.430
above organs such as
the SS, who would beat,

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:59.830
maim, and murder without
any issue at all.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:04.270
That dual state, to some extent,
exists not only in Russia,

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.210
but in many countries
around the world.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:12.730
The deep state, which is an
argument that concerns us here

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.800
in the United States, as well--

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.510
the deep state relates to those
people in the government that

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:22.150
are embedded within the
government, those people

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.860
in the government here and
abroad that are forever--

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.430
irrespective of the
particular administration,

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.130
that are forever
engaged in managing

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.370
the safety and security
of the administration.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.280
And there are many
people today who

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.740
believe that the deep
state in the United States

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:46.000
is on the attack
against Donald Trump,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.100
but our point in
raising it is to talk

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.090
about how both the deep
state and the dual state

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.580
are part of what
corporations need

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.670
to include in their toolbox.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:03.520
You simply can't look at dealing
with foreign countries in a way

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.660
as if to give credit to
the topical explanations

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.650
or expositions, or,
as we suggest often,

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.520
simply allow international
arbitration or some form

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.100
of international
dispute resolution

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:22.330
to satisfy the needs
of corporations.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:26.950
Those types of dispute
mechanisms often last years,

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.300
and with corporate foreign
policy you can be lobbying.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.010
You can be disaggregating.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:38.530
You can be focusing on the real
power nodes within a country

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.610
without that level of delay,
and often to everyone's surprise

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.780
you can actually litigate in
some of the most difficult

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.570
countries and come out on top.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:54.280
I think one of the
big surprises often

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:57.700
is that, even with
tough cases, if you

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.230
are able in a country where you
can use and get out the media--

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:08.230
if you can use the media and put
enough pressure on courts that

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.740
are ostensibly
rule of law courts,

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.850
you can get a result. In
other countries, however,

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:19.590
it becomes extremely
difficult. We

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:27.780
represented a political prisoner
in Venezuela, an individual who

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:35.160
had unfortunately been dragged
by Chavez into a dungeon

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:40.290
for over two years, and
for that individual,

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:47.730
we managed to get a UN order
from one of these organizations

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.880
within the UN that
can provide opinions.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.580
An order was obtained for the
release of this individual,

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:58.890
which the Venezuelan
court, amazingly,

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:02.760
after he had been illegally
incarcerated for 32 months,

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.720
allowed that man to be
freed only temporarily

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.010
and only on bail.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.750
Unfortunately,
within a few minutes,

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.580
Chavez went on
television, ordered

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.510
the arrest of the judge.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.190
The judge was arrested.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:21.450
She was taken to a prison.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:26.500
She was burnt alive on
the day of the ruling.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:32.860
She fortunately did not succumb
and is still alive today.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.300
The client left the court
knowing that he could not

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.980
survive one more day
in Chavez's Venezuela

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:49.340
and very fortunately
managed to equip himself

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:56.360
with a very small propeller
driven device, travel for three

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.170
hours over the ocean--

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.560
managed to get to curacao, where
we had a jet ready to take him

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.620
to the United States,
where he has now

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.080
managed to obtain asylum.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:15.330
But these types of cases
and these types of hostage

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:19.740
situations involve
understanding and getting

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.850
to the point of analysis.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.660
And one of the things I
always recommend to companies

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.470
is to understand
the criminal law

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.750
in each country in
which you operate,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:34.590
because if there is anything
other governments have learned

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:40.590
from us, it has been the
misuse of criminal law,

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.920
not just from us, but obviously
from their own histories.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:51.950
And you often find that without
the right criminal lawyer,

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.680
whatever may be your
corporate plans--

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.070
whatever may be the
corporate legitimacy,

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:02.900
when individuals
are taken hostage,

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.010
you have nowhere to run, and
one of the most important things

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:11.780
we urge is that, when
corporates hire attorneys

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:16.280
in many of these countries,
from a practical standpoint,

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.850
they don't look to hire the
guy who went to Harvard.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.640
They don't look to
hire the sister firm

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.570
of the American firm that
has an office in Caracas.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.190
They don't necessarily
look to hire

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:30.930
the people that speak English.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.750
Rather they look to
hire the people who

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:37.935
can manage and navigate
the local government

00:26:37.935 --> 00:26:41.880
and the local area enough
so that they can translate

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.960
for you what that reality is.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.960
So when one turns to today's
situation, what does one see?

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.640
What opportunities
and what problems

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.280
does one see for the future?

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:05.170
I'd say, number one, the
prospect of not only a trade

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:11.170
war, but a fundamental
attack on the EU,

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:15.430
where the United States
is seen not as an ally,

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:20.410
but as an enemy is a
tremendous risk and burden

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.130
for American corporates.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.780
Be very clear--

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.020
Brexit and the
manner in which it's

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.550
being handled by the
May administration

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:37.770
is no different than
the Mexican wall.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.820
I think they've been organized
by the same contractor.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.990
The British currency has
been depreciated by over 20%

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:50.510
relative to the dollar,
and the House of Lords

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:54.620
just yesterday
defeated the government

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:59.690
in imposing certain conditions
on how Brexit will take place.

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:03.800
We've seen real chaos in
the UK for the first time

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:09.230
legally, because, in fact, David
Cameron, when he structured

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:15.980
Brexit, was addressing a problem
within his own political party.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:21.360
There had been no demand for
secession, so what happened was

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.890
we had a vote that some
believe was gerrymandered.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:29.310
Then we have a situation where
England had just survived

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.440
one Scottish referendum.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:36.730
Now it faces another Scottish
referendum, potentially.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:42.190
In addition to that, the
UK and the rest of Europe

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:46.180
have been unable to
fashion a response

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:52.480
to this first massive change
in the political dynamics

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:58.660
of Europe in dozens of years,
which is Putin's ability

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.340
to keep hold of Crimea.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.940
This is an existential
threat to Europe

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.650
that we in the United
States have not

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:11.300
grasped the seriousness with
which the Europeans view

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:17.180
this, nor have we grasped the
seriousness with which Russia

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.410
has taken its job of
disaggregating the EU.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:24.410
The funding that
Russia has given

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:29.150
so many of the major
contestants in EU battles--

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.990
Le Pen, backed by Russia--

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:35.270
Brexit, Farage,
backed by Russia--

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.320
Bulgaria, backed by Russia--

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.950
Montenegro, backed by Russia--

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:44.630
Schulz in Germany, not sure yet,
but the Russians are playing

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:49.700
very fast and loose with
this issue of false news,

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:53.270
the propagandizing that is going
on throughout the world with

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:57.320
this false news, which is
something else that companies

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.830
in the information
industry-- and we saw

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.380
Zuckerberg's
manifesto recently--

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.270
which companies in the
information industry

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.400
are going to have to address.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:14.060
Because with so much
on the line in terms

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:18.680
of what is being
disseminated and the levels

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.270
to which the Russian
government is

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:26.160
going in Europe, and the way in
which the Chinese government is

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.360
moving very
aggressively to pick up

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.650
the vacuum of
American leadership--

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:36.980
this is another
tremendous issue we face.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:42.290
Far more serious than the
Russian threat in the future

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:46.340
will be the Chinese
threat both economically

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.940
in terms of picking off
countries for which the United

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:54.380
States does not have the same
appetite for engagement--

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.670
I can't even begin to
understand what's happened with

00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:00.720
Australian-American relations--

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.520
but firstly we have the
this America first ideology,

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.520
this economic
nationalism ideology,

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:14.640
which is completely unattractive
to the rest of the world.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.230
The war on terror--

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.950
the various wars this government
has sponsored over the last 50

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:29.480
years are not compelling
aspects of brand America.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.900
Countries are not attracted
to other countries

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:41.370
who are constantly expressing
a message of fear and concern.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:43.530
The government, the
president is continuing

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.590
to use the words Islamic terror.

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:49.670
Terror is not Islamic.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:56.310
We are alienating a billion and
a half citizens of the earth

00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:02.010
by talking about terror as
somehow being only connected

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.300
to Islam.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.360
Timothy McVeigh, to the
best of my understanding,

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:13.170
was not practicing Islam at
the time that bomb went off,

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.240
and we can go on and on.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.570
These terror attacks, as
dangerous and unsettling

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:24.680
as they are, have nothing
to do with a religion.

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:30.320
They have to do with the
attempt to seize power

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:34.800
and to instrumentalize
our media.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:42.390
So our point is that in the
future over these next four

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:43.380
or--

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:48.710
heaven help us-- eight years
we have to hope that this

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:57.310
government establishes a real
deep understanding of the fact

00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:01.210
that issues like the
maintenance of the EU,

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:05.350
issues like a strong
power base with Russia--

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.626
that these issues are
internalized and that--

00:33:09.626 --> 00:33:11.500
yesterday there was an
important appointment.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.740
Fiona Hill may join the
administration with respect

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.700
to Russia.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.250
These kinds of appointments,
as well as his appointments

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:21.760
with respect to national
security and defense,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:27.790
are all to be welcomed, but the
issue that truly grabs at us

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:32.350
is America is not
in a position where

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:36.400
we want to adopt
economic nationalism,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:42.100
where we want to go to war with
our neighbors and our friends.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.150
If you had told me any American
president would have been

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:53.270
able to alienate Mexico and
Australia as opposed to what

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.810
are the natural competitors
of the United States,

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:01.220
I wouldn't have believed
that was possible,

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:05.590
nor would I have believed
that in the case of what

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.780
happened recently with the
executive order regarding

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.170
immigration that Uber
would have immediately lost

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:18.050
200,000 subscribers because
they didn't adjust quickly

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.690
enough to the political
issue that they

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:24.989
didn't want to be seen
supporting the executive order.

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:29.190
It is this kind of
lightning-like approach

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.719
to policy as opposed to
law that corporations

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:37.889
need to embrace very
aggressively as we

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:41.260
move through these
very uncertain waters.

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.989
So thank you very much.

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:44.321
Appreciate it.

00:34:44.321 --> 00:34:49.449
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:52.560
AUDIENCE: You spent some time in
Turkey, as well, if I remember.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.670
I was wondering what
your thoughts are

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:58.300
on the current situation
there and how it interplays

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.376
with Russia, for example.

00:35:00.376 --> 00:35:01.750
ROBERT AMSTERDAM:
Well, I've been

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.790
hired by the Turkish
government to deal

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:07.120
with the situation
of Mr. Gulen, who

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:14.310
is an Imam living in
Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, who

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:21.020
runs 170 charter schools
in the United States.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:26.180
Those charter schools take
half a billion dollars out

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.850
of the US economy.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:31.190
A percentage of
that money is then

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:35.240
taken into what it turns out
to be essentially is a cult

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:39.860
and then shipped to
Turkey to continue

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.950
to work to undercut
the Turkish government.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:47.390
Turkey views Gulen as
an existential threat.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:49.940
We have done a series
of investigations,

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.750
which you can find at
GulenInvestigations.com, which

00:35:53.750 --> 00:36:00.470
I think fully demonstrate
that the Gulen organization is

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:04.910
engaged in a massive H-1B
visa fraud, where they bring

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:09.170
over individuals,
state that they earn 53

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.200
or some other thousand
dollars, and then rebate

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.530
that money-- a percentage
of that money, 15% or 20%,

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.210
to the Imam.

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:21.590
Then, in addition to that,
they engage in a massive amount

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:25.970
of self-dealing through
real estate ventures,

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:32.250
through crony capitalism
at its worst, where

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.490
Gulen-related construction
companies engage

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:40.800
in no bid or low bid contracts
where the quality has just

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.750
been fairly shocking.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.180
And what we've
done is we've tried

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:51.750
to work with a whole group of
American parents and teachers

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:58.730
to bring this to
light in really the 26

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:02.750
states in which the schools
are located, and we've been--

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:06.890
frankly it's been very difficult
because the charter school

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:11.960
industry in this country
is a religious totem

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.200
for certain people
and many Republicans,

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.590
and even if you say
that we're not viewing--

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:22.640
we're not trying to argue
pro-charter or anti-charter.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.510
What we're trying to say is,
here's a bad charter that

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:27.860
needs to be addressed.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.070
Even if that's how
limited you approach it,

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:35.390
it is very difficult
because many people simply

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.940
don't want to hear
it, and this is

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:44.600
one of the things I'm
finding in America today--

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:50.100
is that we've really lost the
ability to hear our opponents.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:54.450
We've really lost
the ability to engage

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:58.080
in real meaningful dialogue.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:02.370
And there's a book
that just came

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:07.380
out called "The Death of
Expertise" by a guy named

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.660
Tom Nichols, and
actually there's

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.250
a quote in this
book that's just--

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.190
I think it just sums it up.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.870
"The death of
expertise is not just

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.670
a rejection of
existing knowledge.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:21.690
It is fundamentally a rejection
of science and dispassionate

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.060
rationality, which
are the foundations

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:27.480
of modern civilization.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.520
All citizens today
believe themselves

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.460
to be experts on everything."

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.670
And it's one of-- if you'll
excuse me, for all of the good

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:39.480
that Google has done, it is one
of the unfortunate byproducts

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.420
of googling-- is
that people believe

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.750
that within a few minutes
of googling any subject

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.400
they've mastered it.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.820
And certainly one of
the problems we've faced

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.720
is trying to explain
at the state level

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.590
from politicians, many
of whom have received

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:01.500
significant payments
from this organization,

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.400
that there's a very
serious problem in terms

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.400
of not only what
this organization did

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.550
during the coup, but what this
organization has been doing

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.710
in Turkey for many,
many years and what

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:19.710
they appear to be intending to
do here in the United States.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:21.360
AUDIENCE: Really
what the prognosis

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.180
is for the future in terms
of corporations dealing

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.620
on this governmental level-- is
it a matter of banding together

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:32.700
to express their interest
in a confederation,

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.060
or is it better just
that they each have

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.030
their own, essentially,
foreign policy?

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.550
ROBERT AMSTERDAM:
Well, I think it's

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:45.120
going to be necessary
for governments

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:49.630
to once again attempt
to come together.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.320
We're going to see
the French vote.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.020
We're going to see the
Brexit negotiations,

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.830
but I think the
Trump administration

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.430
has to decide on
what its message is

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:04.410
and who its voice is.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.600
I mean, we're in an
embarrassing scenario

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:11.340
here where the president
will say one thing

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:17.520
to the American public, and then
a completely different message

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:22.100
is raised in Munich
by the vice president.

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:27.350
I mean, you can't really
run a foreign policy

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:32.420
with that many discordant
voices at the highest level.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:38.240
So if what happens is the
Trump administration starts

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:44.300
to veer towards a more middle
of the road historically

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.590
consistent American
position, you're

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.380
seeing an American economy
that is starting to pick up

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.850
in a major way, and
it may be possible

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:58.750
that after some very significant
veering to-ing and fro-ing

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.410
we get back on track.

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:05.960
We renegotiate NAFTA.

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.620
We realize that complete
abandonment of the TPP

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.360
and leaving Asia
to China may not

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.060
be the greatest deal
in town, and we come up

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:17.960
with some new methodology,
some powerful series

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.080
of bilaterals that would
save president Trump's face

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:24.920
and at the same time
keep us in the game.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.380
This is a great country that
leads the world in technology

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:34.670
and leads the world, until
recently, in many key sectors

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:37.010
like environmental technology.

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:40.160
So I think there's still a
tremendous amount of hope.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.850
There isn't a necessity for
us to be negative completely,

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:47.660
but we also have to
suggest to the Democrats

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.700
that we don't want
to have another four

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.210
years of a stalemated Congress.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:55.240
And I think that's--

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.320
the message has to be given
to both political parties

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.070
that they're going to
be held accountable,

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:06.640
and as somebody who has
been ferociously attacking

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.290
on the issue of
Russia, I can say

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:15.210
that the level of
instrumentalization

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:20.160
of this issue of the
Russia hack really has--

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.210
the Democrats really
have to slow down or--

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:27.210
forget the presumption
of innocence.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:31.580
You do have to understand
that logically,

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.310
if you're sitting
here looking at what

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.440
happened in the election--

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.420
I'm sorry, from my
perspective, and I was here

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.800
for most of the time--

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.200
if I was going to point to
anything that might have swung

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.740
the election, it
was the Democrats

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:49.700
forgetting their base, and
it was Comey and the FBI.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.220
And I think a lot of questions
have to be asked of Comey.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.280
If he was aware of
this Russia stuff,

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.040
it sounds far more
relevant than reopening

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.420
Hillary to have at least opened
an investigation about that.

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:06.740
And it seems shocking to me, as
does the Obama administration's

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.880
reaction.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.480
Once again, when you talk
about foreign policy,

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.250
the Obama
administration does not

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:18.260
get five stars, and this issue
of how they've handled Russia--

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.530
they did to Russia what
Trump did to Mexico.

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:25.190
Obama insulted
Russia unnecessarily.

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:29.960
There was no reason to call it
a second rate regional power

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:35.300
unless what you want to do is
just pour gasoline on a fire.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:40.220
There's so much that a president
can do by his presentation,

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:45.080
by his words, by his conduct to
show respect to other nations,

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.880
and President Obama really
dropped the ball with respect

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.100
to Russia--

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.470
and to be fair, has
dropped the ball in respect

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:59.090
to a number of other
areas, like Syria--

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:03.980
and has left has left Trump
with some real difficulties.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.500
And the fact is about
Russia they don't

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.050
have to be a mortal enemy.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.370
There's no reason for it.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:15.670
I think to that
extent Trump is right.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:19.090
Russia has to clean up its
act, and at the same time,

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:21.880
some form of face saver
can be negotiated.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:29.290
The real hard point is what are
we going to do about Crimea.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:32.390
How is Crimea to be resolved?

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:37.310
That is one of the key points
for European integrity.

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:39.440
As well as, obviously,
the expansion

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.040
that's going on
in eastern Ukraine

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.940
is incredibly threatening,
but one believes

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.800
that can be more controlled.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.670
I think from a Putin
standpoint Crimea is probably

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:53.450
entering the realm of
the non-negotiable,

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:56.390
and that presents a real
problem because it's

00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:59.180
around Crimea and
eastern Ukraine

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.710
that the entire sanctions
morass is based.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.660
AUDIENCE: You've
talked a lot about what

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.675
the corporations can do and what
the federal government can do.

00:45:08.675 --> 00:45:10.970
Do you have a charge
for the individual?

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:15.909
Is there something that you
feel like the individual can do?

00:45:15.909 --> 00:45:17.450
ROBERT AMSTERDAM:
Yeah, I'll tell you

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:25.040
I think that one of the things
the last election demonstrated

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.690
very significantly is that
individuals can do a lot.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:32.060
The last election
demonstrated it.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.850
The march on Washington
the day after the inaugural

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:36.650
demonstrated it,
even though there

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:39.590
were far fewer people at
the march on Washington

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:40.580
than at the inaugural.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.840
We all know that.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.560
That was very
powerful, and I think

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.260
with the assistance
of the internet,

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.020
with the assistance
of media harnessing

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.920
technology a tremendous
amount can be done.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.460
In fact, arguably
the Trump team did

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.990
a tremendous amount by
harnessing digital technology,

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:08.440
and the same team that
did Trump did Brexit.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.730
And it's led to a lot of very
powerful and obviously somewhat

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:13.522
difficult outcomes.

00:46:13.522 --> 00:46:15.479
SPEAKER: Well, thank you
very much for speaking

00:46:15.479 --> 00:46:16.160
with us today.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:19.180
We'll have a link to your
blog and site in our video,

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.094
as well, for our viewers,
and thanks for stopping by.

00:46:22.094 --> 00:46:23.260
ROBERT AMSTERDAM: Thank you.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:27.210
