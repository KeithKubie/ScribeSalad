We were lucky to get a chance to talk
with an iOS engineer from Venmo, and

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.420
Keith Smiley, an iOS engineer from Lyft.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.210
They told us about their
experiences rewriting the Venmo and

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.076
Lyft apps in Swift,

00:00:11.076 --> 00:00:15.190
and how they see future of Objective C
in iOS development shaping up.
