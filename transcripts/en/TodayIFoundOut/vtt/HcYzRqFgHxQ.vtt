00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.440
Do Earwigs Really Lay Eggs in Your Ears?

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.610
To answer the question of whether earwigs
actually like to go in your ear to lay eggs

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.459
or not, we’ll start off talking about the
mating habits of the earwig.

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.630
To make baby earwigs, the male grabs and holds
onto the female and they, literally, bump

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.630
uglies.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.410
The eggs may not fertilize immediately (the
sperm can hang around for several months before

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.390
fertilizing the eggs), but ultimately they
will.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.869
At some point, the lady comes to her senses-
no doubt realizing the male is super creepy

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.910
looking- and exiles him from the nest- yes,
nest, that is not your ear.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.860
Then she lays anywhere between 20 and 80 eggs.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.469
After hatching, earwigs develop in a series
of five stages, each grosser than the last.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.380
The mother earwig, unlike most non-social
insects, actually guards her young, at least

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.380
until they leave the nest after the first
molt.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.720
Throughout their development, earwigs retain
that familiar handsome profile.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.699
There seems to be a consensus that people
have always thought the earwig would climb

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.320
in your ear if given a chance.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.079
In fact, the name is thought by most etymologists
to come from two Old English words that mean

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.680
“ear insect” (ēare wicga).

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.119
While humans may have long associated the
insect with burrowing into ears, in reality

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.830
this almost never happens and even when it
does, they aren’t going there to lay eggs

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.140
and burrow into your brain.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.390
Earwigs simply like moist, dark places to
hide, but they choose these places for day-time

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.979
hiding, not at night when you are presumably
sleeping.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.270
At night, they hunt for insects and plants
to eat.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.820
That being said, throughout history, there
have been anecdotal reports of earwigs being

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.659
found inside people’s ears.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.330
One story submitted to the Bug Doctor by a
man known only as Frank, goes like this:

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.290
“At 3 am, my 8-year-old daughter awoke me
from a sound sleep.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.890
She was extremely upset.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.580
For the preceding few minutes she had attempted
to remove a creature crawling about in her

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.070
left external ear canal.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.810
A light sleeper, she had been aroused by the
‘sound of little feet.’

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.549
Otoscopic examination revealed a dark brown
mass near the tympanic membrane.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.430
My brief discussion with her on the importance
of proper hygiene was interrupted when I saw

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.520
the form move.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.250
Then, bathed in brilliant illumination from
the otoscope, a female earwig . . . measuring

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.650
20 mm in length, cautiously emerged, to the
relief of insect, child and father.”

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.530
While this story may or may not be made up,
it doesn’t seem too far fetched to think

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.160
at some point in human history, possibly many
times, and earwig crawled into a person’s

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.160
ear canal.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.200
As stated, there are many anecdotal stories,
some even well documented, of this sort of

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.990
thing happening, along with similar occurrences
from many other small insects.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.830
Insects like exploring and if you let them
crawl all over your body, eventually one might

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.070
dink around in your ear canal for a bit to
see what’s there.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.030
But regardless, once there, the female earwig
certainly isn’t going to find it a good

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.910
environment to mate and nest.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.900
If left alone in the ear, she also would not
burrow into a person’s brain and lay her

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.900
eggs.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.230
Besides the fact that the ear canal and brain
wouldn’t make a very good nest, this simply

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.390
isn’t possible considering the amount of
bone and other tissue the earwig isn’t equipped

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.390
to burrow through.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.530
At best, the earwig can use their pincers
on you, but even these aren’t strong enough

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.490
to do any real damage.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.390
As for their often slimy appearance, leading
some to believe that this is from earwax,

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.020
this likely comes from the damp crevices where
they reside as well as the waxy secretions

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.210
from their abdominal gland.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.890
Bonus Facts:
• Nocturnal, earwigs come out to feed at

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.890
night.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.630
They love decaying organic matter, like dead
leaves, but they also eat a variety of other

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.120
insects including mites and aphids.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.070
Omnivorous, they eat beneficial healthy plants,
too.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.290
Although there are nearly 2,000 different
species of earwigs (why, God, why?), the one

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.450
most of us flinch from is the Forficula auricularia.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.040
• If you are unlucky enough to have an earwig,
or any other insect, crawl into your ear,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.180
there are a few simple steps to removing it:
o DON’T STICK ANYTHING IN YOUR EAR (not

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.850
a finger or a Q-Tip).

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.690
Poking at the insect may cause it to bite
or sting.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.910
o Lay your head flat, infested ear facing
up.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.900
Say a prayer to your higher power of choice
that the insect will crawl out on its own.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.130
If it doesn’t, proceed to step three.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.050
o Have someone pour baby or olive oil in your
ear, pulling the lobe as they pour.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.100
For children, the lobe should be pulled backward
and downward; for adults, it should be moved

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.590
backward and upward.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:23.090
It is hoped the insect will drown, and then
drain out 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.910
with the oil.
