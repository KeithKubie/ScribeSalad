00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.099
In today's video,

00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:03.026
we are taking
a commonly despised item,

00:00:03.026 --> 00:00:04.700
and making it
even more dangerous.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:14.320
[Music]

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.100
Guys, we built

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.980
a random idea generator, and it
kicks out some weird stuff,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.923
and some of them seem
like pretty mean ideas.

00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:24.400
This time, it gave
us weaponized glitter.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.300
Now, it doesn't go

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.200
into any details
about what that means,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.500
it just leaves it up to us.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.100
And so, we weaponized glitter.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.080
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.100
Our random idea generator
told us to weaponize glitter.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.015
So we're going to go
ahead and get creative with that

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.580
in a few different ways.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.700
Namely, into really

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.300
really really really
adorable little bombs.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.634
We've got three different
versions of weaponized glitter.

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:48.600
We've got some bombs
that are made

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.321
from glass Christmas ornaments
filled with glitter,

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:52.900
and painted to be super cute.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.500
We've got Nerf darts
that we are dipping in glitter

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.600
and glue to make a sort
of DIY paint ball.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.700
Although, it's more
glitter than paint.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.060
And then we've got

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.880
water balloons full
of gelled alcohol, water,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.100
and glitter, of course,
because that's the thing.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.500
All right, on your mark?

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.769
Wait.

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:13.420
Get set!

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.755
First, let's show them
how we made these.

00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:15.555
All right.

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:16.894
Well show you how we made these,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.400
and then we'll show you
what they do.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.700
So the first thing

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.800
that you want to do is assemble
all of your supplies.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.900
Most of the stuff,
I got from a craft store.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.540
So we've got glitter, a funnel,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.800
different types of craft paint,
Model Magic, some craft cord,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.300
and a piece of foam sheet.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.740
Once you have the rest
of your supplies assembled,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.443
you're going to want to get
a glass of Christmas ornament.

00:01:36.443 --> 00:01:38.700
Now, you can choose what size
or shape you want.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.700
I wanted to go with the very
classic looking video game bomb.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.500
So I found the biggest
round ornament I could find.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.900
So with these ornaments,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.400
you can get them at pretty much
any store during Christmas time.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.200
I was able to get
these on clearance,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.000
because it's after Christmas,
but they're pretty simple.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.750
They're made to fill
or to decorate.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.000
So if you take off the top,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.810
you're going to have
a little piece of wire

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.814
that we've clipped off,

00:01:59.814 --> 00:02:02.100
and you're going to want
to save this top for later.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.900
Next, you're going
to grab your funnel,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.000
and you're going
to choose your weapon.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.900
So I've got two different
colors of glitter.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.760
So I'm going with
gold and for this one.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.877
That's either going to look
like an awesome explosion,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.340
or a Gryffindor party.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.000
So for your next step,

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:16.900
you're going to add
a thin line of hot glue

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.100
right around the edge
of your glass ornament,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.820
and we're going to put the lid
back on once that's in place.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.110
Once your ornament is sealed up,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.460
take a piece of your craft foam,
and cut a strip

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.000
that's about the same height
as the top of your ornament.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.750
Once you've cut your strip
of craft foam,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.900
glue it around the edges.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.117
Probably go around it
twice to make sure it's

00:02:33.117 --> 00:02:35.728
about the width and size
that you're going to want.

00:02:35.728 --> 00:02:38.900
Next, you're going to take your
craft cord, and cut a piece,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.680
maybe about 2 inches long.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.650
Once you've got a decent
amount of hot glue,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.500
we've almost formed the dome
at the top like a resin dome.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.400
You're going to sink
your wick down into it.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.060
[Music]

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.400
Once you've got
the body assembled,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400
you can start painting.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.200
So the paint that I'm using
is not very expensive.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800
It's about 90 cents a bottle,
which is great.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.749
But it also doesn't have
the best coverage.

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.000
So I'm going to probably
do two or three coats

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.880
of this black paint on the body,

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.487
but I'm going to be hitting it
with the heat gun,

00:03:10.487 --> 00:03:12.420
so I don't have to wait
for it to dry.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.900
If you use
a better quality paint,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.500
you can probably
do this just once,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.240
and not worry about it too much.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.200
Once you've got the body
of your video game bomb

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.100
all finished painted,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.100
you're going to want to hit it
with a layer of sealant.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.041
This is probably my favorite
sealer I use for anything,

00:03:25.041 --> 00:03:27.440
whether it's decorations
or cosplay.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.100
This is Krylon Clear Sealer,
and it's amazing.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.240
It works for anything.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:39.260
[Music]

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.760
Alright, once you have
the base all made,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.000
it's time to add the details.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.970
And the way that we're going
to add the little face

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.264
and the feet is going
to be Model Magic.

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:48.209
It's super cheap,
super easy to use.

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.460
You don't need a whole lot
of skill or practice with it,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.100
and it's going to form
really easy for what we need.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:23.960
[Music]

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.900
Guys, I've already
assembled all of our bombs.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.600
Now, it's time to make
some more weapons.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.900
[Music]

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.060
That's still enough glitter

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.900
that you're not going
to want to get hit with it.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.612
Any glitter is enough that I
don't want to get hit with it.

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:39.700
That's the point.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:05:17.360
[Music]

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.220
All right, guys,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.540
we've got three different types
of glitter weapons.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.200
It's time for a field test.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:32.600
[Music]

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.720
So glitter has a tendency
to stick to things forever.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.900
And...

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.700
If you get it on you,

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.700
be prepared to have
it on you forever.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.200
I'm trying not to
ruin my clothes.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.700
I'm trying to ruin his clothes.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.400
Yeah.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.480
That's why they call it War.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.180
Yep.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.020
I've gone all out folks.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.620
This is a head sock.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.840
It's a rectangle
with a spot badly cut out

00:06:04.843 --> 00:06:06.612
and sewn for your eyes.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.040
[Music]

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.460
You're going down.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.440
I'm yelling glitter.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.880
Okay.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.500
Yeah, I was having
that same problem.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.340
And I say I was,
I mean, I still am.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.800
This is going well.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.600
This is glitter glue.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.000
Now what we're doing
with this is

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.100
were actually coating the ends
of our Nerf darts in glue,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.500
and then glitter.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.700
And then we're shooting
each other with it.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:45.360
[Music]

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.060
Bomb flower!

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.300
Bomb flower.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.320
Your bomb didn't break.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.800
No!

This is unfair.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.240
I think the glue was a mean,
a mean addition.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.380
I've never been so proud.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:06.955
Guys, that was awesome.

00:10:06.955 --> 00:10:07.457
But you know,

00:10:07.457 --> 00:10:08.920
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.317
This box up here at the top will
take you to our latest video.

00:10:11.317 --> 00:10:12.300
That box of the bottom is

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.000
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.400
Hit this bomb in the middle,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.857
and it will subscribe
you to the channel.

00:10:16.857 --> 00:10:19.080
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see in the next one.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.160
Talk to you then.
