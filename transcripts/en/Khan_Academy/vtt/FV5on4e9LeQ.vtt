00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:02.486
- [Narrator] So where we
left off in the last video,

00:00:02.486 --> 00:00:05.562
we have the Neo-Babylonians,
the Chaldean Empire,

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:09.376
being conquered by the Persians
led by Cyrus the Great.

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:13.543
That's in 539 that Cyrus
the Great conquers Babylon.

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:18.994
And they're able to establish
a significant empire.

00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:22.618
And his successor, Cambyses II,

00:00:23.964 --> 00:00:27.622
in 525 B.C.E., is able to do something

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:28.768
that many of the conquerors

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:30.195
that we've talked about
in the last two videos

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:33.271
were not able to do, and conquers Egypt,

00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:36.856
and makes that part of the Persian Empire.

00:00:36.856 --> 00:00:38.314
And so the Persian Empire

00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:40.613
is this vast and significant empire

00:00:40.613 --> 00:00:43.042
that gets created in this time period.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:46.399
But they soon run up to
a, I guess you could say

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.464
a group of city-states, a civilization,

00:00:48.464 --> 00:00:51.335
that is able to fend off the Persians.

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:53.419
And so just to be clear
what we're talking about

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:55.299
or what I just talked about,

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.132
here we are in roughly 539 B.C.E.,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.200
where you have Cyrus the Great

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:09.206
is able to take over the
Neo-Babylonian Empire,

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:11.589
and in doing so, going back to

00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:13.049
references from the Old Testament,

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.128
ends the Babylonian captivity
of the Jewish people,

00:01:16.128 --> 00:01:17.834
is able to free the Jewish people,

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:21.834
and then his successor,
Cambyses, in 525 B.C.E.,

00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:25.683
is able to take over Egypt.

00:01:25.683 --> 00:01:28.827
And so you see this expansion
of the Persian Empire

00:01:28.827 --> 00:01:30.823
on this timeline as well,

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:34.343
but then they run up
against the Ancient Greeks.

00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:38.511
And the Ancient Greeks
were not a unified nation.

00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:40.508
They were a group of city-states.

00:01:40.508 --> 00:01:43.186
When people talk about city-states,
it's cities like Athens

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:46.341
that are associated with the Ionians,

00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:49.590
that settled several hundred
years ago in that region,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.512
the Spartans, associated with the Dorians,

00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:54.022
who also moved down several hundred years

00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:56.231
before the time period
we're talking about.

00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:59.142
They each had, each
city was its own state,

00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:02.509
it had its own military, it had
its own laws and traditions.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.107
But they also had things in common.

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:07.769
They shared a language,
they shared traditions,

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:09.519
they shared religion.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.427
And the Persians, and I'll
do many videos on this,

00:02:13.427 --> 00:02:14.602
because it is fascinating,

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:16.640
were not able to conquer,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.430
and now this is under the
successors of Cyrus the Great,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.181
or the successor of Cyrus
the Great and Cambyses,

00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:24.485
we have Darius the Great,

00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:26.742
is not able, in multiple attempts,

00:02:26.742 --> 00:02:28.683
to take over the Greeks,

00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:31.869
and these are the famous
Greco-Persian Wars,

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.119
which occur from 499 B.C.E.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:37.906
to 450 B.C.E..

00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:42.884
Greco-Persian Wars.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.485
In our map, we see it right over here.

00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:52.313
The Greco-Persian Wars,

00:02:52.313 --> 00:02:53.993
and there are some famous instances,

00:02:53.993 --> 00:02:57.743
famous events, from why
we now run a marathon

00:02:59.037 --> 00:03:02.265
to the movie 300, where you have the stand

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:06.742
that the Spartans attempted
to take at Thermopoli,

00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:08.643
where the Persian army,

00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:10.468
with thousands and thousands of soldiers

00:03:10.468 --> 00:03:14.389
facing 300 Spartans and
several hundred other soldiers,

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.103
say "give us your arms,"

00:03:16.103 --> 00:03:18.040
and once again, we don't know
how much of this is legend

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.767
and how much is true,
but it's a good story,

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:21.667
and the Spartans say "come and take them,"

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:22.876
and then the Persians say

00:03:22.876 --> 00:03:25.489
"we have enough arrows
to blot out the sun,"

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.332
and the Spartans say

00:03:26.332 --> 00:03:29.009
"good, then we will fight in the shade."

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.423
So the Greco-Persian Wars, they happened,

00:03:32.423 --> 00:03:34.484
and they're also the stuff of legend

00:03:34.484 --> 00:03:37.106
and some great stories
and great movies even

00:03:37.106 --> 00:03:39.959
have come out of those wars.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.013
Now, even though the city-states of Greece

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:46.014
were able to fend off the
Persians in this time period,

00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:47.753
they're not able to unify,

00:03:47.753 --> 00:03:49.901
and in fact they start
fighting each other.

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:52.647
And that's when you start
having the Peloponnesian Wars.

00:03:52.647 --> 00:03:53.480
So 431,

00:03:54.952 --> 00:03:56.202
from 431 B.C.E.

00:03:59.632 --> 00:04:00.799
to 404 B.C.E.,

00:04:03.153 --> 00:04:03.986
you have

00:04:05.684 --> 00:04:07.184
the Peloponnesian,

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:13.326
or I should say the Peloponnesian War,

00:04:13.326 --> 00:04:16.567
and that is between Sparta and its allies

00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:18.726
and Athens and its allies,

00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:21.480
and we'll once again
do more videos on this,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.244
but Sparta is this militaristic society,

00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:26.937
Athens, famous for its
culture and its learning,

00:04:26.937 --> 00:04:29.633
but they're able to give
each other a good fight.

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:32.050
Now can you imagine, while
they're fighting each other,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.559
it leaves them open to be
conquered by someone else.

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:38.958
And that someone else ends
up being Philip of Macedon.

00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.030
And the Macedonians are a related people.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.370
They share a similar language,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.033
they have similar traditions,

00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:49.544
and Philip of Macedon is able to take over

00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:53.171
most of what we now consider to be Greece.

00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:56.338
And as famous as Philip of Macedon is,

00:04:57.446 --> 00:05:00.613
his son is perhaps one of the top five

00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:03.485
most famous people in history,

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:07.421
because in 336, Philip of Macedon dies,

00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:09.760
he's actually assassinated,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.440
and his son, Alexander
the Great, takes over.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.037
And his son is only 20 years old.

00:05:15.037 --> 00:05:16.742
And he wasn't called Alexander
the Great when it started,

00:05:16.742 --> 00:05:21.105
but when he was done, they
called him Alexander the Great.

00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:23.156
So Alexander takes over,
I'll write this down,

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.656
he's 20 years old,

00:05:26.082 --> 00:05:28.927
and he quickly consolidates power,

00:05:28.927 --> 00:05:33.783
not only over Greece, but he
starts establishing an empire,

00:05:33.783 --> 00:05:35.455
where he's able to take over,

00:05:35.455 --> 00:05:37.454
now the shoe's on the other foot,

00:05:37.454 --> 00:05:41.621
he's able to take over much of
what was the Persian Empire.

00:05:43.015 --> 00:05:45.378
He actually is able to take his armies

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:48.248
all the way to the borders of India,

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:51.563
he's taking over Egypt,
much of the Middle East.

00:05:51.563 --> 00:05:53.535
And so this is often referred to

00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:54.822
as the world's greatest adventure,

00:05:54.822 --> 00:05:56.641
and it's fascinating because he does this

00:05:56.641 --> 00:05:59.032
over a little bit more than a decade.

00:05:59.032 --> 00:06:01.532
He dies in 323, so 323 B.C.E.,

00:06:07.324 --> 00:06:08.794
Alexander dies.

00:06:08.794 --> 00:06:13.285
So he's in his early 30s,
and he managed to do this.

00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:14.548
Depending on what side
of history you're on,

00:06:14.548 --> 00:06:16.093
fortunately or unfortunately,

00:06:16.093 --> 00:06:17.919
his empire isn't able to last.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.258
So you can see this on our timeline.

00:06:19.258 --> 00:06:20.997
Alexander, in that brief, you know,

00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:21.926
a little bit more than a decade,

00:06:21.926 --> 00:06:25.207
he's able to take over
all of this territory.

00:06:25.207 --> 00:06:29.374
He's able to get his armies
to the borders of India,

00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:33.188
but then because he
dies, it's short-lived,

00:06:33.188 --> 00:06:34.398
the empire does not last.

00:06:34.398 --> 00:06:37.193
It actually gets split
into multiple empires.

00:06:37.193 --> 00:06:40.370
People who are related or
the generals of Alexander.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.269
We'll do many videos about that split.

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:44.385
But maybe more interestingly,

00:06:44.385 --> 00:06:47.538
while that is happening,
at the time of Alexander,

00:06:47.538 --> 00:06:50.378
another group is emerging

00:06:50.378 --> 00:06:54.673
that will eventually turn into
one of the greatest empires

00:06:54.673 --> 00:06:56.965
that the world has ever seen.

00:06:56.965 --> 00:07:00.306
And that is the Romans, that we see,

00:07:00.306 --> 00:07:05.023
or they are the Romans, that
we will see in the next video.

00:07:05.023 --> 00:07:08.869
You can see it on this
timeline right over here.
