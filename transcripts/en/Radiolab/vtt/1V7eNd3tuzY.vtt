00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.780
Three, two, one. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:08.340
And today we have a legal case. Well, it's actually, it's,

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.380
it's really more than just a legal case. This case, it's, it's, um,

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.320
what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet.

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.130
Once you start thinking about it, it won't go away.

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.520
It gets under your skin. This is Lisa Lehrman.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.050
I'm a law professor at Catholic University at the Columbus School of law where

8
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:31.650
she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our

9
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:32.760
producer Brenda feral,

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.120
who brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten.

11
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.660
Yeah, it,

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.730
it just made me not know whether to decide with my head or my heart.

13
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.110
And, uh, let me just jump in and say, this episode contains, um,

14
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.250
some violence and explicit imagery in it. Uh,

15
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:54.630
so if you're listening with kids,

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.800
you just know that going in and you might want to skip this one.

17
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.700
So to get the story started. Sure. Jim Tracy,

18
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.310
<v 1>my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist,</v>

19
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.490
newspaper Guy for the post. Darn glens falls.

20
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:11.550
He's been reporting on this story since about 2000.

21
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:14.610
He's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's,

22
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.200
he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him.

23
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.830
Um, I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks, which is where the story begins.

24
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.760
So Saturday night, July 28th,

25
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.580
1973 for young people, ages 18 to 23,

26
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.410
three men and a woman go camping in the Adirondacks, pulled off the road, uh,

27
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.780
aside road off route 30, they made up a makeshift campsite, the grass clearing,

28
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.980
they set up two tenths and went to sleep for the night. And then Sunday they,

29
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.430
you know,

30
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.430
woke up and about 9:00 AM two of the campers heard somebody walking outside

31
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.410
their, their town. And all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the tank go up.

32
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.800
And what they saw was this middle aged man peering into the tent,

33
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.370
who looked like a conservation officer. You had a fedora with a feather on it.

34
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.010
Sunglasses, a rifle.

35
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.430
He had a buck night binoculars around his neck and very calmly,

36
00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:13.270
he told him almost politely to step out of their town, which they did.

37
00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:15.040
He got the other two campers yacht,

38
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:17.830
all four of them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in a

39
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:21.450
semicircle. And then the man cocked the gun and said, listen,

40
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:26.140
a I've killed before and I'll kill again. I'm, I'm gonna take your gas.

41
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.240
I don't want to get caught, so I'm going to tie you to trees.

42
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.790
And he started marching the kids off into the woods,

43
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.300
took them into the woods near a brook and pears, a two with him.

44
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:37.600
Behind him are the kids of course were scared out of their weds.

45
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.580
He pulled out some ropes basically. He hadn't,

46
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.360
he had each of them tie themselves, you know, as he pointed the gun at them.

47
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:44.770
And then the last one, he tied.

48
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.280
<v 2>Okay.</v>

49
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.440
<v 1>So after we had the four people tied,</v>

50
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.820
he went back to the first boy, 18 year old Phillip Dumb Bluesky.

51
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.430
And because the other three kids were spread out through the forest,

52
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.950
they couldn't really see what was happening. But they could hear clearly and um,

53
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.110
they heard vomiting sounds and then they heard Phillip's voice get really high

54
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.640
and they knew something was happening, something bad was happening to them.

55
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.850
What was happening was the man was stabbing dumb blue with his buck knife.

56
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.360
He stabbed him five times in the chest. And when this happened,

57
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.740
three of them in their panic were able to break loose and start running.

58
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.240
Nick Fiorello ran to his car. Carol and Malinowski ran through the woods,

59
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.530
but the man caught one of them, David Freeman.

60
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.800
He took the boy back to the campsite and he had him lay down in a ditch next to

61
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.360
them to kind of monitor the situation, I guess. So Freeman and um,

62
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.430
the killer laying in the ditch after about an hour and the men come then that

63
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.590
the other two campers, the ones who had gotten away,

64
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.660
had managed to alert locals that knew the area.

65
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.330
They came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted them.

66
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:53.170
Killer and Freeman laying down in the ditch. And when they did,

67
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.520
Freeman got up and ran towards the man screaming for help saying he's got a gun

68
00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:58.354
and he's going to shoot,

69
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.630
and the man with a gun just kind of stood up and calmly and coolly walked into

70
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:08.050
the forest and thus began what was at the time,

71
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.820
the largest manhunt in state history.

72
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.100
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

73
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.730
This morning and about 1130 you can see a state police cars parked almost as far

74
00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:14.870
up the road. As you can see,

75
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.040
<v 1>when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning,</v>

76
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.490
<v 3>deputies and the state police standing by,</v>

77
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.500
<v 1>it was a scene like a never been seen before</v>

78
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.620
<v 3>today where you've broken down on man power into a roving patrols. Men</v>

79
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.440
<v 1>are in with all kinds of weapons, rifle, shotguns,</v>

80
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.030
bloodhounds or traveling trails, helicopters, and it's a waiting game right now.

81
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.350
By Monday or Tuesday,

82
00:04:36.351 --> 00:04:39.860
they had 200 men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods.

83
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.830
They eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and

84
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.920
that comes back with an ID, a 37 year old Robert Garrow, Robert Francis Garrow,

85
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.880
senior of Syracuse, New York. The fugitive police are looking forward today.

86
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.790
He was an ex-convict, he'd been in prison for rape,

87
00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.230
serves seven years now armed with a 30 30 rifle and knife.

88
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.610
And the story was on every TV station, CBS, ABC, and NBC.

89
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.290
So by Tuesday night when the people got panicked, when you're all, well,

90
00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:12.890
one of at night, the doors are short. Like people loaded their rifles,

91
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.310
they locked their doors for the first time and we've noticed a lot of people

92
00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:19.910
leaving around here, but people left the area so fast, I don't play it out.

93
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.460
Last night, and the day before that, they left their tents up.

94
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.100
They left barbecue smoldering, they left behind coolers. So as a man,

95
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.050
manhunt dragged on.

96
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.190
What happened was Carol was able to use those camps in that food and those

97
00:05:31.191 --> 00:05:34.010
drinks to survive. After day. The manhunt,

98
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.220
it's about 400 men now the police follow a lead that he had stolen a car and he

99
00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:44.780
had been cited and they, they're kind of closing in on him. And then day 12,

100
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.700
Thursday, August 9th, 1973 very, very hot day.

101
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.800
One of the hardest of the summer. That day,

102
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:55.220
a conservation officer named Hilary Leblanc spotted Garrow.

103
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.280
He said, freeze or

104
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.900
<v 0>drop your gun, something to that effect.</v>

105
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.520
And Garo started running the block, fired four times,

106
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.050
got him in the back, the arm and the foot. Daryl went down once,

107
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.370
got back up and kept running. They ended up, you know,

108
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.640
chasing through the forest, you know, found a blood trail.

109
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:18.260
And just in a very short time they saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud,

110
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.153
not moving.

111
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.970
And so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there, but they,

112
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:25.550
you know, took his pilots and everything and he was certainly alive.

113
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.260
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

114
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.920
<v 0>so they put them in an ambulance and they rushed him to the nearest hospital in</v>

115
00:06:31.921 --> 00:06:35.160
Plattsburgh. And according to Jim, a couple of cops go with him.

116
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.220
They're grilling him the whole time because they think that he might've been

117
00:06:38.221 --> 00:06:41.670
responsible for an additional murder. And for a girl who's gone missing,

118
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.100
but he wouldn't talk.

119
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.680
And it's at this point that the story that I'm interested in really gets

120
00:06:49.681 --> 00:06:53.040
started. It's known as the buried bodies case.

121
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.060
And I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case,

122
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.800
this is law professor Lisa Lurman. Again,

123
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.970
there's the conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person

124
00:07:04.561 --> 00:07:08.030
should do in this situation. Okay.

125
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.660
And we are recording.

126
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.810
So the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank Armani,

127
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.730
frank h Armani and Brenda the lawyer and Syracuse and never know whether to

128
00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:24.930
pronounce it Armani or Armani. That's Mary Armani,

129
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.010
Frank's wife in our area. And Salvey they use it our money,

130
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.940
but it is our money. A couple of months ago,

131
00:07:32.941 --> 00:07:35.520
producer Simon Adler and I went up to visit them.

132
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.330
They live right outside of Syracuse, New York. Mr Armani's now in his eighties.

133
00:07:39.331 --> 00:07:40.164
He's retired.

134
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:46.490
<v 5>My name is Frank Armani and I was the attorney for Robert Girl.</v>

135
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.890
<v 0>Um, well I, I'd love to have you start wherever you like.</v>

136
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.440
How did this whole story start for you?

137
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.840
So just to give a bit of background, Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid,

138
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.100
he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the

139
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:05.360
guy that that wouldn't walk.

140
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.100
<v 5>I was a fighter. I like to f fights, physical fights.</v>

141
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.890
I like standing up for the little guy

142
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.190
<v 0>and that's partly why he became an attorney.</v>

143
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.890
<v 5>When you fighting a case for a defendant,</v>

144
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.710
you're fighting the state and tyranny

145
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.110
<v 0>and he was doing really well. He was well respected, had a good reputation.</v>

146
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.290
But then he met Robert Garrow.

147
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.540
<v 5>Yeah. [inaudible] black hair, strong man to take him out,</v>

148
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.810
you need a 45. And uh,

149
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.900
I just had that feeling that this guy is dangerous and I love the things that

150
00:08:40.451 --> 00:08:41.470
are going to happen.

151
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:46.490
<v 0>This is a year before the manhunts 1972. Um, frank remembers,</v>

152
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:50.500
he represented him at first on two pretty small things. One on

153
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.610
<v 5>a school teacher had assaulted his child.</v>

154
00:08:54.611 --> 00:08:56.460
He sued the school

155
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.550
<v 1>and I talked him out of it and then he had an automobile accident.</v>

156
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.300
I represented him on that.

157
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.880
<v 0>But then pretty quickly it gets dark. Yeah.</v>

158
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.800
Garrow was charged with trying to kidnap two college kids.

159
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.340
That case got dismissed but then picked up for, oh hello.

160
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.750
See some young girls, kids to very young girls.

161
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.270
Age 10 and 11 girl was released on bail.

162
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.000
He skipped his court date and just disappeared.

163
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.720
And then we pick up where we left off the murder,

164
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.200
the manhunt and an August 9th the night Garo got captured.

165
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.880
Frank gets a call from Garrett's wife telling me daddy wanted to talk to me.

166
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.410
He wanted Armani to represent him.

167
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.000
My impression is that Armani didn't want to do it.

168
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.520
<v 1>In my mind I'm saying,</v>

169
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.460
what the hell do I want to get involved in this for?

170
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:50.620
<v 0>He had never handled a murder charge. Full throw a murder case. No,</v>

171
00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.600
he didn't know how the problem was.

172
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.960
Garrow wouldn't talk to any lawyer except for Armani.

173
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.360
He looked at me as his attorney.

174
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:02.110
So Armani eventually decides to go and talk to the judge who'd been assigned to

175
00:10:02.111 --> 00:10:04.630
the case and the judge is basically like,

176
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:09.970
we have an obligation to provide the counsel that this guy wants.

177
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.970
So, I mean, unless you have a good reason why you can't do it,

178
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.990
I want to appoint you his public defender and Armani agrees.

179
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:21.310
And so at that point he has to defend Carol. Yeah.

180
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.880
So this is reporter Jim Tracy again.

181
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.310
<v 1>Armani decides to elicit a man named Francis Belge.</v>

182
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:32.340
We skied together as friends or family's picnic together to help them with this

183
00:10:32.591 --> 00:10:36.370
case as co counsel because I felt I needed support.

184
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:40.270
Belge was the top criminal defense lawyer in central New York.

185
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.790
I needed someone with brains and guts.

186
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.110
So Armani goes to talk to Belgium. He kinda resembled Mickey man,

187
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.840
all the blonde hair, blue eyes, good looking. I told them, I says,

188
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.200
I just need backup. That's it. He's like, no,

189
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.960
that was a lose lose case and there's no money in it. You know,

190
00:10:55.961 --> 00:10:58.510
the prosecution had three eyeball witnesses.

191
00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.840
They had his car at the scene of the crime and they had his two week flight.

192
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.120
But he was guilty and I said, come on,

193
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.920
I'm not going to try to prove you didn't do it.

194
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.740
I wanted to go on and sanity defense. Maybe Garrow murdered this kid buck.

195
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.960
Maybe it was because he had temporarily gone insane. He's crazy.

196
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.950
He really believes this. I'm telling you about my theory on top of that.

197
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.330
Armani tells him most is this going to be a big case. We pulled this off.

198
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.560
We made it would take belge awhile, but eventually he says,

199
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.050
I'm in frank now.

200
00:11:29.051 --> 00:11:32.080
We're into a late August,

201
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.480
1973 so we went up to the hospital.

202
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.511
<v 0>When they got there,</v>

203
00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:38.390
they went up to Garrett's room up on the fifth floor of the hospital.

204
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.390
Police are standing guard. They walked into the room

205
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.340
<v 1>and I hadn't seen him in a while.</v>

206
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.460
And we greeted each other and we talked,

207
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.390
<v 0>and just to picture this,</v>

208
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.170
Jim told me that the room they put Garo in was what he described,

209
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.790
a training observation room,

210
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.230
which meant that it had this big window that ran alongside Garrett's bed so they

211
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:00.070
could keep an eye on him.

212
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.090
And the cops are stationed right outside just watching.

213
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.020
And according to Jim, and I should say,

214
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:09.760
I've heard differing accounts about this,

215
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:13.420
but apparently the cops had brought in a lip reader to try to see what girl was

216
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:16.930
saying, wait days. I don't think you can do that. Right? I mean,

217
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.210
that's not legal. Yeah, I think that's probably not okay. Um,

218
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.780
but from the cop's perspective,

219
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.790
they think that he's involved in a recent murder and a missing girl,

220
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.800
and they think that girl could still be alive.

221
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.160
So they want to know absolutely anything they can that's going to get them

222
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:36.880
closer to solving that murder and finding that girl.

223
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.410
But at the same time,

224
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.460
the defendant has to be able to share absolutely everything with the lawyers.

225
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:46.390
And know that they're in that safe space of that relationship.

226
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:51.391
Because we have sixth amendment right to counsel and the Fifth Amendment right

227
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.650
not to incriminate oneself,

228
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.730
<v 5>to freely speak as an attorney.</v>

229
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.700
Then you have no real justice system

230
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.800
<v 0>and Armenian Belge they need as much information about what Garo has done as</v>

231
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:08.020
they possibly can get so they can start to build their defense.

232
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.640
<v 5>I don't like surprises. I'm the kind at once I know everything.</v>

233
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.150
<v 0>Wow. So, so that as a lawyer, you're in a strange spot here.</v>

234
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.830
[inaudible] he needed to get from Garrow his story and it needed to be just that

235
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:22.360
and he didn't want the cops in on it yet.

236
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.080
<v 5>And you don't know if there are taps in the room or what.</v>

237
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:31.120
So they'll turn up the TV, turn off the fans. But uh, he was playing games,

238
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:33.520
you know, he talking basically about anything but,

239
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.580
but the cases kept saying he couldn't remember. He couldn't remember.

240
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.170
<v 0>And they're, they're trying to convince him like,</v>

241
00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.330
you've got to talk to us if you're going to have any shot.

242
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.960
It's like a lynch mob out there. The police pretty much. Have you cold.

243
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.500
There's witnesses and Garrow knew he could be going to prison,

244
00:13:48.501 --> 00:13:50.180
he could be going to prison for a long time,

245
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.080
maybe 25 to life and pedophile in prison. You have to be careful.

246
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.590
Things can get rough, but they tell him, if you talk to us,

247
00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.530
maybe we can get you not guilty by reason of insanity.

248
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:05.590
That was our only defense to help get Garrow into a mental hospital instead of a

249
00:14:05.691 --> 00:14:09.700
prison. That was the goal. So if you have anything to say, say it know,

250
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.860
it took several conversations to get Garrett at this point,

251
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.100
but finally Jerell poured a soul out at this point.

252
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.270
It was just Belge in the room and he told him yes,

253
00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:26.780
he had killed them blue ski and he'd also killed other people too.

254
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:31.990
And the episodes when guero killed people seem to have followed,

255
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:38.240
uh, like a pattern. You would get these intense headaches and you know,

256
00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:43.241
become psychotic and do horrible things when it came to the details.

257
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.620
Keep tended to not remember.

258
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.680
But then Carol mentions two particular girls who were then missing and whose had

259
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:52.990
no idea where they were.

260
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.960
<v 1>21 year olds who's in pads and another girl, 16 year old Alicia Hock.</v>

261
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.930
<v 0>Susan pets was from Chicago. She's the girl I mentioned earlier.</v>

262
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.920
Cops were already looking for her, hoping that Garo might have some information.

263
00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.420
Earlier that summer, her boyfriend had been found murdered.

264
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.780
The two of them had been camping and Susan had been gone ever since.

265
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.770
Alicia Houk, she was a high school girl from Syracuse.

266
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.560
She had gone missing just a couple of days before Susan.

267
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.960
Everybody thought she might've just run away,

268
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:28.470
but Garo told the lawyers that he had killed them and where he had left their

269
00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:29.590
bodies.

270
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.320
One odd thing about Guerrero's description of the incidents,

271
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.990
he doesn't say I killed her.

272
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.930
He says she got stabbed with my knife,

273
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.690
stab with my knife. Like it wasn't even him doing the stabbing. Right,

274
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.680
like this is what do you do? Well, first and foremost, you have to ask yourself,

275
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.290
is this true? You know,

276
00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:56.650
your client is obviously severely mentally ill.

277
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.920
This could be a dream he had.

278
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.090
It could be a delusion if you're gonna go and um, you know,

279
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.940
craft an argument and, and present a strategy,

280
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:11.380
you need to know what actually happened. Belge walks out the door,

281
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.670
he grabs frank and he says, let's go. So they, they slip outside,

282
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.880
they get in the car and take off to go look for the bodies.

283
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:28.050
Garrow told the lawyers that Susan pet's was in an air event of a closed up

284
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.730
mineshaft

285
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.700
<v 1>the main is up in Maine, WVU bout an hour south of the hospital,</v>

286
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:39.110
a burner head around it. So when in that moment were you scared?

287
00:16:39.111 --> 00:16:43.010
Were you excited? Like, Oh, you're up high,

288
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.380
but you're scared, you're concerned,

289
00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.800
you fear you're a fool if you're Joan. In fact,

290
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.710
at one point looking in the rear view mirror, they got a little spooked.

291
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.130
We thought we were being followed by the state police.

292
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.590
So eventually they pull over,

293
00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:02.620
get out of the car and went into one bar where when a Francis Bell,

294
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.970
Jeez, lady friends was hanging out for about 30 minutes.

295
00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:10.520
Belge talked to her. Then he asked if he could borrow her car.

296
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.580
And then we went out the back door,

297
00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:20.680
took off driving the lady friend's car to try to lose any tails

298
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.200
<v 0>and so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until</v>

299
00:17:25.201 --> 00:17:29.040
finally they get here. This may be as far as we're going to go. Okay.

300
00:17:29.041 --> 00:17:32.400
We can walk up to this old abandoned mine

301
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.960
went out there last February with reporter Laura McKinstry and the town

302
00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:45.450
supervisor of Mariah. Tom's goes a fava.

303
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.400
So is this a road that goes to the mines or what is mind?

304
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.600
It was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road.

305
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:59.250
Is this a trail that we're on or you're just very icy that day?

306
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.130
This here, this used to be an old road while

307
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.400
we're walking up a very wooded hill. It was fairly steep.

308
00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:12.570
There were no leaves and all the trees were black. And um,

309
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.210
Larry skeletal walking right in. They use the same area that Armenia,

310
00:18:16.211 --> 00:18:20.370
and this is the only way they could have came in here. So right up this hill.

311
00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:20.820
Yeah.

312
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.900
<v 5>Here we are in our Sunday suits. And here we go.</v>

313
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.920
Treading through the forest, looking for the case.

314
00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.430
<v 2>We spent a lot of hours looking around.</v>

315
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:44.463
Then

316
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.960
we found this uh, air vent. Hello.

317
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.310
<v 0>You see the air shaft here? They find this air shaft,</v>

318
00:18:55.311 --> 00:18:58.190
which is just a hole in the ground, a couple of feet across.

319
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.730
That shoots up from down in the depths of the mind. Oh, be careful.

320
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.670
Now this has given me such. Yeah, you don't want to slide down in there.

321
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:09.320
And so they couldn't see anything down the hole.

322
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.030
So Frank Armani laid down on the ground at the edge of the mineshaft.

323
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.120
He's got a flashlight that he takes out and then bells,

324
00:19:17.121 --> 00:19:22.121
she held my feet and left me down in there and as frank got lower down into the

325
00:19:23.541 --> 00:19:26.900
hole, I could see her sneak

326
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.320
<v 5>the blue shoe. A blue sneaker. Yeah,</v>

327
00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.670
and a leg. I said to myself,

328
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:41.050
this son of a bitch did it and he yells back up to Belgian, get me Outta here.

329
00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:42.850
Pull me back up.

330
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.500
<v 0>Eventually Belge found the other body, Alicia Hawk's body.</v>

331
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.590
She was in a cemetery where Guerro had said he'd left her,

332
00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.170
but Armani wasn't there when Belge found her.

333
00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:03.470
So what ensued was a very long struggle where the lawyers tried to figure out

334
00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:12.291
what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls.

335
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.990
So let's, yeah, let's play that out. What, what are your options? Sure.

336
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.050
So option one, we've got to call the police.

337
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.530
We've got to tell the prosecutor these are missing kids.

338
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.820
We're the only ones who know, you know, shouldn't we just call the police,

339
00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.970
right? No, you can't. You just can't.

340
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:35.210
We took an note to keep the confidences of our client under the current rules,

341
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.030
which have developed quite a bit since the time this happened. Um,

342
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:45.710
anything that is related to the representation of a client is under the

343
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:47.190
confidentiality.

344
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.160
So you're not supposed to tell anybody except to prevent reasonably certain

345
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:58.520
death or substantial bodily harm. That will be that. That is, yeah,

346
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:03.610
that can be or will be. Okay. Right. So, so in this situation,

347
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.320
the two girls are dead, then there's no future crime.

348
00:21:08.321 --> 00:21:10.240
It's over. It's done.

349
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.600
And even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and

350
00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:18.040
leaking up,

351
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.600
when even if they have hired detectives and even if the local police are combing

352
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:26.830
the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that, but there's no, if the, if the,

353
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.760
if the people are already dead, then you, you the, the law is,

354
00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.123
that's right.

355
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.800
<v 6>It's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer.</v>

356
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.900
You have a very particular part to play. You,

357
00:21:39.901 --> 00:21:44.901
you have a role and that role isn't what you think as a person is good and

358
00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:45.891
right,

359
00:21:45.891 --> 00:21:49.070
and what you would do for your friend or your family member in that situation.

360
00:21:49.071 --> 00:21:50.060
What your role is,

361
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.920
is to play this part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the

362
00:21:54.921 --> 00:21:59.630
guy that everybody else hates. Even if everybody hates you,

363
00:21:59.631 --> 00:22:02.060
even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit,

364
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:07.090
you have to do your job and that job is to be in the role of the person that

365
00:22:08.331 --> 00:22:10.860
fights as hard as they can for their clients. The lawyer

366
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.900
<v 0>is the agent of his client, only.</v>

367
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.580
Only the agent of [inaudible] or also a citizen and a member of the g and part

368
00:22:18.581 --> 00:22:20.680
of the justice system. And there's a, there's a,

369
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:25.600
there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened.

370
00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:30.000
He now knows what happens. Right. Is there a wheat here building on,

371
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.830
on the side of tell. Just tell. Tell.

372
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:37.560
<v 5>Yeah, of course. Yes. And I knew Mr Hawk from bowling</v>

373
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:44.210
cause his other daughter and my daughter were in the same class and I knew him

374
00:22:44.921 --> 00:22:49.830
from church and one a yeah, you have to be an animal,

375
00:22:49.831 --> 00:22:52.480
not a female.

376
00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:58.150
The anguish of the parents. Oh, the family.

377
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.350
And yet you, you have your duty as a lawyer.

378
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.360
<v 0>You're caught between the two more moralities.</v>

379
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.940
So now what is he doing coming up that hard spot?

380
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.780
Kit's even harder. We'll be right back.

381
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.370
Hi, this is Lizzie from Arlington, Texas.

382
00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.060
Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

383
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.720
enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world.

384
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.430
More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

385
00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.890
okay. Hey, I'm Jad, I'm, I'm Rod, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

386
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.980
And now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral.

387
00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.100
Then when we left it, they were aware they were stuck. Right? They didn't know.

388
00:23:57.101 --> 00:24:00.430
They knew this thing. They knew the client was very guilty of something.

389
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.980
They had found the bodies of these two girls and a no.

390
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:08.350
I know what's their next move? Well, so they did decide to put the burden,

391
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:12.520
plea bargain that take this information to the prosecutor and say,

392
00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:17.460
I have information that will help you solve some cases. Some cases. Yes.

393
00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.270
And in exchange,

394
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:24.010
I want you to give me a better deal for my client to get guero into a mental

395
00:24:24.011 --> 00:24:25.690
hospital instead of a prison. Oh,

396
00:24:25.691 --> 00:24:29.200
so right away they're going to use this as leverage.

397
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.970
That was the idea.

398
00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.390
You're going to give a little and you're going to take a little,

399
00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.220
well that's Kinda gross. No, yeah,

400
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.940
he's trying to get a better deal for this murderer. But I mean,

401
00:24:39.941 --> 00:24:41.950
if you think about it from Frank's perspective,

402
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.500
he's got this information as a person.

403
00:24:44.501 --> 00:24:47.830
He doesn't want to have to keep that secret. So if he plea bargains,

404
00:24:47.831 --> 00:24:51.880
then that's a way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give

405
00:24:51.881 --> 00:24:53.500
the information to the prosecution.

406
00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:57.370
But he's also not selling out as client report at Jim Tracy again,

407
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:59.380
they called a meeting with Henry McCabe,

408
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:04.120
investigator from the state police to McCabe and the district attorney Army's

409
00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:04.840
office.

410
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.840
And when they met Armie and Belge search the briefcases of the DA and the

411
00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:14.080
investigator, make sure they weren't wearing a bug because they're paranoid.

412
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.330
There's going to be a wire tap or something, some sort of bug.

413
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.110
And then a Belge presents the deal. He says, listen,

414
00:25:20.111 --> 00:25:22.090
I've got information on two bodies.

415
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:26.470
I want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending

416
00:25:26.471 --> 00:25:27.304
them off to prison.

417
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:32.080
And the prosecutor apparently very quickly puts two and two together and

418
00:25:32.081 --> 00:25:35.890
immediately thought, Holy Shit, are you talking about Susan and Alicia?

419
00:25:35.891 --> 00:25:39.040
Like these are the two girls that we are most concerned about.

420
00:25:39.041 --> 00:25:41.260
We think they're alive. And Belge said,

421
00:25:41.261 --> 00:25:43.450
I'm not telling you anything unless we have a deal.

422
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.230
Both the da and the investigator thought that the lawyers were absolutely

423
00:25:47.231 --> 00:25:50.950
ludicrous. They thought they'd lost their mind. Like, are you kidding me?

424
00:25:50.951 --> 00:25:55.870
Like are you trying to get a better sentence for murder by offering his murder

425
00:25:55.871 --> 00:25:58.480
victims? Are you seriously bargaining with people's lives?

426
00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:04.080
But also I'm sure that the prosecutor do that.

427
00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:09.450
This was doubtless the highest profile case that would ever come to him.

428
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.040
And so as the prosecutor,

429
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.450
you're not going to look so good if you give a deal to this reprehensible man.

430
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.850
No. Well, what the Hell is the difference?

431
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.410
He's going to get life no matter what. How many times you want to give him life.

432
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.870
But the meeting only lasted like five minutes.

433
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.660
We wouldn't know where the deal collapses completely.

434
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.230
And to back up a little ways when that deal fell apart, that was actually,

435
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.710
that was particularly devastating for Armani because just the day before he was

436
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.210
in pets, his father had flown in from Chicago to Syracuse.

437
00:26:40.211 --> 00:26:44.100
I remember most of bets coming to my office and

438
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.730
<v 5>he said, can I meet with you and talk to you on? And Armani agreed to it.</v>

439
00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:52.000
<v 6>So he comes in, it takes a seat and we asked him, father to father,</v>

440
00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:54.280
is there anything you can tell me about my daughter?

441
00:26:54.281 --> 00:26:58.990
I mean the papers think that sh that girl probably has something to do with her

442
00:26:58.991 --> 00:27:02.800
disappearance. Is there anything at all that he's told you that that can help me

443
00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.360
<v 5>but I couldn't tell him anything.</v>

444
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.040
<v 6>And around he just, he says, no, I can't tell you.</v>

445
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:09.390
There's nothing I can tell you.

446
00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.450
<v 5>I remember trying to assure him that, look,</v>

447
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.530
I've got a meeting set up.

448
00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:19.330
<v 6>All I can say is it's with state investigators and the prosecutor on the case.</v>

449
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.700
<v 5>They could have some information for you.</v>

450
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:27.050
Trying to give him hope that we would bring it to a conclusion.

451
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.960
I thought we would, but we didn't.

452
00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:34.190
<v 6>So then when Mr Petz leaves Mr Armani, he loses it.</v>

453
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.660
He threw a bunch of books basically just, you know,

454
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:39.950
destroyed his office.

455
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:45.070
<v 5>Just trying to relieve my by that I couldn't help the man</v>

456
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.440
<v 6>because he's looking right at this man knowing exactly well imagining what he's</v>

457
00:27:50.661 --> 00:27:53.450
going through. Like Armani had lost a brother.

458
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:57.490
<v 5>Yes. Was much younger. Is four years younger than me.</v>

459
00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.580
He's an air force pilot or three kids.

460
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.260
<v 6>1962 his plane went down and he was lost at sea.</v>

461
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:08.120
So after that Armani said his mother, she'd be up at night crying.

462
00:28:08.121 --> 00:28:09.590
She would like go to bed at night

463
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:13.800
<v 5>and my mother would wake up screaming, no fish, you're eating.</v>

464
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.910
You know, she couldn't ever recover from

465
00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.980
<v 6>because you can't, you know, you just, you don't really know. But you know</v>

466
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:27.420
<v 5>it's a, I can understand that.</v>

467
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.120
<v 6>And that's, you know,</v>

468
00:28:29.121 --> 00:28:33.770
that's partly why this was so hard for Armani because when that plea deal fell

469
00:28:33.771 --> 00:28:34.220
apart,

470
00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:39.220
that was his chance to try to get this information to the families.

471
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:41.660
When the plea fell through,

472
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.200
he didn't have any other options for sharing that information. He was stuck.

473
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.270
What? So what happens next?

474
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:52.170
So they have to go to trial and that means that Armani and Belge have to knuckle

475
00:28:52.171 --> 00:28:56.450
down. I try to present an insanity defense. Meanwhile, Armani,

476
00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.880
he said he couldn't sleep. He was having nightmares.

477
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:03.290
<v 5>Wake up at two 30 in the morning where the sweat running down your back.</v>

478
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:04.500
<v 6>Go sit at the kitchen table,</v>

479
00:29:04.501 --> 00:29:07.800
drinking coffee and just waiting for the morning paper to come because he was

480
00:29:07.801 --> 00:29:10.860
just alone with it. He was alone with this secret.

481
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.450
And he knew at that moment that police are trying to find these girls.

482
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:18.330
He knows that the parents are holding out hope that they might still be alive.

483
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.950
<v 5>You, you, uh, you're questioning yourself very, uh,</v>

484
00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.820
you're hurting people. So you begin to wonder,

485
00:29:30.821 --> 00:29:34.210
am I in the right profession? You know, you're looking for,

486
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.010
you're looking for a way to give the information now,

487
00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:44.980
you know, more anonymous call. Did you ever think of that?

488
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.400
Sure. Why didn't you? Well,

489
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.940
if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it openly, you know? Uh,

490
00:29:55.210 --> 00:30:00.130
I don't know. Did he ever, did he ever break? No.

491
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.110
According to him, no. You know,

492
00:30:02.111 --> 00:30:07.111
in my mind I was doing what I thought was the proper ethical,

493
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.640
legal, moral, moral thing to do.

494
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.403
And then

495
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:18.710
<v 0>in December of 1973, five months after the girls disappear,</v>

496
00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.160
their bodies happened to be discovered within two weeks of each other.

497
00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:26.480
Susan's body is discovered by two kids who were playing up in the mines. Alicia,

498
00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.900
um, I guess, uh, I think a student from Syracuse University,

499
00:30:29.901 --> 00:30:31.770
which is right next door to the, uh,

500
00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.430
cemetery is walking through and stumbles upon her.

501
00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.900
And so she's discovered then too,

502
00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.980
and then six months later in the summer of 1974

503
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:43.830
<v 6>opening day of the trial, it might be one of the most significant, even though</v>

504
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:48.150
<v 0>Robert Carol's trial for the murder of Belton Bluesky Begin,</v>

505
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.000
<v 6>Robert,</v>

506
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.200
his primary line of defense will apparently be not guilty by reason of insanity.

507
00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:53.470
Right?

508
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.060
<v 0>So in order to make that case,</v>

509
00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.590
what they decided to do is to put Garrow on the stand and you just get the facts

510
00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:04.540
and Garel would tell his whole life story to shock the jury's mind,

511
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.840
including all these murders and all these rapes to see that he was,

512
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.940
at the time he was not

513
00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:12.570
<v 6>Sharon Smith, channel six news in like pleasant.</v>

514
00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.860
So the trial opens, um,

515
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:21.230
the courtroom is jam packed. Prosecution starts, they have a really good case.

516
00:31:21.231 --> 00:31:24.890
They've got a good lawyer from Syracuse that joined to help the guy from

517
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:29.660
Hamilton county, and then it's the time for the defense to start their case.

518
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.110
So belge stands up and he calls his first witness,

519
00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:38.260
Robert Garrow to the stand. Garo gets on stand and he starts,

520
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:41.370
he's telling his life story and it's horrible.

521
00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.060
Severe beatings and abuse by his parents.

522
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:50.520
Very little education basically gets sent off to a farm to work like as an

523
00:31:50.521 --> 00:31:54.360
indentured servant when he's seven slaughtering bowls and he's eight years old.

524
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.610
Weird stuff like that. He starts like drinking blood,

525
00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.650
I'm having sex with the animals.

526
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:03.710
And then he starts admitting to a series of rapes throughout his adult and he

527
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:10.670
admits to killing Alicia and Susan and what happens next?

528
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:15.290
And nobody's quite sure if it was a slip up or if maybe it was on purpose.

529
00:32:15.291 --> 00:32:20.291
But when Guerrero's was talking about Susan pet's Belge says,

530
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:22.040
is that the one I found?

531
00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.810
Is that the one I've found? So the cat was out of the bag. Then

532
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.090
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

533
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.631
<v 0>the next day,</v>

534
00:32:32.631 --> 00:32:36.410
Belgian Armani pulled a press conference to try to explain why they hadn't told

535
00:32:36.411 --> 00:32:40.310
anyone. [inaudible] Roberts, Gyros, defense attorneys,

536
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.590
because they had this duty to protect our client's secrets

537
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:46.370
<v 10>that they knew the body was here and they have seen it, but</v>

538
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:50.300
<v 0>everyone is disgusted. There was columns written at a tutorials,</v>

539
00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:52.010
written letters to the editor.

540
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:56.180
Very just no way in the world you're going to convince your average nonlawyer.

541
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.740
Everybody turned against them, but this is anything short of Shabby Chubb.

542
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:01.370
Regan, I belong in Augusta.

543
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.760
Pretty soon one of the prosecutors let out that Armani and Belge had actually

544
00:33:04.761 --> 00:33:07.760
tried to use these dead girls as leverage for Garo.

545
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.590
The headlines in the Syracuse papers would say bodies used as pawns in a game of

546
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.080
law who was bedlam.

547
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:17.810
Armani was getting death threats in the mail and I'd get these crazy phone

548
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.930
calls. People calling saying stuff like, how can you live with yourself?

549
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.880
I'm going to kill you. No, I get, yeah.

550
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.070
At one point he finds a dead fish in his car.

551
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.060
His wife finds an unlit Molotov cocktail in the backyard.

552
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.300
He started to carry up this, so my back, he kept shotgun in the car.

553
00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:35.570
He kept one in the house so we could sleep. It was,

554
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.860
that was the worst moment of my life. I some horrible.

555
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.790
I hit some bar, Bro fucks.

556
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:51.010
June 27th Robert Garrow is convicted for the murder of Phillip Don Blue Ski.

557
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:53.110
He's given the maximum sentence.

558
00:33:53.111 --> 00:33:56.850
He's given 25 years to life in a maximum security prison. How did,

559
00:33:56.851 --> 00:34:01.720
how did that feel? Where you relief? You know, it's over.

560
00:34:01.721 --> 00:34:02.554
What,

561
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:07.060
but then it is up to the grand jury itself in their investigation to determine

562
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.550
which charges they should bring against the two attorneys.

563
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:12.970
Pretty soon after the verdict Armani and Belge learned that they could be facing

564
00:34:12.971 --> 00:34:16.360
criminal charges. No one's really sure exactly what those might be,

565
00:34:16.361 --> 00:34:18.490
but it could be something like tampering with evidence,

566
00:34:18.491 --> 00:34:22.960
obstruction of justice or the state's public health law and the provision that

567
00:34:22.961 --> 00:34:26.860
says that a body must be given a quick and decent burial. And on top of that

568
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:31.640
<v 10>love the testing questions and the one was the greatest amount of controversy as</v>

569
00:34:31.641 --> 00:34:33.560
the one over the attorney client privilege.

570
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.540
<v 0>There was an ethical complaint filed against Armani and Belge.</v>

571
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.920
So basically they were then facing disbarment and investigation into the ethical

572
00:34:40.921 --> 00:34:45.450
complaint that would drag on several years. Belge started drinking heavily,

573
00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.470
abandon his law practice and moved to Florida. Armani topped it out,

574
00:34:49.471 --> 00:34:52.230
but he suffered. No one wanted him as a lawyer anymore.

575
00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:57.290
Or we're just thinking about what else can I do to make your living?

576
00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:02.080
He was just barely getting by for a little while. I think the pray all the,

577
00:35:02.081 --> 00:35:04.800
all the distress and pressure, you know,

578
00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:09.550
takes you to a toe. In fact, he has a heart attack, um,

579
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.770
while this is all going on,

580
00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:16.530
but eventually the criminal charges are dropped and the ethical complaint is

581
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:17.364
dismissed.

582
00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:22.380
And the reason in the opinion of the court and the state bar is that what

583
00:35:22.381 --> 00:35:26.760
Belgian Armani did was right. What they did was good.

584
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.160
Exactly. According to the law.

585
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.390
And my view is Frank Armani is a, you know,

586
00:35:33.391 --> 00:35:36.690
real life hero. I always say, you know,

587
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.390
so admire Atticus finch.

588
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:44.391
And the Difference Between Atticus finch and Frank Armani is that Armani is a

589
00:35:44.521 --> 00:35:46.890
real person. And Lisa told me about this panel.

590
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:50.610
She organized back in 2007 it was for the American Bar Association,

591
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.800
a big conference on professional responsibility.

592
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:56.580
And there were about 400 people in the room, most of them lawyers,

593
00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.110
and they were there to watch onstage the featured speaker, Frank Armani.

594
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.980
And it was a love feast. Does what is this? What does that feel like?

595
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:09.120
And did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the

596
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:14.130
hardest parts? No, never dream that.

597
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.530
Uh, I don't think I was a hero. I just was the lawyer that did his job.

598
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:23.850
Uh, I mean, I was a good lawyer,

599
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:30.470
at least I thought so. All right, everybody. Um, and now, you know,

600
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.820
over 40 years later this case,

601
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:37.560
let's talk about and what Armani and Belge did. The dead bodies case.

602
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.910
It's taught in law schools across the country. Everybody teaches the case.

603
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:46.410
It's like a touchstone. What do people think? What if, what if people think?

604
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.880
So I went to a couple of classes,

605
00:36:47.881 --> 00:36:52.881
I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class

606
00:36:52.891 --> 00:36:56.280
here in New York that was being taught at Fordham. Why don't I just stand up?

607
00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.820
Um, I agree. Um, his duty is to his clients.

608
00:36:59.821 --> 00:37:02.550
He represents his client's best interest.

609
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:05.880
If you've been sitting in on these classes and in talking to law professors,

610
00:37:05.881 --> 00:37:10.290
I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely is because

611
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.670
professors can point to it,

612
00:37:11.671 --> 00:37:15.840
they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal

613
00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:18.780
situation. And they can say, in this situation,

614
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.360
this is what a lawyer should do.

615
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.460
<v 2>Mm,</v>

616
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.100
<v 0>this is what a lawyer should, should be.</v>

617
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.070
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

618
00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:36.400
<v 0>So from, from the moment I started thinking about this story,</v>

619
00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.000
I always wanted to talk to the families involved,

620
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.190
which proved really difficult.

621
00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:47.370
I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and

622
00:37:47.921 --> 00:37:50.170
understandably, no one wanted to talk to me.

623
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:55.450
But eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the

624
00:37:55.451 --> 00:37:59.320
victims and she had initially didn't want to go on the record,

625
00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:04.350
but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and

626
00:38:05.111 --> 00:38:07.720
decided that she did want to go on the record.

627
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.020
<v 9>Okay. All right. Yeah.</v>

628
00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:13.060
<v 0>So, um, with me on a phone call, would you mind, um,</v>

629
00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:17.130
just telling us who you are, your name and you mentioned,

630
00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.740
<v 9>okay. I'm, I'm Roberta Patch and I'm, Susan's mother.</v>

631
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.140
<v 0>Susan was the girl from Chicago.</v>

632
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.890
She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her

633
00:38:27.891 --> 00:38:32.690
boyfriend. And she's who Armani and Belge found in the mind, you know, as,

634
00:38:32.691 --> 00:38:36.130
as I've explained before, my interest in

635
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:40.480
<v 6>this story, um, has to do with the fact that it seems that it, that it's become,</v>

636
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:41.080
um,

637
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.010
sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept

638
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:49.960
of confidentiality. And so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea,

639
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:50.500
um,

640
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:55.420
to ask if that's something that you knew that law schools were teaching and if

641
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:57.640
you had any feelings or thoughts about that.

642
00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:02.820
<v 9>I had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified</v>

643
00:39:03.311 --> 00:39:07.540
to think that this is what is considered to be correct.

644
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.260
<v 6>Okay.</v>

645
00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.650
<v 9>Uh, cause I don't think it's ethical at all.</v>

646
00:39:11.651 --> 00:39:16.651
And to think it's being taught as the right way to do things in an ethical class

647
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.240
is totally in comprehensible to me.

648
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:19.961
<v 6>And was the,</v>

649
00:39:19.961 --> 00:39:23.170
the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to you?

650
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.193
Yeah, it was, yeah.

651
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.890
<v 9>You were the only in talking to you did I know that? Yes.</v>

652
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:33.200
Maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to

653
00:39:33.201 --> 00:39:35.990
defend, but what about the victims?

654
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.970
And I think that that should at least be an equal thought in their mind,

655
00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.090
if not a greater consideration.

656
00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:46.330
<v 6>Did you, did you have a feeling that,</v>

657
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.400
that you really weren't taken into consideration as,

658
00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:50.550
as all of this was happening?

659
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:56.680
<v 9>Yes. And only, oh, my husband and I, when we first heard that she was missing,</v>

660
00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.620
we flew immediately and,

661
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.920
and went to the police station. And, uh,

662
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:07.090
when we were there sitting with the police men,

663
00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:11.290
they received the policeman at the time that we were with received the phone

664
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:14.620
call that the I needs my daughter's boyfriend,

665
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:19.900
what his body was found. And that's, that's all we knew.

666
00:40:19.901 --> 00:40:24.901
And we never really had many updates and nobody told us what was going on.

667
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.360
And obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse.

668
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.800
And then the only other time we were contacted by the police was,

669
00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:40.840
or some authority, I can't even remember who was, um,

670
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:44.290
when her body, my daughter's body was found like five months later.

671
00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:49.330
And in the meantime, of course we were all going crazy. My, my father,

672
00:40:49.331 --> 00:40:53.950
as a matter of fact, even when so far is to contact a psychic,

673
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.083
that's how,

674
00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.220
how important it was and how it was our entire life is during that period.

675
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.660
And as far as visiting the lawyer, which my husband did,

676
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.840
it was a totally lie. The lawyer,

677
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:10.540
maybe he considered it to be ethical,

678
00:41:10.541 --> 00:41:15.541
but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of,

679
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.430
of horror and,

680
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:21.880
and this is what is being taught in law schools.

681
00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:26.620
So anyway,

682
00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:31.430
<v 6>just to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone,</v>

683
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.070
law professors, law students, um,

684
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.790
<v 0>when they approach this as it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are,</v>

685
00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.920
they're struggling with the pain. They,

686
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:44.030
I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went

687
00:41:44.031 --> 00:41:44.331
through.

688
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:48.740
But my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't

689
00:41:48.741 --> 00:41:52.400
gone through it? And so I guess that's, that's why I was hoping to talk to you,

690
00:41:52.401 --> 00:41:57.050
to kind of, um, let you have a chance to communicate some of that, um,

691
00:41:57.830 --> 00:41:58.520
experience.

692
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.000
<v 9>Yeah. Well, it's impossible to really communicate in words.</v>

693
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.600
I mean, 40 years later I'm still,

694
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:11.600
I guess it's still a struggle to discuss this because it'll never go away as

695
00:42:11.781 --> 00:42:12.710
long as I live.

696
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:19.380
<v 0>I don't know. I'm guess, uh, I'm wondering,</v>

697
00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.950
we've been talking a lot of, um, sad stuff.

698
00:42:22.951 --> 00:42:26.670
I'm wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about, um,

699
00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.880
Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people

700
00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:33.750
to know that you'd want to share? I don't. Nothing. You don't have to, but,

701
00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.290
<v 9>well, what can I say? She was,</v>

702
00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:43.040
she did receive her degree pass to mostly, uh,

703
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:44.280
we,

704
00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:49.280
we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University was too difficult for us.

705
00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:54.910
And, um, and Danny, who was her boyfriend,

706
00:42:55.210 --> 00:43:00.210
had been just that summer and he had a full scholarship to Harvard and he had

707
00:43:01.061 --> 00:43:05.560
graduated just the year before. And so two lives,

708
00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:10.300
and I'm sure the other two children had great futures.

709
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:14.920
I hadn't been to, and it's just a horrible tragedy.

710
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:29.223
<v 0>It's,</v>

711
00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:34.830
it's so horrible to be in their position.

712
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.310
Do I have to live through, I mean,

713
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:43.780
how did he relate losing your daughter, you know, um, what,

714
00:43:43.781 --> 00:43:45.560
what excuse is there for,

715
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:49.270
to protecting the person that killed her?

716
00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:50.523
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

717
00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.320
<v 0>It's no justification. You couldn't justify it in my mind.</v>

718
00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.660
I don't expect them to accept it,

719
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.990
but that's the way it is.

720
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.413
<v 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

721
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:36.060
[inaudible]

722
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.600
<v 0>um, I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here, if that's okay. Yup.</v>

723
00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:52.953
<v 2>Okay.</v>

724
00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.950
<v 0>Okay. I can hear the echoes of dogs down the mountain.</v>

725
00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:07.350
Things tend to travel up the, up the hill and kind of bounce around. Um,

726
00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:11.300
and that water, I think it's from deeper down in there, dripping.

727
00:45:11.301 --> 00:45:14.570
I can't tell where it's dripping. Everything up here is frozen solid,

728
00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:19.420
so I'm not sure what that is. Um, but I think I'm going to turn back around now.

729
00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.150
Sorry. I wish I'd brought some flowers or something.

730
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:31.793
<v 2>Right.</v>

731
00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:04.393
[inaudible]

732
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.790
[inaudible].
