00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.405
Now that you know positive powers of ten moves the decimal right, and negative

00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:08.736
powers of ten move the decimal left, let's see you use this in action. Here's

00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:13.166
another quiz. Fill in the powers or exponents to make each statement true. You

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:17.509
can put your exponents in these boxes. Remember, you want to think about where

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:21.741
should this decimal point move. How can I can 63, and turn it into 6,300? How

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:24.831
many spots does it need to move, and in which direction?
