they'll talk about something like mm I

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 align:start position:0%
mean it's kind of weird comparison but
 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.580 align:start position:0%
mean it's kind of weird comparison but
like<00:04:04.699><c> 2001</c><00:04:05.359><c> they'll</c><00:04:05.629><c> be</c><00:04:05.750><c> like</c><00:04:05.959><c> well</c><00:04:06.379><c> it's</c><00:04:06.530><c> just</c>

a bunch of effects and that's it it's
 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.629 align:start position:0%
a bunch of effects and that's it it's
