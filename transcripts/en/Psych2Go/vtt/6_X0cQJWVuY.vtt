00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.480
Charlamagne once said, "To have another language is to possess another soul." Another

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:18.919
soul?

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.390
Somehow this

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.860
celebration of learning second languages was not always the case;

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.719
it was once more recently thought that learning a second language was a sign of dual personality disorder or

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.569
could onset schizophrenia and other disorders.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.889
This was thought to be true because many who were bilingual

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.570
had smaller vocabularies and slower access to sentence structure.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:51.639
However, in today's day and age the cons of knowing more than one language are far outweighed by the prose.

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.890
Number One:

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.690
Delaying Dementia.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.909
While more research is needed for data, it has been shown that being bilingual slows dementia by five years.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.400
There's no downside there!

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.800
Number Two: Better Listening.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.339
Listening skills are heightened in those who are bilingual.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.100
Once someone speaks more than one language,

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:22.389
they can hear different sounds and tones and recognize them, thus creating a subconscious analytical mindset.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.139
Babies who grow up in bilingual households can distinguish and differentiate languages they've never even heard before

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.460
Number Three: Better Memory Recall. Those same babies who grew up in bilingual

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.990
households also show a stronger memory recall. Their memories were also recalled with more clarity and accuracy--

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.600
this leads to faster learning,

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:54.428
especially in math and a better recollection of faces and names which allows creating stronger relationships at a much quicker rate

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.890
Number Four:

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.349
Multitasking. Despite the fact that multitasking is impossible as our brains are only capable of tackling one thing at a time,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.729
rapid task changes are vastly improved by being bilingual. Because being bilingual requires cognitive

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.380
flexibility; allowing the speaker to be able to shift from one task to the next

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.279
much quicker and with more ease than those who only speak one language.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.089
Number Five: Sharper Focus.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.569
Bilingual people also have both languages activated in their brains at the same time,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.750
monitoring which is appropriate for which given situation, which can improve attention and focus.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.660
Learning another language can also shed new perspectives on different topics:

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.529
Dancy Susilo conducted a study in June 2015 that showed that those who are bilingual

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.988
had higher abilities to process information and their self perception was different.

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.759
Being bilingual has lots of benefits. So why not go and learn a new language?
