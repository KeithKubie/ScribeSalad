00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.620
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Good evening, everyone.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.570
Welcome. Glad you can make it.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.870
My name is Larry Appelbaum.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.880
I'm one of the music
specialists here

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.460
in the Music Division
of the Library.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.700
I think everyone is gathered
here tonight in anticipation

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.060
with this concert we're
about to hear.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.180
And it is with great pleasure that
I'm going to take a few minutes

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.110
to talk with the composer,
the arranger,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.750
and the band leader,
Maria Schneider.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.550
Please help me welcome her.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:01.070
[ Applause ]

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.660
So here we are and we're about
90 minutes before show time.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.070
What kind of things
go through your mind?

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.570
Do you have like a
checklist of things

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.820
that you have to do before concert?

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.120
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Well, it depends,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.380
like tonight we're playing a
piece called "Cerulean Skies"

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.640
that has bird calls and
I don't have my people

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.610
from the audience that participate.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.500
There is supposed to be
birds around the room.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.800
So, I'm like, OK.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.810
Somebody said we have to
hermetically seal the bird calls

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.010
or putting tape around them so
that people don't get germs.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.400
[ Laughter ]

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.570
You know, those kind of-- There's
a lot of logistical things.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.820
And then there is talking
to somebody in the band

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.760
because we're doing a premiere,
you know, so talking about, "Hey,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.020
when you do that line,
can you try this?"

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.070
You know, just always a few
little last minute details.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.110
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Speaking
of this premier tonight,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.620
Maria has been commissioned
to write a new work

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.250
and you will be the first
audience to hear it.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.150
Why don't you tell us a
little about the piece itself,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.120
what context it comes out of, and
maybe something about the music?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.420
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: OK.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.370 position:56%
So, whenever I get a commission, I--

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.880
I don't know, I almost
panic a little bit,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.570
feel a lot of pressure,
you know, torture.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.190
And I started working
on this and writing

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.340
and there were a few
things that came to me.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.200
One was that as I was
working on it, the--

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.170
it was a little bit of a different
sound and a different approach

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.450
and a different something that--

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.220
than what I had before and
I immediately recognized

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.160
that it was the influence of having
worked with David Bowie a year

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.150 position:56%
and a half before and the project
that we did and the kind of attitude

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.900
and the sense of freedom
and fun and risk-taking

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.460
that he made me feel
very comfortable doing

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.530
and kind of that he reveled in.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.380
So, it's got some of that
and it's got the intensity.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.580
He really liked my
intense dark music.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.030
And it kind of made me
explore that dark side.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.800
But then as I as writing
it, also at the same time,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.620
many of you maybe know or if
you don't know, I will tell you,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.020
I'm quite into the whole thing
of what is happening right now

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.370
in our digital world and
rights for music creators

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.690
and creators of all kinds.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.870
But specifically my interest from
my perspective is music creation

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.330
and this idea that there are
these companies that are sort

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.250
of seducing us with the
idea of seducing musicians

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.220
that exposure is wonderful,
seducing everybody that, you know,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:47.090 position:56%
more is better and this concept that
free is just the way it has to be.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.510
But it's very conveniently-- it's
very convenient that the people

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.430 position:56%
that are making it free are actually
becoming very, very rich off of it.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.940
There's a massive redistribution
of wealth to these small companies

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.450
that are becoming huge and
they are big data companies.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.050
And, you know, we're talking
like Alphabet, Google, YouTube

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.490
and this kind on inducement of
infringement to gather this data.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.930
And this data is making
these companies

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.910
like Google more and more powerful.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.350 position:56%
And there are people and
scientists and people that speculate

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.100
that by the year 2035, artificial
intelligence could become more

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.490
intelligent than we are.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.120
And actually, that
could be catastrophic.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.100
You know, some say utopian,
some say catastrophic

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.960
and it could go different
directions.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.470
For-- I can tell you for the
music industry right now, it--

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.430
or not the industry,
the music makers,

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.580 position:56%
the people that make the music
because you have the music industry,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.600
you have the internet, big data--

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.650
and the piece I wrote
is called "Data Lords".

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.860
So the data lords, but
what they're resting on

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.630
and how they're attracting people

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.930
to amass all these data
is on the music creator.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.080
You know, that's the
attractor, make that free

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.800
and then you get all these eyeballs
and then you get the information

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.100
of how people move around.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.570 position:56%
So, the piece is about the seduction
and then this gathering of data.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.860
So there's this intensity that
comes through and it just kind

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.010
of overtakes us at the end.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.430
[ Laughter ]

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.730
We'll see.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.030
So, "Data Lords", yeah.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.120
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
"Data Lords", yeah.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.440
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: So, and also,
as I was writing, I thought, well,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.740
this is perfect, you know?

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.360
I'm going to Library
of Congress, you know?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.660
Oh, there's a copyright, you know?

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.350
It's like OK, Washington D.C., this
is a good place to unleash my--

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.010
the holy hell of the data lords.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.310
[ Laughter ]

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: It's interesting
to hear you talk about that,

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:48.500
because I want to know what
choices a creative artist has today

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.500
when faced with these things.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.240
I mean, you talk about the
seduction of promotion,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.360
for example, or exposure.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.910
Well, of course, when people
are starting out, they need--

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.300
in fact, they feel
they must have that.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.770
But what real choices do people
have other than to be co-opted?

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.470
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
The-- For me, I'm--

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.790
I would say that I'm one of the
few musicians that has managed

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.230
in this climate of what's going on,

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:23.520
and I became very inoculated
before it really hit luckily

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.560
because a friend of mine started
this company called ArtistShare.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.900
And the whole idea is that the
artist owns their own work,

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.580
the artist sells directly to
the fan through the internet

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.880
and through ArtistShare that
they share all the data.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.800
So when somebody buys my music or--

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.320
you know, through my
site, I know who they are.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.500
It's not some other company using
that data but it's my information.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.620
And the idea is that I
am not just sharing music

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.170
but I'm sharing the
whole creative process.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.550
So whenever I do a project,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.640
I announce I'm going
to be doing a project.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.570
I don't have to start
from square one each time

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.610 position:56%
because I have amass this fan base
now, because I've been doing project

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.210
after project, commissions
and recordings, and recordings

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.990
that are $200,000, and
managing to pay for them

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.110
because of this relationship
that I've made.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.480
So, for me and what I tell all
musicians now is self-ownership is

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.340
king, having your own
relationship with those people

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.400
that you establish, that
relationship of trust and respect,

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.820
giving them things that are fun.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:40.390
So they feel like, you know, wow,
this is so much more special than,

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.000
you know, just going and
streaming something somewhere.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.710
Wow, I'm getting this
whole inside story.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.010
And it's fun for me.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:53.220
The connection is beautiful
because it's-- Yeah, so it's that.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.890
And then the other thing is there
is a group of us in New York

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:01.240
that have started, you know, a
campaign called Musicanswers.org.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.380
And one thing that's
happening in this--

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.200
in the music industry and even
with people that, you know, lobby,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.600
Congress and everything, is that
some of the music organizations

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.000
that are doing it, they
are doing wonderful work

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.630
but there is a little
bit of a problem

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.750
and that sometimes the record
companies and the publishers are

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.120
in those organizations with
the people that make the music.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.800
And some of those record companies

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.020
and publishers have actually
joined the data lords.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.630
You know, Sony, Universal,
Warner all took equity--

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.300 position:56%
and Spotify, Spotify is a data lord.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.050
You know, they're making music free
to attract eyeballs to amass data

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.240
and sell advertising and
with a lack of transparency.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.840
So the idea that we had
was to start this campaign

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.540
where we educate musicians and
people, any-- all of you can join.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.460
You can go and sign up and just
say, "I'm a fan of the music,

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.810
I'm in the music industry," or
"I'm a composer, a songwriter,

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:03.550
a producer or performer."

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.180
That's who we're advocating for.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.730
So we have videos up about YouTube.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.440
We're going to have things
you should always have

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.190
in a publishing contract,
language you should never have

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.010
in a publishing contract, the
idea of empowering musicians

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:24.330
because we have been sitting ducks
for so long because, first of all,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.290
we love what we do and what we most
want is that you love what we do.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:34.790
So, if you-- if many musicians
will just give it away just

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.120
to be appreciated, and of course,
you know, industry looks at this

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.560
and say, "What a bunch
of idiots," you know?

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:48.720
And to some extent, musicians
and artists, there was a history

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.580
of feeling like you're-- that
if you are the starving artist,

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.660
there is something-- that's
an incredible story, you know?

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.630
So it's like, wow, they
actually feel more special

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.010
when they're a starving
artist, excellent, you know?

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.310
[ Laughter ]

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.570
You know, let's use them up
and suck them dry, you know?

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:13.940
So this is-- So to me, it's
education and it's very difficult

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.270
to move Congress and, you
know, the Subcommittee

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.360
on Intellectual Property
is very difficult to move

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.670
that when you've got buildings of
lobbyists from Google and YouTube

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.500
and this revolving door between
government and these companies.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.880
But, if the-- if you have the
power of this list of names--

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.220
and we have Carole King,
we have Herbie Hancock,

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.440
we have so many people now, you
know, just a lot of musicians

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.750
and students and everybody.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.880
And if we're all getting
this knowledge

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.340
and we're saying we are
watching you and we do not

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.060
like what you're doing,
suddenly there's a shame factor.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.830
And so sometimes, I think that the
strongest change you can make is

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.500
that, you know?

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.110
And then everything has to change,
you know, rather than mandating it

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.710
through law, but yes,
I would like the law

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.580
to change regarding
the digital rights

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.950
and Safe Harbor Rules
and all these things.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.140
But, you know, you have
to be reasonable, too,

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.110
and we don't know what can change.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.620
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Every time
I hear you speak about this

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:22.080
and others, I wonder who
really owns the music.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.360
We often prefer to believe
that the creators do,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:32.470
the people who actually dream up
or even manufacturer or record

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:36.580
or whatever it might be,
that creative process.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.060
But who really does own the music?

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.470
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Well, I guess it--

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.960
I mean to me, the person
that creates the music,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.130
the copyright holder, the
person who makes the music.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.580
I mean if you-- there
is that other level too

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.100
that you can copyright a recording.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.000
But, you know, the
thing that people forget

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.230
and I think what's
happened is as we've gotten

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.040
from the physical product-- and a
guy, Marshall Gilkes, in my band,

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.990
he just did a panel about this.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.750
And he came up with an incredible
point that I hadn't thought about.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.730
He said, "You know, it
wasn't that long ago

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.800
when Tower Records said
they would wrap those CDs

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.740
in those plastic things that
would beep when you would go out

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.150
and the cop would arrest you
if you stole that, you know?"

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.090
So what is the difference
between that

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.840
and grabbing the file somewhere?

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.950
So, you know, I think people have
come to think that if music is

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.220
out there, that sort of
ephemeral, beautiful thing,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.860
it's all of ours, it's
so easy to access.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.090
But it is an asset.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.120
You know, when you write
that music, the investment.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.010
When I made my last
recording, "Thompson Fields",

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.910
it's a $200,000 recording.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:50.290
Just recording it, you know,
the planning of it, the mixing--

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.050
the editing, the mixing,
the mastering,

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.900
the putting the book
together, it was a full year

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.350
where I couldn't really work
and make money that much

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.140
because I was doing that.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.830
So that $200,000 doesn't
include that I wasn't paid.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.580
Now, we haven't talked
about the years proceeding

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.470
up to it writing all the music.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.670
So we're talking like
a $400,000 investment.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.970
That's an asset.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.010
That's my 401(k), right?

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.310
[ Laughter ]

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.460
So this is like-- you
know, I remember Congress.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.130
I just-- I wanted to look at
them and just say, just imagine--

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.750
because I got to testify
before the Subcommittee

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.050
on Intellectual Property.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:30.400 position:56%
And I didn't get the chance to say
it, but I wanted to say, imagine if,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.880
you know, we build some kind of
app that could go on to your 401(k)

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.170
that was just like, oh
wow, this is so cool.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.240 position:56%
People can just take little snippets
off from Farenthold and this

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.070
and that, you know, just
grab Chaffetz, you know,

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.290
like he's got a lot of money,
let's take some of that, you know,

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.990
oh yeah, share, free for all.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.960
Isn't this fun, isn't this great?

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.870
But then add to it that
the people that are doing

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:53.480
that aren't just taking the money,
they're actually becoming rich

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.200
from it because they're gathering
the information from this thing.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.680
I mean, it's incredible.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.050
So, yeah, no, the musician
owns the music

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.300
if that's what-- that
was your question.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.600
No question.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.640
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And see, I
thought it was the publisher.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.940
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: No.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.240
If you give the publisher--

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.430
If a musician gives the publisher
the rights and then there are,

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:19.160
you know, rights to kind
of administer and there's--

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.720
and some of these publishers,
there's a lot of questions

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.270
with what the publishers can do
because right now there are really,

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:31.130 position:56%
what, a lot of composers consider to
be huge breaches because they have--

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.250
there's these organizations
called PROs

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.630
that are these performing
rights organizations like ASCAP.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.990
Like tonight, you know,
they pay a license here.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.540
So when my music is played in
this hall or if it's on the radio,

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.460
they collect these royalties
from restaurants and everywhere

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.230
and they divvy it out to the
people whose music there are.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:55.490
Well, there's PROs, now suddenly
the publishing companies are making

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.470
these moves to try
to private license

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.690
and take these people
out of their PROs.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.690
And there's a transparency in
the system that's been working.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.400
And the loss of that when the
publishers start taking these--

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.310
you know, overstepping or--

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:16.040
you know, or if an artist gives
away those rights because they feel

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.730 position:56%
that they want that advance or
whatever it is they're getting, boy,

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.150
and you lose that transparency.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:26.120
Now you're settling with a
publisher that says, you know, oh,

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.480
he won't notice that he's not
getting that much royalty,

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.540
she's our new artist and we want
to make her happy, let's put--

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.220
you know, they can kind
of divvy it how they want

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.020
and you don't really know.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:41.760
So, it's a very-- that's why for
me in this business, transparency

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.290
and self-ownership is everything.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.130 position:56%
I wouldn't give my music to anybody.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.640
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And
it's important that there--

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.640
that you have some kind of
consciousness about these issues,

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.830
otherwise you are at their mercy.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.130
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Of course.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.940
And people are starting to wake up.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.390
People are starting to wake up.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.550
I think for a lot of musicians
that have these contracts,

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.770
maybe their contract, you
know, gave a record company

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.900
or a publisher whatever the
right to distribute their music

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:15.900
in different ways and it didn't
specify only by CD or download.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.210
So, all of a sudden, these people--

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.670
you know, I don't know
exactly what the legal

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.780
which that people haven't
had in their contract,

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.450
but I would imagine it
wasn't specific enough.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.540
So, all of a sudden,
these people are like, OK.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.080
Well, you know, so if Sony,
Universal, and Warner have like 80%

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.150
of the world's music or
something close to that

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.340
and they have all these people
that have these contracts

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.060
that didn't have the specific
language that you said, you know,

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.660
it doesn't cover any-- any,
you know, method of copying

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.140
or whatever beyond the
CD and the download.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:54.300 position:56%
OK, all of a sudden now, these
people say, OK, now, we'll give this

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.610
to you Spotify in exchange
for equity.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.590
And these people are
stuck, stuck on something.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.040
The other night we did talk here

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.190 position:56%
and I brought a wonderful young
musician named Spree Wilson with me.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:12.290
This kid has had 45
million streams on Spotify.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.460
And, you know, I don't
know how often they pay

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.990
if it's a quarter or whatever.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.840
He's never had a check
for more than $60

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.540
from them, somewhere from 30 to 60.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:26.810 position:56%
Now, 45 million streams, I'm telling
you, that's big time, you know?

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.020
If I'm paying for $200 record
with my small big band audience,

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.970
we're talking, you know, a
mailing list of like 20,000 people

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.990
and not all of them are buying
and I'm paying for that record,

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.150
you can see what my numbers are.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.040
Then you imagine 45 million.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.950
So, you know, after he talked
to me, he was like, "Wow,

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.920
I think I might want to be doing
what you're doing," you know?

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.580
So, you know, we just have
to change the consciousness.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.880
People have to wake up.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.170
And that's what the
MusicAnswers is about.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.470
It's like, "Hello, guys.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.630
Let's wake up, see
what's happening."

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.560
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So, you're
talking about the context

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.150
for this piece and what sort
of inspired you to write it.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.710
Can you tell us a little bit
about the music itself and how

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:14.700
that animates the argument
or how that summarizes

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.990
or captures your feeling about it?

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.260
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Well,
the music has some beauty

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:24.250
and it has some seduction,
you know, I think, you know?

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:30.120
But it has-- always underneath, the
drums are always moving fast time.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.510
And that never stops.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.740
So it's just this-- well,
all of this is going on,

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.280
there's always the thing here
just grabbing, grabbing, grabbing,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.580
you know, digging, digging.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:42.970
And then I'm doing a thing with
the band where I was imagining--

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:48.850
it's very difficult to write
music, period, let's just say that.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:52.510
But it's also when you
add to it a little bit

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:56.030
of the [inaudible] element and,
you know, the rhythm section

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.470
and the mailability and the
exchange of ideas that can happen,

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.210
it's hard to know exactly where
those things are going to unfold,

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.730
how far they're going to go.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:08.110 position:56%
There's a certain understanding that
comes through performing the music,

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.490
you know, many times
that people start

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:14.620
to realize how far they can
stretch, what risk they can take

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.350 position:56%
and keep the context of the feeling.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.130
So, it takes a while to do that.

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.710
But I was trying to imagine
behind these solos and fathom

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.210
where they might be going
and what that rhythm,

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.630
what the drummer might feel like
if he's playing the fast time.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:36.270
And I decided to create the band
that is composed out of time,

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.950
so I'm conducting everything
free over the time but I have

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.360
to listen really carefully because
I have to count where they are.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.390
So, they're like one, two,
three, one, two, one, two,

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.570
and I'm doing these
"cha-cha-cha-cha-cha."

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:51.010
I have the whole band, I just
gave them like repeated notes.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.760
And then I just look at
them and "cha-cha-cha-cha.",

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.370
cha-cha-cha-- it's kind of fun.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.750
It kind of feels like
[inaudible], you know?

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.200
So, we're-- So it's very gestural

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.980
and I've never done
anything like that.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:10.670
So, it's kind of--
it's unique that way.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.810
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: And we will
hear the first performance tonight.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:16.330
So, will there be an
intermission here

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:17.630
or are you going to do one long--

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:18.930
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: We're
going to do it straight.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.230
We're going to do a
straight 90 minutes

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.740
and we're doing a variety of music.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.540
We're playing-- Luckily this
is a pretty live strong hall,

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.510
so we're playing a couple
of real strong pieces

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:31.680
and then we're playing a lot of
like more-- almost pastoral--

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:37.440 position:56%
a lot of my music from my last album
was very inspired by where I'm from,

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.260
Southwest Minnesota, wide-open
prairie landscape and kind

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.710
of that open-- he was just
saying that I didn't realize

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.860
that the premiere for
Appalachian Spring was here.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.160
When I was a kid--

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.460
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
In that same room?

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.760
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: -- that was
one of those pieces that made me --

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.650
I wore that record white.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:21:00.410 position:56%
And that was one of those records
that made me want to just, you know,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.150
become-- you know, the small
chamber version, you know?

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:06.200
It made me want to
become a composer.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.540
And for one brief period, my
sister knew Aaron Copland's nephew

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.180
or something and I
was like, "Oh, my god,

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.640
maybe I'm going to
meet him someday."

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.230
Anyway, yeah, so you'll
hear some of these pieces

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.190
that are inspired by nature.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.620
I'm a big lover of birds.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.620
Are there any birders
[phonetic] in here?

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.920
Oh, my god.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.860
OK. So, migration's on.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.270
What-- Have you seen any
warblers down here yet?

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.770
They got to be coming soon.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.300
Your trees are green.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.100
They're not quite like
that in New York.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.260
I've seen the phoebes are
coming through up north.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:47.880
Anyway, so, I'm very inspired
by nature and birds and things

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.180
like that, and so that's-- that
balances out the Data Lords.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:57.740
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I love
hearing you mention that recording

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.320
that you were out of
Appalachian Spring.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.620
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.920
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Do you
remember the first record

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.510 position:56%
that you bought with your own money?

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:08.120
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
"Snoopy and the Red Baron".

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.230
[ Laughter ]

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.770
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: By
the Royal Guardsmen.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:13.070
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: It might be.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.370
You know, I'm really not sure.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.760
I'm trying to think if
it's with my own money.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.060
Oh, man.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Because then
you know it's going to be important.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:22.330
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
It might have been--

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:24.330
It might have been "Tapestry".

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.630
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Wow, really?

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.640
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: It
might have been "Tapestry".

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.940
It might have been
the "Fifth Dimension".

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.240
I don't know.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.970
I don't remember at what point.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.620 position:56%
You know, our records, when they
were all sold in the clothing store.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.390
What a great era?

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.990
Have any of you-- We were
talking the other day

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.000
about the Brill Building--

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.300
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.600
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: -- you know,

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.900
where the songwriters
wrote together and--

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.720
there's a wonderful book called
"All was Music in the Air".

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.380
Have any of your read that?

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.520
Great book about, you know,
the song writing collaborators

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.970
that worked in that building.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:07.230
It was just such a great era
of music, you know, to come up.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:12.070 position:56%
And so, I don't know, I can't really
remember at what point I came of age

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.720
to actually pay for my own records.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.020
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: But
you are listening to radio,

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.860
there was music around the house?

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.160
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Records mostly.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:24.130
Records. You know, it's Katie OM
Radio on Wyndham exactly, you know.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:28.470
It's a town of 3,600, you know,
but I listen to a lot of records.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.470
And then I was just
voracious going through music.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.620
My mom had a lot of piano
music around, you know,

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.790
and everything from, you know,

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.620
a classical music she'll
pan everything.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.240
And I just-- And then
a lot of show music.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:50.530
I was really in love with the song,
you know, the "American Songbook",

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:55.660
Cole Porter and Harold Arlen,
and Rogers and Hammerstein.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.220
I just absolutely love that music.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:04.200
And my piano teacher really
thought me to play stride and dress

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.300
up those songs, you know?

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.260
So, she was equally appreciative
of that music as she was

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.240
in making me analyze Beethoven
and play a Beethoven sonata.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.540
So--

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.840
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Is this Evelyn Butler?

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.140
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: This
is Evelyn Butler, yeah.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.440
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.740
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Great, great teacher.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.440
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Yeah, I like
how you described her lesson

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.660
for teaching you about tonality.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.310
And certain scales
or certain chords--

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.610
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.910
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: --

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.210
would represent certain
feelings again in nature.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.510
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Yeah, you know, she--

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.860
the very first lesson with her--

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.210
so this is the woman she had
been stride pianist in Chicago,

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.370
classical pianist,
and really high level.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:44.300
If any of you remember Dorothy
Dunnigan, I compare her to be--

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.570
and they were about the same age
and they were both from Chicago.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.270
So, if you know Dorothy
Dunnigan, that's Mrs. Butler.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.310
That fused kind of play
and just light the room up,

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.650
you know, when she would play.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:58.440 position:56%
And she was very-- I always describe
her, you know, she had red hair,

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.010
she wear [inaudible] but she has
a face of [inaudible] kind of.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.310
[ Laughter ]

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.380
You know, she had like this-- and
kind of magnificent personality.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.580
And my first-- And I was
very attracted with Dorothy

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.770
because I have red hair
too on top of everything.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.240
And the first lesson she--

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.910 position:56%
and I still have all my little music
writing notebooks, which I thought

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.860
of when we went to the
copyright like all the--

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.160
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
The copyright deposits.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.710
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah,
the deposits and things.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.100
But I have all these and all
the beautiful things we have

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.630
in our archive, people's
notes and things.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.420
So I have all the stuff
and I love looking at it.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.000
So she would play a major triad
and then sing, "Bright the day".

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.790
And then minor and
sing, "Dark the night".

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.970
And she said everything
in music is a feeling

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.220
and there's something
behind called theory.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.500
And I want you to understand why
the music you play feels the way

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.800
it feels.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.280
And you're going to analyze
everything you play so we're going

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.070 position:56%
to have this music writing
notebook and she started teaching me

00:25:55.070 --> 00:26:00.430
about one, four, five, one, which
is the basis of tonal harmony

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.380
that pieces start somewhere.

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.940
They go away.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.130
They culminate and feel like
they got to go back home.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:11.680
And so her thing for the one,
four, five, four was, "Here we go,

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.660
up the hill, back again home".

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.270
"Home" is tonic.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.400
"Up the hill" is subdominant.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.600
Dominant is-- And you
know, this is a woman

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.890
who was a professional musician.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.670
I don't know to what
degree she studied pedagogy,

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.490
but I know something,
I don't know anybody

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.900
that ever had a childhood
piano teacher like that.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.370
And the only reason she ended
up in Wyndham was her husband

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.060
and she had a daughter
and a son and a husband.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.020
Her husband, his name was
Ken Butler and he had been

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.550
with the Miller Band for a while.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.720
And he fell in love with her.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.410
She always says because she
had been married and divorced

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.190
and she said her first
husband was lazy and horrible.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.440
And she said she was in a bar
one night and Ken walked in

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.380
and she said she plays like a
man, I'm going to marry her.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:03.220
So, anyway, he died and her son
both died in like within a month.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.590
It was a really short period.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.060
And her only living
family was his daughter

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.350
that had married a
chiropractor in Wyndham.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:14.360
So, this woman who would never end
up in this little farm town did.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:21.580
And so, you know, to my--
you know, I don't want to say

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.570
in a great fortune because it was
such a deep misfortune for her,

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:29.000
but it's an extraordinary thing
that I got to rush with that lady

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.310
and I will always appreciate that.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:35.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Now, clearly
she thought you about playing piano.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.700
Did you ever gig as a
professional pianist?

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.000
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Very little.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.300
Very little.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.600
A few little gigs here.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.930
And, you know, I never had-- she
has such extraordinary technique.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.570
And in Wyndham, everybody
thought I was amazing, you know,

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:55.370
but I knew I wasn't and I had
a special painful realization.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.620
There was a farm family in--

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.590
outside of Wyndham that
had a relatives coming

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.300
to town and they invited us.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.660
I've never been to their house,
but they're very wealthy.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.600
And we went to this Christmas party

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.180
and they had a Steinway
in their house.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.080
I was like, "Holy smokes."

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.090
And this family came from
the east, they're relatives

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:17.260
and this girl has just won
some Mozart competition.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:22.500
So, after dinner, she sat down and
played her Mozart concierto and--

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.490
I mean, her runs were
flawless and I was just--

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:29.350
I remember just sitting there just
thinking I can kiss music goodbye.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.570
I will never-- I will never
have that in my hands.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:36.500
I just-- And with Mrs. Butler, too,
I knew I could feel my potential

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.410
for technique and I
knew I didn't have it.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.090
I knew I love playing.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.560
I knew I have music in me.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.280
I dreamt of being a
composer but I felt

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.160
like it was way too lofty
of a goal, you know?

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:52.930
I couldn't go to college and say
I want to be a composer, you know?

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.340
Actually it took until
somebody said to me, "Hey,

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.510
you seem to have some
talent for composing."

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.920
Then it was like, "Oh, OK."

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.780
You know? I was always, you
know, waiting for the validation.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.370
You know, I would-- I never
proceeded with confidence.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:10.910
He said the other day, "You seemed
like you're very confident."

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.210
I was not at all.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:18.300
I was very scared and
apologetic and, yeah.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.600
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
I have, of course,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.680
have many questions I
would love to ask Maria.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.410
But I want to give you a chance.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:28.860
If anybody out there has something
gnawing at them who are just dying

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.760
to know, here's your chance.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.060
Here's a question.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.980
Hold on. There's a
microphone right there.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:41.660
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about your year
with Gill Adams and what happens.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:47.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I got to work-- So I
love Gill Adams so much and he was--

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:52.770 position:56%
I would say, he was more responsible
probably for anybody, for me,

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:57.550 position:56%
doing this along with Bob Brookmeyer
and others who I love, you know,

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.850
Dan Jones [assumed spelling],

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.150
Newt Galington [assumed
spelling] and whatever.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.580
But there was something about
Gill's music being such--

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.410
because I told you, I grew up
loving these different kinds

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.710
of music equally.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:08.870
And Gill's music, it wasn't some

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.790
of the third stream music
I always felt a little bit

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.410
like it locked like this.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:19.560
Gill's music mixed idioms like
it was just water, you know?

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.720
And I love that you
could feel those lines.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.490
And so it was dream
to study with him.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.560
And I wanted to and in
college I wanted to apply

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.830
for a national endowment
grant study with him.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.540
And then, one of my
teachers said "Oh, you know,

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.010
he smokes pot all the time."

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.310
[ Laughter ]

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.660
He has a [inaudible], he is
the recluse and that's just--

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.280
you know, put that dream away.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.220
And still, I tried to call.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.870
It was amazing back then calling an
operator on a dial phone and then,

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.670
"Gil Evans, 212, you
know, 555-1212."

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.430
And they gave me his number and I
got a message machine that's said,

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:58.270
"If you wish to speak to
Gil, speak after the beep."

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.320
And I got so freaked
out I hung it up.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.100
And then, by chance I'll tell you--

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.960
and I'll tell you how
I ended up meeting Gil.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.160
But what was funny is that-- and
that wasn't Miles Davis speaking,

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:13.550
it was his son whose name is
Miles who kind of talk like that

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.320
or something, I don't try to.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.400
Anyway, the way I met
Gil I was working at--

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.860
I was working at a Xerox
machine in a music copy office.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:27.580
I made my living as a calligraphy,
pen and ink, inkwell pen,

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.010
copying parts for composers
in an office in New York

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.290
for eight years, pretty full time.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:38.020
And one day I was Xeroxing a score
for a composer and we got talking

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:42.420
and he was asking me about who
I loved and I was telling him

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:47.750
about Gil Evans and he was telling
me about things he was into.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.050
And we exchanged numbers.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.480
He was a composer who
knew people that I know

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.570 position:56%
and had gone up to Eastman recently.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.690
And he had this big dense score.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.990
It looked very interesting.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.290
His name is Tom Pearson.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.590
He was in Japan now.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:03.350
And then he called me that night
and he said I didn't tell you today

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.770
that Gil happens to be
like my closest friend.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.290
And I told him about you
and he wants to meet you.

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.670
He needs somebody to assist him.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.670
So then I got this chance to
work with him and it really--

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:18.170
Spree Wilson was asking me, too,
on the train coming back yesterday

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.470
after the advocacy thing.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.770
He said, "What was it
like to work with Gil?"

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.070
And I said, pretty much like
working with Yoda, you know?

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.440
[ Laughter ]

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.460
It was just like-- It was
like being with this--

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.270
you know, this wise
old soul, you know?

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:39.220
And he did everything so in his
own very unique way, you know,

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:43.660 position:56%
with his own perspective, breaking
the-- breaking rules to find things,

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.520
making instruments play on
their most uncomfortable range,

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:51.020
kind of like the beginning
of Rite of Spring, you know?

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.860
You know, you got the
bassoon playing this--

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.240
that's bringing out
the stride quality.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:01.460
Gil was always playing with those
kinds of things that you don't--

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:06.690
those are the things that
make you have a voice

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.220
and that your music
just embodies you.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.590
And so, being around
that long enough

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.170
and then also studying then
I got the endowment grant.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:20.290 position:56%
I study with Bob Brookmeyer who was
a whole another world equally strong

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:24.260
in another realm, mainly
formal development.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.670
And between being with
these two forces,

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.230
it really at a certain point I was
like I have to start my own band

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.650
because this is-- these
people are so strong

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:35.370
and I realize what they are.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:38.290
They are just so committed
to their own ideas,

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.420
and I have to find my own ideas
and become committed to them,

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.130
that's what I need to do
if I want to have a voice.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.480
And so, they were very
helpful with that.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.290
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Who
else has a question?

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:53.070
Over here, Jay.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:59.090
&gt;&gt; Actually, [inaudible] so
I'm going suggest you become

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:04.910
like a little mini data lord and
exploit the I stuff so that--

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.340
&gt;&gt; Use the mic, please.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.640
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.940
So when these tickets go on sale,

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.610
maybe like five days before
something, you send everybody

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.820
that lives in this area little
blaster that says, "Hey,"

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:20.320
so that some of us who [inaudible]
to Manhattan in November to see you

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.250
at the jazz standard get a shot

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:25.330
at getting tickets here
not like wait until--

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah, the last--

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:27.930
&gt;&gt; That night when
you see on the Library

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:29.230
of Congress thing and
they're all gone.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:30.530
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:31.830
&gt;&gt; So--

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.130
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:34.430
&gt;&gt; -- just a suggestion.

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:35.730
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah,
these tickets went fast, right?

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.330
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Did
you not get a ticket?

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:39.630
You didn't get one?

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.930
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
But he'll get it.

00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:42.230
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Oh.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.530
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: He'll get in.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:44.830
Everybody here will get in.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.130
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Oh,
you're going to get in?

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.430
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:48.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.030
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: OK.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.330
OK, good.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:52.630
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Who
else has a question?

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.930
Over here.

00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:55.230
Over against the wall.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.530
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Can I work out there?

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:57.830
&gt;&gt; Who do you listen to now?

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.580
Who do you enjoy listening
to in terms of music?

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.880
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Oh, wow.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.180
You know what?

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.290
It's such variety and I've gone
through so many periods but one

00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:09.730
of my favorite things to
listen to is Brazilian music.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.600
I love Egberto Gismonti.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.400
He's another one where it's
like, you know, it's classical.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.890
It's Brazilian folk.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.200
It's like all these things
kind of mix together.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.220
I have years where it
was flamenco music.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.840
And then sometimes it's--
sometimes it's vocalist,

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.420
like recently just listening
to Shirley Horn just--

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.440
OK, Washington DC, Shirley
Horn, I hear you all.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.540
I mean Shirley Horn--
I mean thank God I got

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:40.760
to see her sing several times
and experience her sense of time

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.340
on the piano and just
a deep expression.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.270
And the way she would just
lay back in the communication

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.050
of that trio she worked with
that just like followed her.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:57.120 position:56%
And I-- you know, so anything that's
just felt so deep from the heart,

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.950
you know, I love and follow.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:04.910
I suffer from one little thing in
my life and that is that I have--

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.060
this is not going sound
nice but I'm going to try

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.520
to make it sound just right.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.690 position:56%
I have so many people send me music.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:15.320
And I have this feeling
sometimes that--

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.460
this obligation, because
every time--

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.860
every once in a while
you listen to something

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.810
and it's truly extraordinary.

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.230
And I feel bad not
listening to people's music

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:26.190
but it becomes-- it's too much.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:30.300 position:56%
It's so easy to record-- and I won't
say it's easy to record but it's

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.800
so many people are recording
and trying to get stuff

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.460
out there amidst all
these content, you know?

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.630
Everybody is trying to
find their way to the top.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.510 position:56%
So it's just like gorging, you know?

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:45.650
And so I get so much stuff that
sometimes I do want to just

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:48.470
like put it away and say,
"Wait, I want to just figure

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.910
out what I want to hear," you know?

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:55.160
My life isn't an obligation of
email and the CDs that I get

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.460
and all these things encroaching
on me, leading me until--

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:03.440
you know, closing in on
me but I want to find--

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.810
you know, just go on my discovery.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.070
So, one of my things,
I'm kind of excited

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:12.340
about when I finish this tour,
I'm going to have some space

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:17.870 position:56%
and I need my field to go fallow for
a while, you know, and taken music

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:21.390
and go to concerts-- and go to
concerts the way I used to go

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.380
to concerts like walk by
Lincoln Center and see

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.680
that picture of [inaudible].

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.950
See, I don't know who that
is but it looks interesting,

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:29.470
I'm going to buy a ticket.

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:30.770
And it changed my life.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.440
You know, that kind of
Ouija board, fill it out.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.740
Go in the paper.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.170
You know, I'm going to
go to that museum today.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.010
I don't know what's
going to happen there.

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:39.310
I need that my life again.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:44.160
I used to live that way and
responsibility and obligation,

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.780
it pulls you away from that.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.090
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Who
else has a question?

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:49.390
Right here.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.470
Yes sir.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.400
&gt;&gt; Your last [inaudible]
right into my question.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.430
We're all really fortunate
to hear the premier tonight.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.680
But can you share what's
kind on the drawing board?

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.270
What's your future of
next project might be

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:04.570
or what you're thinking about?

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:08.700
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: I have
never been want to plan.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:13.090
I've always been want to just kind
of be there and see what comes.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.490
Even when I write, I don't
say, OK, I'm going to write

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:16.790
for the Library of Congress.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.270
I want to do something
about you know big data.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:20.980
You know, it's never like that.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:25.050
It's sort of-- In a way,
well, I am glad I've done

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.360
that because I would have
never imagined really--

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.250
I mean, I did try to call Gil
Evans but I didn't meet him

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:31.970
because I tried to call him.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.400
I would have never
thought of working

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.080
with David Bowie in
a thousand years.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.180
And I had that just a
little bit space in my life

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.970
that allowed that to come.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:43.230
But that being said, there is one
thing I dream of doing that's going

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.840
to surprise-- I don't know
if we talked about this.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.630
It's a crazy thing.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:51.380
But it involves finding
the right collaborator.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.060
Someday I want to write a show.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.810
Isn't that crazy?

00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:00.860
But I do. And you know what did
it to me, I saw light on a piazza.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.070
Did any of you see that production?

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:04.850
Raise your hand if you saw it.

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:07.160
I was so moved and
it was so beautiful.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.300
And I just said, "Yeah,
I want to write a show."

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.680
Because I wrote songs
for Dawn Upshaw,

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.960
and the experience
of writing for words.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.100
At first I was scared
because I thought, oh my God.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.650
You know, it's already hard
enough just to write notes.

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:24.080
Now, I got to figure out I
wasn't writing the words.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.540 position:56%
I was using the poetry of Ted Cruz
but now I got figure out how to make

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.690
that fit in the context and all of
this, and there's another layer.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:32.140
But it wasn't like that.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:36.010
It was liberating because I love
the words and I love the sentiment.

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:41.560
And then that gave me the
impetus to-- it led me.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.860
It led me.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:47.790
Instead of me always having to
go into this blank space of any--

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:52.450
of infinity, suddenly there's this
little beacon that says here I am.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:55.600
I nurture-- you know, make me,

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.780
make me come alive and
sound or something.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.150
So, if I could find the right
story, the right collaborator,

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:02.450
that would be a dream of mine.

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.320
That's like the only-- otherwise,

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.490
I just want to keep developing
the sound with the band

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:11.300
and see what comes, you know?

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.090
Improvising life.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.390
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: I actually
think we have only time

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:17.690
for one last question.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.510
And if you don't mind
I'm going to take it.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.140
[ Laughter ]

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:27.060
Yes. Is recognition
important to you?

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.370
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: It never
really-- you know what?

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:32.900
When I started this--
That's really good question.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.260
When I started out, I never--

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.220
I thought I would be a music
copyist probably forever

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.450 position:56%
and just have my band and, you know.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:46.860 position:56%
And I just kind of expected that and
then I thought I could also waitress

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:49.810
because I stopped waitressing
in Minnesota.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.310 position:56%
And I was a terrible waitress but I
figured that I could get it together

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:55.250
to be a New York waitress
if I needed to.

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:58.770
And so, I never expected
any of this.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:03.390
So, I would say it's fun because
it's fun to share my music.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.360
And yeah, it's really fun
to win a Grammy Award.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.240
I discovered that.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.530
And maybe it was because I remember

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:14.660
when I was kid once giving a Grammy
speech in my living room privately.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:15.960
So--

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:17.260
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum:
Into your hairbrush?

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.560
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah,
something like that, you know?

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.770
Just standing up on a stool
and I'd like to think.

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:26.010
But I did-- I pretended I was
Ms. America once, too, you know?

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:29.200
So we all did these things.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.510
But it's-- as a musician it is
really great to be appreciated.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:36.310
I will say that, absolutely.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:39.710
Did I count on it and
do it for this, no.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.090
I expected very little, actually.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.790
So, it's just I've been very lucky.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.150
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: Well, I hope
you can appreciate how many people

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:50.390
on this room feel that
way about you.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.690
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Oh, thank you.

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:52.990
&gt;&gt; Larry Appelbaum: So,
thank you all for coming.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:55.290
Thank you, Maria.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:05.980
