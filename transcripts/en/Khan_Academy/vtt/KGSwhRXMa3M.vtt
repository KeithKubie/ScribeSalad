00:00:01.644 --> 00:00:04.367
- [Voiceover] This question
says, Vera's dinner plate

00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:07.950
is divided into three
equal-sized sections.

00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:12.170
Vera puts all her broccoli in one section.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.000
And then we're asked, what fraction

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.140
of Vera's plate has broccoli?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.973
Okay.

00:00:18.973 --> 00:00:23.879
So we have we plate with
three equal-sized sections,

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.938
and we know that Vera puts
broccoli in one section,

00:00:27.938 --> 00:00:30.168
and we're asked to
figure out what fraction

00:00:30.168 --> 00:00:32.490
of the plate that is.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.030
So we can draw Vera's plate,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.712
try to represent this with a picture.

00:00:36.712 --> 00:00:39.525
Maybe Vera's plate is a rectangle.

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:43.733
We don't really know,
but a rectangle will work

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.313
as long as it has three
equal-sized sections.

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:48.480
So let's try to draw that.

00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:51.406
This may not be perfect.

00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:54.450
We can probably do that
second one a little better,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.712
but this should represent
three equal-sized sections

00:00:57.712 --> 00:00:59.106
on a plate.

00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:01.130
And then we know she puts broccoli in one

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.876
of those sections, so let's
use green, draw some broccoli.

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:07.260
Broccoli, broccoli, broccoli.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.427
And then, look at this
picture, and ask ourselves,

00:01:12.578 --> 00:01:16.571
what fraction of Vera's
plate has broccoli?

00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.919
Well, our fraction's
gonna have a numerator.

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:23.085
On top will be how many
sections have broccoli,

00:01:23.085 --> 00:01:27.090
which is one, and then,
our denominator will be

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.348
out of the total number of equal sections,

00:01:30.348 --> 00:01:34.777
and we know there are
three equal-sized sections.

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:38.944
So 1/3 or one of the three
sections has broccoli.
