1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.400
Ihara and we're live dumped,
dumped 'em Brynn charm.

2
00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:08.850
I got to talk to you about marijuana and exercise together as a group.
Really.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.360
I am a huge fan today.
I did something I haven't done a long time.

4
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:13.980
I haven't been getting high and working out.

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.960
I got high and did yoga like a couple of weeks ago and I fucking loved it.

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.330
It was a 90 minute class and it went.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.710
I thought I was abducted by aliens and I lost time aliens,

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.340
not aliens and SPANDEX.
The place I go to is not done well.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.300
They're very nice people.
I'll just say that.
But when I was um,

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.390
when I was in the cloud,
usually the class like 90 minutes,
it's rough.

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.370
Especially if those last 20,
you've got to grind,
you've got to stay focused.

12
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:45.270
Mentally tough,
mentally challenged,
like bullshit,
like you know,
like oh come on.

13
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:48.780
And he's housewives are tough.
Yeah,
I've been through some shit.

14
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.300
I've been through some shit with football and fighting and a 90 minute class,

15
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.290
what?
I didn't know it was 90 minutes,
I thought was 60.
I was like,
damn,

16
00:00:58.291 --> 00:01:02.400
not to freak out.
I didn't have water.
I have water.
Oh No,

17
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:05.010
super gangster.
I was like 16 minutes.
I'm cool with water.

18
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.950
Then it gets to that hour mark and I looked over the grill nick too.
I'm like,

19
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.750
we're supposed to wrap soon.
She goes,
oh no honey,
it's,
it's 90 minutes.

20
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.690
You should have seen.
I wish I had my face on camera.
I was like,
God,

21
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.190
how did you do it without wanting to break?
I'm about to break.

22
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.650
You need to try that Wim Hoff method.

23
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.160
That dude didn't even do like a marathon in the middle of the desert in Africa

24
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:29.250
or something like that.
No water.
Yeah,
there's an animal.

25
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.940
Me Making it through yoga.
No larger than saying it's him.
I'm telling you man,

26
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm telling you bro.
I was about to break.
I was like,
damn,
he's house.
Mom's ready.

27
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.010
We'll get this bitch.

28
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.310
There was something about doing it high where it was easier and I don't

29
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:42.510
necessarily know if that's good.

30
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.950
So I think that like sometimes like those mental struggles that's good for the

31
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:51.690
mind.
Tigers deals up the mind and the weed man,
like almost easy,
easier,

32
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:53.310
way easier.
Like to the point where I was like,

33
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:57.390
that was an hour and a half like I never do that when I'm sober.
Ever,
ever.

34
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.380
You're kind of freaking out towards the end.
Not freaking out,

35
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.040
but you're just like dangerous grind in like just what I try to do towards the

36
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:05.874
end of yoga class.

37
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.060
We sound like the biggest pussies that have ever walked the face of the earth.

38
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.130
You know when yoga gets hard,
hey,
whatever bro.
Fucking love that shit.
Look,

39
00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.600
you'll get heartbroken.
The fucking talk.
I toughened up bro.

40
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.340
I got mental toughness.
I'm doing chatter,

41
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:25.341
Ranga and shoot for real until I don't feel cluck 90 minute yoga will fuck you

42
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.570
up.
It will fuck you up,
but what I,

43
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:30.210
I'm I do is I just try to concentrate on my breathing.
That's it.

44
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.700
It's constantly on my breathing and don't,
I don't let anything in.

45
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.570
I don't let any complaints and I don't let any,
I'm tired in,
I just won't.

46
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:37.440
I know it's there,

47
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.970
but I just just bear down and really focus on breathing and bear down and focus

48
00:02:41.971 --> 00:02:44.940
on whatever I'm trying to do physically,
whatever the posture is.
Dude,

49
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:47.690
for me it was a lot.
My Mom,

50
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.520
I'm working so much and I'll care about his work and so I think about all the

51
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:54.930
time,
but when I go to yoga,
it's so hard.
It takes my mind off what's going on.

52
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.720
Yeah,
it's like a reset button,
but it is a mother fucker.

53
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.400
I feel the exact same way.
It does something.

54
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.880
There's something about holding poses and the difficulty and the focus that it

55
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.480
requires to do it.
Ryan,
it sort of erases your mind.
It cleans your mind out.

56
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.480
It's almost like a car wash for your brain was like a little reset.

57
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.930
Then it helps later in the day.
Oh yeah.

58
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.890
It helps you like you so much less.
Um,
I want to say reactive,

59
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:18.850
but you,

60
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.410
you're more relaxed when it comes to like outcomes of things and more relaxed

61
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:26.620
when it comes to interactions with people.
It makes me,
I swear to God,

62
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:30.910
I think it makes you a nicer person.
It opens you up more open minded.

63
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.250
I think it,
um,
you know,

64
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:36.910
I've been going for about three weeks now in Santa Monica when I first got
there.

65
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.040
I'm literally no one talked to me.
They're like,

66
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:43.570
look at this fucking meat head in here.
No one talked to me.
I was in the back.

67
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.613
I'd come out,

68
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.850
they'd have like their little groups and I'd just be on my own like prejudice.

69
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.550
Dammit.
I know.
Man.
Bruxism this real,

70
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.810
it's not racism or race of men.
Waste of race of real men.
That's what it is.

71
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:57.860
They're racist against real men.
They're my friend.

72
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.190
Human Rights on I'm over now though.
They're cool.
You want them over?
I what's up?

73
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.490
Yeah.
That kind of show.
Yeah.
Eventually you're gonna get a tea together.
Yeah.

74
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.490
Yeah.
You never know.
There's a place that I uh,

75
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.500
passed by in Santa Monica that has some yoga class,

76
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.610
but it's like a factory that produces hot chicks with towels under their arm.

77
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:20.800
Like,
what was I talking about?
Mental toughness.

78
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.570
Try not pop in a bone in my yoga track class.
Straight up.
I get in there,

79
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:30.420
I'm like,
God damn.
The teacher goes,
eyes forward,
gaze forward.
So it got,

80
00:04:30.421 --> 00:04:34.130
she tells you that.
Oh,
the club to everyone gaze forward.
Wow.

81
00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:36.040
They catch people staring at assets.
I'm sure.

82
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.240
I'm sure that's distracting as fuck you.

83
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.780
If you're in your pose and some dude is staring at your crack.

84
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.490
I bet that's annoying.
If I was a chick,
I get it mixed.
It is dark in there.

85
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.890
Unless that's what I'm in into.
Some girls are into that.

86
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.070
I don't pretend they don't like it.
I hate it when people look,
you know,

87
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:55.150
it's weird.
It gives,
yeah.
God Damn it.
How dare you.
I hate it.

88
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.470
Your ass cheeks are hanging out the back doing downward dog.
Um,
but the,
the,

89
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.900
some of the dudes in the,
you know,
God bless them,

90
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.740
they're not in great shape and they just say fuck it during basically assumed to

91
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.540
gut out.
That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

92
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.440
This is guide that goes to my class and I admire him.

93
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.070
He's this old fat white guy and he has,

94
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.710
it looks like probably never done a sport in his life.

95
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:19.270
He might not have even ever used the stairs.

96
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.150
He might've just used elevators his whole life.
I mean,

97
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:24.970
he looks like he's never even thought about exercise.

98
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.650
Like nobody informed him what it was.

99
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.210
He just got behind a desk and started eating.
Then he hit like 60,

100
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.030
and I don't know what,
you know,
what motivated him?

101
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:37.590
I've never had a conversation with them,
but this dude is in there grinding,

102
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.760
grinding dirt off shirt,
off Bandana.
He wears a white Bandana.

103
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:47.410
Like the karate kid fucked up full gray,
balding,
you know,

104
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:48.970
the whole deal.
It's like the whole,

105
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.710
the hair is chaos and giant got and gray hair all over his stomach and his tits.

106
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.980
But he's in there.
He's in there grinding that fucking guys in there grinding.
You

107
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 1>know,
I appreciate the hustle man.
He can't do it.
If he stumbles,</v>

108
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:06.350
gets right back up.
Try that again.
Gets to the position,
holds it,
stumbles,

109
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:10.130
gets right back up again.
Way Too vain to do any of that.

110
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.170
I hold the position like a mother fucker.
Like if I fall,
everyone's medical,

111
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.190
look at this asshole I stick with it is levels for sure of of like commitment to

112
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:23.840
a position.
Right?
For sure.
And that's the difference you see in people.

113
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:28.310
Like there's this one girl in the class that I go to,
she's Indian and a,

114
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:32.380
I think she's Indian.
She looks like she's Indian.
[inaudible]

115
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.980
talking to people from the country.
India.
Oh,

116
00:06:34.981 --> 00:06:37.760
not native American because I am politically correct.

117
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.520
I don't think they like to be defined that way.

118
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.020
I think they like dollar men day Indian.
Okay.
You know dollar man days.
No,

119
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.030
no you don't.
Oh my God.
To pull up the song tunic,
tunic tune.

120
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.920
This guy,
there's a dude named dollar Monday.
Okay.

121
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:02.921
And he's like this Indian pop star guy and he's got at least one song.

122
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:06.560
I tried to listen to his other songs.
Dog couldn't get into my bed,

123
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.440
but he's got one song that was one of my all time favorites.

124
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.590
I don't know what the fuck big over here.
It's just got to pull up the video.

125
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.710
Pull up the video and show it to Brendan on this screen right here.

126
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.190
The one over here so we don't get kicked off of Youtube.
I hope he's awesome.

127
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.630
Oh my God.
Is he awesome dude,
you're not even believe this is a real dude.
Really?

128
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:24.464
You got to like the song.

129
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.070
I used to play this song when I worked at fear factor hold.

130
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:31.340
Let's start from the beginning.
Yes.

131
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.430
Don't know the music and I'm right there and then give me some volume.

132
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:35.623
Here we go.

133
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.570
<v 0>Look at the shitty graphics.</v>

134
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.130
Terrible asteroids are coming in here looking at this.

135
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.680
It's like fucking are tare.

136
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.570
Look at this dude.
Check this out.
You took the audio off.

137
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.860
Do you think there will close for this?
Yeah.
You take a

138
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.850
look at this guy.
Oh Shit.

139
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.220
Tell me is is to have him,

140
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.020
him and him in the video.
He's like,
you know what we need,

141
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.670
we need more of me.
I mean he's dressed in traditional Indian.

142
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.810
What looks like a magician's garb.
Oh,

143
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:27.950
this is full fucking at gladden up in this bill.
I often

144
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.890
get,
you know what I like about it?
I have no idea what he's saying.

145
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:39.260
So it's like music that you make with your mouth.
It says other songs.

146
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:43.550
Just dog shit.
I just couldn't get into them.
Maybe someone needs this.

147
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:48.140
Turn me into the right one.
I'm sure you have some other hits over there.

148
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.340
<v 1>Gangnam style.
That one?
Yeah,
he came out with another one though.
Is it a hit?</v>

149
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.600
It's pretty big.
Hit called my daddy or something.
I got it from my daddy.
Oh,
okay.

150
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:01.800
Well people,
you fucking haters out there.
One hit wonder my ass.

151
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.780
You know Howard stern was saying that once I was listened to him and he's

152
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:06.000
talking about that guy saying what's it going to do now?

153
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.850
It's like it's over for him.
I'm like,
how?
Why would you send them both?

154
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.430
This is the other thing,
like maybe,
maybe it's over,

155
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.460
but why it's the guy can do it once.
Why can't,

156
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:17.910
like what is it that makes a fucking one hit wonder?

157
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:20.730
What is it like why does someone become a one hit wonder?

158
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.720
Like what if you could put together like a bang and song?

159
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:26.790
Like there's a series of one hit wonders.

160
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.580
Like if you go to websites like the best ever one hit wonders.

161
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.360
But if you could put together like one of those unbelievable banging songs,

162
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.210
why can't you put together another one?
I don't get it.

163
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.870
Do you think fame fucks them up?
Like the struggle?
Uh Huh.

164
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.600
Definitely a lot of things.
Definitely.
That's,
that's,

165
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.850
but that's one ingredient in a giant poisonous stu.
A huge ingredient.
Yeah,

166
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.330
it's a big one.
Huge one.
It's also who wrote that song?

167
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.800
Like what kind of collaboration,
you know,
did the person who write that song,

168
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.400
did they write the rest of the songs?
True.
But a lot of times too,

169
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:03.840
like when a band gets big and they have like maybe one hit or one album and
then,

170
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.490
you know,
fame comes,
the tour comes,
they're busy.
Uh,

171
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.960
some guys feels like he needs more notoriety.
Drugs kick into play.

172
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.770
Drugs is a big one.
Man.
Drugs,
especially the downers,

173
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.750
heroin and stuff and booze kinds of just booze every night,
uh,

174
00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:24.600
just slowly pulls away.
It's also,
it's just,

175
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.650
it gets to a point where I think they are,
they're overwhelmed.
You know,

176
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:32.070
if you are a rock star and you're on stage and you're singing songs,

177
00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:36.210
there's 25,000 people out there and they're all screaming,
you would be over.

178
00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:39.390
It's over.
It's probably overwhelming.
Could there be a better job though?

179
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.490
What Tommy,
you don't have to train that much.
You know what I'm saying?

180
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:48.210
Why don't get,
don't get me wrong.
Don't get me wrong.

181
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:51.390
You've got to practice.
But we're talking about practice.

182
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:54.240
You know what I'm saying?
We're talking about practice.
They practice.
Man.

183
00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:57.060
You ever seen,
you ever go to band practice and watch those guys go over songs?

184
00:10:57.061 --> 00:11:01.470
Sure.
Hats,
way harder than being a comedian.
No,
I get that anymore.

185
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.080
Compared to being an athlete,
like,
uh,

186
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.970
like look at if Jz one have tits down to his ankles and eat hamburgers all day,

187
00:11:08.971 --> 00:11:12.750
he could do it and still make great music like the disciplines may be,

188
00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:15.120
but you can't.
Here's the thing about being a fat fuck.

189
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.500
You can get famous being a fat fuck and people will love you as a fat fuck like

190
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:20.250
Biggie,

191
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.780
but you can't start out like snoop Dogg and den look like big and blow up.

192
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.220
You can't do that then you're a loser.
Okay.
You know what I'm saying?

193
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:29.881
I see what you're saying.

194
00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:32.890
We can't have evidence that you used to be healthy and then you're on.

195
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.680
You can't celebrate that.
That's what it does.
There's rules,

196
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.120
there's rules,
perception.

197
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.640
You know the guy who doesn't give a fuck is never given a fuck.

198
00:11:41.641 --> 00:11:45.300
That's why he's always been fat.
Big.
He's always been fat.
Seen.
When he was 17,

199
00:11:45.301 --> 00:11:48.090
he was rapping on the corner.
This fat guy,
he's a thick.
Yeah,

200
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.770
he's never watched what he ate.
Not a day,
not a moment in his life.
True.

201
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.250
Did he go,
I shouldn't,
I shouldn't eat that.
That's his thing.

202
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.310
<v 0>That's him.
That's him.
But if you look like Tupac,</v>

203
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.350
all six packed out and then you became like biggie.
No,
but what,

204
00:12:01.351 --> 00:12:05.380
what other job?
And I think this is why I'm obsessed with musicians.
It's a,

205
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:08.950
it's something,
it's so,
uh,
it's something I don't understand.

206
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:11.920
It's the unknown to me.
Right,
right.
Any,
any athletic endeavor,

207
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:13.450
whatever I get at hard work talent,

208
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.910
but musicians to me it's so in this kind of outer space world,
cause I've,

209
00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:20.560
I've never been musically gifted ever.
You know what I'm saying?

210
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:24.730
I don't get any of it.
So when I watched them,
what other job can you like?

211
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:27.730
You see like Amy Winehouse,
and these are terrible examples,

212
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:31.660
but Kurt Cobain just fucked up,
get on stage and just kill it.

213
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.660
You know what I'm saying?
Well,
they've been doing it so long though.

214
00:12:34.661 --> 00:12:37.870
It's like a part of their memory.
You know,
they just know how to do it.

215
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.170
They just know how to do those songs and they get in there and they get in the

216
00:12:41.171 --> 00:12:43.360
groove and the music hits them and they just go with it.

217
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.740
And I think that Harrell Wall heroin,
that heroin,

218
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.880
I think that stuff has some magical properties when it comes to music.

219
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.320
I don't recommend doing it.

220
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.600
And I don't think that's the only way to make great music.

221
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.150
I think it was probably some safer,

222
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.430
safer alternatives that also get you to a great place.

223
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.110
But there's so many people that did heroin that made insane music.
Man.

224
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.170
That's so many tons.
How many and what Amy Winehouse,

225
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:11.410
apparently it was booze was the one that killed her.
Boobs was big.

226
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:14.280
Did you see her documentary,
Amy?
Man,
that's true.
That's awesome.

227
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.820
That shit is amazing.
I heard it's amazing.
That's a real bummer man.
Super Bummer.

228
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:23.300
Cause she finally kind of gets sober.
I mean this isn't a fucking spoiler alert.

229
00:13:23.301 --> 00:13:24.670
She,
everyone knows she's dead,

230
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.990
but she finally gets a sober and she's kind of doing right the right things.

231
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.890
And then her manager and dad are like,
Yo,
unique.
Go back on tour.
And she's like,

232
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:36.100
I'm telling you this is a bad idea man.
Cause when I'm tours,
when I want to use,

233
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:39.310
cause I hate me in a way and they put on tour and that's why I did it.
So they,

234
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.800
did they say she needed to go on tour because she needed money?

235
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:44.050
Is that what it was?
No,
she just had prior commitments.

236
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.450
They're like you owe it to him and that's when she goes on.

237
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.670
I think it's Germany where she's just so fucked up,

238
00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:51.590
falls off state and she like forgets the word and they start booing her,

239
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.960
you know,
self sabotage.
Yeah.
It was horrible man.
It's so tough to watch.
We know.

240
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:56.794
It's interesting.

241
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.670
We had Steve O on the podcast and Steve o went through a pretty lengthy

242
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:05.080
detoxification sort of thing.
You know,
he,
he got,

243
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.660
he got sober and then he went through this like lengthy rehab and like at a live

244
00:14:09.661 --> 00:14:14.661
in place and you know he went into great detail about it and about how long it

245
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:18.700
took him until he was like legitimately sober,
like confident,

246
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.400
had a good foundation.
He was like legitimately sober.

247
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.430
And now he tours and does all these kinds of things,
which is crazy.

248
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:28.540
Still does that sober.
Yeah.
Like to inflict that pain when he's dead sober now.

249
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:32.860
To me,
he's crazy.
He's out of his mind.
He's definitely out of his mind,
but he,

250
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.110
when he's doing all this,
you know,
he's,

251
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.450
he's like confident that he's not going to start using again.

252
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.650
I think when you're like someone like Amy and you're just clear of it and then

253
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.920
the pressure of doing those performances,
it's the temptation,
right?

254
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:49.060
Like you just can't be around it.
Like,
like a Steevo doesn't even drink.
Right.

255
00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:52.100
He won't do anything.
He does any,
if he does nothing.
Nothing.
Yeah.
I

256
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.170
<v 1>think that's how it has to be.
I don't know him.</v>

257
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:55.880
I think everybody's got their own thing.

258
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:59.330
Like I know dudes who have had problems with booze and,
uh,

259
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.280
then they quit the booze and then they'll start smoking weed one day and then

260
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.070
like,
oh,
I can handle this.
Like,
I have friends like that and I know,
uh,

261
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:11.570
like Anthony Bourdain is famously had a problem with heroin,
but he drinks,

262
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.700
he drinks,
loves weed and he's fine.
He's fine.
No one,

263
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.770
not even remotely an alcoholic.
He doesn't drink when he's at home.

264
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.480
Like you could say he enjoys alcoholics and out.
He's an alcohol enthusiast.

265
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.260
Big Difference though.
Yeah.
He doesn't feel good around the physical addiction.

266
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.630
Yeah.
Big Difference.
Yeah.
He talks about how like when he's home,

267
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:32.570
he doesn't drink.
He just doesn't drink,
you know,
and he doesn't need it.

268
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.660
That's crazy discipline.
I don't think it's discipline.
I'd really,

269
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.770
I think there's a,
well,

270
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:39.830
I think most certainly is discipline that he chooses not to,

271
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.140
but it's also an ethic,
but it's also,

272
00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:44.570
I think we're talking about like a physical need,

273
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.470
like a physical addiction and he doesn't have that,
which some people do though.

274
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:49.670
Some people do.

275
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.850
They get a little bit of alcohol in them and then they're fucked and they can't

276
00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:56.600
stop.
Can't stop the kidney function.
I've met him.
I know.
It's true.
I know people,

277
00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:59.810
I've met people like that rather.
I know.
It's true.
I know they do it.

278
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:04.340
Are you seeing who have an addictive personality?
Not Booze?
No.
No,
not at all.

279
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:08.510
What about marijuana?
No,
neither one.
No,
I couldn't get stopped right now.

280
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.260
I enjoy them.
I enjoy big,
different,
but like if I go on vacation,

281
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:15.920
I don't take weed with me.
If I go away,
I'm with my family most of the time.

282
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:16.754
I don't take shit with me.

283
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.490
Sometimes I'll take like a breath strip for the flight,

284
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.260
or if I get a crazy idea and I have to write something down,
everybody's asleep.

285
00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.800
Pop Up,
breath,
strip here.
Nothing wrong with journey.
You go on a little journey,

286
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:31.040
get creative man.
But I just say you're addicted to work though.

287
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:33.350
There's different kinds of addictions,
you know what I'm saying?
You know?

288
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.800
Definitely not really.
No.
I enjoyed it.
The hardest working guy.
I know,

289
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.610
but I enjoy it.
I get them,
but it's not addictive.
Like I quit.

290
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.150
I could quit all of it except comedy,
I think.
I mean,
I could do that too.

291
00:16:44.151 --> 00:16:46.910
I could quit that,
but that would bump me out.
Comedy is the most fun,

292
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:51.470
but everything else,
even the most fun aspects of it,

293
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.120
I could walk away from like,

294
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.630
like what's the most fun aspect about the UFC is actually watching the fights

295
00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.050
100%.
It's not working.
That's not the most fun aspect of it.

296
00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:02.270
Like to be literally the best seat in the house.

297
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:05.210
Watching the best fighters in the world.
That is the best part of it.

298
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.660
But the talking part actually makes it less enjoyable.

299
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.110
The working part makes the fights less enjoyable.
I bet man.

300
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.190
Like I enjoyed the fights more when we're doing these fight companions than any

301
00:17:16.191 --> 00:17:19.940
other time.
Me Too.
We're all hanging or what we're broadcasting to.

302
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:22.610
There's like this extra element because it's going out there too.

303
00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:26.420
And we know people are laughing with us for sure man.
Yeah.
But whenever,

304
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.760
whenever I go to the fights,
when I'm physically there,

305
00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:33.050
I don't have as good of a time.
I think for me,
cause you know,
I've been in there,

306
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.950
I get these nerves and stress and so for me,
I don't enjoy it.

307
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.990
So like this weekend,
I can't tell you how many times when I was at Fox,

308
00:17:40.991 --> 00:17:43.130
I'll look to see you at the cycling.
I won't be there man.

309
00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:48.020
I'd rather stay here and watch it.
Well,
this other thing about watching at home,

310
00:17:48.021 --> 00:17:52.020
you get the angles you're seeing it from inside the cage.

311
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.820
Whereas from outside the cage you're looking through the fence and that's
people.

312
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.780
You don't consider that until you go.
Then you go,
oh,

313
00:17:57.781 --> 00:17:59.730
you got to look through the fence to see the fights.

314
00:17:59.731 --> 00:18:03.420
Like I've seen some of the greatest fights of all time up close,

315
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.710
but through a fence.

316
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.700
Whereas a lot of people that are watching it at home like this,

317
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.490
there's a thing you have to do when you're looking through a fence,

318
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.740
you're not focusing on the things closest to you.

319
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.420
You're focusing on the thing that's past you.

320
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.180
So you always have this peripheral distraction.

321
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.560
That fence is always going to be there.
Being cage side isn't the best seat.

322
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:26.400
It's the most expensive seat.
But really it's almost you almost salami in that,

323
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.750
that first middle tier.
So you have this view.
So you're over the cage.
Yes,

324
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:35.280
100%.
And that's especially for boxing hundred percent for boxing.

325
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:37.950
Boxing as a way better viewing,
um,

326
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.920
position than the UFC because um,

327
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.760
the rings are low and you can see every punch that lands to the face,

328
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.190
like super clear,
at least never an obstruction.

329
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.330
Whereas like even me being right there at the desk,

330
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.550
if someone's behind a post,
like you'll Steve,

331
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.720
me sometimes I have to get on top of the table.
Yeah,
get up on the table.

332
00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:59.250
And I'm like looking here to make sure,

333
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:03.000
like if I need to know if like a camera's not showing me where a hand position

334
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:04.400
is.
If someone's going for a guillotine,

335
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.770
I don't know if they have their hands class or something.
I,

336
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.920
I have to physically get up and move sometimes and I'm fucking right there.

337
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.810
You know,
when you're at home there's,
you're,
you're,

338
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.280
you're watching that shit clean.

339
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.580
And sometimes I feel like when you're at home you're getting those best angles.

340
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.760
It makes the fight,
even if it was a phenomenal fight,

341
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.240
that much more epic cause you're seeing it.
You know what I'm saying?

342
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.971
It's like when your person,

343
00:19:24.971 --> 00:19:29.100
it's kind of hard to kind of see it break down what you've actually seen.

344
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:33.450
When you see a clear on camera and the zoom,
the replays,
you're like holy shit.

345
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.940
And here a better you hear it better cause you're,

346
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:39.740
you've got a microphone inside the cage so you hear those black,
you know,

347
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.610
like we'll play some shots sometimes.

348
00:19:41.611 --> 00:19:43.410
Like we're gonna play this back and she can hear it.

349
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.530
So did you get to hear like a knee slammed into someone's ribs or something like

350
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:48.490
that,
that like,
um,

351
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.020
Kyle Noke I think we did that in is a knockout in Australia.

352
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.340
That front kick to the body.

353
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:57.150
He shot this perfect front kick to the body and the dude just went,

354
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:02.090
Peter Sabata like he made this like,
like you can hear it can do nothing.

355
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.300
He could do it,
but you hear the slap of the ball of his foot.

356
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.370
Just slamming into that dude's body was like a perfect front kick telling oak

357
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.180
looks great.
That's the thing.
Will allow those shots when you can hit up.
Yeah,

358
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:19.800
especially heavyweights.
Oh yeah.
You're not going to hear them that good.

359
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.730
Inside the actual arena itself,
there's so much crowd noise is like,

360
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:26.370
unless you're right there,
it's hard to hear.
Like if you,

361
00:20:26.371 --> 00:20:27.780
even when you're on the first tier,

362
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:31.020
it's hard to hear the impact with everybody yelling and all that screaming.

363
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.200
I don't know when I'll go to another live event.
For me it's too stressful.

364
00:20:34.201 --> 00:20:36.780
Even football games still for me to go to,
but nothing of the UFC.

365
00:20:36.781 --> 00:20:40.470
It's just so intense and for me it gives me these nerves being right back there.

366
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.940
Even hotel.
I hate staying in hotels because of the stress of flight week.

367
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.730
Hawaii.
I hate it as town.
When Collin,
I go on the road,

368
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.640
I always look for an airbnb house because I hate hotels.

369
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.930
Why did I get super stressed?
I get anxiety and that in that rough,
oh,

370
00:20:55.931 --> 00:21:00.220
you want to go on vacation with me?
No,
or I really don't.
I know it's an issue.

371
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.490
That's funny.
I know,
man.
That's a weird issue.
Yeah,
it is.

372
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.000
The thing about being there live though is the energy in the room that you get

373
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.040
where it's like,
it feels like history.

374
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.630
Like there's been some fights where I was at or I was like taking it all in and

375
00:21:16.631 --> 00:21:18.820
I'm like,
wow.
I just witnessed some history.

376
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:20.800
Like when Weidman knocked out Anderson,

377
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.100
I remember when like when Andersen went down and Weidman was just playing

378
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:28.480
basketball with his head pop boom,
ba boom Ba boom and it was sinking in.

379
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.420
Oh my God,
Anderson is fucking out cold.
This is real.

380
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.200
Like it didn't seem real until you know how when like something that's truly

381
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:39.190
spectacular like that happens.
It almost doesn't seem real as it's going on.

382
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.370
Looks like a video game.
Yeah.

383
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.540
Well especially because Anderson had beaten everybody for so long.

384
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:47.260
We had got it in our head that Anderson wins.
Anderson beats everybody.

385
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.400
Anderson beat Steph and bottom.

386
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.130
It looked like he was going to lose the chill sign.

387
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.960
It throws up that triangle and catches them.
Anderson beats this guy.

388
00:21:52.961 --> 00:21:57.961
Anderson knocks out veto with a front kick and then you see that Chris Weidman

389
00:21:58.181 --> 00:21:58.901
left hook,

390
00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:03.901
just [inaudible] just call rank on his chin and then you see Anderson's eyes

391
00:22:04.601 --> 00:22:07.810
roll back and you're like,
your brain is trying to process it.
Like,

392
00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:11.710
am I seeing this?
Is this real?
And then he's down and I'm like,

393
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:15.130
then I remember whatever fucking voices I make.
Like,
Oh,
oh.

394
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:20.260
And then Weidman's on tall ball,
boom,
boom.
And they stopped the fight.
I go,

395
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:25.090
oh my God,
like you just realized this.
I just see this.

396
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.930
I think there's,

397
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:30.930
there's no other live sporting event better than a good solid UFC fight.

398
00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.490
There's no better live event.

399
00:22:33.491 --> 00:22:37.360
Like this weekend you'll see one 94 obviously it's sold out,

400
00:22:37.361 --> 00:22:40.990
but that will be the best live event to go to.
Yeah,
there's not far.

401
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:45.310
There's nothing.
Nothing.
Now on the other end of that,
if it's a sleeper,

402
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.350
if it's a rough night,
it is the worst event to go to.

403
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:54.060
If they're all decisions like all in there,
it's a long night.

404
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:57.040
It gets really boring.
It can get boring.
Yes,
completely.

405
00:22:57.041 --> 00:22:59.200
I mean that's like anything,
but it's tough man.

406
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.830
You know what I think is a tough thing when they have fights in high altitude,

407
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.120
you know like unless you got all Colorado guys and Albuquerque guys and they're

408
00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:09.550
fighting in Denver like shit man.

409
00:23:09.551 --> 00:23:12.640
Who the fuck thought to put mark cut and Ben Rothwell in Denver,

410
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.460
sign him up for Denver.
And then how about this?

411
00:23:15.461 --> 00:23:19.030
They then they go put Mark Hunt with Fabricio in Mexico City,

412
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.470
which is 2000 feet above dental and you give them like a six day notice and he's

413
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.360
300 pounds and he almost won talking about that.

414
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.780
Well Warrior came out in the first round,
almost won,
you know,

415
00:23:28.781 --> 00:23:32.890
and then comes out and the steep imulitic fight out of shape,
you know,

416
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:38.020
gets beaten down in that fight.
And then,
oh my God,
great,
fantastic shape.

417
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.560
He didn't even have to cut any weight at all to be to 65 I saw,

418
00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:46.090
they just announced the Verdugo a cane February 8th or seventh it's the

419
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.610
Superbowl weekend.
That's when Jamie does all gambling.
Look at him.

420
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.560
I hear that a island was data football game.
Look,
it's crazy.
Gets Scrooge McDuck

421
00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:01.220
but did they announce where that fights at?
Is it Vegas?
Vegas fight for sure.

422
00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:04.700
I couldn't imagine being anywhere else a fight like that.
That's a big fight.

423
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.420
This is going to be a lot of bedding unless it's in Brazil.
Don't,

424
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:11.840
don't honey Dick Cain and make them go to Brazil.
Let's let them,

425
00:24:11.841 --> 00:24:13.460
let's keep them in Vegas man.

426
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:18.050
And man would cane is one of my favorite all time fighters.
However,

427
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.310
he's not the champion anymore.

428
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.090
The champions for breezy over doom and it felt Barista over doing what's a fight

429
00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:26.600
in Brazil.
And what if he's only going to have one fucking title fight ever.

430
00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:30.920
Who knows?
Hey,
homeboy as Holly Holm out is to be a champ.

431
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.790
They said,
hey,
real quick call.
Uh,
just a reminder.
You ain't shit.

432
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:38.180
You're going to fight when Rhonda is ready.
So we're going to do it in July.

433
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.690
How rude.
Tell me about it.
I didn't make this decision.

434
00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:43.880
I'm just saying the champ really.
A lot of times,

435
00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:47.660
unless your name's Conor Mcgregor,
Ronda Rousey,
you don't have shit to say.
Well,

436
00:24:47.661 --> 00:24:51.050
it is such a different scenario than it is in boxing.

437
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.910
But in boxing there are some parallels like you saw Tyson fury beat Vladimir

438
00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.320
Klitschko.
Did she that bizarre fight?
Like it's almost a shit out of him.

439
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.840
But Vladimir Klitschko like forgot how to box.
He,

440
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:07.230
I think age caught up with him overnight.
He looked like pure shit.
Tyson,

441
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.770
it's tough to fight man.
It's tough.
He's undefeated.
He's not,
but he's,

442
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.690
but he's on the feed.
He's taller than Klitschko.
He's very awkward.

443
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.230
He didn't really respect him.
He was playing these games.
I don't know.

444
00:25:18.231 --> 00:25:20.870
It looked like something's wrong with clutch,
goes right hand did it.

445
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.670
He didn't throw anything you through nothing.

446
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:26.690
I think he was worried he couldn't get the shit and talking shit.

447
00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:30.380
Talking got to him.
The guy who constantly talked shit fuck with his emotions,

448
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:34.250
you know?
And I think he goes,
who's all wound up tight?
I think that's a big,

449
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:37.040
big issue with fighters.
You'd be issue even with Klitschko though.

450
00:25:37.041 --> 00:25:41.480
He's been through in the last 10 years.
Doesn't matter.
That kind of shit.

451
00:25:41.481 --> 00:25:45.350
Talking that kind of disrespectful shit.
Talking [inaudible] fucked Saturday.

452
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.650
All those,
a different guy because I think all day Klitschko yes.

453
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.900
You're talking about an Olympic gold medalist.
Yes.

454
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:55.930
But Klitschko has been a guy that they have labeled as a guy who has issues with

455
00:25:56.571 --> 00:26:00.680
mental toughness.
He got knocked out by Corey.
What the fuck is his name?

456
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:04.100
I want to say Corey Anderson.
What the hell?
No,
not Corey Anderson.
Um,

457
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.710
the South African guy knocked him out.

458
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.600
Lamont Brewster knocked him out to Brewster guys knocked him out and you know,

459
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:15.350
the guys were saying like that he had issues with mental toughness.

460
00:26:15.351 --> 00:26:17.720
That was the rap on him.
This is not my opinion.
This is the,

461
00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:22.460
this is like the boxing insiders that knew him from the gym would say these

462
00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:23.090
things.

463
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.480
And that was one of the things that they brought up in this fight that Tyson

464
00:26:26.481 --> 00:26:31.300
fury believed from talking to people that trained with Klitschko to manual with

465
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.790
the manual Stewart that Klitschko could be broken and he could be bullied.

466
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.020
He could be fucked with,
you can get inside his head,
you know,

467
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.150
was his name was the first guy.
No one's been able to do it for 10 years.
Yeah.

468
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.660
I mean,
you look,
you,
I grew up jab,
both these boys.

469
00:26:45.661 --> 00:26:49.530
Any fights there tonight that Anthony Joshua Guy from me,
I'm telling you,
man,

470
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.590
did you look this kid off?
Yeah,
he looks terrifying dog.

471
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.540
And you know who everybody's ducking Shannon Briggs.
They really are.

472
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.550
They don't want none of that.
I mean,
he's older,
but yeah,
he's,
he's 43 years old,

473
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.900
but he is still packing some serious fucking power.
A hunter.
But he's got it.

474
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.870
He's got a wicked left hook to the body.

475
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:15.050
He's got asked like skillful delivery of punches that is unparalleled in that

476
00:27:16.381 --> 00:27:19.320
division.
I think if you watched the way he delivers combinations,

477
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:23.640
he can deliver a one too vicious left hook to the body that there's not a lot of

478
00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:25.810
guys in that division could do and go crap.
I know,

479
00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:29.430
but it's hard to sell a 43 year old.
Yeah,
it is being your chance Corey Sanders.

480
00:27:29.431 --> 00:27:34.200
That's who it is.
Thank you.
Um,
pull up,
uh,
the last fight,
Shannon Briggs,

481
00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:35.520
last fight,
dude,

482
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.150
he's fighting a guy who does not deserve to be in the ring with him,
right?

483
00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:41.670
He's a former world champion and the one time it was like one of the,

484
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.680
the biggest prospects in the heavyweight division,

485
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:49.130
but he hits this dude with a one to like a gentle been too and that just popped

486
00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:51.560
some on the left hook left hook to the liver and the guy goes,

487
00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:56.190
it's body just crumbles.
It's the way he delivers it.

488
00:27:56.191 --> 00:27:57.810
Like there's a fluidity to his left.

489
00:27:57.811 --> 00:28:00.870
Look like Nikki Holtzclaw you ever seen Nicky holds control that left hook.

490
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.420
Oh die.
The best left took in the world.

491
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:07.500
That left hook is a goddamn thing of beauty.
It's from the heavens.

492
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.150
Dwayne Nikki throws it too.
It's like he,

493
00:28:10.151 --> 00:28:13.320
he gets you thinking about these head punches and that snap up.

494
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.610
He just snaps it in.
Like why didn't the pocket and that liver shot?
Oh No,

495
00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.810
they are not to go back then.

496
00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.750
But you know they took Tyson furious title away cause that's where I was going

497
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:25.440
to say.
Yeah,
that's what I was going to say.
Like in MMA,
you can't really,

498
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.280
you can't look at it that way.
Watch,
well,
I guess we're going to see a replay,

499
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.200
but why don't you bring it back to the beginning.

500
00:28:31.201 --> 00:28:35.700
Jamie's to go watch from the beginning.
Oh,
breaks is Jackson.

501
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:38.820
Well,
let's,
can we go to the beginning of the video?

502
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.730
Just go all the way to the beginning.
There you go.
Right to the beginning.

503
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:43.350
But look at this.
That's it.

504
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.840
That's exactly what I was looking for and do that again.
Putting that again.

505
00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.980
Put that again,
but just watched the fluidity pop up.
Watch this.

506
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:55.650
Come on,
son.
Nasty pop,
pop.
And then that left hook under the arm couple.

507
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:58.380
Who the fuck who boxes?
Like Kim in the heavyweight division?

508
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.700
I would say one more time.
Do that thing from the beginning.
Look at that.

509
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.500
You know that the whipping fluidity to his punches.
You know,

510
00:29:07.501 --> 00:29:12.360
like he's got like this real refined style of punching do it.

511
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.030
He's going to struggle with a younger guy like that,

512
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:18.960
that Joshua or Dante wilder though.
I'm not going to sit there.
That's true.

513
00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:21.330
They're going to push a hard pace.
They're going to get in his face,
fight,

514
00:29:21.331 --> 00:29:25.890
fighting guts.
He got straight off the bus and look at this sun.
Yeah,

515
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.340
that's nasty.
But you know,
he had a hard time with vitality.

516
00:29:29.341 --> 00:29:31.260
Klitschko Vitali Klitschko beat him up.

517
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.840
But I don't know if he was working as hard back then as he was now.

518
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.740
He's sort of like a reborn.
He wanted kind of a guy.
Yeah.
You know,
good for him,

519
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:40.470
man.
He's got all these motivational videos online too.

520
00:29:40.471 --> 00:29:43.300
Like he's an interesting guy.
I'm going to take these.
I am too.

521
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.430
I want to see him get a shot before he's too old.
He always 43 tough man dude.

522
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.300
Especially with Tyson.

523
00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:53.670
Fury would be some wild shit that would be a wild ass fight.
Him and uh,

524
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.800
Deontay wilder.
There'll be another wild fight.
Dude.

525
00:29:56.801 --> 00:30:00.160
I'm trying to see Deontay wilder and that Joshua Guy.
Yeah,

526
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.070
that'd be interesting to put boxing.
Not Right.

527
00:30:03.071 --> 00:30:07.390
And it takes forever for anything to work out.
Did you see Canelo Alvarez?
Yes.

528
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:11.350
Miguel Cotto.
How good at Alvarez look?
Jesus Christ.
He looked good.

529
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.930
He looked good to me.
He's not the savior,

530
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:17.050
like he's not the Mexican savior that we're all looking for.

531
00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.760
And he could have been yet.
He could yet.
I,
if I'm,
if I'm Canelo's camp,

532
00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.720
you're not fighting triple g next.
We're not doing that.
That's a bad idea.

533
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.610
As a fan I'm like fuck yeah.
Fight.

534
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:31.510
You know what the problem with a triple g fight is as an as like if I was a

535
00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:32.344
promoter,

536
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:37.240
I would say that guy only sold 145,000 paper views in his last fight.

537
00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.110
Like nobody knows who the fuck he is.
He's dangerous as fuck.
Dangerous as fuck.

538
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.240
And if you're going to have that fight,
that should be maximized.

539
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.560
I agreement Floyd and Manny,
they almost missed the boat,
right?

540
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:51.430
Cause Floyd or they missed the boat.
Well they kind of did,
but they still,

541
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.380
they still hit it pretty God damn hard.
It was the biggest fight.
Big.

542
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:56.620
I'm just saying it could have been bigger if they did two years ago.

543
00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.130
They got lucky and they pulled it back once [inaudible] came back and won some

544
00:31:00.131 --> 00:31:01.450
fights through and look really good.

545
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:05.740
But if you look at that division right now,

546
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:11.010
you know like if you look at like if you look at Canelo's fight with Floyd,

547
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:17.140
you know that was like a good fight for canola to learn.
He's like really young.

548
00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.660
He's trying to figure it out for them too much.
Maybe more mainstream.
Yeah.

549
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:26.130
But if you look at like Gennady Golovkin is a totally different kind of a guy.

550
00:31:26.711 --> 00:31:29.530
He's like,
he's a dangerous,
he's right now,
he's ready to go.

551
00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.140
He's ready to fight anyone in the world and beat him right now.

552
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.950
Can is not at that stage.
He might be though sync.
Yeah,

553
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:39.790
I'm just to older Cotto yeah,
but he looked good.
He looked good.

554
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:42.910
He was showing all kinds of skills that he hadn't shown before that counter

555
00:31:42.911 --> 00:31:46.240
uppercut snacks.
He was doing a lot of nasty stuff in there.
Amazing.

556
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.740
Any fucking hits hard.

557
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.950
He scares guys cause he doesn't throw a lot of half speed stuff.

558
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:54.610
He doesn't want to start off.
Yeah.
It's just,
it's an assault,
you know,

559
00:31:54.611 --> 00:31:57.190
and you feel that like that pressure right off the beginning.

560
00:31:57.191 --> 00:32:00.850
Like he puts this pressure on Codo and that pressure is always there.

561
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.860
It's a part of the fight.
It's like his power and his,
his presence,
they,
they,

562
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:10.840
they are an added element that that cocoa has to consider that he didn't have to

563
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:13.960
consider with Kodo Kodo,
he had a mind,
his p's and q's.

564
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.590
He had a huge good defense and you know,
he had a,
he had a stay on it,

565
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:19.660
but he's really only dealing with a left hook.

566
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.710
Kodo really never hurts guys that bad was right hand,
but he has gotten very,

567
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.040
very nasty left took,
but he's really been fighting smaller guys.

568
00:32:27.041 --> 00:32:29.050
Just say he's a lot smaller than codas thing.

569
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.990
Even if he was landing Canela didn't respect you.
Just walk through it.

570
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:36.580
Canelo is like probably a buck 70 when he's walking around.
Tiny.
I've done stuff.

571
00:32:36.581 --> 00:32:39.970
I've done Canelo or Kodo.
Kodo Kodo is so totally,

572
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.370
<v 0>I've done campaigns or that guy and he is tiny.</v>

573
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:47.340
What is he like five five five six five six by any ways.

574
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.280
One 55 in shape,
right?
Yes.
Yeah.

575
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:56.180
And Canelo cuts down and then probably gets in the one seven seventies.

576
00:32:56.181 --> 00:32:58.520
Right.
He's a big boy.
Big Boy.
Bigger for that week.

577
00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.600
And that's why Floyd wanted to catch weight.
Fight with him radically.
Yeah.

578
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.060
And that's why they did a catch weight with Kodo and Canelo.
Yes.

579
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.010
See what you got to weaken that kid,
you know,

580
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.840
weakened them to get them down there.
See,

581
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:12.890
but the thing I do like about boxing is by the time these guys reached their

582
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:16.130
potential,
they've had like 20 or 30 fights.
You know what I'm saying?

583
00:33:16.131 --> 00:33:19.460
Like they've had a lot of experience.
They're ready for that next step.
Exactly.

584
00:33:19.461 --> 00:33:22.370
And the UFC,
we don't have that.
Right,
exactly.
I just don't have that.

585
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:27.110
And like look at page in a Rose Rose I think is what three and two or some shit

586
00:33:27.111 --> 00:33:29.990
like them and their headliner.
Yeah.
It's tough man.

587
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.990
Well that's also the women's division is a little bit less experienced.

588
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.260
Not a little,
a lot less experienced in the men's division.
There's that.

589
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:39.980
That's a bad example.
But like,
uh,
at least sage Northcutt like,

590
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.530
I mean you want to talk about a mismatch.
Is this fight?
How dare you?

591
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.820
What's that face?
How he's out there.
His mom's out go deers.

592
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.420
Parents are watching him.
I know sage is going to kick his head off.

593
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:56.300
I mean not find is tailor made for him.
We'll see.
But,
but,

594
00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.350
but I'm just saying it's a good,
it's,
I'm not saying it's easy files.

595
00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:00.290
Youtube videos.

596
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:05.350
Cody Pfister on top ground shout in the 32nd jobs like fuck me.

597
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:10.630
Oh I know right?
Oh there you go.
Shop Way to go.
Shit man.

598
00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:13.240
You didn't call the Rhonda Fight Heather.

599
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.780
I'm just saying I like this step for sage.

600
00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:22.990
Like it's a good progression in his career.
He's in a deep,
deep,
deep,
deep,
deep.

601
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:28.130
He has joy is in Shitty word,
jacked,
jacked and shredded.

602
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.770
Cause he's like some new thing.
He doesn't have any fat,

603
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.990
has no fat and he sold his healthy.

604
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.590
I've got to think they're like some fat is probably like good for your body.

605
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:40.550
It's good for cardio too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's good for your cardio.
It's also like,

606
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.060
depending on what your body's using for fuel truck,

607
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:47.360
what are you using for fuels your body using fat or is your body using glucose

608
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:51.350
cause you're not getting any glucose in a five round fight.
I look at this boy,

609
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:56.150
I mean he looks like he's been the lead singer of a boy band right now.

610
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:59.750
Somebody on their underground,
I forget what the exact quote that he looks like.

611
00:34:59.751 --> 00:35:01.900
I'm going to butcher this because I don't have it in front of me.

612
00:35:01.901 --> 00:35:05.630
But they said something like he looked like a boy band fucked in American Eagle.

613
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:12.440
Whoever that is a trend that,
I'm sorry I didn't get the crew kids just shred it.

614
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.591
Yeah.

615
00:35:12.591 --> 00:35:16.130
I think you said something like someone from insync fuck to an American Eagle.

616
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:21.750
Yeah,
it's true.
Yeah.
Yeah.

617
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:26.540
I mean I told him,
yeah,
I mean fuck so long.
Do you think he can keep pussy away?

618
00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:31.550
Cause it's gotta be like a swarm of malaria written mosquitoes flying into his

619
00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:36.160
hell.
Tell about every fucking white girl wants to get with it.

620
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:37.980
And he's saying he's at Texas A.
And.
M.
I

621
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.120
<v 1>don't know if you've ever seen the smoke shows at a and m cause my favorite girl</v>

622
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.510
did the best lesson.
Yeah.
Salmon.
Australians.
Yeah.
Austria on the get wild.

623
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.480
I just feel like homeboy is going to have to break at some point.

624
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.960
But you know what's weird is that,
do you see the article on his dad?

625
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.160
I heard but I didn't,
I didn't bother digging in because I figured,
you know what?

626
00:35:59.161 --> 00:36:02.190
I don't even want to read this.
I mean it's just his dad has,
you know,

627
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.590
apparently a dark past that has nothing to do with him.

628
00:36:04.591 --> 00:36:09.300
They just assume that his dad has this weird past that sage is on some shit.

629
00:36:09.301 --> 00:36:13.330
I don't think so.
The kids to say the Patchouli.
What is the path?
A path.

630
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:17.430
I think you went to prison for 10 plus years for uh,

631
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:20.970
selling steroids and other stuff and cocaine,
right?
Yes.
Yeah.

632
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:24.420
Well that's a good combination if you want to be really angry and strong,

633
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.600
especially if in,
especially in pride,
it's a hell of a drug.

634
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.410
I think you win a belt.
Yeah.
I hope it doesn't have anything to do with him.

635
00:36:31.411 --> 00:36:35.510
I hope it's doubt.
I'm sure.
Come on.
He's just a freak man.
Could be,
you know.

636
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.880
Well he's also been training since he was five and the,
you know,

637
00:36:38.881 --> 00:36:42.360
here's the thing about steroids.
You need a lot more than that to look like that.

638
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.740
To be that a bleeding.
That's genetics.
It's genetics and it's insane work.
Yes.

639
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:50.020
There's just no way around it.
I'd say more genetics than anything.

640
00:36:50.021 --> 00:36:52.230
100% his age at genetics.

641
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.140
A strict diet for the majority of his life.

642
00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.870
I mean he's been eating like lean chicken and like he,

643
00:36:57.871 --> 00:37:00.780
he details like what he eats really been at.
Yeah.
Yeah.

644
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:01.830
I mean he's in college too,

645
00:37:01.831 --> 00:37:04.860
so I'm sure after this fight he's fuck and he's balls deep into polars don't

646
00:37:04.861 --> 00:37:07.770
think he is man.
You don't think so?
I think he's one of those guys.

647
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.160
Those guys are tough to hang.
Those are scary.
Whoa.
Look at him.

648
00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:15.600
He's got this like fucking does glow this like,
yeah,
everything is amazing.

649
00:37:15.601 --> 00:37:19.020
You know,
you ask things like kill coming out.
Like he has no idea.

650
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:23.130
He's never seen anything dark in his life.
Did you see him dead lifts,
Dark Shit.

651
00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:26.280
500 pounds or some shit?
Does he really?
He like looks at the camera.
He's like,

652
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.790
hey,
everybody here's just like change sets it down.

653
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:31.950
While we were waiting for these guys to start showing up,

654
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:36.690
these guys who's who had been a project by some overzealous father who has a

655
00:37:36.691 --> 00:37:39.380
martial arts background and attacks the kids.
Yeah,

656
00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:41.070
Mama let you don't want that guy.
You know what I'm saying?

657
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.030
Maybe it did in the eighties tat tap in the 90s when did tab,
I'll start.

658
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.590
If you've got a tablet shirt in like 98 I'll accept it and he's watching just

659
00:37:49.591 --> 00:37:53.460
rich Franklin is that white shot.
Look at him.
Look.
He's like,
Hey,
there you go.

660
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.450
Hey,
check this out everyone.
Yeah,
that's real.
Look.
Hey,

661
00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:01.170
that guy lifted 500 pounds like it's nothing do I don't know how much that is.

662
00:38:01.171 --> 00:38:05.340
It looks like a shitload though.
That's a lot of weight.
I don't know who that is.

663
00:38:05.341 --> 00:38:08.300
That sticking her ass out.
Holy Moly.

664
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.500
Oh yeah.
That's a strong fucker.
He's a,

665
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.760
he's definitely talented and he's got a lot of techniques to,

666
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:17.610
and he's really good at transitioning between striking and grappling.

667
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:22.350
But when I was going to say when we were,
we were on this long,
circuitous route,

668
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:27.690
is that someone like a Holly Holm is not in a position like a Tyson furious or

669
00:38:27.691 --> 00:38:29.490
Tyson fury can say,
fuck it.

670
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.930
I don't want to fight this Russian capital on.
Let me finish,
let me finish.

671
00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.330
[inaudible] he's,
he can say Tyson fury could say,

672
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.640
I don't want to fight this rush and do and they will fuck it.

673
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:41.890
We're stripping you the title.
He's like,
whatever,
bitch.

674
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.840
I know I'm still the champ.
Everybody knows I'm the champ.

675
00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:45.820
I just beat Vladimir Klitschko.
Fuck you.

676
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:50.590
Like he can do that and get away with it and he can go to Bob Arum or he can go

677
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:54.730
to ta,
you know,
golden boy or the money team.
You know what I mean?

678
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:56.790
There's all these different promoters,
Floyd Mayweather,

679
00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.530
different promoters there.

680
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:03.370
We'll put on excellent fights that are bing pay per view events that HBO can

681
00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:08.230
show.
That's the difference with the UFC.
It's the UFC.
There's one game in town,

682
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:11.420
so if Holly Holm says,
you know what,
um,

683
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.950
I'm not waiting for Ronda Rousey.
I'm fighting Misha Tate.

684
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:18.820
Put the fucking fight together.
Can't do it.
Really is I disagree,

685
00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:21.300
but this is what I'm saying.
How is she,
how can she,

686
00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.420
she what I'm saying and say you don't give me a fight before then come July,

687
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:30.190
I'm not doing shit.
Oh,
and your biggest payday.
I'm not doing anything.

688
00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.680
You can't do that because,
because she's got a contract.

689
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:35.440
I'm sure she has a contract and I wish I can't find her.

690
00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:38.590
I don't know what the contract says.
When you're the champion,
do you,

691
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.490
I would assume that it says something.

692
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:47.380
They must have to get it in writing in some way that you're obligated to defend

693
00:39:47.381 --> 00:39:51.550
your title against a challenger of their choosing.
I assume.
Okay.

694
00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:56.500
If I was going to run a promotion but the UFC and fine,
I'm just saying if,
if,

695
00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.420
if,
let's say if I'm John Jones or if I'm wrong,

696
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.540
look at Rhonda is calling the shots.
My man,

697
00:40:01.541 --> 00:40:03.730
I don't know if you guys realize Rhonda is basically,
listen,

698
00:40:03.731 --> 00:40:07.630
I have this movie here.
I need to fight here.
That's how this is going down.
Okay,

699
00:40:07.631 --> 00:40:11.890
let me correct and I'm saying with Holly,
let me correct you guys.

700
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:15.160
This is not,
that's not what's going on.
What's going on is a number.

701
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:20.340
That number is 200 UFC 200 who want to make it the biggest fucking UFC the world

702
00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:26.950
has ever known.
They're already advertising it.
Okay.
You'll see these big,

703
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.210
like big images just comes on July,

704
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:32.950
2016 UFC 200 there's no other number.
Hold on.

705
00:40:32.951 --> 00:40:34.360
There's no other number that's like that,

706
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.040
that they're looking towards this thing.

707
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:40.570
Then there's also this gigantic arena that's opening up in Vegas in April,

708
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.810
so they know that that's where they're going to do it and they know they're

709
00:40:43.811 --> 00:40:47.440
going to do it in July.
So this is what's motivating.
You.
Don't get that Joe,

710
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:52.300
if you don't think that they're the ones that are guiding this to July and not

711
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:55.090
Rhonda guarantee you it's them.
I'm not saying that.

712
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:58.150
I'm saying previously before Rhonda has been able to,

713
00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:01.450
with movies and everything decided when she fights.
Yeah.
Well not now though.
No,

714
00:41:01.451 --> 00:41:02.680
not now.
This is whatever.

715
00:41:02.681 --> 00:41:06.140
I don't know how if their jaws messed up or what would this now?
No,

716
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.460
I'm just saying if I'm Holly,
she has more power than she thinks.

717
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:14.920
Yes and no cause.
Cause if someone was out that long cause the long time,

718
00:41:14.921 --> 00:41:18.460
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
But,
but from a business standpoint,

719
00:41:18.461 --> 00:41:21.460
I'm with Dana White.
That fight has happened.
You can't have Holly fight.

720
00:41:21.461 --> 00:41:25.540
Anyone else?
See I disagree.
Really?
Yup.
Yeah.
I disagree.

721
00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:29.230
Tell watch how many paper views Holly versus Meesha cells.
Okay.
Listen,

722
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.890
first of all,
this is what I think.
This is my personal opinion.
All right.

723
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:32.920
This is just,
there's just,

724
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.660
you're crazy to not have more than one superstar.
Okay.

725
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.340
And I think Holly has the legit possibility of being a superstar.
Legit.

726
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:46.280
She has everything going for,
she's a preacher's daughter.

727
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.050
She is very well spoken.

728
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:53.080
She's very calm and she's got a great personality and she's sweet and people

729
00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:57.410
root for her.
And in the face of all the craziness and the trash talking,

730
00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:59.120
the Meta obligations and the pressure,

731
00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.240
she showed character and she never cracked.
And when she got in there,

732
00:42:02.241 --> 00:42:06.290
she performed like a world class fighter.
I grew,
became the new champion.

733
00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.260
That's a potential superstar.
Okay.
We're sure.

734
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:14.130
And if Ron is going to be out for this long amount of time,
why Russia?
Why?
Right?

735
00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:18.380
I mean if July.
Okay,
you're talking about July,
right?
We're in December,
January,

736
00:42:18.381 --> 00:42:21.740
February,
March,
April,
May,
June,
July seven months.

737
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:25.160
She just said in an interview that she's not gonna be able to eat an apple for

738
00:42:25.161 --> 00:42:27.350
six months.
Forget about taking impact.

739
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:31.550
So how is that going to happen in July and have her be at our optimum?

740
00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:36.170
How is it going to happen?
I don't know this,
but I don't know what the,

741
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.210
I don't know who I'm talking to.
Anybody.
I don't know.

742
00:42:38.211 --> 00:42:40.880
But this is my personal opinion.
Okay.

743
00:42:40.881 --> 00:42:43.910
Holly Holm could be a fucking monster.

744
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:46.380
She could be a monster and she could be a,

745
00:42:46.381 --> 00:42:50.690
I'm a monster on the level of any champion in combat sports,

746
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:53.090
any champion in the UFC.
She can.

747
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.320
If Holly Holm just goes onto dominate the way Rhonda dominated and we all know

748
00:42:57.321 --> 00:43:00.950
that she knocked Rhonda out.
If she gets in there and fights,
fill in the blank,

749
00:43:00.951 --> 00:43:04.560
fill in whatever girl's name,
the head kicks her into oblivion.
Okay,

750
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.250
on television,
everybody's like,
Holy Shit,
we got a new one.

751
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:10.160
Rhonda didn't become Rhonda immediately.

752
00:43:10.161 --> 00:43:14.600
She became Rhonda with a series of spectacular victory.
Holly Holm strings,

753
00:43:14.601 --> 00:43:17.570
a few of those together.
You've got another gigantic dynamo.

754
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:22.430
Then when Ron does ready to come back and she's 100% healed and healthy and has

755
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:27.080
made some corrections and really worked on fixing whatever holes were exposed

756
00:43:27.081 --> 00:43:27.914
during her game,

757
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:32.920
then you have this moment monumental fucking super fight and if Misha wins,

758
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:37.280
then you've got a crazy fucking love triangle here.

759
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:39.890
Seat dot this and this all sounds great.

760
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:45.490
I'm saying low because this all sounds great in less Holly and Meesha fight or

761
00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:49.510
Holly fight Cyborg and she loses your biggest payday,
goes outside,

762
00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.690
goes out the window cause she knows.

763
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:54.290
She's saying she's not going to make one 35 Oh fuck,
fuck.

764
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:57.680
Let's just look at look,
say Misha.
Misha.
Okay.
If me show wins.

765
00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:01.220
If Meesha beats Holly Holm and then me,

766
00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:05.240
she wants a fight round Rhonda again,
your mind.
You're good.
You're crazy.

767
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.080
What the fuck?
What is she?
What does she join?

768
00:44:07.081 --> 00:44:10.220
The fight standing announced strikes her.
They've already fought twice.

769
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:10.700
That's true.

770
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.950
You're telling me that's been a company that's going to break records.

771
00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:15.650
Meet painting would be an interesting fight.
No,
no,
no.
I didn't ask that.

772
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:17.120
You can be an issue soon.
Frank records.

773
00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:21.320
I don't know if it'll break records to break records.
Holly.
Yes,
Holly.

774
00:44:21.321 --> 00:44:24.240
Rhonda is your money fight,
but if Holly you got,

775
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.710
I think the long game is if Holly gets even better,

776
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.920
if she gets even more recognition and Rhonda fully heals up and you also give a

777
00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:37.260
chance for Misha Tate to take that tea.
You've when you run a risk,

778
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:41.310
but I think even if we should take beats Holly and they have a three mount round

779
00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:44.490
rematch between or a five round main event rematch.

780
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:49.500
Non title fight of me has got the strap and Holly and Ronda go at it in a five

781
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:53.970
rounder.
That shit would still be bananas.
Gigantic.
I agree.

782
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:58.050
Everybody makes money.
You get more superstars to get the more,

783
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:03.230
more like high level like marquee matchups.

784
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:04.450
But don't you think that,

785
00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.500
because I don't think [inaudible] has three or four fights left in her.

786
00:45:07.501 --> 00:45:10.870
So this whole round Robin,
he said,
because she said,
if I lose the Holly,

787
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.700
I'm gonna retire.
So by even saying if I fight Holly and I lose,

788
00:45:14.701 --> 00:45:15.870
I'm going to retire.
She said No.

789
00:45:15.871 --> 00:45:18.810
She said that in a recent interview that's on this.
If I were to lose the Holly,

790
00:45:18.811 --> 00:45:22.680
I'm done.
I retire.
Wow.
Yeah.
I'm not making that up.
So when,

791
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:25.830
as soon as someone says if this were to happen,
I'm going to retire.

792
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:27.960
That means you're already thinking about the end of the road.

793
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.510
So there's going to be no round Robin.

794
00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:34.860
So the short game and the big payday in the short scheme is Rhonda Holly.

795
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:37.950
So I get the July wait,
I'm just saying it sucks for Holly.

796
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:43.020
I was the only person that loses in this is Holly.
I think.
I think July is a,

797
00:45:43.021 --> 00:45:44.490
is going to be tricky if Rhonda is,

798
00:45:44.491 --> 00:45:49.120
tell him if she's honest or if she's accurate rather about how long it's going

799
00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:53.280
to take her to heal up.
Well Shit,
y'all ask him cleared.
She just got cleared.

800
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.980
But she also did an interview where she said she's not gonna be able to eat an

801
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.670
apple.
I know.
That's what I don't understand.
Well that's what I'm saying.

802
00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:02.160
She's also staying with uh,
uh,
I forget his name now.

803
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.480
Fucking a homeboy Edmunds staying with Edmund too.
So that's another thing.

804
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:09.850
So she's staying with Edmond and this is the issue.

805
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:12.990
What do you think she should go?
I have no idea if I,
if I had a plan,

806
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:13.830
I would tell you Joe.

807
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:18.180
But she has to get better and I think that everyone's doing her a disservice.

808
00:46:18.181 --> 00:46:22.230
Including Dana White,
including Edmund saying you just had,
you've been so busy.

809
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.750
All this stress cause all it is Rhonda,
Rhonda,
Rhonda,

810
00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.110
can we give Holly the credit?
Say Holly,
just better man.

811
00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:31.650
And for Rhonda to beat her,
she has to get better and striking.

812
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.300
That's the only way she's going to beat her.

813
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:35.910
If you think she's going to beat her by grappling and you're full of shit,

814
00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:40.800
it's not going to happen.
So to fight in July and she's shooting a movie really,

815
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.090
and she stayed with the same trainer,

816
00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:45.450
why do you think the outcome's going to be different?
Well,
it could,
well,

817
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.540
first of all,
I disagree that she couldn't beat her in grappling.

818
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.510
I think it's very possible that she could catch her with something.

819
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.680
It's very possible.

820
00:46:52.681 --> 00:46:56.120
That can be a screen possible and she can catch her hundred percent is possible.

821
00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:00.590
Why you say it's not then I'm seeing the chances of her beating Holly is because

822
00:47:00.591 --> 00:47:02.670
her only chance to grapple.
Right,
right.
Okay.

823
00:47:02.671 --> 00:47:05.970
So let's say that doesn't work again and we're back to stand up.
Okay.

824
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.880
So why would you think of continuing what you're doing is going to be any

825
00:47:08.881 --> 00:47:12.000
different.
But when you say she has a distinct advantage in grappling,

826
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.640
if he goes down there and he goes down there,
right,

827
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.310
but when you say that like grappling for a few years,

828
00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.020
100% Holly has never been taken down.

829
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:23.610
Well she was down in this fight but it was really,
she was on top.

830
00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.590
She took Rhonchi.

831
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.510
She took Rhonda Down in the one time where Rhonda was going for the arm bar.

832
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:31.960
Ronda was on the bottom.
Um,
but theoretically,

833
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.860
I mean at least if you looked at the two of them in terms of just raw grappling,

834
00:47:35.861 --> 00:47:39.460
you would have to think that Rhonda has got a much higher level hunt over game.

835
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:39.731
Right.

836
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:44.500
100% if she didn't get tagged the way she got tagged in that fight,

837
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:47.110
it is a big,
if it's a giantF ,
it's almost if you take away,

838
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:51.380
if you take away Holly's phenomenal striking.
Yeah,
we then,
then you don't know.

839
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:54.010
You don't have to take away,
are striking.
You just have to avoid it.

840
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.630
You have to figure out a way to avoid it.

841
00:47:55.631 --> 00:47:57.790
And one of the ways to avoid is not go head on.

842
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.870
Like you look at the rate Raquel Pennington fight where cal fought a much more

843
00:48:01.871 --> 00:48:05.780
conservative fight with Holly and that was a different division.

844
00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:08.610
It's different demeanor.
You're talking about foot work angles.
Yeah,

845
00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:12.110
less aggressive that's not bonded.
Got this famous.
It's true,
but,

846
00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.150
but that doesn't mean anything.

847
00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:16.420
It's like what do you have to do to win to forget about what got you famous,

848
00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:16.860
what do you,

849
00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:21.280
what's the best tactical technical approach to fighting someone who is as

850
00:48:21.281 --> 00:48:23.770
talented as is Holly and do,
do you have that?

851
00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.400
Do you have that skillset in seven months?
That's a good question.

852
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:31.360
Do you have the skillset to get great footwork,
avoid Holly striking,

853
00:48:31.361 --> 00:48:32.230
get her down to the ground.

854
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:37.180
And we know that there's only a couple ways to develop the kind of movement that

855
00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:38.440
she's going to have to get.

856
00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.800
And one of those is sparring 100% like you're going to have to spar.

857
00:48:41.801 --> 00:48:44.380
So you're going to have to be able to get hit.
And if you have five,

858
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.260
six months where you can't get it,
I mean,
who knows?

859
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.090
She might have overestimated that.

860
00:48:49.091 --> 00:48:51.550
They might like look at it again a couple months,
might heal up quick.

861
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:54.520
Maybe there's some things they can do to help it heal up.
Who knows?
Who knows.

862
00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:58.810
If she saved,
she was fine.
If she's fine now,

863
00:48:58.811 --> 00:49:01.150
I didn't have any teeth problems,
didn't have any of that.

864
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.690
Like how long do you think she should wait before she starts getting hit?

865
00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:10.140
After a vicious flatline head kick knockouts from one of the best kickboxers in

866
00:49:13.031 --> 00:49:15.670
the female bantamweight division.
Right.

867
00:49:15.671 --> 00:49:18.280
I mean it's just the perfect world that she's the,
actually,

868
00:49:18.281 --> 00:49:20.920
let's call her the best between her and Jermaine.
Rhonda May,

869
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:24.940
who's a very outstanding Moitai champion where multiple time world champion,

870
00:49:24.941 --> 00:49:28.400
but she hasn't been as successful in MMA,
but she is a nasty,
sweet guys.

871
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:31.180
Strike that was actually that.
It's actually an interesting matchup.

872
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:34.390
Her and Holly,
phenomenal,
phenomenal matchup.

873
00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:36.400
If more people knew who Ronda may is,

874
00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:39.160
it would be really be a very interesting fight to set up,

875
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.520
but I think that man,
that level,

876
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:45.710
the level of kickboxing is a very dangerous hurt.

877
00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:47.980
Her head kicks that she hides behind those punches.

878
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.930
You go back and watch Holly's early fights,

879
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:52.720
she gets those hands in front of you and that's phenomenal.

880
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.750
That from the left high kick comes out of nowhere.
In a perfect world,

881
00:49:55.751 --> 00:49:59.020
I would say probably six months without any contact,

882
00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:02.130
six months without any context can do that though.
That's a smart move.

883
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:04.360
Can't do that.
If you're fighting,
it's seven months.
Well,

884
00:50:04.361 --> 00:50:08.320
shouldn't it always be in a perfect mood or in a perfect world and it shouldn't.

885
00:50:08.321 --> 00:50:11.980
Like if there's outside pressures,
the outside pressure,
they should stay.

886
00:50:11.981 --> 00:50:14.260
They should stop and think about what the fuck they're doing.

887
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.980
I really believe that I should say,
I think they should make sure,
look,

888
00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:20.710
if Rhonda is going to perform at her best,

889
00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:26.110
you should have everything lined up so you know she's good to go before anything

890
00:50:26.111 --> 00:50:29.060
gets set up,
everything should be lined up well.
I agree.

891
00:50:29.061 --> 00:50:30.950
Everything should be lined up.
There should be no,
again,

892
00:50:30.951 --> 00:50:33.050
we're talking about a morass.
We haven't talked to Rhonda.

893
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.200
We don't know what or no idea.
This is from an intervention in it and for people.

894
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:39.920
Thomas,
I mean I tried to avoid this shit,
but uh,

895
00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.140
did you see the other thing she said in the interview that she was out from the

896
00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:44.420
first punch nine and see that she did,

897
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:48.110
she got cracked by that first punch and she's basically had no records,

898
00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:51.940
tribal instincts to know.
But is that is,

899
00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:57.080
how does she know that?
Here's the thing,
do when you get head kick like that,

900
00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.830
right?
You forget a lot of things.

901
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:05.660
Your memory becomes this weird blur of events.

902
00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:11.380
It's very hard to discern exactly what things took place in what order after

903
00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.020
you've been head kick like that.
You know,
like if you,

904
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:19.460
like you had fights like the Var Johnson fight.
Perfect example.

905
00:51:19.461 --> 00:51:22.820
You fought a fucking scary dude and you fall super smart.

906
00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:25.610
You got in on that motherfucker and you took him down over and over again.

907
00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:28.520
You controlled that.
You controlled the fight,
you control the perfectly.

908
00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:31.250
So you got out of that fight with a perfect recollection of how it went down.

909
00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:34.400
Right.
But you've had fights before where after the fight,

910
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:38.150
like Groin Nelson Fight Roy Nelson,
uh,
Cro cop,

911
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:41.150
even though I wasn't a croak up fight,
when I look back on like what?

912
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.300
Like someone get,
someone was telling me how I took him down like I did.

913
00:51:44.301 --> 00:51:46.520
I don't remember that.
Yeah.
The Travis Brown fight.

914
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:49.280
I thought it was the upper cut that really fucked me up.

915
00:51:49.281 --> 00:51:52.400
But it was when I went for a take down,
he sprawled,
I land on my neck.

916
00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:57.230
I remember that when I was really fucked up cause Atlanta my neck and it
rattled,

917
00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:02.300
rattled me.
Tj grant got his concussion.
So exact way.

918
00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:05.540
Yeah.
People don't realize that.
Like,
you know,
when two guys are shooting,

919
00:52:05.541 --> 00:52:08.630
what won't got shooting for take down with the guys trying to defend that hip to

920
00:52:08.631 --> 00:52:10.850
the face as super common.
Super Common.

921
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.940
Belle rive very rarely watch my fights back.
And then I watched this,
the,
the uh,

922
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:20.590
the trash brown fight pilot,
I don't know,
right after the fight.
And,
uh,
I watch,

923
00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:23.840
I'm like,
Oh,
I'm not the same guy.
So you got him rattled,

924
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:26.980
you got rattled and then you've got rattled again with the punch.
Yeah.
Yeah.

925
00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:31.520
So one,
two,
after it routed me,
then I can watch my movement and um,

926
00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:35.150
I'm real slow and our whole game plan was to avoid getting back to the cage.

927
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.300
I go straight back to the cage and hands down.
Oh Wow.
That's not mean.

928
00:52:38.301 --> 00:52:42.620
We trained 12 weeks to avoid that.
Yeah.
Hey,
trauma man,

929
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:47.270
him trauma.
So in a perfect world grounded,
it's,
it's six months and um,

930
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:52.100
you know,
it's six months.
I wonder what a neurologist would say.
Me Too.

931
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.053
You know,

932
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.650
someone who really understands head trauma from like a physical,

933
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:58.800
like just te,
te,
te,

934
00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:03.650
just breaking it down to the actual physical components of the brain and all the

935
00:53:03.651 --> 00:53:06.080
connective tissue and what kind of damage was done.

936
00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.760
And you look at it with an MRI and you find look for inflammation and what,

937
00:53:09.761 --> 00:53:13.850
what are the issues?
I agree.
I think a caching,
I'll tell you this though,

938
00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:18.940
if there's anyone who can pull it out of her ass and get a win with that amount

939
00:53:19.131 --> 00:53:20.680
of time at six months with that schedule,

940
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:24.350
it's Ronda Rousey with her tenacity and everyone's saying,
oh,

941
00:53:24.351 --> 00:53:28.860
she should have left camp for her.
That's,
that's fire for the fuel.
So for her,

942
00:53:28.861 --> 00:53:31.850
I think fuel for the fire,
fuel for the fire my back,
she's gonna,

943
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:36.240
she's gonna use that and really take it to another level,
which is scary,

944
00:53:36.241 --> 00:53:40.080
but same time,
is that the best way to go?
I don't think so.

945
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:44.880
It is interesting in the UFC as opposed to other combat sports where the in

946
00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.910
other corn bed spores,
the champion is in the driver's seat.

947
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:52.650
Like Roy Jones Jr.
When Roy Jones Jr was the champ of the world,

948
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:54.420
there was a Roy Jones show.
Okay.

949
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:57.260
He was in the goddamn driver's seat and everybody else just,

950
00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:01.650
you got to wait with your fucking warm wet towel to wash his balls and someone

951
00:54:01.651 --> 00:54:03.330
else got to be there with a towel to dry them off.

952
00:54:03.331 --> 00:54:07.140
Like this is the Roy Jones Jr show.
Okay,
whoever wants it,
is it HBO?

953
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:10.800
Is it pay per view?
But they're lining up to see Roy Jones.
It's not the agree,

954
00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.670
the WBC,
you know,
WBC boxing.

955
00:54:14.671 --> 00:54:17.730
It didn't mean that he could have thrown those fucking belts in the trash and

956
00:54:17.731 --> 00:54:21.660
fought everybody and we'd still,
nobody would care.
Nobody would care.
I think.

957
00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.270
I think with Holly it's tough cause she,

958
00:54:24.271 --> 00:54:27.300
she has this tremendous skill set and she's such a good person,

959
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:32.550
but you know,
it's kind of like the Chris Weidman effect.
They're so damn good.

960
00:54:32.551 --> 00:54:36.630
But now we see the Conor McGregor and the Ronda Rousey's like Holly,
right?

961
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.330
Rhonda is on the WHO and I took all the seat cause I said,

962
00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:42.720
I don't think there's any other girl who can carry up paper view main event like

963
00:54:42.721 --> 00:54:44.850
Rhonda right now.
There's just not going to happen.

964
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.420
So I get all this heat and I know you disagree a little bit.
I got all the seat.

965
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.410
But uh,
Holly beat Ronda,
right?
Holly on top of the world,

966
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:54.390
Holly's done on the front cover.
You have to be in the magazine.

967
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:57.630
Holly's not doing interviews like lemon,
but it just happened.
It just happened.

968
00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.930
I'm just saying.
Yeah,
but this is just is just,
this just happened.

969
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:05.820
Holly is now the thing in MMA.
She's the number one story.

970
00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:09.510
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That's not true.
She's the number one story.
No wrong girl.

971
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:11.040
The girl knocked out.

972
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:14.440
Rhonda is the number one story because she's the winner in this.
I disagree.

973
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:18.240
I disagree with you because she's the winner in this.
Jesus' successor.

974
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:22.110
She might not be as famous as Rhonda,
but she's got the momentum.

975
00:55:22.111 --> 00:55:25.200
She's the winner.
She's the one right now.
Who's the champion?

976
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.270
She's the one night now that people like,
wow,

977
00:55:27.271 --> 00:55:31.980
what a fucking performance by Holly Holm eyes are on her now as far as creating

978
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:35.430
a brighter,
I think all eyes are on Rhonda.
Can't she bounce back from this?

979
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:38.550
All this stuff.
There's going to be two way more than that.

980
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:41.190
Ronda lost in that fight.

981
00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:44.910
Holly One whop really is the story right now.

982
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.690
She's the winter other than Aldo and McGregor and for the hardcore fans,

983
00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:53.520
why been and Rockhold Holly Holm is the fucking story.
She's story.
I agree.

984
00:55:53.521 --> 00:55:56.010
She should be in my eyes.
She's the story.
I agree.

985
00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:59.460
She should get more notoriety than anyone right now.
I think that,

986
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:02.340
and I think if marketed correctly,

987
00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:05.160
she has the potential to be fucking gigantic.

988
00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:08.280
Could she be as big as Rhonda is Rhonda as big as she is because she's an

989
00:56:08.281 --> 00:56:11.850
antagonist and she's big as she is because she's the person who says all that

990
00:56:11.851 --> 00:56:16.200
crazy shit fucks with girls and you know she's got that fucking,
you know,

991
00:56:16.201 --> 00:56:19.920
attitude about her and comes out to that Joan Jett song and was beaten girls

992
00:56:19.921 --> 00:56:23.890
acids and was pulling it off.
Is that what it was?
Check,
check,
check,
check.

993
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:29.220
When a Holly Holm comes along and shows you an alternative approach and an

994
00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:34.510
approach that ultimately is more successful against that one person who we have

995
00:56:34.511 --> 00:56:37.600
one fight and other,
that white fight,
one fight between the two of them.

996
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:42.460
Holly's flawless,
right?
Flawless performance.
Why doesn't make any sense?

997
00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:45.430
I mean is there a,
we do we have a limited amount of fucking superstars?

998
00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.150
Is there a limited amount of female champs that becomes huge,
I think.
No,

999
00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:52.090
I think Holly has all the ingredients.
She does not,

1000
00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:55.840
it's not gonna be the same kind of star because I doubt there'll be as many

1001
00:56:55.841 --> 00:56:56.710
people who hate her,

1002
00:56:57.490 --> 00:57:01.900
but that hate also fueled pay per view buys people that were happy when Ronda

1003
00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:02.291
lost,

1004
00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:06.880
there's all this extra reality TV shit that's going on with a Ronda Rousey's.

1005
00:57:06.881 --> 00:57:11.210
She crossed over to the pop culture so everyone was chiming in,
crossed over,
not,

1006
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:15.370
I mean like it.
She became like this cultural icon globally.

1007
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:19.810
She became a big and the first woman ever that was like this ass kicker like

1008
00:57:19.811 --> 00:57:22.450
that that looked like her.
There's never been one of those.
I agree.

1009
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:25.720
So Holly comes along,
he's going to be a difference.
Yes.

1010
00:57:25.721 --> 00:57:29.860
Kind of star told she can be a big star.
I think Holly's going to be a big star.

1011
00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:31.970
She's not going to be Rhonda stuff.
She's,
I can't get the paper.

1012
00:57:31.971 --> 00:57:35.680
Even numbers like Rhonda,
I don't know about that man.
You might.

1013
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:37.420
Hopefully I'm wrong.
I'm wrong.

1014
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:42.460
I think Callie's the greatest thing that happened to lose division in a long,

1015
00:57:42.461 --> 00:57:45.340
long time,
but she's a great person.
And if I had a daughter,

1016
00:57:45.341 --> 00:57:49.420
I can point to Hallington that you can act like her.
This is good.
I agree.
Again,

1017
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:51.490
we can't say that for a very long time.
Right?

1018
00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:56.640
I agree 100% she's a classic example of like an honorable mixed martial arts

1019
00:57:57.851 --> 00:57:59.020
competitors.
What you want,

1020
00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:02.020
she's interested in martial artist and she acts like a true champion.
Yes.

1021
00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:06.610
Trupro I think that with the right fights she could be gigantic.

1022
00:58:06.611 --> 00:58:10.030
So this is her mainstream what?
Coming out party,
right?

1023
00:58:10.031 --> 00:58:13.840
She knocks out Ronda Rousey,
this giant upset this huge performance.

1024
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:18.070
She looks spectacular.
This is a coming out party and then she find someone else.

1025
00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:22.330
You don't necessarily have to have this rematch right away and I think this also

1026
00:58:22.331 --> 00:58:25.240
sets the seeds up for other people to get attention.

1027
00:58:25.241 --> 00:58:27.400
Like tats in Ghana who knocked out Meisha Tate.

1028
00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:32.330
Remember that fucking fight 10 Zingano didn't charge after Ronda like that would

1029
00:58:32.331 --> 00:58:35.650
have cat was able to stuff to take down and turn that fight into a fucking Bra.

1030
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:40.510
Who knows what fight we missed out on because cat decided to throw out a crazy

1031
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:42.950
flying the worst game plan of all time in UFC sheet.

1032
00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:48.010
She probably meant that to you 100% sure,
but she is a fucking bad ass.

1033
00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:50.480
Hell yeah.
She grows up fat ass suit.

1034
00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:55.540
That fight with me should take when she hits her with that overhand elbow lack,

1035
00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:57.580
I mean,
oh see she's nasty.

1036
00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:02.230
I think in they're all so close in the women's division at one 35 I think

1037
00:59:02.231 --> 00:59:04.960
Callie's going to struggle with Tate and Kat.

1038
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:07.690
I think she's the perfect Achilles heel for Rhonda.

1039
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:11.380
I think these other match ups are a lot tougher for they might be and then

1040
00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:15.620
sometimes that's interesting.
Sometimes styles make fights mass.

1041
00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.730
The media needs a dominant champion man.
To be a superstar,

1042
00:59:18.731 --> 00:59:22.310
you need to be dominant.
Yeah,
I don't know man.

1043
00:59:22.311 --> 00:59:25.640
I think rivalries are great too.
Sugary Leonard,
when he lost to Roberto,

1044
00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:28.910
Duran got even more famous and then when they did it again in the rematch,

1045
00:59:28.911 --> 00:59:32.660
the no mas fight,
that fight was gigantic.
Oh yeah,
those guys are bad ass.

1046
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:36.920
I don't think a cat Zingano and,
and you can compute a cat and then got on.

1047
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:41.330
Those guys are respectfully,
I agree.
Just Joe.
You're right,
you're right.

1048
00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:43.360
Phenomenal fights.

1049
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:47.150
We're talking about moments in time where people were popular with their finding

1050
00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:50.630
women to have a top talent and tech dominant champ.

1051
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:55.130
Dominic about that man.
If Holly goes out and face kicks,

1052
00:59:55.131 --> 00:59:58.790
Tate in the first round,
then gets captain Ghana and drops.
All right?

1053
00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:02.330
Now we fucking got some,
but she loses it.
Tastes like that.
Fuck.

1054
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:05.420
Now here's another thing,
and I hate to be the jinx here.

1055
01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.980
I had to be the guy that talks about this,

1056
01:00:06.981 --> 01:00:11.981
but for a girl like Rhonda and who's going to go into movies and is gonna,

1057
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:17.890
you know,
take off and become this,
she's fine either way,
but issuing,

1058
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.130
because do people want to see those movies the same way they wanted to see those

1059
01:00:22.131 --> 01:00:27.131
movies when she was smashing Alexis Davis and armbarring Misha Tate knocking out

1060
01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:32.000
Batchko Hey,
uh,
do,
is there that same draw?
Well,
I'll say this.

1061
01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:36.050
I don't think people are going to Rhonda movies cause she's a phenomenal
actress.

1062
01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:39.260
Does that make sense?
Like,
I'm not going to see Ron's moocs.
You got to see her.

1063
01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:42.470
You got to see her act in this sheet is amazing.
She is.

1064
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:46.290
She wouldn't go to see her because she's supposed to Ronda Rousey because she

1065
01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:50.780
supposedly the baddest woman on the planet.
Yes.
Now Holly Holm shut her down.

1066
01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:54.080
Yeah.
So now Holly is thought to be the baddest woman on the planet,
correct?

1067
01:00:54.081 --> 01:00:56.510
Right.
Correct.
If,
unless she fight Cyborg,

1068
01:00:56.511 --> 01:00:59.570
if they figure out a catch weight fight,
you know,
in,
in MMA,

1069
01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.510
that's really the big scary fight for her for sure.
You know,

1070
01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:06.980
and she said she would fight her.
Yeah.
She's,
she's fought at one 52 in boxing.

1071
01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:11.660
You know,
Holly Holm,
she's,
she's gangster.
But I mean,

1072
01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:15.410
I think other than,
I mean,
what,
what would you do if you were,

1073
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.090
if you were the promoter,
let me ask you this.

1074
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:18.920
What would you do if I'm dating a white?
Yes.

1075
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:23.670
Scrooge McDuck if I'm you up scrooge McDuck Dana White.

1076
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.900
Well,
I find a rebound right now,
by the way,

1077
01:01:26.901 --> 01:01:30.590
I say scrooge McDuck ice crazy scrooge McDuck like three or four times a week

1078
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:34.510
now,
strictly because of you.
I was like,
see,

1079
01:01:34.511 --> 01:01:38.330
he sent me this text the other day with a picture of scrooge McDuck sitting on a

1080
01:01:38.331 --> 01:01:43.190
pile of gold and I was just laughing,
laughing.
My,
I love that character.

1081
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:46.010
If I'm Dana White,
I,
uh,

1082
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:52.100
I do exactly what he's doing with you.
The,
the,
the,

1083
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:53.330
what about the long game?

1084
01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:58.340
How much money do you need in the bank before you start looking at the long
game?

1085
01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:02.210
Well,
your,
your cash cows,
Ronda Rousey,
right?
That's right.

1086
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:07.490
But how much
is he so close to Rhonda?

1087
01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.790
Is he one of these guys saying,
Oh,
you just need to fight her again,
health,

1088
01:02:10.791 --> 01:02:12.110
get healthy and you're going to beat her.

1089
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:13.910
And then he's thinking the long game there.

1090
01:02:13.911 --> 01:02:16.250
And then the third fights can be even bigger.
Well,

1091
01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:21.280
it could be that he has 100% faith in her and he thinks that of Rhonda cuts the

1092
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:22.500
distractions out of our life,

1093
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:27.680
comes back and focused and attacks and does the fight the correct way that

1094
01:02:28.201 --> 01:02:31.950
she'll win.
He could think that.
And I think that's a bad way to think.

1095
01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:34.350
I think then you need to jump in line in your yes man,

1096
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.870
because someone needs to sit her down back.
Listen,

1097
01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.020
I just think we need to work on some things.
That's should be the plan is,

1098
01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:46.830
here's the other thing,
like there's no evidence of that.
Like if you're gonna,

1099
01:02:46.831 --> 01:02:50.370
if you're gonna look at a fight and you're gonna look at a result and you're

1100
01:02:50.371 --> 01:02:54.090
going to assess what went wrong,
what went right,
what could be changed,

1101
01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.620
what could be different?
There's no evidence that she could've done it better.

1102
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:02.640
And what I'm,
what I mean is not that she couldn't have fought better.

1103
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:06.960
What I mean is that we don't have any evidence.
Our only evidence is Ron,

1104
01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:09.090
his past fights and Holly's past fights.

1105
01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:12.540
It's all we can go off of the evidence of the first fight that they had.

1106
01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.190
It was a domination by Holly.

1107
01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:16.710
So there's no evidence that Rhonda could have done better.

1108
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:20.910
What would you have to look at it?
Technically you have to look at,

1109
01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:25.530
you have to look at the attacks,
the interactions,
the exchanges,
right?

1110
01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:29.460
So they have these exchanges inside the octagon and in those exchanges,

1111
01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:30.990
Holly had all the answers.

1112
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.290
She had all the answers and she had the right strategy and the right movements,

1113
01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:38.700
and you saw her reacting to things that she knew were going to take place.

1114
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.300
The left hand goes for the clench.
She's moving it away.

1115
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:46.590
She's landing counter shots.
She lands that beautiful counter,
straight left.

1116
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:49.950
She's throwing that oblique kick.

1117
01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:53.280
She's attacking the knee with that and then thigh without oblique kick.

1118
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.960
She does that thing fast too.
She's,
and she's very agile.
True.

1119
01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:01.320
So you look at that and you look at these interactions,
you go,
well,

1120
01:04:01.321 --> 01:04:03.780
there's a lot of work to be done here.
There's a lot.

1121
01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:07.990
This is not just a simple matter of someone being tired.
Somebody like you,

1122
01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:12.180
you have to solve technical issues,
giant technical issues.

1123
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:15.030
And so do you just chalked it up to,
you know what,

1124
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.300
we just need to get your healthy cause you just gotta do what you do.

1125
01:04:18.301 --> 01:04:20.900
She does what she do and hopefully it's good enough if not either way to be

1126
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:24.150
payday.
I think you give her time.
I think you have to give her time.

1127
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:28.400
Manny Pacquiao got knocked out by one memo.
Marcus,
that's a mouthful.

1128
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.540
When you got your coffee in your face stuff,

1129
01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:34.800
Juan manwell Marquez knocks out Manny Pacquiao and Freddie Roach says to him,

1130
01:04:34.801 --> 01:04:38.130
you can't fight for a year and we're not doing nothing for a year.

1131
01:04:38.131 --> 01:04:40.890
I want you to rest up.
Cause it was a brutal.
Now I liked that.
It is.

1132
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:44.820
Well look at Freddy Roach.
Freddie Roach has trauma related Parkinson's from his,

1133
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:49.620
his career in boxing.
I think what he did is smart.
It's ethical,

1134
01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.720
it's intelligent and it's correct.

1135
01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:55.980
And he did it because he's a guy who's experienced the effects of not doing
that,

1136
01:04:55.981 --> 01:04:57.080
of being,
you know,

1137
01:04:57.090 --> 01:05:00.210
rattled inside the cage and he did it because he wanted the best result for

1138
01:05:00.211 --> 01:05:02.580
Manny.
So Manny comes back a year later,

1139
01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.120
it doesn't look like he's had any ill effects cause that knockout,

1140
01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:06.900
he looked great because he fully healed.

1141
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.060
Now how many guys are we seeing come back?

1142
01:05:09.061 --> 01:05:13.380
Like Anderson Silva gets knocked out by Chris Weidman just brutally knocked out,

1143
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.311
comes back,

1144
01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:18.070
and then the second fight gets dropped in the first round from a punch in the

1145
01:05:18.071 --> 01:05:19.690
clinch,
which you know,

1146
01:05:19.691 --> 01:05:23.590
probably wouldn't have dropped him a few years ago looking at Leo Cheetah.
Yeah,

1147
01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:24.371
exactly.

1148
01:05:24.371 --> 01:05:29.050
You get to a certain point where you've taken enough damage where if you don't

1149
01:05:29.051 --> 01:05:31.690
allow your body to fully recover from that damage,

1150
01:05:31.691 --> 01:05:34.330
you're going to have a diminished ability to absorb punishment.

1151
01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:38.020
I'll tell you this,
man,
I don't Envy Dana White.
I don't even think decision.

1152
01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:40.180
I don't either.
He looked to hell of vaginal envy.

1153
01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:44.200
He doesn't have time to have a perspective like you and I do either.

1154
01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:48.550
You've got to realize this fucking guy is 24 seven making calls,

1155
01:05:48.551 --> 01:05:50.940
setting up meetings,
doing this fly in here,

1156
01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:54.010
doing this press conference and that and this thing and that thing.

1157
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:58.840
Dana White's life is fucking overwhelming for him.
It's also a business too.
Yes.

1158
01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:01.510
He used,
well you got,
you and I are not trying to make money.

1159
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:05.470
We're looking at it in terms of like,
okay,
what is,
what do you think is,

1160
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.980
if you had to move all the pieces on the Board in order to achieve checkmate in

1161
01:06:08.981 --> 01:06:12.510
order to achieve the best result,
what's the move?
What's the mood?
What do you do?

1162
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:15.910
Just just go all in.
You know,
do I don't,
I don't think you do.

1163
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:19.090
I don't think you do.
I think you have to be real careful when you also,

1164
01:06:19.091 --> 01:06:22.240
you have to be real careful.
You have a big superstar,
right?

1165
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:26.500
Like Rhonda and your big superstar gets flatlined.
Okay.

1166
01:06:26.501 --> 01:06:30.430
That is probably the worst result.
If you want women to get into MMA,

1167
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:32.950
you want women to like come up.
Like,
you know,

1168
01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:36.520
we want to have a lot more people that are really into fighting a lot more women

1169
01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:36.880
that are into it.

1170
01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:41.350
And then you watch the number one woman ditches fucking blasted into the middle

1171
01:06:41.351 --> 01:06:46.270
of the universe.
Okay.
Yeah.
T like Michael Chevelle says astral traveling.

1172
01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:48.850
That's Alexa love Chavela.

1173
01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:54.940
So if that happens again and she suffers like serious repercussions,

1174
01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:58.750
now you've got a real problem with your sport.
Well now the story is over though.

1175
01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:01.480
Yeah.
The story's over stories over.
Yeah.
And you know,

1176
01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:04.720
and I think the story doesn't have to be over.
I think this is a,

1177
01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:08.980
this is obviously there's some lessons to be learned from that fight,
right?

1178
01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:11.800
Technically a strategy wise,
the,
the,

1179
01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:15.490
like when you're chasing after a striker,
you know,
sure.

1180
01:07:15.491 --> 01:07:17.560
Of in the reaction of the public side.
Absolutely.

1181
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:20.590
But when you're chasing after a striker,
that shit is never a good idea.

1182
01:07:20.591 --> 01:07:21.910
Especially if you don't have good head movement.

1183
01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:26.500
Like chasing a striker like Holly who is so agile and you have knee problems so

1184
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:29.740
you're not the most agile.
So you've got knee,
knee problems,
you've got to grow.

1185
01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:31.450
Does flips at the end of every fight.

1186
01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.700
At the end of every fight she stands on her trainer's hands,

1187
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:36.490
Winkle Mike Winkeljohn flips or through the air and she goes flying like a

1188
01:07:36.491 --> 01:07:39.400
fucking acrobat.
Lazy.
Yeah,
and she never misses it,
right?
She,

1189
01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:44.110
she nails it every time.
Amazing.
She's an athlete.
She's a fucking super athlete.

1190
01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.420
Just like Rhonda,
I'll go you one better.

1191
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:48.790
She might be a better athlete because if you look at her,

1192
01:07:48.791 --> 01:07:51.730
she never gets out of shape.
She's totally ripped.
She's like,

1193
01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:55.680
her body is optimized.
Right?
If you want to look at someone's whose,

1194
01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.940
whose bodies optimized,
you would say,
well,

1195
01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:01.120
here's a girl who a has a minimal amount of body fat.

1196
01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.460
She's got a good amount of muscle.

1197
01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:07.270
Like you could tell she works hard and is in phenomenal shape.

1198
01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.380
The two of them fighting in the first round,
Ronda comes back exhausted.

1199
01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:15.220
Holly's not,
they both thought the same round.

1200
01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:17.990
Rhonda is exhausted.
Holly's not.

1201
01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.840
Is it because of the punishment she took that probably had something to do with

1202
01:08:20.841 --> 01:08:23.720
it.
It's also that she fights too.
It's also the way she fights.
Yes,

1203
01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:25.910
but that's a part of being an athlete.
I agree.

1204
01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:28.370
Part of being an athlete is making smart choices.
I agree.

1205
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:29.990
Especially at combat sports athlete,

1206
01:08:29.991 --> 01:08:33.440
making smart choices and adjusting it's life and death.
Yes.

1207
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:38.110
And adjusting or losing it.
Yeah.
Yep.
Made adjusting mid fight is,

1208
01:08:38.111 --> 01:08:41.060
is critical and having off speed,

1209
01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:45.080
different rhythms to rely upon is never have to make,
he's,

1210
01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.560
she's never had to make those adjustments and then you're not to make them with

1211
01:08:48.561 --> 01:08:53.060
a superior athlete and then you're like,
ah,
fuck.
Exactly.
You know,

1212
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:56.150
I had a buddy who wanted to do MMA and uh,

1213
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:59.720
he's a Brazilian jujitsu black belt and he was doing very minimal striking

1214
01:08:59.721 --> 01:09:02.090
training and we talked about it and I said,
look dude,

1215
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.970
do you know like what you can do to a white belt?
You know,

1216
01:09:04.971 --> 01:09:07.580
that feeling where you get in there and you roll with a guy and he's a wipe out

1217
01:09:07.581 --> 01:09:10.200
and you just fucking strangle them.
Just wrap them up,
strangling me,

1218
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.053
do whatever you want.

1219
01:09:11.230 --> 01:09:13.830
Somebody who's going to do that to you with kickboxing and it ain't fun.

1220
01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:17.150
There's no end to happen.
Yeah.
It's not fun at all.
And you can't think that it's,

1221
01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:21.980
they don't know because even though kickboxing,
I don't think there's the same,

1222
01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:22.820
um,

1223
01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:27.440
a broadness that there is in Jujitsu where I think Jujitsu is almost like never

1224
01:09:27.441 --> 01:09:29.870
ending as far as techniques.
Yes.

1225
01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:34.700
But kickboxing has so much depth,
like real high level,

1226
01:09:34.701 --> 01:09:39.410
kickboxing is so much depth and there's so much,
there's so much.
Uh,

1227
01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:42.770
there's so many variables with guys who are really good,

1228
01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:47.120
who have like very specific like styles and way to draw you in and they set

1229
01:09:47.121 --> 01:09:50.870
traps for you and you think they're doing this and they're doing that and

1230
01:09:50.871 --> 01:09:53.880
they're setting up kicks with punches and punches with kicks and you know,

1231
01:09:53.881 --> 01:09:56.580
they're,
they're trapping you in meeting you and elbow and you in the face.

1232
01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.070
There's so much going on man,

1233
01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:02.120
that if you think that you're just going to go in there with some bullshit guy

1234
01:10:02.121 --> 01:10:05.930
who holds the pads and you know,
uses those,
those pool floaties.
Oh,

1235
01:10:05.931 --> 01:10:08.700
you're near taps your gloves,
your it.
Yeah.
Or You just have no,

1236
01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:12.320
you just have no idea what you're getting into,
which is very unsafe.
Very unsafe.

1237
01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:13.820
So you better be one of two things.

1238
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:19.030
You better be some fucking Stud Phil Davis type all American wrestler who could

1239
01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:21.170
just pretty much take down anybody in the division.

1240
01:10:21.171 --> 01:10:25.130
So you get to dictate where the fight takes place or don't fight that guy.

1241
01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.280
Learn how to fucking kickbox first man.
Learn cause this is,

1242
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.980
you're going to get shinned and you get shunned in the head.

1243
01:10:30.981 --> 01:10:33.800
That is one of the worst results you could ever have.
An MMA pepper.

1244
01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:37.790
If somebody's arm bars you,
you tap.
If somebody's checking you out,
you wake up,

1245
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:40.280
you wake up and go,
what happened?
And you're,
you're okay.

1246
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:44.900
You get fucking Gonzaga in the head.
Like Gabriel Gonzaga knocked out Cro,

1247
01:10:44.901 --> 01:10:49.640
cop or what?
Cro?
Cop knocked out.
Vandelay Jesus Croak up.
I mean,

1248
01:10:49.641 --> 01:10:52.820
you know,
uh,
can Zack is fighting I think tonight or tomorrow night,

1249
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.750
he's on this car.
Do you know that?
I had no idea.
I had no idea.
I have no idea.

1250
01:10:56.751 --> 01:11:01.130
Who's he fighting?
He's fighting some Russian cat.
Some.
Yeah,

1251
01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.980
he's on the undercard.
How crazy is that?
I was going through the pike.
I'm like,

1252
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.970
Ooh,
Shit.
Gonzaga's doing the damn thing cause it tonight.

1253
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:13.440
Is He fighting tonight crust?
Where is that?

1254
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:18.480
<v 0>I don't see it.
I don't see it on the schedule.
Oh,
that's tomorrow.
Oh,</v>

1255
01:11:18.481 --> 01:11:22.290
it's tomorrow night.
Okay.
Surprising though.
Right?
I had no idea.

1256
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:26.290
35 fights in three days.
What is going on with that?
What was,

1257
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:28.830
what's the idea behind that?
I should probably ask.

1258
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:32.070
I feel like you'd know more than I would.
I should.
Should know more than you do.

1259
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.310
What's wrong with me?
I don't know for sure.
Just texts.
Dana.
He's on your return.

1260
01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:39.840
My texts.
He would do it during your ducks.
None of us like,

1261
01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:43.860
hey man,
what the fuck fights bro.
Why are you guys doing?

1262
01:11:43.861 --> 01:11:47.550
Why you guys fuck it up so hard?
But I think it's amazing.

1263
01:11:47.551 --> 01:11:51.690
It's a Christmas weekend for fighters fans rather phenomenal.

1264
01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.550
Nothing matters except for UFC one 94 Constantine year broken.
Yeah.
Okay.

1265
01:11:56.551 --> 01:12:01.020
That guy's a beast.
It's a big fucking tough Russian guy.
That's interesting.

1266
01:12:01.021 --> 01:12:05.880
Fight man.
Yeah.
I can saga Gonzaga.
So scary when he was,
when he was,

1267
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:09.000
oh,
you can saga.
I wonder if he's trying to do now.
You know,

1268
01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:13.620
what if he's just making a living or if he wants to reassess.

1269
01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:18.360
And I mean,
how always hold is he now?
I mean,

1270
01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:22.170
what does it say?
A guy like Gonzaga though,
like

1271
01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.160
35 or 36,
right?
This sucks to say,

1272
01:12:26.161 --> 01:12:30.720
but it's like he's never gonna be champion.
That's not happening.

1273
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.241
And you can say,

1274
01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:36.410
well that's not necessarily true because look at where are you going to say mark

1275
01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:39.570
[inaudible] something like that.
It's just tough,
man.

1276
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:42.090
He's going to have a hard time for sure.

1277
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:48.480
Your boy Mitzrian look really good against him.
You look great.
Mitch runs fast.

1278
01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:52.260
And that's the thing like Gonzaga,
when he gets on the scale,
you know,

1279
01:12:52.261 --> 01:12:54.540
and got Kazakus steps on the platform.
When he weighs in,

1280
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.350
it's almost like he's made out of rock.
So Dad,
he's in the way.

1281
01:12:58.351 --> 01:12:59.620
He moved like [inaudible].

1282
01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:04.150
Like even Brock Lesnar didn't make that kind of noise when he got onto the

1283
01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:08.500
consomme is so dense.
I,
before I fought him in Anaheim,
uh,

1284
01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:12.410
I remember walking by him and we're actually scanned on the fires bus.

1285
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:16.840
I see him in Starbucks eating to glazed donuts.
I was like,
God did.

1286
01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:20.430
And I read my mind.
I was like,
Goddamn,
that's gangster.
You didn't give a fuck.

1287
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:24.360
He doesn't give a fuck.
Let's get that guy the right way to approach it,

1288
01:13:24.361 --> 01:13:29.010
but fuck it that Shane Carwyn fight that fight.
Oh my God.

1289
01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.260
He was kind of whipping Shane's ass and Shane's what?
He caught it.

1290
01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:37.150
He caught Shane and had him hurt and he moved in for the kill chain,
Dan.

1291
01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:38.280
I was like,
Oh shit.

1292
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:41.580
And then Shane got up and just do like this half ass kind of just like a flick

1293
01:13:41.581 --> 01:13:46.020
of the wrist,
just a little and knocked him out while he threw a right hand.

1294
01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:50.430
It was so,
just a little like this right hand.
Yeah.
Shane hit home so hard.

1295
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:54.480
God,
it's so fucking hard.
Yeah.
There's like,

1296
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:58.830
there's going to be a wave of those guys,
man.
It's going to take a few years.

1297
01:13:58.831 --> 01:14:03.180
Maybe.
You know these elite wrestlers that are coming up that are learning how to

1298
01:14:03.181 --> 01:14:05.220
strike when they're in high school,
you know,

1299
01:14:05.221 --> 01:14:08.310
and they're competing as wrestlers and they're gonna make it into the UFC.

1300
01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:11.440
And the next couple of years,
especially as the money gets bigger,

1301
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.690
like there's no money has to get bigger.
You know,

1302
01:14:13.691 --> 01:14:16.930
there's no doubt that February Silverdome is like a super talented super

1303
01:14:16.931 --> 01:14:17.764
skillful guy,

1304
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:22.840
but the public's consciousness and the awareness of him is not nearly as high as

1305
01:14:22.841 --> 01:14:25.780
it was when Cain beat Brock Lesner.
Right.

1306
01:14:25.781 --> 01:14:29.260
That was the height of the heavyweight division.
Right.
When you say B and the,

1307
01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:33.940
I think it's mainly due because of Brock Brock because cane junior dos Santos,

1308
01:14:33.941 --> 01:14:34.721
that was awesome too.

1309
01:14:34.721 --> 01:14:39.610
Superior athletes going on it but still not the same because Brock Brock brought

1310
01:14:39.611 --> 01:14:41.950
some new element,
the,
you know,

1311
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:45.700
he brought the world wrestling entertainment people,

1312
01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:50.720
but I think in order to get those,
those big boys,
those freak athletes involved,

1313
01:14:50.721 --> 01:14:53.620
the money would have to be able to come up half the value of those football guys

1314
01:14:53.670 --> 01:14:55.890
who are,
you know,
interested in giving it a shot because you know,

1315
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:58.510
I have a kid on the way in.
If he's anything like Brock Lesnar,

1316
01:14:58.570 --> 01:15:02.800
a little bastards not fighting,
you better go get that money in baseball.
Nfl.

1317
01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:06.700
Yeah.
D,
what would you worry about?
NFL head collisions and all that shit.

1318
01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:10.330
Not as much because the juice is worth the squeeze.

1319
01:15:10.331 --> 01:15:14.500
Not as much as fighting because fighting,
I mean like,
like I retired,

1320
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:19.240
I got an Instagram posts,
said hey man,
congrats.
And then uh,
like an email,

1321
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:23.710
you know,
you retired in the NFL,
you time that a fell,
you know,
you've got some,

1322
01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:27.220
you got some shit coming your way and so it's just different fuel only had like

1323
01:15:27.221 --> 01:15:31.090
a couple of years in a,
if you have a three and a half years or more,

1324
01:15:31.091 --> 01:15:34.060
you get a stipend every month you have health insurance is really me.
Yeah,

1325
01:15:34.061 --> 01:15:35.920
you're pretty taken care of.
Wow.

1326
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:38.710
That's nice to certain levels to a certain degree.
How much you played.

1327
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:42.160
That's nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That would be ideal.

1328
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:46.390
If fighters new you think so?
The UFC I get there.
They have to,

1329
01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:50.250
they have to think so they know that.
Yeah.
They know that like,

1330
01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:53.380
and this isn't a knock on Dana white or Lorenzo,
anything like that.

1331
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:56.320
We're just in the,
we basically have leather helmets on right now,

1332
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:58.510
you know what I'm saying?
If you go back,
if you commit to the NFL,

1333
01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:01.690
they're going to get there.
They take all this heat.
Even I give him shit,

1334
01:16:01.691 --> 01:16:04.450
but it's so new,
man.
They're trying their best.

1335
01:16:04.451 --> 01:16:06.610
This stuff does not happen overnight.
Don't you think?

1336
01:16:06.611 --> 01:16:08.710
It almost has to pass through a few generations,

1337
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:12.520
like maybe a like what is this sport going to be like 50 years from now and

1338
01:16:12.521 --> 01:16:15.130
Dana's on around anymore.
I mean when we're not around anymore,

1339
01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.420
what is the support going to be like then?

1340
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:18.490
Like maybe you know when you look back at football,

1341
01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:21.430
football's been around a long fucking time.

1342
01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:25.120
I long fucking time and it's slowly gotten to this point.

1343
01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:29.350
I think what MMA really needs right now is competition.

1344
01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:33.070
They need a lot of competition and Bella tours just,

1345
01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:36.820
you're not going to get there with.off 5,000 and Kimbo slice.

1346
01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:40.180
It's just like it's a good fight.
It'd be fun to watch.
I'm sure.

1347
01:16:40.450 --> 01:16:45.400
Hoists Gracie versus Ken shamrock three.
Look,
they're legends they deserve.

1348
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:48.670
They deserve to fight.
If they want to fight,
they have earned it.

1349
01:16:48.671 --> 01:16:52.170
And I know that's something that can,
has alluded to.
He said,
you know,
he does,

1350
01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:57.100
he earned his right to compete.
I agree.
Absolutely.
100% sodas voice.

1351
01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:59.860
Absolutely 100% they deserve the right to compete,

1352
01:16:59.861 --> 01:17:04.360
but it's not the same as the UFC right now.

1353
01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:05.830
And until it becomes,

1354
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.010
until someone comes along and like strike force Kinda almost

1355
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.420
<v 1>had it,
you know,
they were,</v>

1356
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:14.300
they were close before Strikeforce is owned by the UFC.

1357
01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.860
Fader was fighting Brett Rogers and you know,
there was some shit going on.

1358
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:21.740
I was like,
I'm doing well.
Do some shit going on.
It was like,
Whoa,
this is a,

1359
01:17:21.741 --> 01:17:24.200
this is pretty God damn good.
It was pretty God damn good.
See,

1360
01:17:24.201 --> 01:17:28.370
I think the UFC would get there.
We just need time on our side.

1361
01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:31.310
The struggle they're going to have is,
you know,

1362
01:17:31.311 --> 01:17:34.040
the NFL is dealing with a little bit now with the concussion stuff.

1363
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:38.090
I think when MMA down the road we're gonna see the concussion.
It's really been,

1364
01:17:38.091 --> 01:17:40.760
people were like,
dude,
what are we doing?
And the pay is nowhere near.

1365
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:44.420
So when I say the NFL is worth the squeeze because you're taking care of

1366
01:17:44.421 --> 01:17:46.190
compensation white,
why?
So you're,
yeah,

1367
01:17:46.191 --> 01:17:48.860
you're gonna have some fucked up knees and your brains can be oatmeal.

1368
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:51.770
But in the UFC,
I mean man,
like I said,

1369
01:17:51.771 --> 01:17:54.260
you can email and a repost on Instagram,

1370
01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.670
but don't you think that like then it's even more important to make sure that

1371
01:17:58.671 --> 01:18:03.170
someone like Rousey has enough time that Rhonda has enough time off to

1372
01:18:03.171 --> 01:18:08.171
recuperate and you mitigate all potential problems that you could have with her

1373
01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:11.240
getting knocked out again,
100% Joe.
I mean,

1374
01:18:11.241 --> 01:18:16.241
what if this fight takes place and in the first round Holly just fucking slams a

1375
01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:18.020
Shin right into Ron,

1376
01:18:18.021 --> 01:18:22.580
his jaw and she stiffens up and just fall straight back like Terry Edom number,

1377
01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:25.190
everyone,
Teri enema and caught him with that.

1378
01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:28.460
We'll kick just stiffened and fell straight back.
Bang.

1379
01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:31.010
The probability of that happening are very high,
very high.

1380
01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:34.190
But this is what you have to realize.
If you've never been hit before,

1381
01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.860
when you get knocked out like that,
you are not,

1382
01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.460
you can't get hit for a long time.
It's not the same.

1383
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:44.630
It takes a while before you build back the resistance to the get to get to the

1384
01:18:44.631 --> 01:18:46.860
point where you have like a baseline.
You know like your,

1385
01:18:46.861 --> 01:18:49.980
your baseline is like how you are right now.
If you get hit right now like wow,

1386
01:18:49.981 --> 01:18:50.661
that it would hurt,

1387
01:18:50.661 --> 01:18:55.640
but you'd be able to absorb a much better shot than if you had just gotten a

1388
01:18:55.641 --> 01:18:56.474
concussion.

1389
01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.360
Have you just gotten a concussion recently and then you get hit again?

1390
01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:01.670
Your Brendan's like what the F and we've seen it.

1391
01:19:01.671 --> 01:19:04.640
We've seen so many guys get knocked out and then come back a lot of,

1392
01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:06.230
a lot of times it happened,
I'm going to cut you off.

1393
01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:08.120
But a lot of times that happens in camp,

1394
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.920
like the fly dot Rothwell like weeks before Karlyn fucked me up,
man.

1395
01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:18.080
I should and if I was knowledgeable how I am now,
I'd be like,
dude,

1396
01:19:18.081 --> 01:19:21.950
I don't know if I should fight.
This is not good.
But my,
you know,
back in the day,

1397
01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.880
you know,
this is whatever,
three,
four years ago,
they're like,
oh,

1398
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:27.980
just no more spawn.
You'll rest.
Well,
it's two weeks before the fight.

1399
01:19:27.981 --> 01:19:31.580
That's really not enough time.
Not Enough.
So then he has a decent shot at it.

1400
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:34.820
You know,
I've had way worse than he clips me and it's,
you know,
it's tough,
man.

1401
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:38.420
Yeah.
Just shut you off.
Yeah.
Well Joe Duffy,
how about that?

1402
01:19:38.421 --> 01:19:41.510
A week before he was supposed to fight Dustin Poirier he gets knocked out in

1403
01:19:41.511 --> 01:19:46.480
camp.
He gets a concussion and they have to pull them out.
You know,
like teal.
Oh,

1404
01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.120
that's why whenever MMU math people try saying,
well,

1405
01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.600
rock cold Machita Machita Weidman,
mme math doesn't,

1406
01:19:53.601 --> 01:19:56.360
doesn't work for me because I know Machida was not ready to fight.

1407
01:19:56.361 --> 01:19:59.060
When he fought Rockhold I was in his camp.
He was,
we were like,
dude,

1408
01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:03.350
this is not the Machita we know.
So he goes in there,
destroys him,
gets clipped,

1409
01:20:03.351 --> 01:20:05.560
you know,
it's the different Machida.
So that doesn't work for me.

1410
01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:08.010
What was wrong with Machida?
He just needed time

1411
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:12.600
<v 0>off.
His biggest issue is,
is he like,
he'll go right back to sparring.</v>

1412
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:15.360
We're not talking like light sparring and hitting mitts.

1413
01:20:15.361 --> 01:20:20.150
He goes right back to the dog days of sparring as soon as he's done.
So,
you know,

1414
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:21.880
he's getting clipped.
He was having just,

1415
01:20:21.881 --> 01:20:25.080
these are rough time and he just wasn't ready to take that fight.

1416
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:27.510
So you were watching him train and you knew that something was up?

1417
01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:31.290
I think everyone did.
Really?
Yeah.
And so now,
you know,
as he's taking,

1418
01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:35.280
everyone's like,
dude,
you need a break.
So he's taking a long time off.
Um,

1419
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:40.290
he fought Munoz.
Where was that?
In England.
Is that where it was?
Where he,
uh,

1420
01:20:40.291 --> 01:20:44.130
his first fight at one 85 when he had kicked him.
Yeah.
He looks sensation.

1421
01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:48.060
They were training together too.
Yeah,
that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1422
01:20:48.061 --> 01:20:50.070
Cause we are all trained together.
And then I was like,
dude,

1423
01:20:50.071 --> 01:20:53.950
I gotta fight my Cheetah.
And everyone's kind of like,
oh wow.

1424
01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:58.830
But if you watch him from that fight to like the machete,
see now it's like,
man,

1425
01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.060
little shop worn.
Is that some tough fights and Ramiro fire happens.
Yup.

1426
01:21:03.090 --> 01:21:06.240
That happens,
man.
Yeah.
That happened and like,

1427
01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.280
like I think happened with Klitschko.

1428
01:21:08.281 --> 01:21:10.440
I hate going back to buck and I think it just,

1429
01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:13.860
whatever reason it happens that it's a certain fight where like,
oh my God,

1430
01:21:13.861 --> 01:21:17.790
it's not the same guy.
Yeah.
Oh fuck man.
And is it,
is it,
you know,

1431
01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:21.240
Josie always been on feed for 10 years.
He's been through the ringer.

1432
01:21:21.241 --> 01:21:23.970
He's fought the best of the best to me.
He's number one pound for pound.

1433
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:28.110
There's no one better.
You look at his resume,
to me,
he's number fucking one now.

1434
01:21:28.111 --> 01:21:30.350
It's Saturday night.
The time where we seem to like,
oh,

1435
01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.300
that's not the same that we've seen there.
There's gonna come a day.

1436
01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.650
It's just there's going to be a fight unless he retires.
See,

1437
01:21:37.651 --> 01:21:42.630
I think that he is definitely one of the all time greats and I think he's

1438
01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:44.790
definitely one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world.

1439
01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:50.150
But he doesn't fight the same sort of dominance that mighty mouse does.

1440
01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.000
Like he,
he'll beat like Uriah faber down.

1441
01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:59.180
He crushed his leg and beat him down and knocked out Chad Mendez and their first

1442
01:21:59.491 --> 01:22:02.130
fight.
But if you look at like the Ricardo Lamas fight,

1443
01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:05.610
lamas had him on his back and the fifth round he's beating on them.
So Dominic,

1444
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.700
Dominic,
he fades towards the end.

1445
01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:11.910
And if you look at the fight with Chad Mendez as a fucking very,

1446
01:22:11.911 --> 01:22:14.650
very close fight,
that second fight,
I'm and fight fires.

1447
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:19.170
I think 40 fives more stock than mighty mouth.
Mm.
Amazing.
More stacked.

1448
01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:22.950
I think he's that tougher.
Cuts hit certainly a good argument.
However,

1449
01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:27.760
John Dodson knocked out Tj Dillashaw at one 35 he's a fucking monster.

1450
01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:32.460
Monster.
Fast as shit.
Super Athletic and dangerous as fucking mighty mouse.

1451
01:22:32.461 --> 01:22:33.990
Just shut him down.
I agree.

1452
01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:37.560
I just think over 10 years and he's fought the WHO's who?

1453
01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:41.220
And you know what I'm saying?
What's this?
It's such a subjective title.

1454
01:22:41.221 --> 01:22:43.890
The chat box.
If you want to talk about pound for pound,

1455
01:22:43.891 --> 01:22:46.050
who's gonna rip everyone's face offs?
Jon Jones.

1456
01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:48.720
There's no one better than Jon Jones to ever enter the octagon.

1457
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.040
He's literally gonna grab everyone,

1458
01:22:50.041 --> 01:22:53.430
rip their fricking face off if you want it to.
Let's pound for pound.

1459
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:54.980
You think he's going to fight heavyweight now?
Yeah,

1460
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:58.620
100% and going to go in there.
He's gonna fight DC and they were like,
cool,

1461
01:22:58.621 --> 01:23:03.480
let's fight heavyweight.
Yeah.
Wow.
He's so jacked.

1462
01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:07.630
What are we doing?
He's Jack like has his shit together.

1463
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:12.010
You know that happens to people when they become like real technical and
they're,

1464
01:23:12.011 --> 01:23:12.281
you know,

1465
01:23:12.281 --> 01:23:15.580
they're strong but in a grappling sentence and then they start lifting weights.

1466
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:19.600
Like they get so many cars now they have all this ability to do things from

1467
01:23:19.601 --> 01:23:23.230
technique that's backed up by all this horsepower.
Like Dude,

1468
01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:28.060
Eddie Bravo's game changed so hard when he started lifting weights.

1469
01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.111
Like there was like,

1470
01:23:29.111 --> 01:23:33.280
there's Eddie Bravo pre weights and is Eddie Bravo post weights and they're

1471
01:23:33.281 --> 01:23:34.940
totally different guys.
They different,
we,

1472
01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:39.490
he was just a small guy who had really good technique and then he got to the

1473
01:23:39.491 --> 01:23:43.090
point where he was lifting weights like a couple days a week,

1474
01:23:43.091 --> 01:23:46.970
steady for years.
He wouldn't stop.
He just like,
I got to get stronger.

1475
01:23:46.971 --> 01:23:47.351
And he's like,

1476
01:23:47.351 --> 01:23:51.370
I'm just battling in the gym constantly with these guys who are bigger and

1477
01:23:51.371 --> 01:23:54.790
stronger than me and then as soon as he started putting masks on and he started

1478
01:23:54.791 --> 01:23:56.980
getting really strong to go with that technique,

1479
01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:59.650
he was just smashing different animal.

1480
01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:01.570
See Shankar and myself for a little different.

1481
01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:03.160
We spent too much time in the weight room.

1482
01:24:03.161 --> 01:24:06.110
We should've been doing techniques like we're in the weight room like spot each

1483
01:24:06.111 --> 01:24:10.780
other bench.
I'm like God I feel like we should work on punching.
Thank you.

1484
01:24:10.781 --> 01:24:13.570
Think I'm like well your hugest fuck is it is.

1485
01:24:13.571 --> 01:24:16.290
I don't think we're getting any better squatting all this recipe.

1486
01:24:16.291 --> 01:24:19.630
If you fight a guy like junior dos Santos like junior couldn't live nearly as

1487
01:24:19.631 --> 01:24:23.650
much as Shane but when they got in the case together juniors lightened him up

1488
01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:27.040
cause it just buys him tech.
That's where technique comes into play.

1489
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:28.750
That's what it is.
It's about getting hit.

1490
01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.640
You want to talk about a fight that should have happened years ago.

1491
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.210
Dos Santos over him next week.
What do you think about that?
Fine.

1492
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:40.150
I mean dose Angeles with a new camp,
the att.
So I think that's good.
Um,

1493
01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:40.510
it just,

1494
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:43.900
this slight should have happened a year or two and I don't think junior is ever

1495
01:24:43.901 --> 01:24:47.860
the same.
I think after those two cane losses and then after that steep a fight,

1496
01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:52.360
I mean,
what I was going to talk about files,
brutal fight.
So I don't know,
man.

1497
01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:55.380
Yeah.
And then with Overeem,
with this new drug testing,
I mean are we,

1498
01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:57.640
what are we going to get when you get the tool five a room,

1499
01:24:57.641 --> 01:25:01.450
what's he going to look like?
Right.
There's a lot of variables,
man.

1500
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:05.830
A lot of very beautiful thug.
Same with Josie Aldo.
Oh yeah,

1501
01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:10.570
yeah,
yeah.
You're like me,
you're making the steroids face.

1502
01:25:10.930 --> 01:25:13.270
I'm just saying,
might have been,
maybe he's not,

1503
01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:16.770
but lets the face you're making the other me my name,
let's say.

1504
01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:21.640
Let's say he's not like w and,
but let like,
no,
let's say he is,

1505
01:25:21.641 --> 01:25:23.620
but then the strict drug testing comes into play.

1506
01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:27.220
We're talking about a different animal,
man.
Oh yeah.
Completely different animal.

1507
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:31.480
Not the same guy.
That's an x factor.
That's a huge x factor.
It has to be,

1508
01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:33.940
but we don't know.
We don't know what he was doing.
What?

1509
01:25:33.941 --> 01:25:36.540
He wasn't born 100% I have no idea.
He,

1510
01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:40.450
because he never got tested positive for anything ever and he's an absolute

1511
01:25:40.451 --> 01:25:43.960
animal.
I don't know,
but that I could say that for anyone you go out,

1512
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:46.500
you go through,
you'll see one 94 you'd say that for a lot of the guys,

1513
01:25:46.501 --> 01:25:47.470
that's the next factor.

1514
01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:55.480
That's interesting man.
We can't know.
You know and can't know who was on water,

1515
01:25:55.481 --> 01:26:00.100
who was on something and got caused.
No Way.
Unless people get caught.

1516
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:03.080
Yeah.
When you get caught,
you know,
they always say,
oh,
you know,

1517
01:26:03.081 --> 01:26:04.950
I didn't know someone gave me his die.

1518
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:08.090
Is there ever been a guy who someone actually did give?

1519
01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.660
They gave him a protein shake and he drank it and they're like,
oh Yo dog,

1520
01:26:11.661 --> 01:26:16.430
I forgot to tell you stuff.
I did have multiple,
y'all thought this was chocolate.

1521
01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:21.050
Wait,
Nah,
Nah man.
I put steroids in it.
Hey real quick.

1522
01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:23.510
Just for all the listeners out there,
that's never happening.

1523
01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:27.250
It's got to have happened once.
People are idiots.
There's a lot of positive.
Yeah.

1524
01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:29.270
Yeah.
I like that.
It's like,
I don't even know what I was taking.

1525
01:26:29.271 --> 01:26:31.820
This guy was just give me in Jackson my ass.
He told me his vitamin C,

1526
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:35.900
it is possible that if you were at a bad gym and you're hanging around with a

1527
01:26:35.901 --> 01:26:39.590
bunch of fucking morons and they want you to fail and there's dudes are doing

1528
01:26:39.591 --> 01:26:42.950
juice,
they'll put put some juice in your protein,
drink tea.
Here's the solution.

1529
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:46.010
Until anybody mix your protein drinks,
especially some asshole.

1530
01:26:46.011 --> 01:26:48.650
It doesn't really like you.
Yeah man.
Some crazy shit,

1531
01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.380
but to has to be a guy out there that actually did have someone drop a steroid

1532
01:26:54.381 --> 01:26:57.260
in his protein drink and he pissed positive and he probably tells her and

1533
01:26:57.261 --> 01:27:00.830
they're like,
yeah,
yeah,
sure.
It was like actually did happen.

1534
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:05.640
Fuck be meal.
Your

1535
01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:10.880
surprise.
You'd be failed.
The steroid tests.
He'd be so freaked out like,

1536
01:27:10.881 --> 01:27:11.900
I can't believe that.

1537
01:27:11.901 --> 01:27:16.010
The actual thing that everybody jokes about really did happen to me.

1538
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:17.380
You fucked.
Oh my you.

1539
01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.800
It's like actually going into a van that says free candy cause they're really

1540
01:27:21.801 --> 01:27:24.320
free.
Channy is very clunky.
Ow.
Fuck you're,

1541
01:27:24.321 --> 01:27:29.150
that guy beat you over the head.
Like God damn it.
How did I fall for that?

1542
01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.340
This car tomorrow is pretty good.
Um,
there's a lot of good fights on this card,

1543
01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:39.020
but the card on Saturday is insane.
But the one big fight that's on tomorrow,

1544
01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:43.100
well,
there's a couple big fights besides a Frankie Edgar and Chad Mendez,

1545
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:46.640
but Barboza and Tony Ferguson,
motherfucker

1546
01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:51.260
Barboza and Tony Ferguson.
Sun Woo.

1547
01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:56.750
I love Ferguson in that flight.
That's a crazy fight,
dude.

1548
01:27:56.810 --> 01:28:00.920
That's a motherfucker.
That is a crazy fight.
I just think it's Ferguson's time,

1549
01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:04.790
man.
He's so fucking good and he's dangerous.
Very dangerous.

1550
01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:07.250
But so is Barboza I agree.

1551
01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:11.810
I just feel like Tony just hits like a Mack truck.

1552
01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:16.280
He does.
He does.
It's a very interesting fight.
Very interesting.

1553
01:28:17.210 --> 01:28:19.160
He's going to have to deal with those fucking leg kicks.

1554
01:28:19.161 --> 01:28:22.010
So God Damn Barboza kinks get gets out of two rounds.

1555
01:28:22.011 --> 01:28:25.280
I think Tony stops live in too.
Wow.
I know,
right?
So much.

1556
01:28:25.281 --> 01:28:28.790
I believe in [inaudible].
I think,
I just think 2016 is kind of,
uh,
uh,

1557
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:32.810
the year of Tony Ferguson at that weight.
Strong,
stale,
right,
right.

1558
01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.390
Not show going out on a limb and tell you what man,

1559
01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:39.380
you're making predictions like you,
you're making a strong prediction.
Oh,

1560
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:43.240
it's never good.
Sometimes it backfires.
Like,
ah,

1561
01:28:44.150 --> 01:28:45.260
Barboza Monster.

1562
01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:48.520
He is a monster that Paul Felder fight that switch kick that he was landed to

1563
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:51.560
Feldman's ribs mixing anything like it fastest I've ever seen.
I agree.

1564
01:28:51.850 --> 01:28:56.060
Just let her say anything like it.
It was like a,
like 110 pound Thai guy.

1565
01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:56.751
You know,

1566
01:28:56.751 --> 01:28:59.690
like you watch those Moitai champions flyweight dudes that are just like

1567
01:28:59.691 --> 01:29:03.900
lightening bolts.
That's what kind of speed he was dropping that switch kick in.

1568
01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.750
I remember like,
literally I was like,

1569
01:29:05.751 --> 01:29:09.150
I had to like readjust my metric when I was judging it.

1570
01:29:09.151 --> 01:29:12.030
Like watching like what's a fast kick and what's not a fast kick.

1571
01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:15.310
His kick was so much faster than anybody else's that I had a,

1572
01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:18.510
I had a readjust like what I thought was a fast kick.

1573
01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:22.380
He's going to land some those eyes think Tony's gonna counter and the night,

1574
01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:26.580
well Michael Johnson gave him a lot of pressure and Barboza had a real hard time

1575
01:29:26.581 --> 01:29:30.240
with that.
But correct me if I'm wrong,

1576
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:35.270
I believe Barboza was traveling back and forth from Florida to New Jersey,

1577
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:39.630
the trade mark Kendra that was going on.
Now he lives down there.
Correct.

1578
01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:41.820
That'll make a big impact.
Different animal.

1579
01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:44.850
And that's what we saw in the fight with Paul Felder.

1580
01:29:44.851 --> 01:29:48.850
We saw like the best version of Barboza we've ever seen.
The most focus,

1581
01:29:48.851 --> 01:29:49.800
the fastest,

1582
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:54.120
the best prepared if he's with Mark Henry.

1583
01:29:54.121 --> 01:29:57.360
I'm telling you,
man,
I spent maybe four weeks smart Kenny.

1584
01:29:57.361 --> 01:30:00.690
I've never seen anything like it for whatever the reason.

1585
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:03.420
Maybe just cause he's Frankie Edgar's guy in Edwin Barboza,

1586
01:30:03.421 --> 01:30:07.440
she doesn't get a lot of notoriety like a frost or Greg Jackson.
I'm tell you,

1587
01:30:07.441 --> 01:30:12.150
man,
I've,
it's some another level shit,
man.
I'm telling you that we worked,

1588
01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.250
uh,
he was like,
let me see you move around.
And he had this,
uh,

1589
01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:16.320
guy hold mitts for me.

1590
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:19.980
Any filled out a fucking notepad about six pages long front.

1591
01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:24.390
And back just all this shit and we're just obsessed with it.

1592
01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:28.350
Texted me,
caught voice mails with waves,
like just listen to them.

1593
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:31.260
You don't respond,
just listen.
And there's all these combos.
I was like,

1594
01:30:31.261 --> 01:30:34.050
holy fuck if,
if someone can,

1595
01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:38.250
if you spend and you see Edwin Barboza and you see frickin Frankie Edgar,

1596
01:30:38.251 --> 01:30:39.720
how talented these guys are.

1597
01:30:40.110 --> 01:30:44.610
And now Chris Weidman brought Mark Henry in to help with the raclette fight

1598
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:47.880
railing.
And that was the x factor for me.
Ooh,

1599
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:51.330
that's what pushed you over the top.
Why men over Rockhold?
It did.

1600
01:30:51.331 --> 01:30:55.590
And I thought [inaudible] was gonna win earlier in the week and then,

1601
01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:58.630
and I've been listened and then Mark Kennedy says he's working with wide.

1602
01:30:58.670 --> 01:31:01.410
I was like,
Oh hell no.
Really?

1603
01:31:01.411 --> 01:31:04.860
So it was just Mark Henry coming in as a trainer that made you switch over.

1604
01:31:04.861 --> 01:31:06.720
I was,
that was this close.

1605
01:31:06.721 --> 01:31:11.580
I was this close to picking Weidman or Rockhold and then just,
I dunno,

1606
01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:16.050
I'm with Weidman.
Wow,
that's interesting.
That's a,
that shows you,

1607
01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:19.380
that's a pretty serious level of respect for Mark Henry up.

1608
01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:22.260
Dude I've worked with for us and I'm not these,

1609
01:31:22.261 --> 01:31:24.990
those are the best in the business list or bowling,
Greg Jackson,

1610
01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:27.990
all these phenomenal coaches,
Tony Jeffries,
all these guys.

1611
01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:31.160
I've never seen anything like Mark Henry the amount of time.
As soon as he,

1612
01:31:31.230 --> 01:31:34.740
I heard he's on board.
I was,
oh fuck.
You're talking about another level.

1613
01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:40.250
What do you think about his style as opposed to the style that bang is showing

1614
01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:44.190
Tj Dillashaw,
which has a lot of switching of the stances,

1615
01:31:44.191 --> 01:31:48.690
a lot of variations in the approach and the attack where you're constantly

1616
01:31:48.691 --> 01:31:51.120
overloading the mind.
You never know when a guy's going to do.

1617
01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.313
What do you think of that?

1618
01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:57.030
I think banks style worked for one guy in the world for Tj.
Yup.

1619
01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.230
I think what it's doing for Danny Castillo,
Danny Gus

1620
01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:04.630
<v 1>deals look fat can fantastic.
He's not looking like Tj.
He's looking good for him.</v>

1621
01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:07.660
Well,
first of all,
they came in at different levels of strike.
I agree.

1622
01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.810
I'm just saying kicking wise.
I agree.
He looks better,

1623
01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:14.680
but I think for that obsessive style for what Tj does,

1624
01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:17.980
they're the perfect combo.
Right?
Does not get any better than that.

1625
01:32:17.981 --> 01:32:22.460
So you think it's a style makes trainer matchup?
Yes.
Hundred percent yeah.

1626
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:26.050
Blit trying listen to,
well,
you won't be there.
They find them Friday night.

1627
01:32:26.051 --> 01:32:26.741
You're not doing the fight.

1628
01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:30.670
But if you can listen to Mark Henry when he's coaching Frankie Edgar,

1629
01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:35.320
I think she has a towel on.
He sweating and he's that they have different,

1630
01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:38.740
uh,
language every time.
They have very different variables every time.

1631
01:32:38.741 --> 01:32:41.590
It's never the same so that nobody could get it.
Only can get it right.

1632
01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:45.760
It's literally like a video game.
ABBC ABC and the doing the thing,

1633
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:50.350
it's like a fucking video game.
Wow.
I've never seen anything like it,
man.
Wow.

1634
01:32:50.410 --> 01:32:54.640
Very interesting.
And he see he's just as striking guy.
Right.
Just striking.

1635
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:57.700
So who does the transitions between the striking and grappling?

1636
01:32:57.701 --> 01:33:02.200
How do we orchestrate that in a training?
Yeah.
I know a Weidman has a,

1637
01:33:02.290 --> 01:33:05.980
his little camp with Ray Longo mix there and all that.
So they all come together.

1638
01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.560
And then I've,
I've heard stories about why I'm in,

1639
01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:12.580
I don't think people realize how strong wide is.
I've heard him,

1640
01:33:12.581 --> 01:33:16.930
just Molly whopping heavyweights,
just destroying dudes and Weidman.

1641
01:33:16.931 --> 01:33:17.830
When I break down the tape,

1642
01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:22.570
he just has this x factor that don't think Luke has granted Luke's gone five

1643
01:33:22.571 --> 01:33:23.404
rounds more.

1644
01:33:23.470 --> 01:33:26.580
A lot of people don't realize that Luke's gone five rounds in or stock rate.

1645
01:33:26.581 --> 01:33:28.090
Tim Kennedy beat both of them.
Great.

1646
01:33:28.091 --> 01:33:32.040
Grapplers but I just think Wyden has this x factor that you are,

1647
01:33:32.050 --> 01:33:35.140
it's hard to gauge.
Like you can't put a number on it,
if that makes sense.

1648
01:33:35.141 --> 01:33:35.974
I know it sounds weird.

1649
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:39.700
Rockhold thinks he's going to be able to stay on the outside and have success

1650
01:33:39.701 --> 01:33:41.220
that we Anderson did in the first round,

1651
01:33:41.230 --> 01:33:46.150
the first fight in v toward did in that opening flurry of that,
the,
the uh,

1652
01:33:46.151 --> 01:33:49.060
the fight that they had and he thinks he's gonna be able to do some damage
there.

1653
01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:54.160
If you look at that fight,
The v two or fight where v tour had Weidman stunned.

1654
01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:57.070
She nailed him a couple times and then vitro moved in for the kill.

1655
01:33:57.071 --> 01:34:00.400
But [inaudible] just didn't have the stamina he did.
He just couldn't sustain it.

1656
01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:03.010
And then he didn't have the defense in the ground.
Why men took him down,

1657
01:34:03.011 --> 01:34:03.844
just fucked him up,

1658
01:34:03.930 --> 01:34:07.570
which is a beat down as soon as why man shot that double got ahold those legs

1659
01:34:07.571 --> 01:34:07.991
tight,

1660
01:34:07.991 --> 01:34:11.530
dropped him down total control the ground and just beat the shit out of him.

1661
01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:15.200
I don't think he'll be able to do that the same way to Rockhold.

1662
01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:18.250
I think rock holds would be a much harder guy to take down and a much harder.

1663
01:34:18.251 --> 01:34:19.060
Got to keep down.

1664
01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:23.710
I think rock holes got a way better wrestling camp with DC and Kane and Rockwell

1665
01:34:23.711 --> 01:34:26.320
just shown really good takedown defense in the past.
I agree.

1666
01:34:26.650 --> 01:34:30.100
It makes it makes it tricky.
I think that fight gets super interesting.

1667
01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:34.240
If Rockhold uses height and reach and kicking,
he's a really good kicker.

1668
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:36.340
Keep telling me outside and I left kick.

1669
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:39.850
What is his fucking background besides wrestling?
Surfing,

1670
01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:42.350
but where did he learn how to kick?
Really?
He He,

1671
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:45.010
he was surfing and he was bullshitting around.

1672
01:34:45.011 --> 01:34:46.720
I know he did some judo when he was young,

1673
01:34:46.730 --> 01:34:50.320
didn't have a karate background and then walked into Ak when he was super young.

1674
01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:53.290
How old was he?
I think 17 okay.

1675
01:34:53.291 --> 01:34:58.040
So a Javier has been kind of coaching him from the beginning,
so,
so I mean

1676
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:02.060
<v 0>the rock old I think will get his kicks off and that's uh,
the,</v>

1677
01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.620
I mean just to keep that distance.

1678
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:07.580
I just feel like Weidman's going to get them down.
And Weidman,

1679
01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:11.960
this is the x factors.
Weidman also is a phenomenal grappler,
man.

1680
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:14.390
He's been trained with Marcella Garcia for ever,

1681
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:18.230
I mean he's a stud on the ground.
I think a is overlooking that.

1682
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:20.330
I think that they're worried about the strike and they're worried about the

1683
01:35:20.331 --> 01:35:23.150
pressure and all that and they think Rockwell thinks he's doing it.
Paid Down,

1684
01:35:23.151 --> 01:35:26.190
pop up.
I get that.
Weidman's a motherfucker down there,
the,

1685
01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:28.070
he controlled Vito Belfort on the ground.

1686
01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:32.360
Like they're going to be building literally,
he's so heavy on top man.
Well Donna,

1687
01:35:32.361 --> 01:35:37.340
hers,
his guy too.
And Donna,
hers the master.
He's a real wizard.
That's a,

1688
01:35:37.370 --> 01:35:38.870
he's a,
he's so smart too.

1689
01:35:38.871 --> 01:35:41.990
He's a a guy that when you have that guy in your corner,

1690
01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:45.950
there's a distinct advantage when it comes to strategy and if you're training

1691
01:35:45.951 --> 01:35:49.650
with them on a regular basis,
like he doesn't,
he doesn't make mistakes.
He's not,

1692
01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:53.060
isn't making,
he doesn't make mistakes in assessment or execution.

1693
01:35:53.061 --> 01:35:55.700
He knows what to do and when to do it and how to do it right.

1694
01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:00.480
He just knows he does not,
he's not weighed down by stupid ideas to,

1695
01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:05.180
to me it's the best fight in middleweight history.
Two guys in their prime,
man,

1696
01:36:05.230 --> 01:36:06.410
I have no idea who's going to win.

1697
01:36:06.411 --> 01:36:09.320
I can see the guys fighting two or three times talking about a trilogy,

1698
01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:11.570
what it really all depends on the result of the first fight.
Sure.

1699
01:36:11.571 --> 01:36:14.050
It's like a lot of people thought that could have been the case with v torn why,

1700
01:36:14.110 --> 01:36:17.830
but why just smashed him.
True.
If Weidman can do that to Rockhold,

1701
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:20.420
then the whole game changes.
But if why,

1702
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:24.770
why do you think Weidman needs like a breakout performance in order to achieve

1703
01:36:24.771 --> 01:36:28.670
like a higher level of stardom?
Like something has to happen.
Even this.
Right.

1704
01:36:28.690 --> 01:36:29.660
Nice.
How great he is.

1705
01:36:29.661 --> 01:36:32.480
So let's say widen it goes in there and knock some out in the first round.

1706
01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:36.350
But then commonly Gregor goes in and knocks Josie out out in three rounds.

1707
01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:39.470
We're not talking about Weidman.
He gets funny dicked again.

1708
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:43.880
You know what I'm saying?
He's honey dick again.
My bad dog.
Maybe next time,

1709
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.580
cause we're not talking about Weidman.
It's true all we're time.

1710
01:36:46.590 --> 01:36:49.040
I was Connor Geraldo.
Yeah.
That's all we're talking about.

1711
01:36:49.190 --> 01:36:52.460
And it's all trash talk.
It's the trash talk,
the trash talk.

1712
01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:55.580
Because on paper both of them are equally intriguing.

1713
01:36:55.820 --> 01:37:00.820
But the trash talk of of Connor has pushed the whole thing way over the top as

1714
01:37:00.861 --> 01:37:03.340
far as like wanting to see it like wow.
But it's Kinda,

1715
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:06.680
it's kind of calmed down because of the injury and there's been this delay

1716
01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:09.380
because when they're on that world tour,
I was like,
holy fuck.

1717
01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:13.040
This is insane to me.
I think Conor McGregor mind fucked Jose Aldo.

1718
01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:16.460
Not really anymore.
I don't know about all that.
I don't think so.
No,

1719
01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:18.830
I don't think it's as bad this time.
I think it's still on his head.

1720
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:22.970
It doesn't matter.
We don't know what the reaction that is going to be.
Some guys,

1721
01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:26.300
the worst shit you can do is get them riled up.
Well if you look at Joe,

1722
01:37:26.301 --> 01:37:30.110
the elders pass.
Anytime a guy brings the fight to him,
he gets fucked up.

1723
01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:33.530
If Josie Aldo,
if it's super expectable and he gets a head on you,

1724
01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:36.500
he coasts and he takes rounds off east coast.
We've seen it man.

1725
01:37:36.710 --> 01:37:39.530
But I think Conor Mcgregor's he bit off all I can chew man.

1726
01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:42.050
Cause Joe's Alto and he's,
when you're bringing the fight to them,

1727
01:37:42.051 --> 01:37:45.950
you get one hell of a Joe's Outta we look at Mendez,
Josie to what?

1728
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:48.080
To me that's one of the greatest fights ever.

1729
01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:51.920
It's going to be interesting to see what approach although takes.

1730
01:37:51.921 --> 01:37:56.130
Cause what if Aldo comes out southpaw then chick gets interesting

1731
01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:00.540
<v 1>cause one of the benefits that that Connor has is that he fight southpaw is your</v>

1732
01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:05.070
nasty right hand true.
He throws almost like disdainful.
Half speed kicks in.

1733
01:38:05.071 --> 01:38:06.360
He uses your positioning,

1734
01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:10.440
judging you to set up other things and then he mixes those half speed kicks up

1735
01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:13.410
with very fast techniques,
spinning kicks and things along those lines.

1736
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:16.860
That front kick to the body and then we'll throw like a disdainful roundhouse

1737
01:38:16.861 --> 01:38:17.071
kick,

1738
01:38:17.071 --> 01:38:20.590
almost like daring you to try to counter it so he can look to drop that left

1739
01:38:20.591 --> 01:38:21.301
hand and on you.

1740
01:38:21.301 --> 01:38:25.050
He does a lot of interesting shit as far as like varying his rhythm and his

1741
01:38:25.051 --> 01:38:28.350
approach and his movement,
his long wide stance.

1742
01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:33.250
It just a lot of shit that's hard to judge.
But if all,

1743
01:38:33.251 --> 01:38:36.870
although immediately initiate grappling,

1744
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:42.420
this is something that I don't think people have been thinking of is a fucking

1745
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:46.870
nasty on the ground Nass deal champion.
Yeah.
He's like,
like he's,

1746
01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:49.920
he beat Cotto Cabrina and straight Jujitsu.
Okay.

1747
01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:54.600
So if all doe just clenches and drags that fight to the ground very early in the

1748
01:38:54.601 --> 01:38:54.931
fight.
Look,

1749
01:38:54.931 --> 01:38:59.931
we saw in the corner with Connor and Chad Mendez Co Chad took him down and held

1750
01:39:00.421 --> 01:39:04.020
him down,
was laying some nasty ground and pound with essentially no camp.

1751
01:39:04.530 --> 01:39:08.340
I mean two weeks,
which is like your weight cutting.
You don't have any cardio.

1752
01:39:08.341 --> 01:39:11.670
It's just like you're not going to improve in two weeks because the last week is

1753
01:39:11.671 --> 01:39:12.900
all just about recovery anyway,

1754
01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:16.800
so he's got like seven days to work out for Conor for a fucking world title

1755
01:39:16.801 --> 01:39:18.990
fight while he's doing all this press right.

1756
01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:21.180
All those good all the time in the world.

1757
01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:25.830
He's got all the time in the world and he is a monster on the ground.

1758
01:39:25.831 --> 01:39:29.490
What's his background is back on is not striking his background,
his Jujitsu,

1759
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:31.890
so to me,
and you hit it right on the head,

1760
01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:35.700
no one's talking about us talking about Josie is going to grapple him because

1761
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.980
Connor's hard to figure out,
especially early in the rounds.

1762
01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:40.620
He's doing all these weird angles.
It's like,
fuck man,
what am I going to do?

1763
01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:44.760
He's going to grapple them and he's a stud athlete too,
like a freak.

1764
01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:48.990
He can get a hold of you and drag you to the ground and all of a sudden you know

1765
01:39:49.230 --> 01:39:52.710
he's got your back and he's fucking blasting you with punches and elbows.

1766
01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:55.650
It could get real weird cause cause cause if I'm watching the,

1767
01:39:55.730 --> 01:39:59.100
the Mendez fight cause it,
I think those,

1768
01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:01.710
that switch to that first round when minutes kept taking him down,

1769
01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.260
Josie camp is going,
all right,
this is what we're going to do.

1770
01:40:04.410 --> 01:40:06.990
And then let's get good at staying in the third,
fourth,
fifth round.

1771
01:40:07.230 --> 01:40:09.420
But Start Tiana,
here's looking at another way.

1772
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:14.630
Connor comes in like a serpent will always slippery movement and he dropped one

1773
01:40:15.001 --> 01:40:18.090
of those fucking pissed and left hands in on José's chin.

1774
01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:23.100
Then shit gets real weird real quick.
That could happen to the lamb.

1775
01:40:23.130 --> 01:40:26.970
He lands one of those fucking Corker's on them and starts talking shit to them

1776
01:40:26.971 --> 01:40:30.920
and gets in front of his face.
Josie has never been a fight at this magnitude.

1777
01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:34.590
Never.
Never with the shit.
Talking Shit,
talking changes,
everything.

1778
01:40:34.770 --> 01:40:38.610
The shit talking about the,
all the eyes on this file.
We can pressure.

1779
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.730
He's been champion,
you know,
forever.
He's been undefeated for 10 years.

1780
01:40:41.850 --> 01:40:44.550
He's never been in this kind of fight.
No,
not even close.

1781
01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:48.240
He's gotten a lot of attention in Brazil.
Like the first uh,
chat bend is Phi.

1782
01:40:48.241 --> 01:40:50.970
Was a giant victory for him in Brazil.
Ran Out to the audience,

1783
01:40:50.971 --> 01:40:54.100
was cheering with them.
They held up the flag for an does a different thing.

1784
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:58.600
And I also,
uh,
Josie will get hit.
He'll go straight back and he does get hit.

1785
01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.450
We see Chad Mendez and other fights where he gets hit.
He sounded lucid.

1786
01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:05.530
He's not like,
might get hit by Conor McGregor.
The game is over.

1787
01:41:05.650 --> 01:41:10.420
She hits like a fucking Mack truck.
Yeah.
He snaps those punches big too,

1788
01:41:10.421 --> 01:41:10.871
man.

1789
01:41:10.871 --> 01:41:15.250
He mixes shit up real good with upper cards and straight punches and comes at

1790
01:41:15.251 --> 01:41:18.580
different angles.
He gets unpredictable with his movements when he's in close.

1791
01:41:18.850 --> 01:41:21.340
Like if you look at like a,
his fight with Marcus scrimmage,

1792
01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:24.130
that beautiful combination that he landed take [inaudible] out.

1793
01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:28.240
And how good does his Mac haul Max Holloway when you look now.
Exactly.

1794
01:41:28.241 --> 01:41:30.100
And he did this really fucked up knee.
Yeah.

1795
01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:32.420
He jacked his knee in the first round.
He,

1796
01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:37.360
so there's a lot going on in that fight.
There's a lot going on that fight.
What?

1797
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:41.590
And I think,
I think after,
uh,
let's say common wins,
that fight is toughest.

1798
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:44.760
Matchups are looming,
you know,
they're waiting for,
well,

1799
01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.580
Tony Ferguson's already called him out.
It,
this is my 55 bits.

1800
01:41:48.581 --> 01:41:51.910
Just might be his last fight at 45 to most likely will be with dog wants to

1801
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:55.180
fight them too.
Of course.
That's a long fight song.
Whoa.

1802
01:41:55.181 --> 01:41:59.200
Pedis while Donald shouldn't be thinking about anything but the 18th that's

1803
01:41:59.201 --> 01:42:02.500
gonna be a tough one.
That's tough.
One stuff.
One route from my voice.
Ronnie.

1804
01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:07.180
I am too.
I'm also rooting for a dos Anjos that's a fucking problem with being a

1805
01:42:07.181 --> 01:42:12.130
commentator.
He kind of fucking rude on everybody.
I like as a human being,

1806
01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:16.420
I'm wait closer to Donald Donald's,
my friend.
But when I watched those two fight,

1807
01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:20.060
I'm a fan.
I mean I'm a fan of martial arts.
Yeah,
you're a professional.

1808
01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.310
But when I watch those two fight,
I'm a fan of both those guys and I'm a,

1809
01:42:23.410 --> 01:42:25.180
I'm a Hofeld dos Anjos Fan.

1810
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:29.410
That motherfucker is a beast that beat down that he put on pedes the way he did

1811
01:42:29.411 --> 01:42:32.500
it.
He's the nicest guy in the world to the best.
The Nice Guy.

1812
01:42:32.501 --> 01:42:34.960
When I was fighting and I never forget this stuff.

1813
01:42:34.961 --> 01:42:37.780
Anytime guys go out of their way to be nice to me.
I never forget it.

1814
01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:42.190
When I was in Brazil for a press conference before I fought Nogueira it's like

1815
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:46.750
whatever,
14 weeks before the fight,
you know,
Brazilians around exactly.

1816
01:42:46.751 --> 01:42:49.840
A big brown fan when you're fighting the biggest guy in the fucking city.

1817
01:42:49.841 --> 01:42:54.490
No one's doing me favors and a dos Anjos uh,
gave me rides everywhere.

1818
01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:58.760
Took me a little jams,
made sure I was cool.
That's not sure where to eat all.

1819
01:42:58.761 --> 01:43:01.390
He was great man.
He's a great dude.
I always like talking to him,

1820
01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:06.150
but very friendly guy and I from Denver,
same team,
cowboys,
my boy.
Yeah.
No,

1821
01:43:06.151 --> 01:43:09.070
I guess tough man.
I'm always biased.
Don't ever get it twisted.

1822
01:43:09.071 --> 01:43:12.040
Whenever I make picks I'm always biased.
Yeah.
I feel,
yeah.

1823
01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:15.220
I like this fight as a martial artist because,
um,

1824
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:19.390
as someone who's like looks at the,
of the problems of both guys present,

1825
01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:22.300
I liked his fight because of the physicality of dos.

1826
01:43:22.301 --> 01:43:24.100
Anjos is something that guys have to deal with.

1827
01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:27.880
He's worked real hard on his conditioning and his strength and conditioning

1828
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:30.820
routines that he trains with that nick curse on guy.
Yeah,
he's a mark.

1829
01:43:30.821 --> 01:43:35.230
Marinovich is decided.
Sure.
They do some wild,
crazy explosive plyometric shit.

1830
01:43:35.231 --> 01:43:39.130
They do a lot of like strengths shit and a lot of it about just just reducing

1831
01:43:39.131 --> 01:43:43.390
the amount of time it takes you to act and to perform your actions.

1832
01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:47.380
Just getting it down.
Just fractions of a second.
Just fractions of a second.

1833
01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:49.530
Constantly exploding constantly.

1834
01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.490
There's all sprints and box jumps and that kind of shit.

1835
01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:55.280
If you watch like some of his,
uh,
the,
the training modalities,

1836
01:43:55.281 --> 01:43:58.040
it's really fascinating to watch all these different techniques.

1837
01:43:58.041 --> 01:44:01.820
They apply all these weird flexibility things he does.
That's cool.
Oh,

1838
01:44:01.821 --> 01:44:03.480
he does a lot of wild shit,
man.
I'm,
I,
uh,

1839
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:07.860
the one thing I don't like is how much time cowboys hat off cowboy likes to go

1840
01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:08.661
and go.
And that's what it,

1841
01:44:08.661 --> 01:44:11.360
this is best when you have a lot of time off and he has to think about the

1842
01:44:11.361 --> 01:44:14.900
fights usually trouble.
Yeah.
But of ways a mother fucker,
man,

1843
01:44:14.901 --> 01:44:18.920
he saw the momentum right now.
So a lot of momentum,
you know,

1844
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:22.460
and he's a really fucking tough guy.

1845
01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:25.690
He takes a good shot.
I don't get any tougher.
That's Ronnie.

1846
01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:30.380
He takes a good shot and he's really fucking sneaky with his Moy Tai.

1847
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:34.340
Very sneaky and off his back man.
Older than you is x fact off his back.

1848
01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:38.640
I've rolled with cal weights like Jesus,
man.
Yeah,
he's very slick off his back.

1849
01:44:38.641 --> 01:44:40.440
Just one of the best things about being a kickbox.

1850
01:44:40.441 --> 01:44:43.430
It has a really good guard game cause you don't worry about getting taken down

1851
01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:46.850
cause you're very off fencing off your back unless you're fighting dos Anjos

1852
01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:52.250
high level grappler,
black belt,
high level.
Not give a fuck about your guard.

1853
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:57.080
Who's also star wrong as Shit.
Yes.
Like you saw that Nate Diaz fight.

1854
01:44:57.081 --> 01:45:02.060
He just ragdoll ideas and just brutalize that leg too with those leg kicks.

1855
01:45:02.150 --> 01:45:06.140
Oh,
it's gonna be interesting to see if he decides to stand with Donald,

1856
01:45:06.141 --> 01:45:09.170
like how he decides to approach it.
He's so fucking fast.

1857
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:10.940
That was the thing that got me in the pennys fight,

1858
01:45:10.941 --> 01:45:15.290
like how fast he is to engage and fastest execute.
He's like,

1859
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:17.360
he's like right there,
right there,
right there.
Bang.

1860
01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:21.290
Like he was like put a tremendous pressure on pedis right from the beginning.

1861
01:45:21.291 --> 01:45:22.370
And Pedis doesn't like that.

1862
01:45:22.610 --> 01:45:26.630
Pedis likes you to stand on the outside and give him time to like get his timing

1863
01:45:26.631 --> 01:45:28.890
strikers do like Barboza loves that,

1864
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:33.710
you know exactly the way to beat those guys a lot of time is that kind of

1865
01:45:33.711 --> 01:45:34.910
pressure get in their face.

1866
01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:38.810
And Donald had a hard time with Nate in their first fight or their fight rather

1867
01:45:38.930 --> 01:45:41.840
because Nate put a lot of pressure on him in the first round and there was a lot

1868
01:45:41.841 --> 01:45:45.230
of shit talking.
Yep.
I think you got emotionally invested in that shit.

1869
01:45:45.231 --> 01:45:47.230
Talking a little too much.
You want to talk about leg kicks?

1870
01:45:47.231 --> 01:45:49.040
Wouldn't even talk about this.
I hate to go back to,

1871
01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:53.480
but Josie Aldo motherfucker for a kick.
Oh yeah.
Horrible.

1872
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:57.650
And you got to remember content.
That's that white stance.
Yup.
Yup.
He does.

1873
01:45:57.690 --> 01:46:00.260
In fact,
cause you land for those leg kicks.
We're talking about different night.

1874
01:46:00.290 --> 01:46:01.970
Yep.
And he's also,

1875
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:07.280
we're assuming the Connor's gonna fight southpaw and it shows who's gonna Fight

1876
01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:09.080
Orthodox,
we're assuming.
And if he does do that,

1877
01:46:09.081 --> 01:46:13.520
then it opens him up for that inside leg kick for sure.
Let's say,
um,
that's a,

1878
01:46:13.521 --> 01:46:17.390
a powerful technique and it also head kicks and Josie has not been a head kick

1879
01:46:17.391 --> 01:46:21.530
kind of a guy,
but Connor is,
you know,
and when,

1880
01:46:21.710 --> 01:46:23.540
if Connor is in that position,

1881
01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:27.620
he's in the strong leg back position and Josie has opened in the Orthodox

1882
01:46:27.621 --> 01:46:30.290
position.
So what I'm saying folks,
if you don't know what we're talking about,

1883
01:46:30.291 --> 01:46:33.260
if like someone fights at south means they have their right foot forward

1884
01:46:33.261 --> 01:46:36.500
orthodox than way.
Most boxers fight.
They have their left leg forward.

1885
01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:40.490
When Connor has his right leg forward,
the inside of his leg,
which is a very,

1886
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:44.090
very sensitive to soft tender area,

1887
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:48.410
he gets opened up for those inside leg kicks.
It'll slow your game down.

1888
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:50.100
You only had couple of those worldclass

1889
01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:51.240
<v 0>cakes.
So slow your game.
Yeah.</v>

1890
01:46:51.241 --> 01:46:54.960
But I mean I kind of think the Conners anticipated that and he's probably going

1891
01:46:54.961 --> 01:46:58.230
to,
you know,
timeless movement.
And then also you look at like,

1892
01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:01.770
that was the kick that did in Anderson Cause Weidman checked it,

1893
01:47:02.170 --> 01:47:04.650
Wyman checked it perfectly and snapped Anderson's leg.

1894
01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:08.580
So there's that possibility too.
You know,
if they go Shin Shin a couple of times.

1895
01:47:08.581 --> 01:47:12.030
Whoa.
I've never been more excited than for a fight card since Saturday night.

1896
01:47:12.090 --> 01:47:16.890
It's stunning.
Spectacular.
It's so,
it's so good in so many ways.

1897
01:47:16.891 --> 01:47:20.490
Can I can I hate on one of the fights on the card Joe real quick.
Please do.
Uh,

1898
01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:25.440
gunner Nelson.
Damien Maia think is air.
You saw news fast 3000.

1899
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:27.360
I don't know.
I hope I'm wrong.
I hope I'm wrong.

1900
01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:30.900
Every other fight on that card is ridiculous.
I think just style wise,

1901
01:47:30.901 --> 01:47:33.810
I just don't see that being fun.
You look at their previous wins,

1902
01:47:34.170 --> 01:47:38.280
gunner Nelson really finishes our decision is finishes are only by submission.

1903
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:40.770
Unique to men.
Damien Maia.
That ain't happening.

1904
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:42.180
And then there's other ones are decision.

1905
01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.440
Damien Maia is either submission or decision.
Imagine if gunner did submit.

1906
01:47:46.441 --> 01:47:50.190
Damien Maia,
you imagine that'd be sick.

1907
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:54.690
Can you imagine if he could do that?
Be so sick and be like,
is it possible?

1908
01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:58.320
I mean,
I think fan,
is it possible to Damien kids,
submit gunner?
I mean,

1909
01:47:58.321 --> 01:48:01.620
I don't even know if that's possible.
I agree.
Well,
the thing is,

1910
01:48:01.621 --> 01:48:04.620
we talked about Gunnar Nelson's background at Jujitsu.

1911
01:48:04.650 --> 01:48:06.200
He's the far cry from Damien Maia.

1912
01:48:06.201 --> 01:48:08.640
Don't get towards twisted people as far as you know,

1913
01:48:08.690 --> 01:48:13.410
celebrated true traditional Jujitsu.
Damien Maia is a motherfucking monster.

1914
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:16.190
Absolutely.
100% as far as achievements.
Yes.

1915
01:48:16.230 --> 01:48:19.860
When you look at what Gunnar Nelson has done,
like he's in elite grappler.

1916
01:48:19.890 --> 01:48:23.790
He really is.
Jeff Manson.
Yes,
he did.
Dominated them.
Yes,

1917
01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.280
and he's also small for the division,

1918
01:48:26.610 --> 01:48:29.830
which is where it gets interesting because Damien why is large for the division

1919
01:48:29.831 --> 01:48:32.490
and Damen cuts a lot of weight and this will be his first time doing it without

1920
01:48:32.491 --> 01:48:36.570
an ivy.
Oh,
see all these x factors.
Sun.

1921
01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:39.470
The other thing is David [inaudible].
He's not exactly Lance Armstrong,

1922
01:48:39.490 --> 01:48:42.900
the cardio department.
So you ought to about submissions later in the round.

1923
01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:47.160
There's going to be one.
It's probably going to be Nelson.
Well and with no ivy,

1924
01:48:47.370 --> 01:48:51.030
he could even be more weakened by this weight cut.
And that's a factor.

1925
01:48:51.210 --> 01:48:53.670
How about Susan Romero would even talk about that one.

1926
01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:58.290
Jock array is fighting Yoel Romero.
First of all,

1927
01:48:58.830 --> 01:49:03.720
Yo Romero has the best body that has ever walked on earth.
Like who?

1928
01:49:03.721 --> 01:49:08.520
She who looks looks better than that.
That's a superhero.
He's a superhero.

1929
01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:11.400
That's a superhero.
That's fucking aqua man.
That's Spiderman.

1930
01:49:11.850 --> 01:49:15.240
Straight up superman.
Straight up at that build.
That shit's ridiculous.

1931
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:17.520
And Jackie Ray's a fucking savage to man.

1932
01:49:17.521 --> 01:49:21.090
Jocko raise bicep is like three inches longer than a normal bicep.

1933
01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:24.600
It goes to the middle of his forearm.
He was born to choke people.

1934
01:49:24.630 --> 01:49:26.990
He was literally born to choke people unconscious.

1935
01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:29.910
It's going to be interesting to see if UL can avoid the submissions.

1936
01:49:29.911 --> 01:49:30.870
If it goes to the ground,

1937
01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:34.170
it's going to be interesting cause Yo el such an elite wrestler,

1938
01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:37.230
I mean his wrestling is outstanding.
You know what?
It's outstanding.

1939
01:49:37.231 --> 01:49:39.810
But he's been taken down the octagon.
Buy Inferior guys.

1940
01:49:39.811 --> 01:49:42.540
It's cause he doesn't give a fuck cause he just gets right back up.

1941
01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:45.900
He's not going to get right back up on junk or no,
no,
no,
no.

1942
01:49:45.901 --> 01:49:47.760
He's not going to have that approach.
That's a fucking test.

1943
01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:50.150
Going to be much more conservative I think in the,

1944
01:49:50.190 --> 01:49:53.770
in his approach as far as the tax.
But he's got so much,

1945
01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:57.130
he's got so much faith in that fast twitch muscle fiber too,

1946
01:49:57.790 --> 01:50:02.130
cause he drops those fucking fast shots.
Is Sousa though sodas,

1947
01:50:02.150 --> 01:50:05.640
Joc grip this full.
Especially now you should know Cami fight.

1948
01:50:05.790 --> 01:50:09.290
Jacques Rey unloaded on Okami.
Were you worried about my Jujitsu?
What?

1949
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:13.800
How about worried about knuckle sandwiches?
Look,
a sandwich son,
I think,
uh,

1950
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:17.350
still is getting dropped.
That's a wildfire I think ends up on the feet.

1951
01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:22.300
Film's gonna Lean in now Bob.
You know what gets me?
I almost wish that you,
well,

1952
01:50:22.530 --> 01:50:23.051
it's like,

1953
01:50:23.051 --> 01:50:27.100
I almost wish she was fighting for the title now because I feel like he's 36,

1954
01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:31.450
he's 36.
Time is not on his side.
No,
especially not with this kind of testing and,

1955
01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:35.290
yeah,
and I was not inside.
Testing ain't doing him any favors.

1956
01:50:35.291 --> 01:50:38.590
Not He has injuries,
you know,
he's back.
They're supposed to fight before.
Well,

1957
01:50:38.591 --> 01:50:40.840
he's had his neck operated on.
Of course,

1958
01:50:40.841 --> 01:50:43.420
you've got a big slice in the back of his neck when you see him,

1959
01:50:43.421 --> 01:50:47.020
when he steps on the scale to weigh ins where he,
uh,
he had disc surgery.

1960
01:50:47.530 --> 01:50:48.550
I don't know what they did.
I don't know.

1961
01:50:48.551 --> 01:50:51.850
He don't wrestle for that long without having some issues on Cael Sanderson

1962
01:50:51.851 --> 01:50:53.800
twice.
Yeah.
He's a monster.
I mean,

1963
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:57.100
maybe one of the greatest amateur wrestlers to ever come out of Cuba.

1964
01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:00.250
He's just a freak man,
monster wrestler.
He shots though.

1965
01:51:00.251 --> 01:51:02.500
And he's not exactly a cardio machine either.
Nope.

1966
01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:04.600
And he's gotta be real careful about like how we,

1967
01:51:04.630 --> 01:51:06.370
how explodes and I paste himself.
I mean,

1968
01:51:06.371 --> 01:51:09.610
these are too fucking kegs at dynamite going after each other.

1969
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.560
Two different approaches.
God Damn.
That's a good fight.
Whoa.
And how about,

1970
01:51:14.561 --> 01:51:17.470
where do I even talking about Uriah Faber?
Uriah favors on this card.

1971
01:51:17.650 --> 01:51:22.510
No one's even brought it up.
Yeah.
They've just have him on the car just in case.

1972
01:51:22.511 --> 01:51:26.860
Altered in show up.
Yep.
Let's,
let's get real here.
Yeah.

1973
01:51:27.650 --> 01:51:32.170
Probably gave him a good stipend.
Yeah.
He's on the Dan Shade.
Yeah.
Do your thing.

1974
01:51:32.171 --> 01:51:32.880
You're right.

1975
01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:37.880
Who Do you know Frankie signs as I really and z transit signs.

1976
01:51:38.450 --> 01:51:42.220
Sinan sanes sanes it's not good if we don't know his name.

1977
01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:45.620
I don't know if he wins.
It's good for him.
Yeah.
If he wins for it,

1978
01:51:45.650 --> 01:51:48.490
it's gigantic forum.
Jeremy Stevens.
Max Holloway.

1979
01:51:48.491 --> 01:51:51.070
It's another fucking bang up fight too.
Nobody's bringing up,
dude.

1980
01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:53.920
I'm impressed with Holloway,
man.
Huh?
Yeah,
man.

1981
01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:57.730
That cubs swans and fight opened up a lot of people's eyes.
They were like,
whoa.

1982
01:51:58.210 --> 01:52:02.920
And this kid's only like 24 young talented fucking dudes up.
What's the one,

1983
01:52:02.921 --> 01:52:07.210
five zero seven or row since losing to Conor five probably.
He's won quite a few.

1984
01:52:07.211 --> 01:52:10.450
It looks better every single time he's inside the octagon.
Hey Stevens,
for sure.

1985
01:52:10.451 --> 01:52:13.000
Let's not stuck in our gut like that.
When we take a picture of

1986
01:52:14.770 --> 01:52:19.480
July that caught him at a camp for photos.
I'll be,
I've been there.

1987
01:52:19.481 --> 01:52:23.140
It's like God damn it.
And you know that Shit's gonna be on the promos and shit.

1988
01:52:23.890 --> 01:52:26.800
I would attend and did them fucking pushups.
Yeah.

1989
01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:30.880
Jeremy Stevens has some fucking dynamite in his hands.

1990
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:35.830
Dynamite kicks to the can not doubt honey.
Jason,
that head kick,

1991
01:52:38.430 --> 01:52:42.010
that was a flatline or someone like the rumble Johnson of this weight class.

1992
01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:45.980
You know like he just right and ball of knockout.

1993
01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:51.200
<v 1>Then how?
I just think hallways he's too good is to eight tools to win.
We'll see.</v>

1994
01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:54.320
I like it.
I like that fight.
I like it a lot.

1995
01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:58.790
I Jeremy Stephens the it's used egg when you should have zagged.
You fuck up.

1996
01:52:58.791 --> 01:53:03.170
You make a mistake.
You,
yeah,
he,
he'll shut the fucking lights out on you.

1997
01:53:03.171 --> 01:53:05.870
That Dennis Bermudez fight.
How about that?
How about that?

1998
01:53:05.871 --> 01:53:10.060
Fight Bermudez is a mother from UTS was looking good in that fight too to

1999
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:13.580
Jeremy's.
Steve has dropped the bomb on him.
He can do that man,

2000
01:53:13.581 --> 01:53:15.890
and he holds that power deep into the third round two.

2001
01:53:15.891 --> 01:53:18.230
You've got to remember also,
he knocked out the champ.

2002
01:53:18.231 --> 01:53:22.490
He knocked out Dos Anjos right?
Yup.
Knocked up to just that.
I don't forget it.

2003
01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:26.450
He knocked out those angels had 55 then dropped down to 45.

2004
01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:28.310
Feels like he's got a better shot at 45.

2005
01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:33.560
I wonder if how many guys are going to continue to try to compete at 45 with

2006
01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:36.860
this ivy band?
Not many.
Yeah.
I wonder how Jeremy's going to do,

2007
01:53:36.861 --> 01:53:39.890
cause I think this will be his first fight without the ivy as well.

2008
01:53:39.891 --> 01:53:41.890
Think about all of them.
Mcgregor to bikers,

2009
01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:43.730
that some mother fucker for them to get down.

2010
01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:46.370
You look at Mcgregor when you've done that scale.
It's like,
yeah,

2011
01:53:46.371 --> 01:53:50.180
it looks like dead man walking.
So like a horrible stomach disease or something,

2012
01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:54.590
you know?
Um,
if McGregor knocks out all those,
he's the biggest star in the UFC.

2013
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:58.490
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's the biggest.
100%.
He's the biggest right now.
You think me?

2014
01:53:58.491 --> 01:54:01.940
Rhonda is the biggest,
but she's not because she's not the champ.
Um,

2015
01:54:01.941 --> 01:54:05.270
he's the champ if they will have parades for him in Ireland.

2016
01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:08.810
[inaudible] to for them.
Yeah.
But you have to understand the level of champ,

2017
01:54:09.050 --> 01:54:11.120
like their level of love that he gets his.

2018
01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:16.120
So like women like looked at Rhonda like this new thing.

2019
01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:18.230
There's this new thing that never existed before,

2020
01:54:18.231 --> 01:54:21.440
this beautiful female combat sports champion who's totally dominant.

2021
01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:25.360
But Ireland has a long history of,

2022
01:54:25.361 --> 01:54:30.140
of combat sports athletes and right now Conor McGregor is big as anyone that's

2023
01:54:30.141 --> 01:54:30.974
ever been.

2024
01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:35.750
And if he beats all doe and he smashes all though with the way he talks and his

2025
01:54:35.751 --> 01:54:39.770
charisma,
the way he dresses,
his whole package,
the whole thing.

2026
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.821
There's no one like him.

2027
01:54:40.821 --> 01:54:44.060
They will have a Goddamn parade for him in Ireland and he will be the biggest

2028
01:54:44.061 --> 01:54:45.980
star MMA has ever seen.

2029
01:54:45.981 --> 01:54:49.280
He will eclipse Brock Lesnar and Ronda Rousey together.

2030
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:51.980
He's going to be the fucking Mack Daddy.
You don't,

2031
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:55.400
you know the thing about Connor tends a big effort,
right?
It's a big gift.

2032
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:58.430
Big fucking.
If man puts an,
if he needs it,

2033
01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:03.620
I think UFC needs him to win so bad.
Nope.
Nope.
I disagree.
I disagree.

2034
01:55:03.670 --> 01:55:07.970
I dishonor if kind gets knocked out dead by Josie Aldo than,

2035
01:55:07.971 --> 01:55:10.520
although it looks even better,
all it looks even better,

2036
01:55:10.521 --> 01:55:11.780
and then next people want to see it.

2037
01:55:11.781 --> 01:55:14.930
Although fight someone else who I Frank Jagger,
I don't,

2038
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:18.650
I don't ever look at it in terms of like what would be the best result for the,

2039
01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:23.250
Oh,
I do all that.
I don't.
I want martial art.
That's what I want.
I want,

2040
01:55:23.251 --> 01:55:26.030
what did you,
Joe,
that's all great points.
I want exchanges.

2041
01:55:26.031 --> 01:55:28.520
I want to figure out what is,
what's the best style?

2042
01:55:28.521 --> 01:55:32.900
Is it this long stance with these crazy weird movements and throwing in

2043
01:55:32.901 --> 01:55:37.460
traditional martial arts techniques or is it hard Dutch style with fucking

2044
01:55:37.461 --> 01:55:40.760
Worldclass Brazilians?
We know that works.
He'd been with for 10 years,

2045
01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:44.580
so let's says it work against Connor would have caught her fucking spinning
back,

2046
01:55:44.581 --> 01:55:47.760
kicks him in the liver five seconds into the fight like you did with Chad.

2047
01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:51.450
Then we got to be fight of all time.
Wild Shit.
But the thing is,

2048
01:55:51.451 --> 01:55:54.770
is if you look at the,
if,
if I'm a businessman,
I'm not,
not as Marshall.

2049
01:55:54.771 --> 01:55:59.400
There's from a businessman,
Conor winning is the golden ticket.
Oh yeah,
5%.

2050
01:55:59.430 --> 01:56:01.870
And it's the one play too,
cause Josie,
you know he,

2051
01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:03.630
he's not gonna be around that much longer.
Right.

2052
01:56:03.631 --> 01:56:06.630
But there's never been a guy like Conor before in the UFC has been fine.

2053
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:09.270
Like you don't need,
it's not necessarily the best thing.

2054
01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:13.710
[inaudible] Dana's still scrooge.
Mcduck I'm not saying that son.
I'm not,

2055
01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:15.040
I'm not saying he goes broke,

2056
01:56:15.041 --> 01:56:17.460
but I don't even think it's just talked about again,
new heights.

2057
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.080
I don't think so.
Look at this.

2058
01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:25.020
Scrooge McDuck to the backstroke through a sea of gold.

2059
01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:26.850
We can love that guy.

2060
01:56:29.690 --> 01:56:33.360
I just never thought about until you started bringing up scrooge McDuck.

2061
01:56:33.361 --> 01:56:35.990
I never thought about that cartoon.
It's random as fuck.

2062
01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:39.730
Whenever you talk about money like scrooge McDuck I don't like it's true.

2063
01:56:39.731 --> 01:56:43.110
That's right.
Scrooge McDuck yet a lot of money balling son.
Yeah.

2064
01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.130
I think this fight for martial artists,
this fight is a,

2065
01:56:47.730 --> 01:56:52.350
is like the ultimate,
who knows?
It's like the ultimate,
the Weidman fight as well.

2066
01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:53.640
They're both ultimate.
Who knows?

2067
01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:57.660
The only difference being that we saw Weidman get wheel kicked in the head by V

2068
01:56:57.661 --> 01:57:01.830
tour.
We saw that.
You thought you sent you salt rock.
We'll get,
we'll get,

2069
01:57:01.890 --> 01:57:03.210
what did I say?
Why man,
I'm sorry.
Yeah,

2070
01:57:03.211 --> 01:57:07.410
we saw Rockhold get knocked out by v Tours.
We'll kick in the first round.

2071
01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:11.370
That's the only variable that was Mutan v Two r though.
It was mute and V tour.

2072
01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:15.270
I missed that.
You know,
there's part of me that all this,
look,

2073
01:57:15.271 --> 01:57:17.790
I'm very torn on TRT v tour.

2074
01:57:18.210 --> 01:57:23.210
Obviously I'm very torn because I was as a person who enjoys TRT myself,

2075
01:57:24.190 --> 01:57:29.070
like God damn,
there's some benefits that stuff you can't have that you can't,

2076
01:57:29.071 --> 01:57:33.880
but why not get it?
Because Bisping's left eyes.
Why not?
You're right,
but okay,

2077
01:57:34.410 --> 01:57:36.450
that,
but that was a shot that landed.

2078
01:57:36.451 --> 01:57:40.560
Are we absolutely sure that that shot was landed because of TRT?
I mean,

2079
01:57:40.590 --> 01:57:44.940
that's the thing with tit.
If I can throw a spinning back kick a hundred times,

2080
01:57:44.941 --> 01:57:46.370
naturally I take tit,

2081
01:57:46.410 --> 01:57:50.010
I can throw it a thousand times 100% it's helped me feel that bad case,

2082
01:57:50.011 --> 01:57:53.370
especially if you can achieve hyper human levels and maintain them.

2083
01:57:53.371 --> 01:57:56.640
So that's what people I don't think totally understand about this argument about

2084
01:57:56.690 --> 01:57:59.120
tea,
our tea.
So all you have to do when,

2085
01:57:59.121 --> 01:58:03.240
when they're talking about like the dosage dosage varies for every athlete that

2086
01:58:03.241 --> 01:58:08.010
takes it,
but what they want to do is maintain a high normal,
right?

2087
01:58:08.010 --> 01:58:11.370
So high normal's like 800 this would be the number that we would look for in

2088
01:58:11.371 --> 01:58:14.460
your blood tests.
A hundred to a thousand right?
Well,
is that right?

2089
01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:18.450
It's very rare.
You get to a thousand very,
it's like super rare.

2090
01:58:18.451 --> 01:58:22.920
Like African dudes who eat elephant meet and fucking kill lions with sticks.

2091
01:58:23.070 --> 01:58:28.070
Those guys might hit a thousand naturally get some fucking super fucking

2092
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:31.350
genetics.
But like,
like Yo Al Romero,

2093
01:58:31.410 --> 01:58:35.080
there probably some times in his life where he's at a thousand.
But most people,

2094
01:58:35.090 --> 01:58:37.130
you didn't have to be like some super stud,
you know,

2095
01:58:37.131 --> 01:58:40.170
they're just does it barely exists out there out there.
They're out there.

2096
01:58:40.171 --> 01:58:44.050
There's outliers,
right?
These,
he's like fuck,
like those Iceland dudes,

2097
01:58:44.290 --> 01:58:46.510
those gigantic power like the mountain.
Yeah.

2098
01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:51.210
Obviously it probably does some fucking Mexican supplements.
Don't know leave.

2099
01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:53.710
But uh,
even on top of that,

2100
01:58:53.770 --> 01:58:58.090
Utno was Mexican supplements on top of a super human guy.

2101
01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:02.630
True gigantic,
seven foot tall gorilla man.
You're the man.
You're the mountain.

2102
01:59:02.631 --> 01:59:05.620
Yeah.
Right.
So when you're in camp,

2103
01:59:05.710 --> 01:59:08.840
like this is one of the things that Weidman was yelling at Vituro cause when v

2104
01:59:08.841 --> 01:59:09.190
Tours,

2105
01:59:09.190 --> 01:59:14.190
blood work came back from camp is the guy that had been taken off of TRT got on

2106
01:59:14.941 --> 01:59:17.170
TRT because his testosterone was low.

2107
01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:21.490
But when he's in camp training for Weidman,
they test his testosterone.

2108
01:59:21.491 --> 01:59:24.910
It's three times higher than Wyman's.
Why Ms if three,

2109
01:59:24.911 --> 01:59:29.230
he's at 12 and everyone's like,
what the fuck?
You know?
Or was it four times?

2110
01:59:29.590 --> 01:59:33.820
So He's who knows,
who knows what's going on,
who,

2111
01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:36.040
what he got away with it,
whatever it is.

2112
01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:39.730
Either he figured out a way to get his testosterone up naturally or he figured

2113
01:59:39.731 --> 01:59:44.550
out a way to do it and not get caught.
But when you are a guy like Weidman,

2114
01:59:44.551 --> 01:59:48.110
who is a young guy who's doing it by the book and doing it totally not you,

2115
01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:52.840
your body gets broken down by training and it takes some serious mental power,

2116
01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:55.720
some serious willpower to keep pushing through.

2117
01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:58.480
When you're a guy who's taken that TRT,

2118
01:59:58.481 --> 02:00:01.600
all you have to do is maintain that high normal.
So you might,

2119
02:00:01.810 --> 02:00:06.070
if your workouts are brutal and they're breaking your body down,
you gotta

2120
02:00:07.570 --> 02:00:09.100
revitalize that bitch.

2121
02:00:09.670 --> 02:00:14.140
And he might be taken giant doses several times a week for sure.

2122
02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:15.490
And if he's doing that,

2123
02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:19.780
he's operating at a level that a normal human being just can't train.

2124
02:00:19.781 --> 02:00:20.411
That just can't.

2125
02:00:20.411 --> 02:00:24.790
It doesn't mean if you're 19 doesn't matter if you're 45 you can't do it.

2126
02:00:24.791 --> 02:00:27.310
You know what the thing is though,
is granted,
you know,

2127
02:00:27.311 --> 02:00:28.660
TRT does help and all that.

2128
02:00:28.750 --> 02:00:32.740
You still have to put in the work 100% he still put in the fucking work.

2129
02:00:32.741 --> 02:00:36.970
You idiot honey.
People are like,
oh,
Barry Bond to what?
He couldn't hit a bit.
No,

2130
02:00:36.971 --> 02:00:39.820
you take all the steroids.
You want to try hitting that many home runs.

2131
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:43.420
Will they still have so much talent?
Man,
you have to have all the above.

2132
02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:45.270
Do you have to have the talent and then you have to you,

2133
02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:46.330
and that's what v tour had,

2134
02:00:46.331 --> 02:00:49.390
but do also thing that there's a thing that happened where he had this crazy

2135
02:00:49.391 --> 02:00:53.260
confidence because of that shit.
Yeah,
different kind of confidence.

2136
02:00:53.290 --> 02:00:56.500
It's just a different person who was a different person in those fights.

2137
02:00:57.230 --> 02:00:59.050
There's a lot of guys like the Overeem,
but when,

2138
02:00:59.070 --> 02:01:03.550
when he fought Brock [inaudible],
oh my God.
Oh my God.

2139
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:08.710
That was terrifying.
It made me not want to fight to 65 Shoreditch.

2140
02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:12.490
I looked at his arm,
I looked at his,
and then I looked at him like,
fuck this man.

2141
02:01:12.530 --> 02:01:16.240
Brock just couldn't fucking take him down.
Pull that fight up.
Find that fights.

2142
02:01:16.250 --> 02:01:19.390
If you could find that fight online Overeem versus Broncos finish third or

2143
02:01:19.391 --> 02:01:23.260
fourth in Olympia?
Probably wouldn't it be great if there was no testing?

2144
02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:27.280
Just so you could see that.
I don't know.
I don't know man.
I don't know.

2145
02:01:27.790 --> 02:01:30.670
I don't know.
Cause then you're talking about who has the best doctor.
I know,

2146
02:01:30.671 --> 02:01:31.504
but I mean,
okay.

2147
02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:36.190
Like when ovary and fought Badr Hari do you think bought her heart was clean?

2148
02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:40.040
Mm.
Fuck,
I love Hari.
Hate to throw them

2149
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.330
<v 0>under the bus too as well.</v>

2150
02:01:41.331 --> 02:01:46.331
So let's just leave it [inaudible] like [inaudible] k one is a different kind of

2151
02:01:49.470 --> 02:01:53.240
an environment,
you know,
and I think those guys had been,
you know,

2152
02:01:53.630 --> 02:01:56.300
these guys in Holland that had been caught.
So here's over him.

2153
02:01:56.301 --> 02:02:01.160
She's just looking at the size of the sun and he's coming out with a low stance

2154
02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:05.570
to,
hey,
look out bad products,
rocks,
leg kicks.

2155
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:09.200
He's thrown leg kicks and doing like some jeep condo hand techniques.

2156
02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:13.070
He's trying to Jab,
Jab,
you don't know what to do.
He didn't know what to do.

2157
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:17.920
He's got this guy coiled up in front of them.
Ooh.
Over him.

2158
02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:20.620
Just barely missed Gamache or overhand.
Right.

2159
02:02:20.630 --> 02:02:22.010
I don't think anyone beats that over him.

2160
02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:26.690
That's the scariest guy maybe ever in the octagon was heavy weight,
low stance,

2161
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:27.800
good luck taking him down,

2162
02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:31.580
and he also could take a shot when he was juiced up like this,

2163
02:02:31.581 --> 02:02:33.320
and God dammit,

2164
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:38.140
look at the amount of mass he was carrying then is compared to now look at this,

2165
02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:43.130
this strategy.
Look,
here's the take down defense.
Nothing.
Not a single,

2166
02:02:43.131 --> 02:02:46.820
not even calls.
Brock just couldn't complete the single.
That's so crazy.

2167
02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:50.070
He's got a hold of that single and he couldn't go a God damn thing about it.

2168
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:52.700
Brock is mixed up with the stand up though.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2169
02:02:52.730 --> 02:02:53.900
Well for him that's pretty good.

2170
02:02:53.901 --> 02:02:58.580
But there's the ferocious fucking power that Overeem has is always looming.
See,

2171
02:02:58.970 --> 02:03:00.320
it's alumina,
keeping them at bay.

2172
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:04.640
You will never see two freaks like this in the octagon ever again.

2173
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:07.240
There's that need of the bottles and the other one done.

2174
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:10.220
Then the kick approx trying to keep him out,
but he's already heard.
Oh,

2175
02:03:10.221 --> 02:03:14.710
you have a bad gut.
That's cool.
Check this out.
He's throwing some good jobs.
Yeah,

2176
02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:17.840
it really is,
but it's just over him.
Over him.
Cut already.

2177
02:03:17.841 --> 02:03:21.620
He got caught over his right eye.
That flat top ain't helping nobody.
C'Mon.

2178
02:03:21.650 --> 02:03:25.820
It looks beautiful.
I like it.
Oh,
that's nasty.
Fucking apricots.
Here's that.

2179
02:03:25.821 --> 02:03:28.760
Needed a body.
Ou had already fucked him up.
Then he kicks him.

2180
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:30.800
Here comes the kick.
The kick was nasty.

2181
02:03:32.090 --> 02:03:34.400
He throws that kick right under that right arm.

2182
02:03:35.590 --> 02:03:40.580
You're never going to see two months ago.
Oh,
and what that right kick he,

2183
02:03:40.581 --> 02:03:43.850
there's a left kick that he lands in this fight that I remember watching like

2184
02:03:43.851 --> 02:03:48.320
three or four times in a row.
Like,
Ooh,
that one.
That one wasn't a good one,
dude.

2185
02:03:48.321 --> 02:03:52.460
I love watching Brock fight.
God Damn over him looked good back then.
Jesus.

2186
02:03:52.461 --> 02:03:55.870
Different animal now in me.
Jesus.
Yeah,
I mean it,

2187
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:59.570
it makes you think like,
I get it.
I mean,

2188
02:03:59.571 --> 02:04:01.640
I'm not really saying that guy should be able to.
There it is.

2189
02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:04.940
There's an is a knee actually,
I'm sorry.
Boom,
boom.

2190
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:08.550
I'm not saying that guy should be able to do whatever.
There's,
there's the kid,

2191
02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:13.670
there's that left kick.
Yep.
Boom.
The one that went right under the armpit.
It's,

2192
02:04:13.730 --> 02:04:15.830
I'm not saying that a guy should be able to do whatever they want.

2193
02:04:15.831 --> 02:04:19.370
Just pull it back to that.
That left kick to the body again.
Just one more time.

2194
02:04:19.371 --> 02:04:21.530
I want to see that.
You know what the thing is though,
Joe,

2195
02:04:21.531 --> 02:04:22.700
you also got to chop it up.

2196
02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:27.050
This is a few years ago to over me has miles on a man.
Boom.

2197
02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:31.010
He's fucking k one pride UFC.
He has miles on them.
Oh yeah,

2198
02:04:31.011 --> 02:04:33.590
100% but I think that's what I'll call just TRT.

2199
02:04:33.610 --> 02:04:37.970
I think one of the things that TRT does is take those miles off a few months,

2200
02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:40.290
<v 1>I think takes a lot off if you do enough,</v>

2201
02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:43.800
and I think that's what we saw with [inaudible].
Here it is,
man.
This fucking,

2202
02:04:43.801 --> 02:04:48.420
he lands his right knee first and hurts him and then he lands that left kick to

2203
02:04:48.421 --> 02:04:51.760
the body and his,
when he landed this boom,
then watch.

2204
02:04:51.761 --> 02:04:56.010
You can see that momentum up and he's hurting him.
Now why here?
This is,

2205
02:04:56.040 --> 02:05:00.240
this is kind of loaded.
Bam.
Oh God.

2206
02:05:00.330 --> 02:05:04.110
Right in underneath just shin to the gut and that's right where after he had

2207
02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:08.130
that surgery for diverticulitis,

2208
02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:11.890
had a big chunk of his colon removed or his intestines removed rather than,

2209
02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:13.890
I'm a big Brock fan.
I like both those guys.

2210
02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:17.940
Big Brock fan though over him.
Then in that fight,

2211
02:05:17.941 --> 02:05:22.941
boy we had a lot of options because so many good fights for that guy's the best.

2212
02:05:23.130 --> 02:05:26.310
Seeing him against junior or him against Cain or him again,

2213
02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:29.430
there was so many fights we're going to see in him.
It was the best man.

2214
02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:34.240
It's interesting how different a guy becomes when we take that stuff away from

2215
02:05:34.241 --> 02:05:39.090
him.
I mean it is the ultimate proving ground for testosterone is the ultimate

2216
02:05:39.091 --> 02:05:42.280
proving ground.
It's different.
Yes.
For washing.

2217
02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:45.330
The difference between these guys and what they can pull off when they're on it,

2218
02:05:45.370 --> 02:05:46.350
when they're not.
I mean you can,

2219
02:05:46.410 --> 02:05:48.600
I'm sure you could see a difference in football players,

2220
02:05:49.050 --> 02:05:50.910
but the difference is you're not,

2221
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:56.010
you're not seeing them to a finish in a particular context against another human

2222
02:05:56.011 --> 02:05:59.160
being.
We get to see their movements.
Like you see a guy sprinting on the field,

2223
02:05:59.310 --> 02:06:00.930
you could see a guy making good plays.

2224
02:06:00.931 --> 02:06:03.030
You could see guy being energetic and pulling off,

2225
02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:07.530
but you're not seeing them in a sustained environment for five minutes at a
time,

2226
02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:12.420
three,
five minute rounds and watching their movements and analyzing them against

2227
02:06:12.421 --> 02:06:15.810
another human being.
I agree.
It's very like in fighting steroids,

2228
02:06:15.811 --> 02:06:17.160
it's very black and white.

2229
02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:21.360
I think it's very clear whether someone's on it very clear.
Well,

2230
02:06:21.361 --> 02:06:24.000
it's hard to say.
I'm not saying I can't look at it again and go,

2231
02:06:24.060 --> 02:06:24.893
he's taken it right,

2232
02:06:24.930 --> 02:06:29.700
but if like [inaudible] like when he fought what v tour in Brazil,

2233
02:06:29.730 --> 02:06:34.470
it was like,
holy good God.
Then p Tony fought Weidman was like,
aw man.

2234
02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:36.600
Oh fuck.
It was like the way I described it,

2235
02:06:36.601 --> 02:06:39.270
like a football pool that had like one quarter of the air missing.

2236
02:06:39.390 --> 02:06:42.180
There's just some,
there's like something happened like something's going on,

2237
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:47.370
but if you watch say like a fight and a guy is a super athlete,

2238
02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:50.430
guys,
we'll assume like people are already saying sage northcutts on steroids.

2239
02:06:50.690 --> 02:06:53.460
That's not fair.
He's 19,
let's say.
Yeah,
that's not fair.

2240
02:06:53.461 --> 02:06:55.740
That's the world we live in though.
Yeah,
of course.

2241
02:06:56.130 --> 02:06:58.170
So it's hard to tell by looking at somebody,

2242
02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:02.010
but you can tell if they changed radically.
Like if you go back to v Tours,

2243
02:07:02.011 --> 02:07:04.920
fight with Jeff,
with rich Franklin,
watch that fight.

2244
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:08.940
What's the rich Franklin fight his body and then watch his fight Rockhold fight

2245
02:07:08.941 --> 02:07:11.720
him and watch his boat.
And there were a few,
uh,
if a,

2246
02:07:11.721 --> 02:07:14.250
if a guy has like a crazy losing streak,

2247
02:07:14.251 --> 02:07:16.560
then all of a sudden he's coming back and like this new guy,

2248
02:07:16.650 --> 02:07:20.010
that's always a signal to me like,
Eh,
well I know,

2249
02:07:20.011 --> 02:07:24.450
but it even changes at saint just kicking and punching cause he's not to do
that.

2250
02:07:24.630 --> 02:07:25.680
I totally get that.

2251
02:07:25.681 --> 02:07:29.040
It should be illegal and I totally agree that it should be illegal,

2252
02:07:29.070 --> 02:07:31.140
but part of me,
it makes me go,
wow,

2253
02:07:31.170 --> 02:07:34.890
it's just so interesting to see something that allows you to do your sport way

2254
02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:36.010
better and they won't let

2255
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:39.880
<v 0>you do it.
I know,
I know.
You know,</v>

2256
02:07:39.881 --> 02:07:43.630
I mean everything else,
everything else you can do.

2257
02:07:43.690 --> 02:07:46.390
I mean like we'll talk about like,
you know,

2258
02:07:47.080 --> 02:07:51.640
different supplements like different companies that sell stuff like is a

2259
02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:57.480
testosterone boosters and all these different than creating all sorts of stuff.

2260
02:07:57.620 --> 02:07:59.950
All those things.
Teens a little bit enhance it.
Yeah.

2261
02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:03.230
It affects your performance at your recovery and all that stuff.
Yeah.

2262
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:06.460
All different vitamins,
different amino acids.
They all have an effect.

2263
02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:08.650
You can take a little,
you can have a little effect.

2264
02:08:09.070 --> 02:08:12.130
Would he take in branch chain amino acids will allow it to help.
Well,

2265
02:08:12.131 --> 02:08:16.660
what about HGH?
Like,
so if,
if a guy injured his knee,

2266
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.780
you know,
there's,

2267
02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:22.780
there's studies now the HGH is proven to really help aid in the process of

2268
02:08:22.841 --> 02:08:27.310
recovery where before guys are kind of fucked.
Oh yeah.
100% athletes take HGH.

2269
02:08:27.640 --> 02:08:28.900
Um,
yeah.
Right.

2270
02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:31.540
Especially when there's a significant injury that trying to recover from.

2271
02:08:31.541 --> 02:08:34.660
But if they're under the testing protocol,
the Usada,
they can't do it.

2272
02:08:34.690 --> 02:08:37.030
I know they can't even do it while they're recovering from an injury that

2273
02:08:37.031 --> 02:08:41.590
hurting athletes to it.
Certain athletes in it.
Certainly UFC.
Right.

2274
02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:44.260
Because now,
now that athlete that maybe you could,

2275
02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:48.310
let's say it's Anderson Silva instead of you could have taken half of his time

2276
02:08:48.311 --> 02:08:49.940
away from the sport and he could be fighting soon.

2277
02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:53.710
Do you think there should be different standards though?
Um,

2278
02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:58.060
I mean between like combat sports and other sports,

2279
02:08:58.550 --> 02:09:02.080
different standards of like what you can and can't do as far as enhancing your

2280
02:09:02.081 --> 02:09:04.990
body because of the fact that what you're trying to do ultimately to do damage.

2281
02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:07.870
Yeah.
Yeah,
100% because it just makes me more stringent.

2282
02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:11.260
Not that she is ever think of Holly was look like over him.

2283
02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:14.710
She was on some massive shit and kick run in the face.
It's a different result.

2284
02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:17.100
Totally different result.
Yeah.
If,
if,

2285
02:09:17.170 --> 02:09:21.430
if it turned out that she had tested positive after that fight,
good Lord.

2286
02:09:21.730 --> 02:09:25.000
All the hate would come her way now.
Yes.
And then,
Oh my God,

2287
02:09:25.001 --> 02:09:27.970
you've got to cheat to beat Ronda.
You fucking loser you piece of Shit.

2288
02:09:27.971 --> 02:09:32.830
They would hate her.
Yeah.
It's crazy,
man.
It's crazy.
It's,

2289
02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:34.240
but it's also theirs.
Theirs.

2290
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:38.440
Don't you think there's a different reaction when a woman gets caught taking

2291
02:09:38.441 --> 02:09:43.270
anabolic steroids versus a man?
Yeah,
I feel good thing.
Yes.

2292
02:09:43.271 --> 02:09:46.930
I think when guys do it,
it's kind of like,
eh.
Yeah,
man.
Makes Sense.

2293
02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.970
A little bit with women.
Like what?
You fucking cheater deep?
Yeah,

2294
02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:55.690
Dude.
I know girl Jujitsu competitors,
they're taking testosterone.

2295
02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:58.870
They don't even get paid.
I mean,
they're just relaxed.

2296
02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:02.350
They're just doing Jujitsu to doing Jujitsu.
Let's not do,

2297
02:10:02.351 --> 02:10:05.020
then they're doing testosterone.
Let's not do that.
Yeah,

2298
02:10:05.050 --> 02:10:08.360
they're doing like creams and stuff like that.
Like cyborg.

2299
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:11.920
We'll never be able to shake that to a steroid stuff ever.

2300
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:15.280
Did you ever watch her first fight?
Have you ever seen first fight?
Yeah,
she'll,

2301
02:10:15.281 --> 02:10:17.830
she'll never be able to shake any of that.
Even she might be clean now.

2302
02:10:17.831 --> 02:10:21.040
I'm not saying she's on stuff.
I have no idea that she's always get,

2303
02:10:21.041 --> 02:10:23.830
that's always going to be brought up every time she fights now.
Well,

2304
02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:28.750
because we all,
I mean it's like you,
you saw what she looked like.

2305
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:33.770
You saw that she didn't look anything like anybody that you knew that hadn't

2306
02:10:33.771 --> 02:10:34.010
done

2307
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:34.940
<v 1>anything that was a woman.</v>

2308
02:10:35.090 --> 02:10:40.090
Like when women get athletic and they get strong and they lift a lot of weights,

2309
02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:44.060
they very rarely look like that.
Like there was this,

2310
02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:49.120
there's this level of musculature and thickness and density and shredded at very

2311
02:10:50.571 --> 02:10:53.870
low body fat with very high muscle content and be like,
Whoa,

2312
02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:58.310
there's a lot going on.
We're just not speculating.
She tested positive.
Yeah,

2313
02:10:58.370 --> 02:11:01.820
exactly.
I'm not like on her.
I think she's on it.
No,
no.
She failed the test.
Yeah.

2314
02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:04.200
Yeah.
It's always going to travel with her.
Oh wait.

2315
02:11:04.201 --> 02:11:08.150
Speaking of big ass girls in Jiu Jitsu,
you know that Gabrielle,

2316
02:11:08.300 --> 02:11:11.870
you don't have time at,
Oh,
Debbie,
she's striking that blackouts.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2317
02:11:11.871 --> 02:11:14.330
She's looking pretty fucking.
She's like six four.

2318
02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:17.300
She's going to fight MMA in Japan.
Signed some big deal out there,

2319
02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:19.610
but the problem with her,
and she's 200 plus pounds,

2320
02:11:19.670 --> 02:11:20.900
there's the hell's a firefighter.

2321
02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:23.160
They found like some big Russian bitch with a beard or something.

2322
02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:30.020
She's knocking this Russian grizzly bear out because like you look at her and

2323
02:11:30.081 --> 02:11:31.730
she's a such a freak now.

2324
02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:36.560
It's like she used to be this really heavy woman with a lot of body fat.

2325
02:11:36.561 --> 02:11:40.250
She was really big and she was just so bulky.

2326
02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:45.320
She was so big.
And then like she must've gotten like facial reconstruction.

2327
02:11:45.710 --> 02:11:47.710
She must've gotten something done to her face too.

2328
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:49.450
And don't forget about them today.

2329
02:11:49.930 --> 02:11:54.930
She has headaches and she lost all the body fat shred cheese,

2330
02:11:56.121 --> 02:11:58.460
shredded the,
who the fuck has ever done that before?

2331
02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:02.930
Gone from being like really fat and overweight forever and just dominating girls

2332
02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:07.140
and in Jujitsu doing really well to all of a sudden being sure.

2333
02:12:08.210 --> 02:12:12.840
Shred town 10,000 fucking Bovary and versus Brock law.
100% yeah.
Yeah.

2334
02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:16.430
And now she's doing MMA and she is she,
I think she has a fight coming up Japan.

2335
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:19.630
She's on rising.
She is on the horizon card,
isn't she?
Yeah.

2336
02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:22.490
I feel like she almost father son like that.
But my thing is,
yeah,

2337
02:12:22.491 --> 02:12:27.470
look how big she is next to cat Zingano and cats.
A big girl.
Google small.
Yeah.

2338
02:12:27.500 --> 02:12:31.220
She's a good 50 pounds heavier than Cat Gabby Garcia.
That's right.

2339
02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:34.470
But she trains with my good friend Mike a fi and uh,

2340
02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:38.600
Anderson Silva's gym and he's like,
dude,
you should see this girl head.
I'm sure.

2341
02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:41.630
I'm sure she's huge.
And the other thing is like,

2342
02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:45.680
she got so good at your Jitsu and choose dominating women that you did sue.

2343
02:12:45.710 --> 02:12:46.880
She gets smashing them.

2344
02:12:46.970 --> 02:12:49.550
She gets any of those girls on the ground now with that body.

2345
02:12:49.551 --> 02:12:52.190
I mean that probably she must have so much shit locked.
She lost though.

2346
02:12:52.191 --> 02:12:57.070
That little McKenzie girl I know named piece to this.
Amazing.
Yeah,

2347
02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:00.700
I grow always like one 30 how did she do that?
I don't know.

2348
02:13:00.701 --> 02:13:03.140
I'm a Fuji to Jujitsu.

2349
02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:08.860
Jujitsu is the only martial art where small talented guy really can beat a

2350
02:13:08.901 --> 02:13:10.430
bigger,
stronger,
faster guy.

2351
02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:14.630
Just by knowing the techniques just by being like a guy like Marcella Garcia,

2352
02:13:14.631 --> 02:13:17.530
when he fought Rigo Rodriguez grappling match,
she said I should,

2353
02:13:17.531 --> 02:13:21.300
they fight a match.
Like everybody knew Marcel was going to win.
You know,

2354
02:13:21.301 --> 02:13:23.570
there's a point where my Marcel took Rico's back.

2355
02:13:23.571 --> 02:13:28.280
Rico sort of like violated the rules.
He slammed my hand.
Yeah,

2356
02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:32.060
he slammed him because Ma Marcella was backpacking him.
He was on them

2357
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:33.480
<v 0>like can you didn't want to get choked out.</v>

2358
02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:38.600
So he threw all of his 240 plus pounds backwards with Marcello on his back.

2359
02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:42.600
So he landed all the weight on Marcello's back.

2360
02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:47.440
Susses slammed him to the ground and then Marcel leg locked him.
Such a bad ass.

2361
02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:49.680
[inaudible] this technique.

2362
02:13:50.130 --> 02:13:54.230
So his leg locks your boy Ryan Hall fight.
I know Dwayne.

2363
02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:58.260
Now what happened was someone was supposed to fight him and they couldn't get a

2364
02:13:58.261 --> 02:14:02.550
visa or something.
No.
So the guy who was,
uh,
he's from England,

2365
02:14:02.580 --> 02:14:05.040
he lied on his,
um,
uh,

2366
02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:07.580
visa to get in there and yet some felony or something like that.

2367
02:14:07.581 --> 02:14:10.350
So they didn't allow him back in the states to fight for the finale.

2368
02:14:10.650 --> 02:14:14.730
So Brian Hall stepped up.
Uh,
but Ron Hall lost already in the House.

2369
02:14:14.731 --> 02:14:19.530
Who Do you lose to a,
I forget.
I haven't watched,
I binge watch.

2370
02:14:19.890 --> 02:14:23.880
I like to Binge Watch,
you know,
I've been doing the show on Fox sports live,

2371
02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:27.090
so I'd just watch,
I like watch him bright before I go on the show,

2372
02:14:27.091 --> 02:14:30.090
but I don't watch the ultimate fighter.
Well,
I've been crazy busy too,

2373
02:14:30.091 --> 02:14:32.280
and since I have,
I'm concentrating on this card,

2374
02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:35.160
I'm not calling those other cards.
I'm only car calling that one card.

2375
02:14:35.161 --> 02:14:38.340
I didn't watch it too much that the Artem guy,
he's Connor's boy.

2376
02:14:38.370 --> 02:14:41.900
He's knocking motherfuckers out his ARD.
Yeah,
he hits hard,
but y'all,
you know,

2377
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:45.330
also drops his hands and he throws these winging punches.

2378
02:14:45.331 --> 02:14:48.570
And so it's interesting.
It's,
yeah,
it's interesting.
It's interesting.
Yeah,

2379
02:14:48.571 --> 02:14:49.250
it's gonna be trouble.

2380
02:14:49.250 --> 02:14:52.140
It's a crazy fucking week and no one's even talking about Chad Mendez and

2381
02:14:52.141 --> 02:14:54.540
Frankie Edgar.
No one's even talking about it.
Listen,

2382
02:14:54.541 --> 02:14:58.710
you ain't shit unless you're a fricking Josie or Connor this weekend.

2383
02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:03.120
Even Chris Weidman was like,
come on man.
Come on.
Give me some love here.

2384
02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:07.540
John Gray and a Frickin,
you know,
we,
we forgot to even w we,

2385
02:15:07.541 --> 02:15:10.140
we skipped over him almost.
Yeah.
Well,

2386
02:15:10.141 --> 02:15:13.890
we always want someone like Conor to come along who believes in himself in a way

2387
02:15:13.891 --> 02:15:15.780
that we can't imagine believing in ourselves.

2388
02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:20.010
We want someone to come along who says crazy shit.
Like he says,

2389
02:15:20.011 --> 02:15:23.010
he's like our Muhammad Ali,
but Irish and small.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

2390
02:15:23.011 --> 02:15:27.180
But,
but in a weird new way,
you know,

2391
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:29.700
where do you like it though?
Because if you meet Connor,

2392
02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:33.450
granted he does blame stuff on anyone,
but he's such a good dude.
Yeah.

2393
02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:36.780
I had lunch with him like,
God Damn,
man,
I'm a greater sign man.

2394
02:15:36.781 --> 02:15:39.270
You're such a good person.
He's a great guy.
And He,

2395
02:15:39.330 --> 02:15:44.100
and he really does fuck with their heads,
man.
He really does a number on dudes.

2396
02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:44.821
They get in there,

2397
02:15:44.821 --> 02:15:47.220
they're all discombobulated by the time they get in there with them.

2398
02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:50.730
And I think other fighters respect that because the amount of shit that he's

2399
02:15:50.731 --> 02:15:53.520
talked and he puts so much pressure on themselves,
it's like damn.

2400
02:15:53.521 --> 02:15:55.120
And he's still pulls it off.
Yeah.

2401
02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:57.720
Because even in little interviews when outside when I,

2402
02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:02.000
I've talked a little bit of Shit,
I got phoned that guy,
shit.
Fuck.

2403
02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:05.160
You talked about the Mark Hunt thing when mark hung got mad at you and you're

2404
02:16:05.161 --> 02:16:08.960
like,
hey,
hey man,
I'll extend my DM on Twitter.
Hey Bro,

2405
02:16:09.330 --> 02:16:13.240
I was just joking man.
What's up brother?
He's cool.
He's cool as fuck though.
Yeah.

2406
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:17.700
Was super cool.
Mark Hunt.
Yeah,
she has a guy.

2407
02:16:17.701 --> 02:16:21.480
Imagine him on testosterone replacement.
Oh my God,
he's not doing nothing.

2408
02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:23.950
Ain't no one fighting that guy.
Especially too.

2409
02:16:24.030 --> 02:16:27.660
There's something about some mole ones like they're,
they're just,

2410
02:16:27.690 --> 02:16:31.840
they're built better to just sturdier like tanks.

2411
02:16:31.841 --> 02:16:33.750
The tanks are tanks and I'm a bike.

2412
02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:36.940
His knees are twice the size of a normal person's knees.

2413
02:16:36.941 --> 02:16:41.020
When you see like Mark Hunt inside the octagon.
Yeah,
he was made to fight man.

2414
02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:44.710
Damn fucking dude throws bombs to what's next for him though.

2415
02:16:44.930 --> 02:16:45.600
It's a good question.

2416
02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:48.010
Cause you know he's coming off a big win over bigfoot Silva.

2417
02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:49.570
What the plan is going to happen when big foot.

2418
02:16:49.571 --> 02:16:52.070
Do you think they're going to let big foot go if they release bigfoot,

2419
02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:54.520
will they be in time for him to fight fader and pride?

2420
02:16:54.580 --> 02:16:59.290
God Damn horizon the horizon Bryson.
Cause that's the fight yet?
I don't think so.

2421
02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:01.620
I don't know.
I don't know what's going on with them.
Bullshit.
If they had it,

2422
02:17:01.630 --> 02:17:05.200
if they gave enough time,
if they were nice and they go,
look,
big flood.
Hang on.

2423
02:17:05.410 --> 02:17:08.740
I'm just saying it won't happen,
but you can go over to Japan.
I'll let y'all,

2424
02:17:09.690 --> 02:17:12.670
I don't see why they wouldn't because what's left for big w where's big foot go?

2425
02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:14.260
What are we going to do with being in Japan?

2426
02:17:14.261 --> 02:17:16.780
They're not going to make 'em weigh in,
can way,
whatever he wants.

2427
02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:20.770
They'll let them take whatever he wants and if anybody has a right to take

2428
02:17:20.771 --> 02:17:25.310
testosterone,
it's big foot is a pituitary gland tumor and that's why as giant is

2429
02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:30.460
allegedly,
well perhaps that's what the according to that says,

2430
02:17:30.770 --> 02:17:34.820
go into the commission to these bias tests done with his blood work.

2431
02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:38.980
I'll tell you that's a great game plan because in the UFC,
yeah,

2432
02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:41.830
there ain't nothing for you homie.
It's just nothing for it is now.

2433
02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:44.350
Can't do that anymore.
Yeah,
there's no title shot.

2434
02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:46.810
They're going to throw you to the wolves and just build off your name.

2435
02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:49.660
He still hits hard.
He's still dangerous.
Fucked up over him.

2436
02:17:49.930 --> 02:17:53.560
And that was one of the best highlight reel knockout in the heavyweight
division.

2437
02:17:53.561 --> 02:17:55.610
That combination of punches of new lands on over here,

2438
02:17:55.710 --> 02:17:58.690
but I got him up against the cage.
The fucking Bang,
Bang,
Bang,
Bang,
Bang.

2439
02:17:58.690 --> 02:18:01.100
How about Travis Browne?
Oh yeah.

2440
02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:04.180
Travis ate that right hand against the cage,

2441
02:18:04.300 --> 02:18:07.330
but Travis blue isn't his hamstring out.
Remember his leg gave out.

2442
02:18:07.570 --> 02:18:10.540
I remember that now.
Getting blasted in the face though,
but that,

2443
02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:14.110
that was big foot on some shit.
It was so none of that man.

2444
02:18:14.140 --> 02:18:16.840
You know what I'm saying?
We don't have that big foot for sure.

2445
02:18:16.841 --> 02:18:20.500
After you're walking papers and go fight fader and get all big and swole,

2446
02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:21.880
who they give him his walking papers.

2447
02:18:21.881 --> 02:18:24.580
He doesn't have enough time to fight fader like we're,
we're dealing,

2448
02:18:24.581 --> 02:18:28.430
it's like December 10th now we're talking about this cyber attack fatal.

2449
02:18:28.470 --> 02:18:29.291
A puff cake,

2450
02:18:29.291 --> 02:18:33.700
like you always fucking fights these days and then let's have big foot get on

2451
02:18:33.701 --> 02:18:34.780
some shit.
And those thing,

2452
02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:39.310
I can't believe they keep saying fade or a meal and ankle with a to be announced

2453
02:18:39.311 --> 02:18:43.960
opponent this month.
I'll tell you what you want to talk about business on one.

2454
02:18:44.110 --> 02:18:47.530
Don't do that.
Yeah.
Fuck.
Are you guys doing,
that's what they've always done.

2455
02:18:47.810 --> 02:18:52.480
It's tried.
Always did.
Always think the pride days,
man.
Huh?
We need matchups.

2456
02:18:52.510 --> 02:18:53.980
We need good matchups.
You're not,

2457
02:18:54.010 --> 02:18:57.130
I'm not buying a paper who just fade or for some schmuck on it.
Well,

2458
02:18:57.131 --> 02:18:59.380
it's not a phase.
It's not a pay per view.
It's going to be on spike.

2459
02:18:59.410 --> 02:19:03.070
So there's that.
You know it's right,
but still that that's not gonna.

2460
02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:05.050
You're not gonna get huge numbers doing that anymore.

2461
02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:07.540
I wanted to once change kind of numbers,
they will get,

2462
02:19:07.630 --> 02:19:11.860
because this is the Ken shamrock fight.
Two hoists,
Gracie,
Ken chairman.

2463
02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:15.030
You know what?
People will buy that Kimbo slice.
People will.

2464
02:19:15.031 --> 02:19:18.400
By that I mean by it is meanings.
Watch it.
They'll watch it.
It'll get,

2465
02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:21.670
it'll get a million people.
You don't think it'll get a million people.
It's free.

2466
02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:25.060
Yes.
We get a million on spike to get a million.
Kim.
This,

2467
02:19:25.090 --> 02:19:30.020
I'll watch Kimbo slice Kimbo Dada and then hoists and Ken and then fade or as

2468
02:19:30.021 --> 02:19:32.260
well,
I'm,
I think that's the car.
That's the ramen.

2469
02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:36.620
Get my fucking Cammo tap out shirt out of the box to put that shit on and go

2470
02:19:36.621 --> 02:19:39.140
back to 2002 you have one with the yellow color.

2471
02:19:39.170 --> 02:19:43.700
I looked before I was so sick that I just said,
Hey Bella,
tour all the door.

2472
02:19:43.970 --> 02:19:47.540
Let's do something new,
man.
Let's try and get some fresh blood in there.

2473
02:19:47.630 --> 02:19:48.990
Well they need to do user good.

2474
02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:53.300
Pay Benson a shitload of money and get him to get over that.
That's right.

2475
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:58.250
How about that Michael Page guy?
Yeah,
he's fine.
He's fine.
He's fine.
He's it.

2476
02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:01.580
He hasn't fought,
you know,
no top competition,
but he has the potential.

2477
02:20:01.610 --> 02:20:04.610
He's fun to watch because a lot of wild shit.
Lot of wild shit.

2478
02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:07.280
A lot of wild shit.
A lot of wild results.
Crazy knockouts.

2479
02:20:07.281 --> 02:20:10.190
Wonder what's going to happen with,
uh,
Ben?
It's a good question.

2480
02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:11.270
It's a very good question.

2481
02:20:11.610 --> 02:20:14.420
When I heard some Korean organization off from a ton of money,

2482
02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:19.490
only $200,000 a fight.
Yeah.
That's not that.
That's okay.

2483
02:20:19.610 --> 02:20:23.480
It's decent.
It's decent,
but it's not enough to take a risk and leave the UFC.

2484
02:20:23.481 --> 02:20:25.670
Cause who knows if they're even gonna be around in a year.
Well,

2485
02:20:25.671 --> 02:20:27.240
if they're going to be around.
Yeah.

2486
02:20:27.260 --> 02:20:29.450
But you know you can get sponsors when you're over there.

2487
02:20:29.451 --> 02:20:32.300
No one's really watching.
That's not where,
exactly.
That's not working.
Well,

2488
02:20:32.301 --> 02:20:35.540
he's not getting any sponsors over here.
You know?
That's part of the problem.

2489
02:20:35.600 --> 02:20:38.940
Yeah.
You can pray together.
They spell your name right and shit.
I

2490
02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:44.200
understood,
although that,
great.
How about they called a,

2491
02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:48.380
they called Anthony Pettis the Mauler.
That's fucking awesome.
I love it.

2492
02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:49.930
It's like someone inside the company,

2493
02:20:49.931 --> 02:20:51.530
it's like trying to sabotage it or something.

2494
02:20:51.531 --> 02:20:54.020
I feel like there's someone in there just like,
God,
how can I fuck this?

2495
02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:56.330
I think there's some dude who works for the company that were,

2496
02:20:56.390 --> 02:20:58.490
he's on the underground and he's,
he's,

2497
02:20:58.491 --> 02:21:03.491
he's like a secret Sabbath tour and he's going into the database and changing

2498
02:21:04.011 --> 02:21:06.860
things after hours.
They're like,
look the fuck they get there.

2499
02:21:06.861 --> 02:21:09.950
The teachers are printed.
What do you,
what the fuck is and I'll do,
what is this?

2500
02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:10.431
He's like,
oh,

2501
02:21:10.431 --> 02:21:14.120
I already put it up and he's [inaudible] that something has to be going on.

2502
02:21:14.240 --> 02:21:18.800
Who knows?
Who knows?
Maybe someone from Adidas growing pains.
Adita owns them.

2503
02:21:19.100 --> 02:21:22.520
Oh they do a zones.
Reebok they do like the redheaded stepchild.

2504
02:21:22.910 --> 02:21:23.960
Maybe someone from Nike.

2505
02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:26.660
Maybe Nike didn't like the deal so they let [inaudible] at the deal.

2506
02:21:26.660 --> 02:21:29.270
Then they sabotage the company with spyware.

2507
02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:34.010
That's the only legit like it makes no sense to me.

2508
02:21:34.011 --> 02:21:37.610
It doesn't make any sense for the design of the shirts too.
How about that?

2509
02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:40.850
How about the design?
Like what did you,
did you guys spend 20 minutes?

2510
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:44.060
Is there I touched was like there's some guys like you think I can make these

2511
02:21:44.061 --> 02:21:46.730
dumb asses where this,
you think someone's going to sign off on it?

2512
02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:51.560
I mean if you just put that out on the Internet and you said come up with a

2513
02:21:51.561 --> 02:21:55.520
design idea and you know,
we'll give you 50 grand or something like that,

2514
02:21:55.521 --> 02:21:57.440
which is Jack Shit for Reebok.
Yeah.

2515
02:21:57.450 --> 02:22:02.450
Not just get fans who are fans of the sport with Photoshop and you open yourself

2516
02:22:03.261 --> 02:22:06.680
up to this just gigantic pool of people that come up with ideas.

2517
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:10.460
You can get some dope stuff.
God Man,
Oh my God.
Phenomenal stuff.

2518
02:22:10.461 --> 02:22:11.660
And instead they just basically,

2519
02:22:11.661 --> 02:22:15.470
they didn't even spell the names right on all of them.
So you know,

2520
02:22:15.471 --> 02:22:19.880
I mean a month,
how much time was put into that.
It's just a bummer man.

2521
02:22:20.260 --> 02:22:23.600
And his bomber bumps me out just because I love the Ufa.

2522
02:22:23.601 --> 02:22:26.850
It makes the UFC look bad.
Reebok do or the fuck you want.

2523
02:22:26.851 --> 02:22:30.110
But by signing this deal now it looked like dumb asses.
Oh,

2524
02:22:30.111 --> 02:22:32.430
into the hardcore fans.
They're the only ones even know about it.

2525
02:22:32.460 --> 02:22:36.340
Most people have no idea why anybody is wearing a Reebok pair of pants versus

2526
02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:38.670
the,
I mean you have to be like deep in it.
Like we are,

2527
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:42.540
like the average guy was watched and fucking buffalo wild wings and he doesn't

2528
02:22:42.541 --> 02:22:44.040
give a shit and he doesn't give a shit.

2529
02:22:44.041 --> 02:22:47.670
But also that guy's not going to buy a fight kit.
You're right.

2530
02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:48.481
If you want to appeal,

2531
02:22:48.481 --> 02:22:53.010
the welts isn't going to buy a fight kit mean you just start going outside and

2532
02:22:53.011 --> 02:22:57.330
pointing at people.
You'll be successful.
I agree.
No,
let me just can't.

2533
02:22:57.630 --> 02:22:59.860
Who's buying?
If you've seen one,
have you ever seen one?
Seen One?

2534
02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:03.030
I've never seen one.
Some guy tweeted me earlier today,
he goes,
holy shit shop.

2535
02:23:03.031 --> 02:23:06.370
I'm seeing Connor Mcgregor fight kits.
Other that's at the,

2536
02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:09.930
you know diamond people.
Yeah,
but they smell like Guinness.

2537
02:23:10.650 --> 02:23:15.450
The American flag uncover Gregor Shit.
I think they did it on a website.
Um,

2538
02:23:15.500 --> 02:23:16.380
what they did though,

2539
02:23:16.381 --> 02:23:20.460
also some guy ordered it and took pictures like this can't be right.
Oh God,

2540
02:23:20.461 --> 02:23:23.430
I really,
yes.
Physically had,
it was like,
come on man,

2541
02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:26.460
I've got to fucking Konrad Geico shirt.
Well,

2542
02:23:26.461 --> 02:23:30.180
how about the Ireland shirt that they made where they didn't include Northern

2543
02:23:30.181 --> 02:23:33.400
Ireland?
That was a big one.
Oh my God.
That was a big issue.

2544
02:23:33.570 --> 02:23:37.980
That's a massive insult to those people.
That's a massive insult.

2545
02:23:37.981 --> 02:23:41.370
Like you're trying to sell the image of their land and you don't,

2546
02:23:41.371 --> 02:23:45.840
I mean this has been this historical dispute between the north and south and

2547
02:23:45.841 --> 02:23:48.420
you're,
you're going to not include Northern Ireland,

2548
02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:51.450
Conor Mcgregor's head coach or like,
you guys better change that right now.

2549
02:23:51.451 --> 02:23:54.000
I'm ripping all this Reebok shit off my walls.
Yeah.

2550
02:23:54.001 --> 02:23:57.900
I mean that's a big deal to huge deal for those guys.
Just details man.
You know,

2551
02:23:57.901 --> 02:24:00.090
it's just,
it comes down to just details.

2552
02:24:00.180 --> 02:24:02.460
I'm sure Dana is getting so much shit from it.

2553
02:24:02.610 --> 02:24:06.900
He's going to start folk focusing on it more.
I hope so.
But um,

2554
02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:09.200
it's a fucking nightmare,
man.
They have,

2555
02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:13.170
they've done nothing good because at least if they were fucking things up,

2556
02:24:13.171 --> 02:24:14.610
but guys,
we're getting paid.
It's like,
don't worry,

2557
02:24:14.611 --> 02:24:16.930
we'll figure it out in the fight.
It's like,
it's all good,
but right,
right,
right.

2558
02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:18.420
You can't do that when you're buying guys.

2559
02:24:18.450 --> 02:24:20.910
That's exactly how fighters would be dead.
They wouldn't give a shit.

2560
02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:23.130
If you spelled her name wrong,
we'd give them half a million dollars.

2561
02:24:23.250 --> 02:24:27.720
I don't give a fuck.
Call me Brandon.
Give me five on new shop.
Yeah,
change it.

2562
02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:31.220
Why did you want Brandon?
That's cool,
but like viewed nickname.

2563
02:24:31.330 --> 02:24:35.700
Brenda and Brenda just fucked up.

2564
02:24:35.701 --> 02:24:39.450
Brandon will be in quotes.
You just take that on as your new nickname.

2565
02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:45.860
It's like sage,
sage Northcutt.
Someone tagged me on his Instagram.
He posts,
oh,

2566
02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:50.870
get my shirt for the fights tonight and the sh t shirts 34 99 well that's an

2567
02:24:51.001 --> 02:24:54.450
issue there and then sage is getting such big fallen,

2568
02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:59.130
do your own shit man.
You know we've been over this.
Beat it to a dead horse.

2569
02:24:59.131 --> 02:25:00.640
Reebok,
you'll figure it out.
Well,

2570
02:25:00.641 --> 02:25:04.350
you got a unique opportunity to do that because of the podcast and you know,

2571
02:25:04.351 --> 02:25:05.540
you connect with all these people.

2572
02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:07.800
Then you have like this network of people that listen to your stuff.

2573
02:25:07.801 --> 02:25:09.300
You give a free podcast all the time.

2574
02:25:09.301 --> 02:25:10.950
They want to wear those fighter and the kid shirts.

2575
02:25:10.951 --> 02:25:14.700
They want to drink coffee out of the fighter and the kid mug.
Yeah,
it's,

2576
02:25:14.730 --> 02:25:18.960
it's hard for a fighter to establish all that stuff and get it going while

2577
02:25:18.961 --> 02:25:22.890
they're in the middle of training camp to get the managers and managers all that

2578
02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:24.010
should recommend

2579
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:26.290
<v 1>it to them.
Oh yeah.
I mean,
I think he shouldn't be focused on,</v>

2580
02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:29.550
don't get me twisted.
Don't get it.
Don't get it wrong.
I just feel like,
uh,

2581
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:33.820
if you're not on that model yet,
you're getting left behind.
It's true.
But,
um,

2582
02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:36.550
you know,
these managers and these agents and stuff,
they,
they,

2583
02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:39.400
they probably don't even know how to do it.
They don't even,

2584
02:25:39.401 --> 02:25:42.010
they're not even aware because everybody's just concentrating on the fight game.

2585
02:25:42.190 --> 02:25:45.050
It's like you have to earn some money.
You're not making money doing that re,

2586
02:25:45.051 --> 02:25:46.030
but you're not so,
all right,

2587
02:25:46.031 --> 02:25:49.900
so you're taking 20% of his money that he already earned from Reebok.

2588
02:25:49.930 --> 02:25:51.490
That makes no sense.
How are you gonna make money?

2589
02:25:51.610 --> 02:25:53.860
How much can a fight or make doing seminars?

2590
02:25:53.950 --> 02:25:57.940
Like when someone starts doing seminars,
how much can they make a decent money?

2591
02:25:57.941 --> 02:26:00.760
If you go on like tours,
you know,
we're talking about the beast man.

2592
02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:04.690
How much they make.
Like how much can a guy,
big name guy make for a day?

2593
02:26:05.350 --> 02:26:08.840
I'm not that.
I know.
I'm not a superstar being all,
I was getting a,

2594
02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:13.060
I did a seminar once and I got like six grand.
That's pretty good.

2595
02:26:13.090 --> 02:26:16.810
That's pretty good.
How many people were in there?
Uh,

2596
02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:21.550
it was in Canada.
Uh,
I mean it was packed.
It was packed.
Couple hundred.

2597
02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:24.520
Yeah.
Uh,
no hundred.
100.
100.
Yeah.

2598
02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:26.590
Eddie Bravo does some pretty fucking big seminars.

2599
02:26:26.750 --> 02:26:28.870
[inaudible] I don't want to be rude to him and ask him how much he makes,

2600
02:26:29.350 --> 02:26:32.620
but I would think that if you do a bunch of those like in a row,

2601
02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:35.760
like you do a gang of those.
So that's a,
that's a real living.

2602
02:26:35.780 --> 02:26:37.540
They have to be legit though.
You know what I'm saying?

2603
02:26:37.541 --> 02:26:42.220
A lot of times when guys so technical and he's such a good fighter,
he's not,

2604
02:26:42.490 --> 02:26:46.420
he can't relate that in words very well.
So the seminar kind of sucked.

2605
02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:50.620
It also seems that like Jujitsu is the seminar that people want to go to.

2606
02:26:50.690 --> 02:26:54.280
It's very hard to get people to go to MMA seminar or very hard to get people to

2607
02:26:54.281 --> 02:26:56.410
go to a Moitai seminar or a harder,

2608
02:26:56.530 --> 02:26:59.380
but you Jitsu seminars are typically pretty fucking giant.
Well,

2609
02:26:59.390 --> 02:27:01.950
I feel like Jujitsu is more lucrative,
right?
Like rice,

2610
02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:03.880
people who sign up for Jitsu,
especially in California,

2611
02:27:03.881 --> 02:27:06.970
if you're going through that whole,
the whole belt system,
you'd have some bank.

2612
02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:09.220
So they're going to sign up for a Jujitsu seminar.

2613
02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:13.780
Machida does a shitload of seminars and real karate seminar.
Yeah,
he does.
Yeah.

2614
02:27:14.110 --> 02:27:16.900
But his family has that background.
His brother,
his dad can help.

2615
02:27:16.901 --> 02:27:19.990
It's a little different animal.
Yeah.
And he's famous and he's a former champion.

2616
02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:23.380
Super famous.
Yeah.
It's different if you're famous.
Yeah.

2617
02:27:23.770 --> 02:27:28.120
It's an interesting thing.
Uh,
seminars,
you know,

2618
02:27:28.121 --> 02:27:30.580
seminars are very fascinating to me,
you know,

2619
02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:34.840
and also like putting together a gym and make that Jim a successful entity,

2620
02:27:34.841 --> 02:27:36.790
a successful business.
It's so hard to do.

2621
02:27:37.150 --> 02:27:39.280
Do you know anything about Combat Sports Academy,

2622
02:27:39.281 --> 02:27:42.520
the CSA or Kevin Ross trains out of a gene?

2623
02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:47.530
I guess Gina Carano is up there now too.
Variable Nakamoto.
I've heard of it.
Yeah.

2624
02:27:47.670 --> 02:27:49.920
He's,
he's a bad motherfucker.
The guy runs at Jimmy.

2625
02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:52.030
He knows what he's doing and he's got a giant gym.

2626
02:27:52.350 --> 02:27:55.570
I said a lot of members and he puts on seminars and teaches people how to run

2627
02:27:55.571 --> 02:27:59.890
gyms,
how to successfully run gyms and set up training programs.
That's brilliant.

2628
02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:03.070
Yeah.
I want to go,
I should go to it sometime just to watch,

2629
02:28:03.071 --> 02:28:05.530
just for my own editor.
Yeah.
We should go find out what,

2630
02:28:05.531 --> 02:28:06.550
I think he does it annually.

2631
02:28:06.580 --> 02:28:09.970
I think he does it annually because on that too though,
right?

2632
02:28:09.970 --> 02:28:13.100
Like they do different though,
different than just saying they do a thing.
How,

2633
02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:17.080
how you can qualify to be a trainer for mom academy.
Right.

2634
02:28:17.081 --> 02:28:20.620
But this is the difference being that it's training protocol like John Wolf does

2635
02:28:20.621 --> 02:28:24.170
a lot of,
but it's all like kettlebells and um,
uh,

2636
02:28:24.171 --> 02:28:27.320
steel maces and things on the eds exercises.
You know,
there's a,

2637
02:28:27.321 --> 02:28:30.750
there's a difference between teaching someone how to,
uh,

2638
02:28:31.010 --> 02:28:33.860
like perform exercises correctly.

2639
02:28:33.861 --> 02:28:38.060
Like kettlebell certifications are pretty common,
you know,
like,
um,
uh,

2640
02:28:38.450 --> 02:28:42.710
Pavel does a bunch of them,
a bunch of different cattle.
It's Steve Maxwell does.

2641
02:28:42.711 --> 02:28:46.190
He has his own certification process.
I think Mauler Mike Mahler does as well.

2642
02:28:46.730 --> 02:28:50.540
The real big name guys have the certification protocols because they figure out

2643
02:28:50.541 --> 02:28:54.260
what's the best way to implement their training regimen and then they teach it

2644
02:28:54.261 --> 02:28:55.820
to people so they could teach to other people.

2645
02:28:55.970 --> 02:28:59.150
And once you get the technique down the most movements down,
stuff like that.

2646
02:28:59.390 --> 02:29:02.990
But I think it's way more complex to get a bunch of people who sign up for your

2647
02:29:02.991 --> 02:29:04.640
gym.
I think that's hard for people to do.

2648
02:29:04.641 --> 02:29:07.910
And he's teaching them how to run the gym and be successful.
I think so.

2649
02:29:07.911 --> 02:29:12.350
I'm pretty sure.
And I think also how to set up training,
uh,

2650
02:29:12.530 --> 02:29:17.420
training schedules and calendars and how to peak fighters.
That's priceless.

2651
02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:20.300
Yeah,
you should be killing it.
There should be,
it's a lot of people come,

2652
02:29:20.301 --> 02:29:22.490
a lot of people come to those things.
You should be killing it.
Cause that,

2653
02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:26.530
I mean to learn that it's priceless.
We also has a key,
he's got some um,

2654
02:29:26.660 --> 02:29:30.080
crossfit shit going on too,
cause they like their Instagram posts.

2655
02:29:30.350 --> 02:29:32.330
There's a lot of his crossfit games stuff,

2656
02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:35.120
a lot of crossfit classes and exercises.

2657
02:29:35.450 --> 02:29:39.890
So I think is Jim is both a strength and conditioning gym and a Moitai Jim and I

2658
02:29:39.891 --> 02:29:42.710
know they have Hartman.
They have some MMA fighters here as well.
Yeah.

2659
02:29:42.860 --> 02:29:46.690
But it's like Moitai it's very hard to get a lot of people to sign up for more

2660
02:29:46.691 --> 02:29:48.770
dine out.
A lot of people want to get their face split open.

2661
02:29:49.270 --> 02:29:51.850
A lot of people want to get cut up my elbows.
Yeah.

2662
02:29:52.010 --> 02:29:55.760
That's why Jujitsu so lucrative.
Exactly.
He'd get old ladies do Jujitsu.

2663
02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:59.090
Even crossfit,
crossfit.
So big man.
Yeah.

2664
02:29:59.840 --> 02:30:01.310
It's hard to run a gym,
man.

2665
02:30:01.311 --> 02:30:05.780
He even running a fucking 24 hour fitness or la fitness or something like that.

2666
02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:08.960
Since I was a kid.
You know,
my dad's a business since I was a kid.

2667
02:30:08.961 --> 02:30:11.810
A gym or a restaurant.
It's not the way you want to go.
People ask me,

2668
02:30:11.820 --> 02:30:13.850
are we going to start a gym?
Absolutely not.
Yeah.

2669
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:17.790
The chance of you making legit money off that.
Good luck,
man,
Tara.

2670
02:30:17.810 --> 02:30:21.680
So competitive and let's use some scrooge McDuck like Dan Lambert,

2671
02:30:21.681 --> 02:30:24.980
who doesn't give a fuck,
who puts together some,
just jog.
I mean,
I don't know.

2672
02:30:25.010 --> 02:30:26.180
I don't ever ask Dan,

2673
02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:30.440
but I can't imagine how long it took him before att was profitable.

2674
02:30:30.520 --> 02:30:31.930
It takes a long ass time.

2675
02:30:31.960 --> 02:30:36.200
I'm sure it's probably profitable now because it's so big and so famous,

2676
02:30:36.201 --> 02:30:38.450
so popular.
But I might be wrong.

2677
02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:41.410
He might just be doing it for the money breaking even.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2678
02:30:41.570 --> 02:30:45.820
He made me do it for the fun rather than the money.
Yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's,

2679
02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:50.950
it's also when you think about how many different schools and colleges produce

2680
02:30:51.891 --> 02:30:54.260
professional football players,
right?

2681
02:30:54.500 --> 02:30:57.440
They go from the high school system to the college system and they go from the

2682
02:30:57.441 --> 02:31:00.810
college system into the NFL.
You know what I mean?
There's the,
the,

2683
02:31:00.860 --> 02:31:05.860
the wealth of talent nationwide established these,

2684
02:31:06.170 --> 02:31:09.770
these systems as these kids come up in 300 a year,

2685
02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:13.670
so established,
right?
MMA is not like that.

2686
02:31:13.880 --> 02:31:17.930
Now you have these random professional gyms and some of them like there's

2687
02:31:17.931 --> 02:31:21.180
fighting like Johnny Hendricks left team take down.
I know.
So He's,

2688
02:31:21.181 --> 02:31:22.650
what he's gonna do is he's going to uh,

2689
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:25.830
have some fucking hold mitts farm and do some boxing work and then work out with

2690
02:31:25.831 --> 02:31:30.660
like a the Oklahoma state wrestling team.
And like I was saying,
yeah,
yeah.

2691
02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:33.480
He's got to put together his own camp is leaving team take down.

2692
02:31:33.481 --> 02:31:34.950
There's tough man.
It is tough.

2693
02:31:35.220 --> 02:31:38.960
And also he lives in Dallas team take down was in Dallas is the big,
you know,

2694
02:31:39.010 --> 02:31:41.160
big place in Dallas.
They came up together.

2695
02:31:41.850 --> 02:31:46.410
I think they had some sort of a problem because the team takedown thing,

2696
02:31:46.440 --> 02:31:48.180
if I'm talking out of my ass here,

2697
02:31:48.181 --> 02:31:49.860
cause it was all just stuff I've read on the Internet.

2698
02:31:50.070 --> 02:31:53.610
But I believe what they did is they give the fighters a salary and they give

2699
02:31:53.611 --> 02:31:57.000
them,
you know,
they set him up room and board room but take care of everything.

2700
02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:02.000
But when the money starts rolling in they get 50% God dog 50% we're talking

2701
02:32:02.791 --> 02:32:05.930
about Johnny headed cause the champ.
Yup.
That'd be annoying as fuck boy,

2702
02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:10.050
he's not the champ anymore.
Yeah,
but still he was for awhile.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2703
02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:11.070
You got to wonder,

2704
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:15.480
you know what's the most profitable way to do 50 is a lot of fifty's a ton,

2705
02:32:15.481 --> 02:32:19.680
but also at the same time,
you know,
it was Johnny Guy that didn't have anything.

2706
02:32:19.681 --> 02:32:21.720
He's coming from Oklahoma,
from college and like,
listen,

2707
02:32:21.721 --> 02:32:24.570
we're gonna invest all this money and you hope and you become the champ and then

2708
02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:27.390
we'll get our money back on the investment.
Zach,
and then did it happen.

2709
02:32:27.391 --> 02:32:30.710
Johnny was like,
listen,
I don't know the details.
It was giant like fuck this man.

2710
02:32:30.711 --> 02:32:33.810
It's too much money.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I mean I,
it's hard to tell.

2711
02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:35.220
It's hard to tell.
You know,

2712
02:32:35.221 --> 02:32:39.090
and then there's the argument that could be made where like if you have a high

2713
02:32:39.091 --> 02:32:41.040
level champion like a Johnny Hendricks,

2714
02:32:41.041 --> 02:32:45.030
it makes the whole gym better and it's worth a lot of money to the gym just to

2715
02:32:45.031 --> 02:32:48.000
have him training for 100% percent.
Right.
Huge.

2716
02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:50.280
Because it changes people's attitude about a gym.

2717
02:32:50.430 --> 02:32:53.820
It brings better guys into the gym.
A hundred percent a hundred percent like,

2718
02:32:53.860 --> 02:32:56.310
like here's a perfect example.
Muscle farm.

2719
02:32:56.460 --> 02:33:00.210
You found out that Tj just moved to muscle farm.
Everybody went,
Whoa,
hold on.

2720
02:33:00.570 --> 02:33:04.080
That's a ballsy move by muscle farm.
That's a gangster move,
right?
Yeah.

2721
02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:08.550
You got a guy like um,
Matt Brown's there to get a guy like Matt Brown.

2722
02:33:08.551 --> 02:33:10.920
You can see you got Matt Brown and you got Tj Dillashaw.
Okay.

2723
02:33:10.921 --> 02:33:12.840
You're making moves.
You got Matt Brown.
Yeah.

2724
02:33:13.170 --> 02:33:17.760
Tj Dillashaw that brain and that Yo mag me up.
Yup.
Yup.

2725
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:22.140
Neil magnet just beaten Calvin gas.
Lum that raises it big time.
Like that's,

2726
02:33:22.210 --> 02:33:25.900
those are gangster moves,
right?
That's,
that's how you get a gym.
Popular.

2727
02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:28.470
So now here we are talking about the muscle farm.
Jim,

2728
02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:30.720
if they didn't do that would we be talking about it?
No,

2729
02:33:30.721 --> 02:33:32.550
we'll rampage was train in there years ago.

2730
02:33:32.790 --> 02:33:35.400
Did we talked about the first one we didn't talk about sage.

2731
02:33:35.450 --> 02:33:38.910
You know sage Northcutt left Tristar.
He did.

2732
02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:43.290
Dad pulled them from Trista what?
Yeah.
When that's in the recent,

2733
02:33:43.340 --> 02:33:45.840
the recent article I read,
His dad took me on the Tristar.

2734
02:33:45.900 --> 02:33:46.860
He's trained in Dallas now,

2735
02:33:46.861 --> 02:33:50.420
some local gym in Dallas or some shit like that or wherever he's from and take

2736
02:33:50.490 --> 02:33:54.840
Sam whoa station,
whatever.
Hmm.
I wonder what that's all about.
I don't know.

2737
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:59.790
French girls coach till get ya too much than fish.

2738
02:34:00.860 --> 02:34:04.980
[inaudible] Sanchez.
If he doesn't,

2739
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:09.040
I don't know.
I wouldn't want fucking sheets on life.

2740
02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:14.320
I don't want to fucking be the person who has to watch that kid sheets.
You know,

2741
02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:19.930
the amount just was fly out of his body in the middle of the night from his

2742
02:34:19.931 --> 02:34:24.340
dreams.
Spiderman.
But
yeah,
man,

2743
02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:29.130
it's going to have a,
a tough road as far as distractions go.
But yeah,

2744
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:32.380
worse things could happen.
Yeah,
I agree.
It's a good thing.
Oh,

2745
02:34:32.381 --> 02:34:34.350
he might just fly off the fucking hate.

2746
02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:36.790
Noah's got prince returned to twice to our,
after UFC fight.

2747
02:34:36.791 --> 02:34:41.110
Night 80 [inaudible] future acting modeling gigs up.
It's over.
Well,
yeah,

2748
02:34:41.111 --> 02:34:44.380
let's over.
Hey man,
acting and modeling in the UFC.

2749
02:34:44.381 --> 02:34:46.930
Let's talk about modeling and acting.
Yeah.
Well,

2750
02:34:46.931 --> 02:34:51.070
maybe just sees the potential for money and realizes you can only fight so much.

2751
02:34:51.370 --> 02:34:55.300
I mean,
that's always possible.
It is always possible,
man.
I mean,
look,

2752
02:34:55.301 --> 02:34:58.060
you have to think about it that way.
Look at what's going on with you.

2753
02:34:58.060 --> 02:35:02.050
Look at how much more money you make now doing your podcast then you were making

2754
02:35:02.051 --> 02:35:04.690
when you're fighting and how much easier it is for you.
Even close,

2755
02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:09.010
not even close and end.
The podcast is growing every month.

2756
02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:11.890
I saw you guys were in the top 10 of all the podcasts in the world the other
day.

2757
02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:16.830
Hm.
Yeah.
Holla,
Holla,
hello episode.
Scooch.
Make whatever the fuck it was.
I mean,

2758
02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:18.580
it's crazy.
And on top of that,

2759
02:35:18.581 --> 02:35:22.570
you doing these live shows that are selling out months in advance and that's

2760
02:35:22.571 --> 02:35:24.730
super profitable and all that comes to you.

2761
02:35:24.731 --> 02:35:28.330
It's doesn't have to go through the UFC.
You make your own schedule.
There's no,

2762
02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:31.690
no one tells you what to do or what not to do what you can and can't say.

2763
02:35:31.870 --> 02:35:35.470
You don't get some angry phone call from somebody says,
why'd you say that?

2764
02:35:35.471 --> 02:35:36.910
You know,
you're not supposed to talk about that.

2765
02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:40.010
You talk about where the fuck you want.
I can't believe my life,
man.
So I'm,

2766
02:35:40.020 --> 02:35:41.590
I'm doing the best I've ever done in my life.

2767
02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:45.490
So a kid like this sees the possibilities of the future and he goes,
look,

2768
02:35:45.491 --> 02:35:48.400
you gotta take what you can take.
He had to take what's there.

2769
02:35:48.410 --> 02:35:53.410
You don't put it aside to try to pursue like this potentially lucrative career

2770
02:35:55.480 --> 02:36:00.160
as a UFC champion.
You know what the difference is though,
is he's 19 yeah,

2771
02:36:00.190 --> 02:36:04.720
he's 19 he's a freak athlete.
He's already getting notoriety.

2772
02:36:05.260 --> 02:36:05.830
He's not,

2773
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:10.830
he's not gonna be able to take that step into movies like Rhonda Deter George

2774
02:36:11.020 --> 02:36:12.490
Saint Pierre unless he's super successful.

2775
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:16.330
So if he already has one foot out the door and now you're about to get ate the

2776
02:36:16.331 --> 02:36:20.560
fuck up in that division at one 55 yeah,
maybe.

2777
02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:23.380
Or maybe he doesn't really have one foot out the door.

2778
02:36:23.410 --> 02:36:26.650
Maybe these are just things that come his way,
says sure.
If I have the time,

2779
02:36:26.651 --> 02:36:30.910
I mean who knows what kind of go Dan knows son relationship he has or how

2780
02:36:30.970 --> 02:36:33.700
disciplined he is.
I don't know.
The only time will tell,

2781
02:36:33.701 --> 02:36:37.970
but all the trappings are laid out in front of him.
When you see that,
I mean,

2782
02:36:37.971 --> 02:36:40.630
and that's what we kind of missed with the Ronda Rousey thing.

2783
02:36:41.050 --> 02:36:43.780
We didn't really talk about it.
She had been able to pull it off.

2784
02:36:43.781 --> 02:36:44.770
She was so successful.

2785
02:36:44.771 --> 02:36:48.850
We thought she was the exception exception and then Holly Holmes said,
Nah,

2786
02:36:48.851 --> 02:36:52.590
check this out.
Wow.
There's no,
yeah.

2787
02:36:53.410 --> 02:36:56.730
That's why I think that fight was good for martial arts because it showed you

2788
02:36:56.810 --> 02:36:59.710
you can't violate the rules of engagement.

2789
02:36:59.740 --> 02:37:04.480
You have to be prepared for any type of engagement.
It's a fight.
It's a fight.

2790
02:37:04.530 --> 02:37:07.630
Well,
Connor said that he goes,
I let no distractions.
You know,

2791
02:37:07.631 --> 02:37:09.850
like I think everyone can learn from the Rhonda fight.

2792
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:12.970
There's no distractions for me.
Smart.
And he goes,

2793
02:37:12.971 --> 02:37:16.040
I've been offered movie TV deals.
He goes,
I do not care about that.

2794
02:37:16.041 --> 02:37:18.380
There's no distractions for me.
When I hear that I'm like,

2795
02:37:18.381 --> 02:37:22.370
this motherfucker is smarter land because of Rhonda didn't do all those things.

2796
02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:24.980
If she put all those things aside and just went into a spartan,

2797
02:37:24.981 --> 02:37:27.620
like existence from the jump and never,

2798
02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:32.630
never Bovary eight never varied from her course and had outstanding training

2799
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:36.710
every step of the way.
You're talking about like a truly unusual athlete.

2800
02:37:37.100 --> 02:37:42.100
Truly unusual outlier of an athlete is someone who's got that kind of focus and

2801
02:37:42.141 --> 02:37:46.340
drive.
Yes.
It's going to be interesting to see what happens,
man.

2802
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:51.770
It'll work out for the rest of the world.
Well,

2803
02:37:52.340 --> 02:37:57.170
hopefully it works out for her.
Yeah,
well,
I mean,
yeah,
hopefully.

2804
02:37:57.650 --> 02:38:00.860
But then again,
hopefully it works out for Holly to,
I agree,
man.

2805
02:38:01.100 --> 02:38:04.780
You have to kind of look at it that way.
But let's work out like if you know,

2806
02:38:04.790 --> 02:38:06.980
I know run is not materialistic,
but let me say workout.

2807
02:38:07.100 --> 02:38:08.840
If you're talking about bank account,
yes,
she's fine,

2808
02:38:08.841 --> 02:38:11.450
but it's more than that for her.
It's of course,
you know what I'm saying?

2809
02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:14.720
But it's worked out.
Depends.
She's fine because of the way she lives.

2810
02:38:14.810 --> 02:38:18.830
She's not living like scrooge.
That's true.

2811
02:38:19.850 --> 02:38:23.120
You know,
she's,
she's pretty frugal for someone who's very wealthy.

2812
02:38:23.121 --> 02:38:27.650
She has a small house,
you know,
she's not,
yeah,
she's not balling out of control.

2813
02:38:27.690 --> 02:38:32.690
So think of that,
but then also think about what does she do now?
You know,

2814
02:38:33.580 --> 02:38:37.700
she had opportunity for real greatness and for a moment had achieved it.

2815
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:42.350
She had this opportunity to be the first ever UFC women's bantamweight champion.

2816
02:38:42.470 --> 02:38:43.970
She took it and then ran with it,

2817
02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:48.650
smashed everybody in front of her and became this gigantic fucking superstar

2818
02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:51.460
until she fought Holly.
But now it's like,
well,

2819
02:38:51.650 --> 02:38:55.490
is the whole fucking game board has changed,

2820
02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:58.700
everything's changed,
the reality has changed.

2821
02:38:59.150 --> 02:39:03.230
Everything has shifted and you need to adjust to this new reality.

2822
02:39:04.410 --> 02:39:09.410
I feel like women fighting is kind of similar to box and where inbox in a few

2823
02:39:10.431 --> 02:39:14.210
lose a fight,
you're kind of fucked in the women's division.
It's not that deep.

2824
02:39:14.211 --> 02:39:16.420
So when you lose a fight,
you're kind of fucked.
Yeah.

2825
02:39:16.700 --> 02:39:20.110
Which is like as soon as you lose this guy,
like,
yeah,
no,
you were great,

2826
02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:23.660
but there's a little astrick 10 now,
right.
Which amend that.
It's not that way.

2827
02:39:23.661 --> 02:39:27.620
So let's say common,
uh,
Josie,
you know,
they can go back and forth.

2828
02:39:27.621 --> 02:39:32.270
They're going to be fine.
Maybe.
Maybe.
It's interesting.
Interesting,
right,
man.

2829
02:39:32.271 --> 02:39:35.330
So interesting.
And you know what,
how about the fucking strawweight division?

2830
02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:39.740
It's so shallow that you've got Paige vanzant who I love.

2831
02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:44.570
She's fucking so scrappy and aggressive and,
but she's already number seven,

2832
02:39:44.810 --> 02:39:48.100
three,
eight.
Oh,
how about roses?
I think rose is records two and three are,

2833
02:39:48.101 --> 02:39:50.000
I think rose is ranked number 12 or something.

2834
02:39:50.001 --> 02:39:53.300
Is that what she's ranked higher on that machine?
She might be higher than that.

2835
02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:55.730
I mean there's some girls ranked like,
Oh yeah,
I'm talking to the guy.

2836
02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:58.280
The Guy Uriah is fighting is ranked number 12 what is,

2837
02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:02.630
she's ranked number three roses.
Yeah.
Roses,
roses,
bad ass.
She's phenomenal.

2838
02:40:02.690 --> 02:40:03.620
She's phenomenal.

2839
02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:08.030
And she's wild and she does a lot of like really explosive things.
Like she does,

2840
02:40:08.090 --> 02:40:10.780
she's flying armbar very,
very dangerous.
But that what?

2841
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:13.650
That is a God damn great fun fight.
Right?

2842
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:16.240
But it's not a lot of those in that division.
There's not like,

2843
02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:21.260
she's like per page being that young and that talented and that like,

2844
02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:23.490
she's fun.
Like she's smiling.

2845
02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:27.720
It's all fun and games till you win that fight and you fight fucking you ana,

2846
02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:33.040
that demon who's gonna fucking rearrange your face in five rounds or Claudia

2847
02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:37.770
[inaudible] who's a fucking destroyer as well.
Clauses nasty man.

2848
02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:41.220
That girl's nasty.
You know what I heard?
I heard,
um,

2849
02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:43.380
I'm not breaking news kind of a rumor.

2850
02:40:43.410 --> 02:40:45.780
They might announce it already in the press conference,
but uh,

2851
02:40:46.030 --> 02:40:50.730
[inaudible] and Joanna are the next tough coaches.
I like that.

2852
02:40:51.100 --> 02:40:54.790
Do you?
Yeah,
I like that.
I liked that fight.
That was,

2853
02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:59.670
I loved the site split decision.
Yeah.
Phenomenal fight.
Yeah,
it's a good fine.
Oh,

2854
02:40:59.671 --> 02:41:02.730
you don't like them as coaches?
I'll give a fuck a coaches.
Honestly,

2855
02:41:02.731 --> 02:41:05.550
I don't like drama.
If I wanna watch real housewives of Beverly Hills,

2856
02:41:05.551 --> 02:41:08.580
I'll watch drama.
You know,
I want to watch fights.

2857
02:41:08.670 --> 02:41:10.470
I want to watch fights and with you,
Joe.

2858
02:41:10.650 --> 02:41:15.420
But the ultimate fighter is a long process.
Yeah,
no,
I understand.

2859
02:41:15.660 --> 02:41:20.250
I don't particularly like the fights on the ultimate fighter that much.
No,

2860
02:41:20.251 --> 02:41:21.590
I don't either.
I could be wrong,

2861
02:41:21.591 --> 02:41:25.460
but that's a rumor I heard is from a legit source.
But you know,

2862
02:41:26.130 --> 02:41:27.660
most of the guys in the ultimate fighter,

2863
02:41:27.661 --> 02:41:30.360
I appreciate the fact that they're learning and getting better,
and they said,

2864
02:41:30.361 --> 02:41:33.630
but when guys get gassed out in the middle of the first round and tough,

2865
02:41:33.870 --> 02:41:37.980
it's all like,
I,
I know how hard it is to even do what they're doing.

2866
02:41:38.010 --> 02:41:40.710
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not demeaning them,

2867
02:41:40.711 --> 02:41:44.970
but in order for me to really want to pay a lot of attention to fighters,

2868
02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.330
they have to achieve a certain level because you've seen that level.

2869
02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:52.410
I've seen it too many times.
So I see so many,
like,
like Uriah Hall,

2870
02:41:52.411 --> 02:41:56.780
when he was on the ultimate fighter,
I was like,
Ooh,
okay.
You can do some dance.

2871
02:41:56.790 --> 02:42:01.410
Motherfucker do some damage.
Yes.
Robert Whittaker,
same thing.
I was like,
Ooh,
okay.

2872
02:42:01.770 --> 02:42:04.830
You know,
um,
there's guys,
there's guys you see,
they go,
all right,

2873
02:42:04.850 --> 02:42:06.420
this is terrific.
And Dude,
it's rare.

2874
02:42:06.421 --> 02:42:10.740
Like last night or whatever early in that last night,
two days or whatever.

2875
02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:12.930
They asked me on the ultimate fighter,

2876
02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:16.590
who do you think can be successful in the UFC?
Who would you pay money to see?

2877
02:42:17.070 --> 02:42:21.150
My answer was no one but probably no one right now.
They have a long ways to go.

2878
02:42:21.151 --> 02:42:24.750
Who Act actually in to get to the UFC.
They have a long ways to go.

2879
02:42:24.930 --> 02:42:28.380
The answer is the guy who's the youngest who's the most focused,

2880
02:42:28.430 --> 02:42:31.470
who has the most attention to you can put to it.
Who's the best athlete,

2881
02:42:31.471 --> 02:42:34.800
who's in the best camp,
best camp.
There's all those things.
All those things.

2882
02:42:35.090 --> 02:42:37.620
Can you capitalize on your experience there and learn and grow.

2883
02:42:37.770 --> 02:42:40.650
It's a great farm system to great farm system.

2884
02:42:40.830 --> 02:42:44.070
The problem is you're taking like people that you know,

2885
02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:46.020
they may not be fully grown.

2886
02:42:46.021 --> 02:42:49.440
They Devon sprouted yet they're not there now and you throwing them right into

2887
02:42:49.441 --> 02:42:52.680
the mixed martial arts Subaru.
It's interesting because,
yeah,
exactly.

2888
02:42:52.681 --> 02:42:56.640
Cause Dalton fighter used to be guys were,
you know,
two and o three,
you know,

2889
02:42:56.760 --> 02:42:58.050
and then you know,

2890
02:42:58.260 --> 02:43:01.410
you're on that show and then you kind of have a huge following and then you're

2891
02:43:01.411 --> 02:43:03.390
in the UFC and can have a couple of buildup fights.

2892
02:43:03.391 --> 02:43:06.670
But at least you have a fan base.
Well now it's like these guys are,

2893
02:43:06.690 --> 02:43:10.260
they get launched right into the mix.
Like I think,
uh,

2894
02:43:10.650 --> 02:43:11.920
you know I Roy Nelson,

2895
02:43:11.921 --> 02:43:14.390
which I had no business fight in the time and then like six months later it's

2896
02:43:14.391 --> 02:43:17.530
right and Gabriel Gonzaga went from fighting a guy in the ultimate fighter with

2897
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:21.910
two fights that Gabriel can saga like lap the former heavyweight championship

2898
02:43:21.911 --> 02:43:25.390
contender.
I was like,
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

2899
02:43:25.391 --> 02:43:29.890
That is the trickiest thing about going from that far from that show right into

2900
02:43:29.891 --> 02:43:31.650
the big leagues.
What if,

2901
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:36.440
what the fuck happened in that one dude that fought Efrain Escudero and Efrain

2902
02:43:36.460 --> 02:43:40.300
beat 'em.
Everybody was all hyped up on them.
Dana was like,

2903
02:43:40.301 --> 02:43:43.390
he's like [inaudible] they know is fighting tonight.

2904
02:43:44.050 --> 02:43:48.520
Is he on the keys on the card?
I think so.
He was a fucking talented kid.

2905
02:43:48.910 --> 02:43:50.200
He's one of those guys.
You,
you,

2906
02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:54.820
you see him against guys who are of a lesser caliber and he looks like a

2907
02:43:54.821 --> 02:43:59.420
monster.
Yeah.
But let's never call them Anderson Silva ever.
Like,
you know,

2908
02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:03.340
I think it's hard to judge when you're watching people that are fighting people

2909
02:44:03.341 --> 02:44:06.560
that aren't that good.
God Damn,
he looks shredded there though.
Like shredded,

2910
02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:08.070
he's all heads of the day.
I did it.

2911
02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:12.940
Did for some weird problem where he was like blacking out to now have some like

2912
02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:16.360
some serious issue.
Like,
like he would have like a,

2913
02:44:16.390 --> 02:44:19.000
like a fainting spell or something like that.
A medical issue.

2914
02:44:19.030 --> 02:44:22.390
Like a fainting goat thing.
Yeah.
It was something wrong.
And he was out for a,

2915
02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:25.640
and then he was fighting all around and then he got back to the UFC.

2916
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:27.880
I fought other places.
Um,

2917
02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:31.050
I'm just looking at roads and van Zandt.
I mean,

2918
02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:33.510
is that the sexiest fight of all time?
I hate to be sucked in.

2919
02:44:33.511 --> 02:44:37.090
So doing it the way is that Tim means versus John Howard.

2920
02:44:37.140 --> 02:44:40.990
[inaudible] fucking kidding me.
It's the dirty birds.
Holy Shit.

2921
02:44:40.991 --> 02:44:43.210
I didn't even know this is happening.
This is tonight.

2922
02:44:44.590 --> 02:44:48.730
What is it on now?
Actually on now?
Is it on fight pass?

2923
02:44:50.770 --> 02:44:52.050
<v 2>Robert's qualified as</v>

2924
02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:56.140
<v 1>really,
whoa.
Jesus Christ.
Okay,</v>

2925
02:44:56.141 --> 02:45:00.310
so there's a few fights before you get to Tim means that is a fucking bang up

2926
02:45:00.311 --> 02:45:04.810
fight,
man.
That's a great fight.
And Tim means is nasty.
He's nasty man.

2927
02:45:04.811 --> 02:45:09.700
He got caught by Matt Brown,
but not after he tagged map was a fun fight.

2928
02:45:09.701 --> 02:45:12.930
Man was a the very fun fight.
Dirty birds.
Fun to watch.
Oh yeah.

2929
02:45:12.970 --> 02:45:17.970
He's super technical and he's an Albuquerque guy outside of Greg Jackson's gym.

2930
02:45:18.461 --> 02:45:21.520
He says that other jet,
what's the NHP or something like that.
I forget.

2931
02:45:22.990 --> 02:45:27.240
I forget.
I should pull it up.
Pull it up.
Yeah.
Um,

2932
02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:32.470
I'm not sure,
but,
um,
his trainer.
Why?
Why am I drawing a blank?

2933
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:38.420
John Tom Vaughn.
Tom Vaughn.
Is Tom Vaughn is training gym or no?

2934
02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:42.200
Um,
I'll find out.
She's a Jim Miller's a good one.

2935
02:45:43.730 --> 02:45:48.380
Oh yeah,
she has a cheese.
Fucking,
I know.
I didn't even know that.
My Dad,

2936
02:45:48.410 --> 02:45:53.060
Jim Miller was fighting.
Oh fuck.
Yeah,
I know Karen One.
Jesus Christ.

2937
02:45:53.090 --> 02:45:56.720
Kaley.
Keren.
Yeah.
She's a little beast.
God Damn.

2938
02:45:56.721 --> 02:46:01.250
There's some crazy ass fights going on.
It's crazy.
What a,
what an amazing time.

2939
02:46:01.970 --> 02:46:04.490
These three days are not,
it's almost like 35 fights.

2940
02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:09.320
Overwhelming wealth of goodness.
That happens over three days.
My brain's like,

2941
02:46:09.321 --> 02:46:12.410
oh yeah,
man,

2942
02:46:13.940 --> 02:46:18.320
this is what's going on right now.
This fight.
Yeah.
Guys got some great tattoos.

2943
02:46:19.270 --> 02:46:20.420
Okay.
It's set of hair on them.

2944
02:46:21.500 --> 02:46:25.550
It's an awesome time to be an MMA fan or you're going to go to Abi on a Sunday.

2945
02:46:25.870 --> 02:46:29.160
Is this Sissy Bravo and it's everyday was Chanel.
Yeah.
Oh,
you going?
Yeah.
Fuck.

2946
02:46:29.180 --> 02:46:33.950
Tell me back.
I'll go with,
yeah.
What time?
Um,
I got a wild ride,
man.

2947
02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:37.550
Um,
I fly in early in the morning.
I think it starts at,

2948
02:46:39.650 --> 02:46:44.360
I want to say it starts at four,
three or four.
Anythings starts,

2949
02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:48.300
I don't know.
I'll go for,
for sure.
Maybe start just talking about it.
Well,

2950
02:46:48.301 --> 02:46:51.140
if I'll find out what time it starts.
Well,
let's find out what to find out.

2951
02:46:51.141 --> 02:46:53.630
What time the 80 probably invitationals starts.

2952
02:46:54.890 --> 02:46:58.250
I knew I had to have enough time to get home and take a nap and then head out

2953
02:46:58.330 --> 02:47:00.410
and it's,
it's almost sold out.
Folks,

2954
02:47:00.411 --> 02:47:05.330
if you thinking about going 5:00 AM five o'clock [inaudible] 23 hours from now,

2955
02:47:05.420 --> 02:47:09.080
and what is the,
um,
what's the name of the,
the,
the uh,

2956
02:47:09.410 --> 02:47:12.260
theater at the,
the venue,

2957
02:47:15.650 --> 02:47:18.410
the Orpheum in downtown,
which is an awesome theater.

2958
02:47:18.411 --> 02:47:21.410
It's really cool fucking old theater.
Um,
but it's,

2959
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:24.200
it might be sold out now.
Uh,

2960
02:47:24.201 --> 02:47:29.110
it was real close to sold out up until I'm like,
yeah,

2961
02:47:29.150 --> 02:47:33.260
last night.
So it might already be sold out.
But,
uh,

2962
02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:38.180
if you want to go see a really fucking exciting Jujitsu competition and you're

2963
02:47:38.181 --> 02:47:40.400
interested in martial arts,
you're interested in Jujitsu,

2964
02:47:40.460 --> 02:47:42.800
even if you've never competed,
you never trained.

2965
02:47:43.370 --> 02:47:46.920
This is the one to go to because first of all,
it's like a,

2966
02:47:46.921 --> 02:47:51.800
a great bunch of killers that are inside the,
uh,
the brackets,

2967
02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:56.510
including Gary Tonin,
who's one of the best in the world in Nogi grappling.

2968
02:47:56.511 --> 02:48:01.250
He's fucking sensational.
He's a killer.
And Denny Papagos,
who is a,
uh,

2969
02:48:01.310 --> 02:48:04.650
he went as a brown belt.
He was a world champion.
Um,

2970
02:48:05.180 --> 02:48:08.480
Nathan Orchard is in this who's also one of Eddie's black belts who is elite.

2971
02:48:08.481 --> 02:48:08.721
There's a,

2972
02:48:08.721 --> 02:48:12.710
it's like a whole bunch of like really good high level talent and the system

2973
02:48:12.711 --> 02:48:17.090
that Eddie's created,
the way they reset the fights,
they battle it out.

2974
02:48:17.180 --> 02:48:20.870
They have a certain time limit and then after that time limit,
if there's no,

2975
02:48:20.930 --> 02:48:24.710
no one has finished anybody,
then they put them in positions.

2976
02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:29.240
Like they'll start off with you on a guy's back with an over under hook with

2977
02:48:29.241 --> 02:48:33.410
both hooks in and you say ready,
go.
And then if he taps you,

2978
02:48:33.411 --> 02:48:37.310
then you get to start in that same position and it's sort of like overtime

2979
02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:41.150
rounds and wrestling sick.
It's a great idea.
And it's like at first I was like,

2980
02:48:41.151 --> 02:48:43.910
boy,
I don't know about that.
But then you see it live,
we go,

2981
02:48:43.940 --> 02:48:48.940
oh this works and it's fucking Psyfari entertaining and most well done.

2982
02:48:49.380 --> 02:48:50.810
Just to show them,
I think,

2983
02:48:50.930 --> 02:48:53.690
what's the website that they can go to if they want to?
Eddie Bravo,

2984
02:48:53.691 --> 02:48:56.210
invitational.com that's what it is.
Eddie Bravo,

2985
02:48:56.240 --> 02:48:59.420
invitational.com and if you want,
you can,

2986
02:48:59.930 --> 02:49:02.210
might be able to still get a couple of tickets for the Orpheum,

2987
02:49:02.211 --> 02:49:06.560
but it might be sold out,
but you can watch it online at butoh videos.
What is it?

2988
02:49:06.561 --> 02:49:07.980
Butoh videos.com

2989
02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:09.710
<v 0>go there.
And uh,</v>

2990
02:49:09.711 --> 02:49:14.400
I'm sure Eddie Bravo's a Twitter page has all the information as well as 10th

2991
02:49:14.401 --> 02:49:19.270
planet j j.com oh,

Always down.
We broke it broke down.

2993

This is a wonderful time.
If you're an MMA fan,

2994
