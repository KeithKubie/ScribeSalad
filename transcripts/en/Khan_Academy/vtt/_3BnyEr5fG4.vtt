00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.130
Our question asks us, what
equation describes the growth

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.550
pattern of this sequence
of a block?

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.460
So we want to figure out, if I
know that x is equal to 10,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.860
how many blocks am
I going to have?

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.240
So let's just look at
this pattern here.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.440
So our first term in our
sequence, or our first object,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.360
or our first pattern of blocks
right here, we just have 1

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.350
block right there.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.470
So let me write, the term--
write it up here --so I have

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.350
the term and, then I'll have
the number of blocks.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.520
So in our first term,
we had one block.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.780
And then our second term-- I'll
just write this down,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.150
just so we have it --what
happened here?

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.940
So it looks just like our first
term, but we added a

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.545
column here of four blocks.

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:57.140
So it's like 1 plus
4 right there.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.500
So we're going to have five
blocks right there.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.330
We added 4 to it.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.850
Then in our third term
what happened?

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.269
What happened in
our third term?

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.650
Well it just looks just like the
second term, but we added

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.980
another column of four
blocks here.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.170
Right?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.450
We added this column
right there.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.540
If you imagine they were being
added to the left-hand side of

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.660
the pattern.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.030
So we added four more blocks.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.930
We have nine blocks now.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.020
We have nine blocks, so it looks
like each time we're

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.810
adding four blocks.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.900
And on this fourth
term, same thing.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.520
The third term is just
this right here.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.250
This right here is what the
third term looked like, and

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.650
then we added another column
of four blocks right here.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.570
So we added four more, so we're
going to have 13 blocks.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.800
So our fourth term is 13.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.870
So let's see if we can come up
with a formula, either looking

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.020
at the graphics, or maybe
looking at the numbers

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.530
themselves.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.675
So one way to think about it, so
we start off with-- So when

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:52.470
x is equal to 1, let's say that
x is equal to the term,

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.510
we add just this 1 there.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.440
Then when x is equal to 2, we
added one column of four.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.860
So this is when x is equal to 2,
we have one column of four.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.690
Then when x is equal
to 3, we have two

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.520
columns of 4, right there.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.390
And you could even say when x
is equal to 1, you had zero

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.270
columns, right?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.300
We had no, nothing, no extra
columns of four blocks.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.510
We didn't have any.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.670
And then when x is equal to
4, we had three columns.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.410
We had three columns there,
when x is equal to 4.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.750
So what's the pattern here?

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.530
Or how can we express the number
of blocks we're going

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.920
to have, given the term
that we have?

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800
Well, it looks like we're
always going to have one

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.010
block, so let me write
it this way.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.550
If I write the number of
blocks-- let me write it this

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.650
way --it looks like
we're always going

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.050
to have one, right?

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.500
We have this one right here,
that one right there, that one

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.030
right there, that
one right there.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.420
Looks like we always have one
plus a certain number of

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.710
columns of four, but how many
columns do we have?

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.120
When x is equal to 1, we have
no columns of four blocks.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.740
When x is equal to 2,
we have one column.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.330
When x is equal to 3,
we have two columns.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.770
So when x is equal to anything,
it looks like we

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.300
have one less number
of columns.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.740
So it's going to be
x minus 1, right?

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.360
When x is 2, x minus 1 is 1.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.220
When x is 3, x minus 1, so this
right here is x minus 1.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.950
x is 2, this is x minus 1.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.670
This is x minus 1.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.650
This is x minus 1, and x minus
1 will tell us the number of

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.990
columns we have, right?

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.180
Here we have one, two,
three columns.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.150
Here we have one, two columns.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.330
Here we only have one column.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.780
Here we have zero columns.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.010
So it even works for
the first term.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.670
And in every one of these
columns, so this right here, x

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.600
minus 1 is the number of
columns, and then in each

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.430
column we have four blocks.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.530
So it's the number of columns
times 4, right?

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.340
For each of these columns,
we have one column.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.710
We have one, two, three,
four blocks.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.590
So this is the equation that
describes the growth pattern.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.400
So let me write this, let me
simplify this a little bit.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.390
If I were to multiply 4 times x
minus 1, I get the number of

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.940
blocks being equal to
1 plus 4 times x.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.960
I have to distribute it.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.050
4 times x is 4x, and then
4 times negative

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.680
1 is negative 4.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.980
So that's equal to the
number of blocks.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.600
And we could simplify this.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.690
We have a 1 and we have a minus
4, or I guess we're

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.420
subtracting 4 from it, so this
is going to be equal to 4x

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.250
minus 3 is the number of blocks
given our x term.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.190
So if we're on term 50, it's
going to be 4 times 50, which

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.120
is 200 minus 3, which
is 197 blocks.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.890
Now another way you could have
done it is you could have just

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.100
said, look, every time we're
adding 4, this is a linear

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.050
relationship, and you could
essentially find the slope of

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.370
the line that connects this,
but assume that our line is

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.560
only defined on integers.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.520
And that might be a little bit
more complicated, but the way

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.330
that you think about it is,
every one, every time we added

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.930
a block, we added-- or every
time we added a term we added

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.660
four blocks.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.180
So we could write it this way.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.490
We could just write change--
so this the triangle right

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.520
here means change.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:48.240
Delta means change in blocks
divided by change in x.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.490
Now you might recognize this.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.290
This is slope.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.160
And if you don't worry, if slope
is a completely foreign

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.100
concept to you, you can just
do it the way we did it the

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.190
first part of this video.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.180
And that's a completely
legitimate way, and hopefully

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.550
it will make some connections
between what slope is.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.670
So what is the change in blocks
for a change in x.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:11.050
So when we went from x going
from 1 to 2-- so our change in

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.350
x here would be 2 minus 1, we
increased by 1 --what was our

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.700
change in blocks?

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.580
It would be 4, or 5 minus 1.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.740
It's 5 minus 1.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.560
And what is this equal to?

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.330
This is equal to 4 over 1,
which is equal to 4.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.710
Let me scroll over
a little bit.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.380
So our change in blocks, or
change in x is 4, or our slope

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.890
is equal to 4.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.920
So if you want to do this kind
of the setting up the equation

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.900
of a line way, you would say
that our equation-- If, well

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.460
let me write it.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:54.130
Number of blocks are going to
be equal to 4 times the term

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.970
that we're dealing with,
the term in our

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.490
pattern, plus some constant.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.260
This right here is the
equation of a line.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.135
If it's completely foreign to
you, just do it the way we did

00:07:05.135 --> 00:07:07.330
it earlier in the video.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.370
And so, how do we solve
for this constant?

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.320
Well, we use one of
our terms here.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.960
We know that when we had one--
In our first term we

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.700
only had one block.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.750
So let's put that here.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.760
So in our first term-- we're
going to have that b right

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.390
there --we only had one block.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.830
So we have 1 is equal
to 4 plus b.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.260
If you subtract 4 from both
sides of this equation, so you

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.240
subtract 4 from both sides,
what do you get?

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.360
On the left-hand side, 1 minus
4 is negative 3, and that's

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.260
equal to-- these 4's cancel
out --and and

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.030
that's equal to b.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.970
So another way to get the
equation of a line, we have

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.910
just solved that b is
equal to negative 3.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.960
We said how much do the number
of blocks change for a certain

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.660
change in x, which is a change
in the number blocks for a

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.680
change in x, we saw
it's always 4.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.230
4 per change in x.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.510
When x changes by 1,
we change by 4.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.630
That gave us our slope.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.535
And then to solve for-- If you
view this as a line, although

00:08:08.535 --> 00:08:12.120
this is only defined
on integers, I

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.550
guess positive integers.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.230
In this situation, you could
view this as a y-intercept.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.520
To solve for this constant, we
just use one of our terms. You

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.320
could have used any of them.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.540
We used 1 and 1.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.680
You could use 3 and 9.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.390
You could use anything.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.980
We solved b is equal to negative
3, and so if you put

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.990
b back here, you get four x
minus 3, which is what we got

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.789
earlier in the video,
right there.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.799
Hopefully you found that fun.
