00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:01.317
- [Voiceover] So I'm going to ask you

00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:03.187
what I think it is an
interesting question.

00:00:03.187 --> 00:00:06.286
Have you ever sat in a
room at room temperature,

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:08.353
lets say it's around
70 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:10.814
And watched a glass of liquid water

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:13.270
spontaneously have ice in the middle?

00:00:13.694 --> 00:00:16.138
And I'm guessing that
you have never seen that.

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:18.895
Of course you wouldn't see
ice spontaneously form,

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:22.285
specially if the room is
at 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:24.619
If it's above the freezing
temperature of water.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.824
But my question to you is, why not?

00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:28.659
Because that does not seem to defy

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.352
any of the laws of physics,
the Newtonian physics.

00:00:31.352 --> 00:00:33.704
Or even the first law of Thermodynamics.

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:36.194
Lets just think about how
that actually could occur.

00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:38.905
Lets imagine a bunch of water molecules,

00:00:38.957 --> 00:00:40.403
in their liquid state.

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:44.785
So, I have a bunch of water
molecules in their liquid state.

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:46.260
I'm gonna do a good number of them.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.757
And, they have some temperature.

00:00:47.757 --> 00:00:50.451
Remember, temperature's just
about average kinetic energy.

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:53.725
But, each of these, are gonna
have their own velocities,

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:55.292
their own momentums.

00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:57.719
So, they're all going
to be bouncing around

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.623
in different ways.

00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:01.527
And, they have their
hydrogen bonds between them.

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:05.753
That's why water is liquid
state at room temperature,

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:07.181
as opposed to gas.

00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:09.607
You got some hydrogen bonds between them.

00:01:09.607 --> 00:01:14.234
But I'm not gonna get too
fixated on that just yet.

00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:17.258
Now, you can imagine
they're all bouncing around

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:18.187
in random ways,

00:01:18.187 --> 00:01:20.950
but there is some probability that they

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.319
interact just in the right way

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.860
that maybe this molecule right over here

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.158
is able to hit this one in the right way.

00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:33.187
So it transfers most of its
momentum to the faster molecule.

00:01:33.187 --> 00:01:35.985
And so this one actually
looses some of its momentum.

00:01:35.985 --> 00:01:37.460
And it slows down.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.584
And just as that's happening
in the neighborhood of it,

00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:41.349
one of the other molecules is able

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.112
to transfer most of its
momentum to some other molecule.

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:45.710
So it too slows down.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.168
So it too slows down.

00:01:49.488 --> 00:01:51.508
So they all have much smaller momentum.

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:53.586
And then maybe this one,
at the exact same time

00:01:53.586 --> 00:01:54.921
is able to do it.

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:59.217
So it slows down, so it slows down here.

00:01:59.217 --> 00:02:01.585
And then the other ones that got

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:03.396
the momentum transferred to them,

00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:04.627
they're all moving faster now.

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:06.984
So lets say that one got their
momentum transferred to it.

00:02:06.984 --> 00:02:09.050
That one got momentum transferred to it.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.187
That one got momentum transferred to it.

00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:13.218
That one got momentum transferred to it.

00:02:13.218 --> 00:02:15.552
And, this one got momentum
transferred to it.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:18.385
And now, these molecules right over here,

00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:20.091
their momentum is small enough,

00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:21.717
their velocities are small enough,

00:02:21.717 --> 00:02:24.480
that the hydrogen bonds

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.920
really take over and they're able to start

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.752
forming some form of a lattice structure.

00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:30.917
They're getting cold
enough, you could say,

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.001
to actually freeze.

00:02:33.123 --> 00:02:36.635
So these are turning into ice.

00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:38.208
Why can't that happen?

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:40.251
What I've just described,
I'm just talking about

00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:42.585
things colliding and
transferring their momentum.

00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:45.708
I'm talking about energy not
being created or destroyed.

00:02:45.708 --> 00:02:49.086
So it seems to fit in with the
first law of Thermodynamics.

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:52.987
So it seems like, theoretically,
maybe it is possible

00:02:52.987 --> 00:02:56.087
for ice to spontaneously form.

00:02:56.087 --> 00:02:57.748
Or maybe another way to think about it,

00:02:57.748 --> 00:03:01.056
maybe it is possible to
start off with a system

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.554
that is fairly uniform.

00:03:02.554 --> 00:03:04.621
It has an average temperature here.

00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:06.618
But maybe a cold pocket could form

00:03:06.618 --> 00:03:08.452
by the rest of it turning hot.

00:03:08.452 --> 00:03:12.905
So, maybe initially, all
of the water is 70 degrees.

00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:14.884
So, everything I'm showing you

00:03:14.884 --> 00:03:17.909
is a neutral 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:03:18.053 --> 00:03:20.793
But maybe, there's some
probability that spontaneously,

00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:23.127
I have no creation or loss of energy,

00:03:23.127 --> 00:03:25.019
but some of the energy from the middle

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.067
gets put into the outside, so it warms up.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.540
So, let me do this in a different color.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.752
So maybe all of this water outside,

00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:35.050
maybe this is a top-down
view of the water.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.878
Maybe all of this water heats up.

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:39.822
Maybe all that water heats up.

00:03:39.822 --> 00:03:41.819
And all the water in
the middle, cools down.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.758
But they have the same total,

00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:46.091
they have the same total kinetic energy.

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:48.321
So I haven't created or lost energy,

00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:51.084
it's just happened to
be that, spontaneously,

00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:54.160
I was able to transfer energy
from the middle, outwards.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.053
And even as the middle
got a little bit colder,

00:03:56.053 --> 00:03:58.154
I was able to transfer
more and more energy

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:01.092
from the cold, the cold water,

00:04:01.092 --> 00:04:02.821
to the hot water.

00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:05.085
And it gets ordered in this way.

00:04:05.085 --> 00:04:08.220
This is actually, it feels possible,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.552
due to some of the physics
that we already know.

00:04:11.552 --> 00:04:14.640
But, some thoughtful folks,
like these gentlemen here,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.659
this is Carnot, considered
the father of Thermodynamics.

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.946
Kelvin, Rudolf Clausius.

00:04:19.946 --> 00:04:22.152
They repeatedly observed,
this doesn't seem to be

00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:23.673
happening in nature.

00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:25.391
Specially when you get
to the characters like

00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:26.552
Kelvin and Clausius.

00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:28.421
They're saying, "hey look,
it doesn't look like we're

00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:31.394
"observing transfer of heat

00:04:31.394 --> 00:04:33.750
"from cold to hot.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.061
"And, since we're not observing it,

00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:38.754
"lets just add our own Second
Law of Thermodynamics".

00:04:38.754 --> 00:04:40.786
The Second Law of
Thermodynamics is really based

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:42.853
on empirical observation.

00:04:42.853 --> 00:04:44.385
And the Second Law of Thermodynamics,

00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:45.813
according to Rudolf Clausius,

00:04:45.813 --> 00:04:47.253
and I'm gonna paraphrase this,

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:49.157
is that we don't see spontaneous,

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:50.515
let me write this down.

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:55.169
Second Law of

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.105
Thermodynamics.

00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:02.560
He said, we don't see
a spontaneous transfer

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.519
of heat from cold areas to hot areas.

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:09.155
So Second Law of Thermodynamics.

00:05:09.155 --> 00:05:13.380
So no transfer, no spontaneous.

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:15.761
We can use work,

00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:17.693
like things like refrigeration equipment

00:05:17.693 --> 00:05:21.717
to make heat flow

00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:24.190
from cold to hot and cool something down.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.971
But no spontaneous transfer,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.256
transfer of heat,

00:05:31.922 --> 00:05:36.922
from cold to hot.

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.455
And maybe I'll underline hot

00:05:40.455 --> 00:05:42.487
in orange right over here.

00:05:42.487 --> 00:05:44.020
And this was just really
based on observation,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.552
because we don't spontaneously
see this happening,

00:05:45.552 --> 00:05:49.221
we don't see the water
randomly organizing itself

00:05:49.221 --> 00:05:51.415
into a hot region and a cold region,

00:05:51.415 --> 00:05:52.948
and getting so cold that maybe

00:05:52.948 --> 00:05:54.654
some of it will spontaneously freeze.

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:56.117
What we do observe is that

00:05:56.117 --> 00:05:58.056
if I were to put ice water
in the middle of a room

00:05:58.056 --> 00:05:59.252
at room temperature,

00:05:59.252 --> 00:06:00.157
I'm gonna see the other way.

00:06:00.157 --> 00:06:03.861
I'm gonna see transfer of heat

00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.166
from, let me draw a cup here.

00:06:06.427 --> 00:06:08.656
I'm gonna see transfer of heat

00:06:08.656 --> 00:06:11.349
from the warmer regions
to the colder regions.

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.502
So, these are ice cubes right over here.

00:06:14.786 --> 00:06:16.034
And,

00:06:17.723 --> 00:06:19.401
this is the water.

00:06:19.685 --> 00:06:21.770
This is the water right over here.

00:06:21.822 --> 00:06:23.656
We're gonna see the
transferred heat the other way,

00:06:23.656 --> 00:06:27.093
from the cold regions, to the hot regions.

00:06:27.093 --> 00:06:28.846
Now, this was an empirical observation

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:31.388
and it seemed to hold
up to experimentation.

00:06:31.388 --> 00:06:33.972
But why do we actually see that?

00:06:34.128 --> 00:06:36.648
And it turns out, that there's some

00:06:36.648 --> 00:06:39.991
super, super, duper,
duper, small probability

00:06:39.991 --> 00:06:41.187
that this could actually happen.

00:06:41.187 --> 00:06:42.894
Remember in real systems
that we're talking about.

00:06:42.894 --> 00:06:45.053
And Thermodynamics is
really the study of systems

00:06:45.053 --> 00:06:47.724
more than individual molecules
that we're talking about.

00:06:47.724 --> 00:06:48.710
Any system we're talking about,

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.450
we're talking about way more molecules,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.051
way more actors than just
three molecules here.

00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:56.077
We could be talking about...

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:58.451
Well, if you look at
the number of molecules

00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:59.415
in a glass of water,

00:06:59.415 --> 00:07:01.261
you're looking at things with

00:07:01.261 --> 00:07:04.291
20, 24, 25 zeros,

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:07.008
depending on the size
of your glass of water.

00:07:07.008 --> 00:07:09.388
So you're looking at a huge,
huge number of molecules.

00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:10.955
And so statistically.

00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:12.476
And the didn't think
about things statistically

00:07:12.476 --> 00:07:14.252
until Boltzmann comes along.

00:07:14.252 --> 00:07:17.747
But statistically, the odds
of this happening are so low.

00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:19.187
Specially when you're thinking about,

00:07:19.187 --> 00:07:20.417
I'm not talking about
just three molecules,

00:07:20.417 --> 00:07:21.961
I'm talking about

00:07:21.961 --> 00:07:24.690
way, way more than three molecules

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.865
that you're just never
going to actually see it.

00:07:27.987 --> 00:07:29.461
And you can think about this,

00:07:29.461 --> 00:07:32.637
if we were to allow
ourselves to look at the

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.419
molecular level of things.

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.184
To not just look at the macro level.

00:07:36.184 --> 00:07:37.943
You could see why this is.

00:07:38.088 --> 00:07:39.777
So, if you,

00:07:40.317 --> 00:07:42.865
if you were to have some
type of a container.

00:07:43.347 --> 00:07:44.839
Let me draw a container here.

00:07:45.657 --> 00:07:47.533
If you were to have a container.

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:51.393
And you have, on the left-hand side,

00:07:51.393 --> 00:07:54.766
lets say you start with a bunch
of molecules that are hot.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.076
So they have a high kinetic energy.

00:07:57.558 --> 00:07:59.787
So these are, these have

00:07:59.787 --> 00:08:02.707
a high average kinetic energy here.

00:08:03.618 --> 00:08:05.006
These molecules.

00:08:06.242 --> 00:08:07.606
And,

00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:09.585
on the right side of the container,

00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:11.989
you have, maybe some molecules.

00:08:11.989 --> 00:08:13.556
And maybe they're the
same type of molecule,

00:08:13.556 --> 00:08:15.536
but they have low kinetic energy.

00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:17.695
So their temperature,

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:19.791
on average they have a
lower kinetic energy.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:20.986
They might have a few that

00:08:20.986 --> 00:08:22.055
have high kinetic energy.

00:08:22.055 --> 00:08:24.542
But on average, the have
a lower kinetic energy.

00:08:24.992 --> 00:08:28.823
So we see that the, we see,

00:08:28.823 --> 00:08:30.983
that the temperature here is lower.

00:08:30.983 --> 00:08:32.336
So let me write this down.

00:08:32.457 --> 00:08:33.723
Right now where we're starting off,

00:08:33.723 --> 00:08:36.840
this has a lower temperature.

00:08:37.055 --> 00:08:39.992
While the left-hand side
has a higher temperature.

00:08:39.992 --> 00:08:41.490
Now what's going to happen?

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.591
These molecules, they can
interact with each other.

00:08:43.591 --> 00:08:45.054
They're gonna bounce into each other.

00:08:45.054 --> 00:08:47.190
The things with high kinetic energy,

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.491
they're gonna bump into the things

00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:49.593
with low kinetic energy.

00:08:49.593 --> 00:08:50.952
And all of these things are also going

00:08:50.952 --> 00:08:52.461
to get mixed together.

00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:53.924
But even if somehow you weren't mixing it,

00:08:53.924 --> 00:08:55.654
these things would be bumping into these

00:08:55.654 --> 00:08:57.906
and transferring their momentum.

00:08:57.906 --> 00:09:00.925
So, as time goes on you're going to have,

00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:03.706
you're going to have a system
that looks more like this.

00:09:03.851 --> 00:09:05.894
Where all of them are going to have

00:09:05.894 --> 00:09:08.251
more of a medium,

00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:10.190
or on average, a medium kinetic energy.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.594
There's still gonna be differences

00:09:11.594 --> 00:09:13.150
in their kinetic energies,

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.890
but they're not gonna
be divided in this way

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.638
between left and right.

00:09:17.852 --> 00:09:21.771
So you're gonna see it all mixed in,

00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:25.015
and you're gonna see that,

00:09:25.015 --> 00:09:26.316
neither the left of the right

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:28.609
is going to have a higher temperature.

00:09:28.789 --> 00:09:31.157
And so what is the net effect?

00:09:31.157 --> 00:09:33.479
Well we had a transfer of energy

00:09:33.479 --> 00:09:36.643
from the hotter molecules
to the colder molecules.

00:09:36.788 --> 00:09:39.354
So, that energy that we're talking about,

00:09:39.354 --> 00:09:40.724
that is heat.

00:09:40.724 --> 00:09:42.734
We use Q to denote the heat.

00:09:42.734 --> 00:09:45.066
We have a transferred
energy from hot to cold.

00:09:45.066 --> 00:09:48.514
It's statistically
unlikely, very unlikely,

00:09:48.514 --> 00:09:50.012
bordering on impossible,

00:09:50.012 --> 00:09:52.821
but there's an infinitely
small chance it happens,

00:09:52.821 --> 00:09:54.319
it's just it wont be observed.

00:09:54.319 --> 00:09:55.294
Then you could go the other way,

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:56.153
but that's not what we see.

00:09:56.153 --> 00:09:58.972
What we're talking about many, many, many,

00:09:58.972 --> 00:09:59.985
not even millions.

00:09:59.985 --> 00:10:01.958
Millions of millions
of millions of millions

00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.386
of molecules.

00:10:03.386 --> 00:10:05.685
You're gonna see the ones
with the higher kinetic energy

00:10:05.685 --> 00:10:08.054
on average mix in and transfer it

00:10:08.054 --> 00:10:10.085
to the ones with lower kinetic energy.

00:10:10.085 --> 00:10:11.490
And so that's why they were able to say

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.313
"hey we don't see any
spontaneous transfer of heat

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:14.555
"from cold to hot".

00:10:14.555 --> 00:10:16.854
It is always going from,

00:10:16.854 --> 00:10:20.111
It is always going from hot to cold.
