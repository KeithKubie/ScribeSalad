00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:02.870
- [Voiceover] Johanna jogs
along a straight path.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.248
For zero is less than or equal
to t is less than or equal

00:00:05.248 --> 00:00:07.825
to 40, Johanna's velocity
is given by a differentiable

00:00:07.825 --> 00:00:09.347
function v.

00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:12.295
Selected values of v of t,
where t is measured in minutes

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:15.592
and v of t is measured in
meters per minute, are given

00:00:15.592 --> 00:00:16.707
in the table above.

00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:18.147
We see that right over there.

00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:21.328
Use the data in the table
to estimate the value of

00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:24.533
not v of 16 but v prime of 16.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.446
And we see here, they don't
even give us v of 16, so how

00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:29.873
do we think about v prime of 16.

00:00:29.873 --> 00:00:34.145
Well, just remind ourselves,
this is the rate of change

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:38.755
of v with respect to time
when time is equal to 16.

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.250
So, we can estimate it, and
that's the key word here,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.331
estimate.

00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:45.975
We can estimate v prime of 16
by thinking about what is our

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:49.429
change in velocity over our change in time

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:51.319
around 16.

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:53.665
And when we look at it over
here, they don't give us

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:55.704
v of 16, but they give us v of 12.

00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:57.842
They give us v of 20.

00:00:57.842 --> 00:01:01.035
So, let's figure out our
rate of change between 12,

00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:03.444
t equals 12, and t equals 20.

00:01:03.444 --> 00:01:07.567
So, our change in velocity,
that's going to be v of 20,

00:01:10.627 --> 00:01:12.992
minus v of 12.

00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:15.880
And then our change in time is going to be

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.290
20 minus 12.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.452
And so, this is going
to be equal to v of 20

00:01:21.452 --> 00:01:23.632
is 240.

00:01:23.632 --> 00:01:25.316
240 v of 12.

00:01:25.316 --> 00:01:27.355
We see right there is 200.

00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:32.385
And so, this is going to be 40 over eight,

00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:34.496
which is equal to five.

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:36.758
And we would be done.

00:01:36.758 --> 00:01:38.986
For good measure, it's good
to put the units there.

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:40.555
So, this is our rate.

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:44.189
This is how fast the velocity
is changing with respect

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.268
to time.

00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:48.833
So, the units are gonna be
meters per minute per minute.

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:50.906
So, we could write this as meters

00:01:52.326 --> 00:01:54.626
per minute squared,

00:01:54.626 --> 00:01:59.605
per minute, meters per minute squared.

00:01:59.605 --> 00:02:01.046
And we're done.

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:02.743
Now, if you want to get a
little bit more of a visual

00:02:02.743 --> 00:02:04.719
understanding of this, and
what I'm about to do, you would

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.036
not actually have to
do on the actual exam.

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:09.923
Well, let's just try to graph.

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:12.505
Let's graph these points here.

00:02:12.505 --> 00:02:16.216
Let me give myself some space to do it.

00:02:16.216 --> 00:02:20.464
So, if we were, if we tried
to graph it, so I'll just do

00:02:20.464 --> 00:02:23.348
a very rough graph here.

00:02:23.348 --> 00:02:26.669
So, let's say this is
y is equal to v of t.

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.909
And we see that v of
t goes as low as -220.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.160
It goes as high as 240.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.037
So, let me give, so I want
to draw the horizontal axis

00:02:35.037 --> 00:02:37.038
some place around here.

00:02:37.038 --> 00:02:39.149
T is positive.

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.324
It would look something like that.

00:02:41.324 --> 00:02:44.226
And so, let's just make, let's make this,

00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:48.196
let's make that 200 and,

00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:50.667
let's make that 300.

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:55.771
And so, then this would be 200 and 100.

00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:00.500
200 and 100 there.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.488
And then that would be -100.

00:03:02.488 --> 00:03:04.541
And then that would be -200.

00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:08.372
And then that would be -300.

00:03:08.372 --> 00:03:11.994
And we see on the t axis,
our highest value is 40.

00:03:11.994 --> 00:03:13.874
We go between zero and 40.

00:03:13.874 --> 00:03:16.719
And so, these obviously
aren't at the same scale.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:18.113
But this is going to be zero.

00:03:18.113 --> 00:03:22.044
If we put 40 here, and then
if we put 20 in-between.

00:03:23.264 --> 00:03:25.299
And so, this would be 10.

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.458
Let me do a little bit to the right.

00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:28.933
That would be 10.

00:03:28.933 --> 00:03:32.058
And then, that would be 30.

00:03:32.058 --> 00:03:34.141
And so, what points do they give us?

00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:38.140
So, they give us, I'll do these in orange.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.218
Zero, comma, zero.

00:03:40.218 --> 00:03:43.678
So, that is right over there.

00:03:43.678 --> 00:03:47.545
They give us when time is
12, our velocity is 200.

00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:50.858
So, when the time is 12,
which is right over there,

00:03:50.858 --> 00:03:53.860
our velocity is going to be 200.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.555
So, that's that point.

00:03:55.555 --> 00:04:00.071
When our time is 20, our
velocity is going to be 240.

00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:03.434
So, when our time is
20, our velocity is 240,

00:04:03.434 --> 00:04:05.852
which is gonna be right over there.

00:04:05.852 --> 00:04:10.443
And then, when our time is
24, our velocity is -220.

00:04:10.443 --> 00:04:12.555
So, she switched directions.

00:04:12.555 --> 00:04:14.198
So, when it's 24.

00:04:14.198 --> 00:04:18.114
So, 24 is gonna be roughly over here.

00:04:18.114 --> 00:04:20.757
It's gonna be -220.

00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:25.648
So, -220 might be right over there.

00:04:25.648 --> 00:04:29.944
And then, finally, when time
is 40, her velocity is 150,

00:04:29.944 --> 00:04:31.465
positive 150.

00:04:31.465 --> 00:04:32.945
So, at 40,

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:36.745
it's positive 150.

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:39.489
And so, these are just
sample points from her

00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:40.800
velocity function.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.348
But what we wanted to do is
we wanted to find in this

00:04:43.348 --> 00:04:48.038
problem, we want to say,
okay, when t is equal to 16,

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:52.979
when t is equal to 16,
what is the rate of change?

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.947
And we don't know much about,
we don't know what v of 16 is.

00:04:56.947 --> 00:04:59.038
But what we could do is, and
this is essentially what we did

00:04:59.038 --> 00:04:59.828
in this problem.

00:04:59.828 --> 00:05:02.382
We could say, alright, well,
we can approximate with

00:05:02.382 --> 00:05:05.518
the function might do by
roughly drawing a line here.

00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:09.220
So, if you draw a line
there, and you say, alright,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.748
well, v of 16, or v prime
of 16, I should say.

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:18.098
So, v prime of 16 is going
to be approximately the slope

00:05:18.098 --> 00:05:23.062
is going to be approximately
the slope of this line.

00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:25.232
That's going to be our best
job based on the data that

00:05:25.232 --> 00:05:28.729
they have given us of estimating
the value of v prime of 16.

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.959
So, we literally just did
change in v, which is that one,

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:36.831
delta v over change in t over

00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:40.081
delta t to get the slope

00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:42.959
of this line, which was
our best approximation

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:47.019
for the derivative when t is equal to 16.
