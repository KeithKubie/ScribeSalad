[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:08.700
ANANT SHUKLA: A James Beard
Award-winning pastry chef,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.710
Dominique Ansel, has
shaken up the pastry

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.780
world with innovation
and creativity

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.550
at the heart of his work.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.780
Named the World's Best Pastry
Chef in 2017 by the World's 50

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.050
Best Restaurants Awards, one
of "Business Insider's" most

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.290
innovative people under 40,
and Crain's 40 under 40,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.270
Chef Dominique has
strived through his career

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.480
to bring a refreshing approach
to the world of desserts.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.170
In 2015, he was bestowed the
prestigious 'Ordre du Merite

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.720
Agricole Award for
his accomplishments.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.990
"Vanity Fair" named him one of
the 50 most influential French,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.140
and "Daily Mail UK" claimed
he was the most feted pastry

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.610
chef in the world.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.390
Prior to opening his
own shop, Dominique

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.020
served as the executive pastry
chef for the restaurant Daniel

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.550
here in New York City.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.250
During his six years
there, he was instrumental

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.940
and was not only the longest
tenured pastry chef there,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.130
he was a contributing
member to the team

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.320
that helped it earn its
coveted third Michelin

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.260
star and a four star review
in the New York Times.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.810
As you saw, the
maker and creator

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.030
of such great and
wonderful desserts, he

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.460
known not only across
the world for his Cronut

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.200
but for all these other amazing
and delicious creations.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.220
So please join me in welcoming
Chef Dominique back to Google

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.388
here.

00:01:18.388 --> 00:01:20.858
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.697 --> 00:01:23.822
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Thank you.

00:01:23.822 --> 00:01:24.810
ANANT SHUKLA: Welcome.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.130
So Chef, welcome to Google.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.640
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Thank you.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.780
ANANT SHUKLA: Is this
your first time here?

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.180
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: My first
time in this building.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.275
ANANT SHUKLA: In this building,
what do you think so far?

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:35.220
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: It looks nice.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.595
ANANT SHUKLA: It looks nice.

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:39.490
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: You guys
have nice offices here.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.590
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.070
But we're really excited
to have you here.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.570
I kind of--

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.020
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: I was told
that I should see the cafeteria.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.530
ANANT SHUKLA: Yes.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.180
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: That
you guys are very lucky.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.763
So I will check it
out before I leave.

00:01:49.763 --> 00:01:51.530
ANANT SHUKLA: Yes.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.550
So pretty, in a relatively
short amount of time,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.880
you've become a world
renowned chef and pastry

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.850
chef recently recognized on
April 2017 as the World's Best

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.709
Pastry Chef.

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.250
Kind of let's start
with your journey

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.010
and how you decided this
was your profession that you

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.270
want to pursue.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.800
What was that
inspiration and spark

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.449
that decided pastries
and desserts are

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.910
the way I'm going to head?

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.320
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Well,
I didn't really decide.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.140
I think life put me
through that track.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.240
I grew up in a small
town North of Paris.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.150
My dad was working in factories.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.300
So we didn't have
much money growing up.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.990
And to me finding a job was
a priority when I was young.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.450
So I started
actually very early.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.480
I was barely 16, I started
working in kitchen.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.580
And I had no clue
what I was doing.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.820
I had no idea what
was coming for me.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.880
I actually hated it
in the first year.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.480
I didn't like it at all.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.910
I met some good people
in this industry that

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.950
taught me how to love my job.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.180
I started working my way up.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.850
Eventually I got
to Paris, where I

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.960
landed a job at Fauchon
which is one of the most well

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.070
known pastry shop.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.500
And I worked my way up
there until I got here.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.580
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.930
So in the world, especially
where formal culinary training

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.230
is often a prerequisite, and
as you said you kind of just

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.630
decided and fell into
this, what was most

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.670
difficult about that journey?

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.492
Where you're expected to
kind of make the same cookie

00:03:23.492 --> 00:03:25.200
as everybody else in
the production line,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.290
or make the pastry the exact
same way, and obviously

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.530
innovation and creativity
fuels everything you've done.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.360
What was most
challenging about that?

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.370
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: I
think, well, there's

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.460
a lot of things that
are very challenging.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.320
The food industry
is a tough one.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.860
You stand on your feet for
16 sometimes 18 hours a day.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.815
You work weekends.

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:47.940
You don't see your friends.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.023
You don't see your family.

00:03:49.023 --> 00:03:51.480
You feel like living
almost like an offset life

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.370
compared to the normal people.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.350
And it's a tough one because
there's a lot of competition.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.280
It's very challenging.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.240
And I think that
the most challenging

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.430
was, for me early on,
to find my passion

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.770
and to have all the stamina and
the dedication to put into it

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.240
is this life.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.329
Because I'll never describe it
as a job, more as a lifestyle.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.100
You have to love it.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.360
And you have to live with it.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.151
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.440
And then making that jump
then from France to the US

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.490
was a large one, right?

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.448
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Yes, it
was pretty big for me.

00:04:28.448 --> 00:04:29.820
I had a pretty comfy job.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.870
I was working one of the most
influential and renowned pastry

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.670
shop in Paris at the time.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.730
I was the corporate pastry
chef developing shops

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.780
around the world.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.770
And it was a comfortable
situation for me.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.660
And I got a call from
Daniel Boulud asking me

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.090
if I wanted to join the team.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.820
And at the time, you
know, my English was OK.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.290
It was like not--
actually, it was not OK.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.990
It was not good.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.220
I shouldn't lie.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.700
But you know, I came
here with two suitcases.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.250
It was 10 years ago
now, working for Daniel.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.700
And the same, I
started everything

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.700
all over again-- a new
country, new kitchen,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.040
a new way of working.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.880
And I've learned and I've
grown with everything

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.870
that was coming my way.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.460
So it was very challenging,
not easy to adapt

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.680
from a different culture,
different country,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.750
different kitchen,
different way of working.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.409
But it was it an
amazing experience.

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:28.200
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.790
As they say, the
New York City dream

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.330
of moving here and
building everything up.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.860
I mentioned earlier,
that you were

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.650
part of that team that helped
it get the three Michelin star

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.550
rating.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.070
What was the biggest learning
from that experience?

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.210
You mentioned you have to
work closely with Daniel.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.970
It's a traditional kind of
French cuisine restaurant.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.220
But you're trying to innovate.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.780
You're trying to be creative.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.915
How did you go about?

00:05:52.915 --> 00:05:54.540
DOMINIQUE ANSEL:
Well, in the beginning

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.820
it was a little tricky
because I didn't

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.995
have that much
restaurant experience.

00:05:58.995 --> 00:06:01.830
I only had like two years
in the past as a chef,

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.180
as a savory chef as well.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.190
So working in a restaurant
was a little bit new for me.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.520
I was working more
for like a bakery

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.050
and retail back in France.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.840
So working in a
restaurant was new for me.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.320
And working with
Daniel was new as well,

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.530
at this level of expectation.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.210
And I had to find my style
and adapt in the kitchen,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.190
working with the people
that were there as well

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.070
without the volume as well.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.980
It's not like in France
where you have like,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.930
you seat like 50, 60 people
and that's it for the day.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.840
It's more like larger scale.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.980
It's bigger spaces.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.880
And high expectations as well.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.500
So I found my style,
and practiced a lot

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.530
on the kind of pastry
I wanted to do.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.514
Early on, I wanted to
do something different.

00:06:46.514 --> 00:06:47.930
I didn't want to
just do classics.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.340
I wanted something more
innovative and creative

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.630
when it comes to flavorous
presentations, and thinking

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.370
of pastry at a different level.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.270
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.380
And you mentioned Daniel was
not only kind of a mentor

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.130
but also a friend.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.530
He wrote the foreword
to your cookbook.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.520
How has that relationship
evolved, and like

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.090
you said, very
high expectations.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.510
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Yeah, it's a
very, very close relationship.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.670
And it's almost like
if my American father,

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.850
even though he's French.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.560
He's my American father.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.680
He's grown him.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.890
He's talked me.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.360
He has supported me.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.600
I always tell the
story and I always

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.640
remember that when
I told him that I

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.287
was going to leave Daniel
to open my own shop,

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:36.620
it was like telling your
girlfriend you were breaking up

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.650
with her.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.650
He was not happy at all.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.312
It like took him some
time to like to digest.

00:07:42.312 --> 00:07:44.270
I remember I was sitting--
we were on the phone

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.270
for like a good like
an hour and a half.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.980
And I had to like calm
him down, tell him

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.640
that I will keep the team
together, that everything will

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.480
be good, that I was not going
to work with anyone else,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.550
that I was opening my own shop.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.790
And he finally realized
and he's been like nothing

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.020
but supportive since then.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.124
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:08:04.124 --> 00:08:05.540
So then when you're
in the kitchen

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.650
and you're, like I said, not
really a classically trained

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.050
mind set you're using,
but instead available

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.410
ingredients, combinations that
people aren't willing to try.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.390
How do you get that
inspiration then

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.030
from what you're going to
try for the dessert or--

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.080
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Well,
to me, it's always been--

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.510
I have always been curious my
entire life, since I was a kid.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.160
Always been curious
about traveling,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.880
about learning about different
cultures, about meeting people,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.789
always been curious
about seeing what's

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:38.590
out there, and not just
what you see with just

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.799
staying in the kitchen.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:44.390
So opening my mind was very
important for me, and not just

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.810
with food either.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.780
I think that getting
inspiration from a lot

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.250
of different industries
and different parts of what

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.100
this world has to offer
has been important.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.550
You know, I think
any creative person

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.360
is very curious of anything
and everything, pretty much.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.750
I often check on
Instagram, for instance.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.410
A few years ago, I was
looking at nail art.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.086
I don't paint my nails, but
their art is very interesting

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:13.460
because they use
different tools,

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.140
they use different techniques.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.500
And that got me inspired for
like new techniques for cake

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.470
glazing, for instance.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.040
I've been looking
lately at pottery art.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.780
So you know when
people do something

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.640
very cool like [INAUDIBLE],,
different techniques of using

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.350
clay.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.720
And we actually have a
pottery wheel in the kitchen.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.910
We do some piping and some
cool chocolate decor with it.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.890
So I always look
what's out there.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:46.280
And have also like
connection between the food

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.710
and the people.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:49.880
So this is one of the most
important things for me.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.580
You cannot just serve
food because it's good.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.270
It has to have a
meaning, to have a story,

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.610
and to have a
connection with people.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:04.430
The biggest example I can
give, it's the frozen s'mores.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.440
So 10 years ago,
believe me or not,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.960
I had no idea what a s'mores
was, before coming here.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.160
And I've learned about it.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.020
I've tasted it.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.640
I've talked about it a lot.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.820
And a few years ago, just
after we launched the Cronot,

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.440
we created the frozen s'mores.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.100
So it's an ice cream version
of a s'more, and something that

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.320
was completely--

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.140
I was unaware that even
existed 10 years ago.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.470
So it's essentially
a vanilla ice cream

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.630
that is coated with
a chocolate wafer

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.250
and pushed inside a
honey marshmallow.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.380
So it looks like a cube.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.754
We set it on a branch.

00:10:37.754 --> 00:10:39.170
And the branch,
the wooden branch,

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.200
has been smoked with applewood,
and we torch the marshmallow

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.165
to order.

00:10:43.165 --> 00:10:45.290
So you have this thin shell,
like caramelized shell

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.706
on the outside of
the marshmallow.

00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:49.220
So when you bite
into, it's crunchy.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:49.810
It's warm.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:50.810
It's cold in the center.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:51.830
It's chewy.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.870
And you have all
this fun texture.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.030
So it's like almost like
rediscovering the s'mores.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:02.840
And that this is not even the
most beautiful part for me.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.020
We opened a shop in
Tokyo a little bit

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.170
more than two years ago.

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.020
We brought the frozen
s'mores to Tokyo.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.230
And of course, Japanese people
don't know what a s'more is

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.400
either.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.810
And believe me or not, it
is one of our best sellers.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.750
We sell close to 800 daily.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.700
And it's something
that is amazing to me

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.050
that me a French person,
I can come here to America

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.920
and bring such a
classic American classic

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.840
to different country and
introduce it so people actually

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.350
love it.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.390
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah, I
think a similar story you

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.030
kind of talk about in the book
is around a chocolate chip

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.720
cookie as well.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.220
Right?

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.020
And I know we'll talk about
the cookie shot later,

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.750
but I found it a very compelling
story about how you just

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.150
couldn't find a good cookie.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.400
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: That's right.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.210
I mean, French people
are amazing bakers.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.440
Probably maybe the best in
the world, I have to say.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.950
But they really
can't bake a cookie.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.447
It's like unknown
in French culture.

00:12:00.447 --> 00:12:02.030
They don't know what
a good cookie is.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.330
They don't know how to bake it.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.621
They don't know how to make it.

00:12:04.621 --> 00:12:06.260
And they just don't eat it.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.430
So my first great
cookie was here.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:15.050
And we have three cookies now
the menu, only three cookies.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.660
But I pride myself
saying that we

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.380
have like probably some
of the best cookies.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.140
I love them.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.520
They're very simple.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.660
They're still like soft
and tender in the center,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:31.115
like a thin brown outside shell.

00:12:31.115 --> 00:12:33.600
And we bake them maybe
for like 10, 15 minutes.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.350
And people will come
just for our cookies.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.690
So it's a simple product.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.380
We always talk about
creativity and how

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.180
like it's important, because
I love being creative.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.510
I love looking at classic
and reinterpretting

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.570
into a more modern way
of, fun way, of eating it.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.040
But I also think that sometime
a good like simple chocolate

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.730
chip cookie is always a winner.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:57.940
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.590
And kind of along
those same lines,

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.280
when you're trying to perfect
that cookie or perfect a Cronut

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.980
or perfect a madeleine,
how many times

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.880
do you try something and iterate
and change the ingredients

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.634
or change the approach before
you decide you know this is it.

00:13:12.634 --> 00:13:14.050
DOMINIQUE ANSEL:
There's no rules.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.050
There's no rules at all.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.100
It's just understanding
where you're

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.340
trying to get, knowing
the science of it,

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:27.010
and try everything you can
to sometimes break the rules

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.970
and break what you know
to make something new.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.980
It's trying.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.930
It's just like hard work.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:40.150
And it's just a good
stamina to never give up.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:45.030
Sometimes it takes us a few
days to develop new recipes.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.980
And sometimes it takes us a
few months, like the Cronut.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.080
The Cronut took me
over three months just

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.280
to perfect the recipe.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.230
I was not happy with the texture
in the beginning, we changed

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.300
the type of flour we used,
the technique, the temperature

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.390
of the oil, the
kind of oil we use,

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.910
feeling that the glaze
everything has been really

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.670
a break down by each part
to make a great dessert

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.960
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.510
And along the same line, you
mentioned science as something,

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:15.130
as part of the approach.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.230
I know you often talk
about time as an ingredient

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.150
that people neglect.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.380
Or nowadays there
are so many recipes

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.930
that are shortcuts
or semi-homemade,

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.210
but time, especially
with the madeleine

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:29.020
or made to order like how did
you decide that you knew this

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.444
was an approach that works?

00:14:30.444 --> 00:14:32.110
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Well,
it's very simple.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.900
It's a childhood memory.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.690
Growing up, I will go to
the bakery with my mom

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.650
or my grandma like three
to four times a day.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:45.490
Three to four times a day, and
not because we're that hungry.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.530
But because you
know like in France

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:52.210
you only get fresh bread, fresh
from the oven, like piping hot.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:54.910
And you don't let it die.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.570
And this notion
of time with food

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.900
is something that everyone
is aware now, I think,

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.950
more and more.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.700
And we, for instance,
at the bakery

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.650
bake miniature madeleines.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.890
They're like small
pillowy cakes,

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.180
like flavored with lemon.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.040
They're delicious.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.180
We bake them only to order.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.680
It takes like three
to four minutes.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.010
So I always tell people it's
faster than getting a latte.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.000
So they're fresh from the oven.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.030
And this kind of emotions I
want to give to our customers.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.800
But if you think about
it, it's the same

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.230
for pretty much everything.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.950
You know, like people
eat sushi, they

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.399
don't want sushi that was
made like 10 hours ago.

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:34.690
You have a sushi chef that
makes a fresh sushi for you,

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.960
putting a new plate
in front of you.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.550
You're not going to
let it sit there.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.860
You want to eat it right away.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.200
That's this moment in time
where the food is perfect.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.960
And for this madeleine,
you know like when

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.580
you bite into it,
this mini madeleine,

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.210
it's like you have this little
puff of steam that comes out.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.270
And we always say that's the
last breath of the madeleine

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.250
before it dies.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.640
So we're very, very
passionate about our food.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.650
And I think time is crucial.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.009
So if you guys come to the
bakery, please be patient.

00:16:06.009 --> 00:16:07.050
And order the madeleines.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.040
They are one of my
favorite, definitely.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.170
ANANT SHUKLA: And I think the
same holds true for macaroon,

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:11.670
right?

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.520
That need to wait
before you really--

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.811
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Yes, actually.

00:16:14.811 --> 00:16:16.510
Just the little
opposite with macaroons.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.030
Like Because the
macaroons, which

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.030
is a French little cookie,
like two little shells made

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.400
with almond with usually
a filling in the center,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.260
it's in every bakery in France.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.240
And this [INAUDIBLE] time, so
time is an ingredient, yes.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.680
Sometimes time has
to be like, it's

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.750
crucial to eat
something right away.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.810
But it's also sometimes--
food needs some time to rest.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.500
So with a macaroon, since it's
a little shell of cookie that

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.490
is like semi-dry, and when
we put the filling inside,

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.670
actually you have to let it sit
for a day or two for the shell

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.280
to absorb the humidity
from the filling.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.490
And then you have like a
thin, super thin, crust.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.440
And when you bite
into it, it's tender.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.106
So that's the opposite
of the madeleine.

00:16:58.106 --> 00:16:58.990
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.530
Great.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:00.030
Great.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.532
And so here we have a
picture of the bakery.

00:17:02.532 --> 00:17:03.490
We talked a little bit.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.339
You started in 2011.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:06.880
And you talked about
the conversation

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.480
you had with Chef Daniel.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.930
But again, what was that
spark that again you're

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.119
taking the second
risk now in New York,

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.760
not only of moving
here from France

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.089
and now moving from Daniel
to starting your own thing

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:21.579
and becoming a full
blown entrepreneur.

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.910
What was that feeling and
process going through your mind

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.334
and did you ever have a moment
that you were like, shoot,

00:17:27.334 --> 00:17:28.250
I did the wrong thing?

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.360
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Oh, it
happened very, very fast.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.955
I give my notice to Daniel.

00:17:31.955 --> 00:17:34.290
And believe me or
not, seven weeks later

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.510
I was opening the bakery.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.080
So it happened just like this.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:42.850
And it's a moment where I didn't
realize how fast I was going

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:45.150
and what was going to happen.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.270
Just keep in mind that this
little bakery on Spring Street,

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.140
when I first opened it,
only had four employees.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.170
And it was a little bit
more than five years ago.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.440
Only four employees-- two people
in the kitchen, two people

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.250
doing coffee and service.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.820
I will take out
the trash myself I

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.550
will like clean
everything myself.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.190
So now we, of
course, we've grown.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.510
But it started as a very,
very like small neighborhood

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.260
business, very humble.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.040
I've done the painting there
myself, cleaned the toilet

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.880
many times.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.710
I have like electrocuted myself.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:23.370
I've fixed and cleaned every
square inch of this bakery.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.420
So at the time, it was just--

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.420
ANANT SHUKLA: A scrappy,
scrappy startup, right?

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.050
Just like here at Google.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.940
DOMINIQUE ANSEL:
Yeah, like let's go.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.050
Exactly, almost like Google.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.900
It was just like,
let's open a shop

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.840
and see if we can
please people with it.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.640
And let's just give me a chance
to like to do the kind of food

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:41.730
I like.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.890
In the beginning
it was also tough

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.410
because before opening
and right at the opening,

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:51.090
everyone would give me advice,
even I was not asking for it.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.910
Advice on what I should
do, what I shouldn't do.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.610
That was New York City,
a lot of pastry chefs

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.300
have failed, a lot of
bakeries have closed,

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.610
and that I should do
cupcakes and cheese sticks.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:03.530
That's all we'll sell.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.270
And should do like tons
of [INAUDIBLE] cheese.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.225
By a fridge and pre-wrap
everything at night

00:19:09.225 --> 00:19:11.330
and leave it there
on the counter.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.480
And it was just--

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.740
I was exhausted, actually.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.340
Exhausted by listening
to like bad advice.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.450
And especially when you
don't ask for it, right?

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.230
So I kind of like
isolated myself

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.670
and decided not to listen,
not to listen to anyone.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:32.730
And just like do things
with my heart and the things

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.980
that I believed in,
which is quality

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.770
food like always the best
ingredients, creative food

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:39.630
and seasonality.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.420
I was creating new dishes,
used the best ingredients that

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.770
are in season, and
customer service,

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:49.320
giving the best to our
customers all the time.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.305
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:19:50.305 --> 00:19:51.780
And that's true, like
what is it you said?

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.696
When you stay true to
your guiding principles,

00:19:53.696 --> 00:19:56.850
the bakery instantly became
the highest rated bakery

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.880
in the city with all of the
mouthwatering kind of desserts

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.450
we saw in the video.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.170
But it's kind of been the
Cronut that obviously took

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.840
the world by storm in 2013.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.350
Tell me kind of in your eyes
how that story unfolded.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.800
And why do you think
it took off as it did?

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.289
DOMINIQUE ANSEL:
Well, that's a--

00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:16.830
ANANT SHUKLA: And
where was the idea?

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.110
We talked a little bit that
you'd spent three months trying

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.026
to perfect the recipe.

00:20:20.026 --> 00:20:24.000
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Yeah, so
my girl friend, my business

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.480
partner, asked me to do
a donut for Mother's Day.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.181
And I was like, ah, you
know, I don't really

00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:31.180
have a recipe for donut.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.555
I don't know how
to make a donut.

00:20:32.555 --> 00:20:34.440
And she pushes me every day.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.110
And lift me up every day,
of course, to get better.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:42.070
And I actually made
a donut that was not

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.510
with a regular donut dough.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:47.610
But I made it with something
similar to a croissant,

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.080
the same techniques.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.680
And we put it on the
menu ahead of time.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.940
And it was still like a
few of us in the bakery.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.470
We put it on the menu, only
made a few for Mother's Day.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.600
And we had a friend, a
blogger had a camera,

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.540
snap a photo on the corner of
the table, put it on this blog.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.790
And he called me the next day.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.220
He was like, hey,
Dominique, I just

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:11.280
want to let you know
my article went viral.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.600
I was like, great,
I'm happy for you.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.850
I'm going back to my kitchen.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.190
I had like two hours of sleep.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.330
And I just want to go
back to my kitchen.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:20.080
I'm happy for you.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.955
He's like no, no, no.

00:21:20.955 --> 00:21:21.870
You don't understand.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.635
I'm going to send
you this chart.

00:21:23.635 --> 00:21:26.710
He had to like get a chart off
like the traffic on the web

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.500
site and the spike of 300%
within just a few hours.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.270
I was like OK.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.486
Let's go.

00:21:33.486 --> 00:21:35.070
Don't know what
to tell you but--

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.430
he's like no, no.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.263
You should be ready.

00:21:36.263 --> 00:21:37.830
You should make more, do more.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.274
I think we made like
35 the first day.

00:21:40.274 --> 00:21:41.940
So I was like OK,
I'll make 45 tomorrow.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:48.840
And of course, by the time
by the time we knew it,

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.840
which is like two days
later, we had over 150 people

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.760
waiting outside.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.900
But still like
four employees, two

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.760
in the kitchen and
two barristers.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.890
And I don't remember
what happened.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:04.910
I just remember that
it was very stressful.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.899
My nights were very, very short.

00:22:06.899 --> 00:22:07.690
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.150
And we saw some of the
craziest stories, the dumpster

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.994
divers, all the celebrities
that came and waited in line.

00:22:12.994 --> 00:22:14.410
DOMINIQUE ANSEL:
Yes, celebrities.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:15.680
They wanted to cut in line.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.970
And I made a very,
very strict rule

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.200
which I still keep to this day,
that no one cuts this line.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.140
Like no one.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:27.050
None of my friends,
and I have less now.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.310
None of have my family.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.920
My family visited New York
and they wanted a Cronut,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.010
so I told them to
go wait in line.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:36.619
And they didn't want to wait,
so they didn't try the Cronut.

00:22:36.619 --> 00:22:37.660
Fair for everyone, right?

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.475
I had celebrities.

00:22:38.475 --> 00:22:42.730
I had like the French
first lady coming.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.880
She didn't get a Cronut either.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.350
So it's not to be--

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.421
it is important for me to
be respectful and mindful

00:22:50.421 --> 00:22:52.420
of our customers that
come early in the morning.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.340
People were coming
in like 2, 3 o'clock

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.610
in the morning when we're
opening at 8:00 at the time.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:58.430
It's crazy.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.100
They were waiting
for 5 or 6 hours

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.810
just outside to get a Cronut.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.820
And I didn't want to be
disrespectful to them.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.030
So I met a strict rule where I
won't let anyone cut the line.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.940
I will kindly ask everyone
to come wait in line.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.610
The line is better now, guys.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.740
You don't to come out at
2 o'clock in the morning.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:19.870
We still have a line of like
80 to 120 people every morning.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.910
Usually starts, then we
get in around 7 o'clock,

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.160
and we open at 8:00.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:27.510
So it's not as bad
as it used to be.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.550
But still, we should have
long lines for the Cronut.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.080
We limit the quantity
of what we can

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.590
do because our kitchen on Spring
Street is very, very small.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.320
It's smaller than this stage.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.490
I'm not exaggerating.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:40.480
And there's one table.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.016
This is where it all started--

00:23:43.016 --> 00:23:44.390
one table, like
three compartment

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.730
sink to wash dishes next to it.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.910
And we don't have much.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.380
So I want to make
sure we preserve

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:54.100
the quality and freshness
of the product we serve.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.890
So we can limit ourselves to
a couple hundred every day

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:01.870
to make sure that we can satisfy
people and not overdo it.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:07.910
And when I decided that I didn't
want our creations to kill

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:12.430
our creativity, and that I will
continue on creating new items

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.240
and come up with new ideas,
which is very challenging.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.170
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.586
And like you said,
you didn't want

00:24:18.586 --> 00:24:20.310
to just become known
as the Cronut shop.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.050
And how does the Cronut then
fit in with the other kind

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.141
of creations on the menu?

00:24:25.141 --> 00:24:27.640
Especially if you know people
are queuing up in the morning.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.150
DOMINIQUE ANSEL:
Yeah, at the time,

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.260
you know, like everyone
wanted a Cronut.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.460
And I had more people
coming, give me advice,

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.760
telling me that I didn't
understand the business,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.960
and what to do, and I should
get a factory in Long Island

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.750
or like New Jersey
and mass produce it.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:46.180
I was told that I should be
in like every supermarket

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.320
to cash out.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.490
And people have tried to
come, and this is not me.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.330
It's just not me.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:56.320
My dad like spent his whole
life working in the factory.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.340
I will not do that.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.330
This is not who I am.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:04.330
It's not what I want to do with
our precious little bakery.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:08.230
And I decided that I will
keep on creating just

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.170
to fight the popularity
of the Cronut,

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:15.010
and to show people
that there's more.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.320
There's more that can be done.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.750
So I love the Cronut.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.300
I think it bought us
like a lot of awareness

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.650
and showed people that
a pastry can be creative

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.420
and a pastry chef
can be creative.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.160
But that's not it.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.980
We've created hundreds and
hundreds of new pastries

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.090
since then.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:36.370
And still to this
day, we'll keep

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:40.300
on creating from our
shop in Tokyo, London,

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.460
and soon in Los Angeles.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:46.310
Every single location, I'll
keep on pushing for creativity.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.140
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.466
And you get that recognition.

00:25:48.466 --> 00:25:49.840
When the first
lady came, I think

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.632
the president called you to
chat with you on the cell phone.

00:25:52.632 --> 00:25:54.590
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Actually,
she was texting him,

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:57.100
and he called her.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.200
And actually handed
the phone to me.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.475
And she was like,
this is for you.

00:26:01.475 --> 00:26:03.350
And I was like, excuse
me, should I get this?

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.891
It's for you.

00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:05.500
It's Mr. President.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.240
And I was like, oh, OK.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.610
And I pick up the phone.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:11.940
It was a little scary because he
knew everything about my life.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:15.850
He knew that my siblings, where
I grew up, what I was doing,

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.153
maybe my tax I was paying.

00:26:18.153 --> 00:26:19.440
I don't know.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.450
But I don't know.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.950
Maybe he had run a
background check.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.850
But he was very
pleased to talk to me

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.780
and told me that he was very
proud of what I was doing here.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.810
He also told me that
the Cronut was French.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.150
And when I corrected
him, I was, it's

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.880
half French, half American.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.480
He was like no, no, it's French.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.480
OK.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.480
OK.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.611
If it was Obama, I would
say something else.

00:26:44.611 --> 00:26:46.090
ANANT SHUKLA:
Yeah, you mentioned

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.250
your other kind of creations.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:49.380
This is the DKA, right?

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.970
This is actually, I believe,
the most popular, right?

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.250
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: So the
DKA is our best seller

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.260
across like every
cities, every countries.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.870
And it's actually my favorite.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:01.154
I tell people I eat
one every morning.

00:27:01.154 --> 00:27:02.070
They don't believe me.

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.940
I really do.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:03.720
I love it.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.650
It's essentially almost like
a flaky caramelized croissant,

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.850
with like a nice crunchy
shell on the outside.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.076
You guys have all had it?

00:27:13.076 --> 00:27:17.750
And like this gooey, soft,
and tender center, I love it.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.240
I'll eat it night and day.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.960
It's actually
something I introduced

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.405
when I was at Daniel.

00:27:22.405 --> 00:27:25.580
We always weekly meeting.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.560
I will always challenge
my team to come up

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.960
with something new
or something classic

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.850
that I wanted them
to see the technique.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.580
And it's something I had done
back in front a little bit.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.970
So I wanted to make a newer,
lighter version of it.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.040
I brought it to the
manager meeting at Daniel.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.350
And they all went crazy for it.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.910
They are asking
for it every week.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:45.826
I was like no, no, no.

00:27:45.826 --> 00:27:46.780
This is off the menu.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:47.876
It's just for the meeting.

00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:49.250
I'm not putting
this on the menu.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.820
And they're all asking for this.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.800
So I decided to put it on
the menu on Spring Street,

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.130
and the bakery.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:57.000
And people love it.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.880
We actually call it the DKA
so it's simpler to pronounce.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.210
It stands for
Dominique's Kouign Amann.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:08.140
And kouign amann means
buttery cake in Celtic.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:08.990
It's from Brittany.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.650
ANANT SHUKLA: The next one also
has a very interesting story.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.480
And this, the cookie
shot wasn't meant--

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.470
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: It was
meant to be so popular.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:22.200
The cookie shot actually
started at South By Southwest.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.250
Yeah I was called
with a PR company

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:28.650
to collaborate, to
do something new.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.800
So it's a show that promotes
innovation and creativity,

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.010
technology.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.430
I was asked to come and then
to do something with them.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.520
So they told me a story
of their PR company

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.600
and how this started.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.520
It started late
at night at a bar,

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.860
where they were like writing
ideas on napkin and drinking

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:46.597
shot.

00:28:46.597 --> 00:28:47.930
And I was like, oh, that's cool.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.360
So I'll do something for you.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.590
So we at the time like
created this cookie shot.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.300
And we set up a bar.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.040
We had different kind of milk.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.380
And it was like a fun event.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.140
And it turned in to
be like very popular.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.910
We did it just for one night.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.320
We had a few hundred that night.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.400
And we had a line of over 700
people waiting just for this.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.610
And this was meant
just for this event.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.040
So I was going back to
New York a day later,

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.430
and before I even got back,
everyone was asking for it.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.120
We decided to put
it on the menu.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.810
It's been one of our best
sellers now since then.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:28.040
We offer it in the afternoon.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.440
It's an afternoon snack,
of course, cookie and milk.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.030
From 3 PM until closing.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:38.660
And in Tokyo as well, like it
was one of our best sellers.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.191
So it's been very popular.

00:29:40.191 --> 00:29:42.690
ANANT SHUKLA: And you perfected
the cookie on the way there.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.810
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: So
it's served warm.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:47.600
We pour fresh farm
milk that infused

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.920
with vanilla inside, a nice ice
cold milk and a warm cookie.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.100
And people always ask
me how should I eat it.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.200
Just get a shot
and eat the cookie.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.411
It's very fun.

00:30:00.411 --> 00:30:02.660
ANANT SHUKLA: This we talked
about, the frozen s'more.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.368
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Yeah,
the frozen s'more.

00:30:04.368 --> 00:30:07.000
So it's beautiful like crunchy
shell and you can see this

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.206
like tender marshmallow,
the vanilla ice cream.

00:30:10.206 --> 00:30:12.080
ANANT SHUKLA: So you
mentioned you've started

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.350
to expand globally now--

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.580
two stores in Tokyo,
a bakery in London,

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.220
you're working towards your
first restaurant in LA.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.250
How do you expand the
brand when you can only

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:24.140
be physically in one
location at any time,

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.570
and stay authentic to
that kind of mission,

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:27.785
and pushing the boundary.

00:30:27.785 --> 00:30:30.390
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Yeah, I
will say just two things--

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.780
talent and technology.

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.790
Talent, because I
need good chefs,

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.630
strong chefs that have the
same vision, or at least

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:42.530
can learn how to create,
how to think out of the box.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:46.449
And we have a lot of talented
chefs in London, in Tokyo.

00:30:46.449 --> 00:30:48.740
ANANT SHUKLA: A lot of the
team is here today with you,

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:49.220
as well.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.595
DOMINIQUE ANSEL:
My team is here.

00:30:50.595 --> 00:30:52.225
We have our chef
from [INAUDIBLE],,

00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:56.750
our chef for the
restaurant in LA as well.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:01.040
I'm very fortunate that the
team is everything for me.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.640
I mean, without a team, there's
no good leader without a team.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.460
And I think it's important to
challenge the team every day.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.760
But also to support them
into everything they do.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.230
And technology-- technology
is very important.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:17.330
I have my cell phone with me
all day, like everyone now.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:21.570
And there's lots of
apps to get into a call,

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.570
send videos, and see photos.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.060
So I stay connected
with our team

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.960
in London, Tokyo, every
day, every single day

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.130
without exception.

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.980
ANANT SHUKLA: And the menu
is custom at each location.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.810
Think this is, again,
the Tokyo bakery.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:39.590
How have you adapted the local
flavors to suit local taste?

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:42.320
I think this is an example of
the creme de la corn, which

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.070
probably in the US it's not
the taste and flavor profile

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.080
that most people would expect.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.580
But--

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.830
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: I don't know.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.650
I think corn is
very popular here.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.890
We're actually going to
launch this very soon just

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:56.780
for weekend at the kitchen.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.500
So in Tokyo, we started
with kind of the New York

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.540
menu, which was 70%.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:06.620
And we created like a small
menu just to test and see.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.580
And now it has that flipped.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:12.790
Like about 80% of the
menu is local creations.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.690
And about 20% is the
signature from New York.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:16.190
And why?

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:19.220
Because I think you
know before anything

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.300
a bakery is a local business.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.960
So you have to cater to
your local customers.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.060
And the culture is
different, so you

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.720
have to use local ingredients
like local produce,

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:36.065
but also like celebrate every
local holiday and tradition

00:32:36.065 --> 00:32:37.260
as well.

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.140
ANANT SHUKLA: And
this is also one.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.185
That is the zero gravity, which
is inside of a balloon, right?

00:32:42.185 --> 00:32:43.060
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Yes.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.230
So it's a light, super
light, fluffy chiffon

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:47.610
cake inside a balloon.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:49.760
It's our zero gravity cake.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.950
So that's how we call it.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.430
It's for a new shop
in Ginza, in Japan.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:59.302
Then we ask people to tale a
little pin and pop the balloon.

00:32:59.302 --> 00:33:02.240
So sometimes we put confetti
inside for birthdays.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.940
People love it.

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.240
It's very fun.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.880
ANANT SHUKLA: Then this is
the kitchen here right here,

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.795
opened April 2015.

00:33:09.795 --> 00:33:12.320
It was your second store
opening in New York.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.510
How did you decide that
it was the right time?

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.617
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: So
everyone was asking me

00:33:16.617 --> 00:33:18.950
from the time when I launched
the Cronut until we opened

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.491
the kitchen, everyone
was asking what

00:33:20.491 --> 00:33:23.630
is the next, what is
the next pastry, what

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:26.360
is the next hybrid
you're going to create.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.200
And I always told people, it's
not about creating hybrid.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.660
It's about being creative.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.600
The Cronut might be known
for being a hybrid pastry,

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.720
but it's not about this,
really, but creating

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.550
emotions and new things.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.810
So when everyone was expecting
the next hybrid pastry,

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:47.150
I give them the next
hybrid bakery, which

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.080
is Dominique Ansel Kitchen.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.650
So we take time
as an ingredient.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.670
And we make everything
freshly made to order.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:54.170
Why?

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.500
Because it's something
I've done my entire life,

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.990
working in the kitchen,
mixing a chocolate mousse

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.340
and taking a spoon of it.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.220
And I realized that
the best moment in time

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.050
were the food was that good
is when you are making it.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:09.800
So if you come to
Dominique Ansel Kitchen,

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.530
we have a large
portion of our menu

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.570
that we make to order, like this
very light, fluffy chocolate

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:16.489
mousse.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.760
We have a lemon
[INAUDIBLE] tart where

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.739
we use [INAUDIBLE]
actually where

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:25.239
we mix the butter and the curd,
and we emulsify it to order.

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.290
And we have a super
thin tart shell,

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:31.280
and we're pour this creamy,
creamy, buttery lemon curd

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.179
into the tart shell.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.760
So it's like, you have
this beautiful textures,

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.920
and it's super delicate.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.089
And it says different emotions,
different way of eating food.

00:34:40.089 --> 00:34:40.880
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.072
And these are the matcha--

00:34:42.072 --> 00:34:44.030
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: These
are the matcha beignets.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.860
So they are fried to order.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:50.929
And they're little
puffy fluffy beignet

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:53.060
dough with the little
bit of lime zest,

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.570
and we finish it with tons
of matcha powdered sugar.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.060
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah, and another
kind of unique opportunity

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.560
that I'm not sure
if everybody knows

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.540
is kind of up, that you run kind
of after hours at the kitchen.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.570
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Yes.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:09.800
I love-- I always tell
people pastry chefs,

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.540
especially in restaurants,
they're always--

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.530
they don't really
have the story to tell

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:20.120
because when you have dinner,
whatever savory food the chef

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.270
cooks, you have to
follow with a dessert.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.617
So if the chef cooks
like classic food,

00:35:24.617 --> 00:35:25.950
you have to do classic desserts.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:28.520
And if it's super modern,
you have to be super modern.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.910
So this is an opportunity for
us to be close to our customers.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.570
So this is our kitchen
in the West Village.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.250
And here we have a table
that's hanged on the ceiling.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:41.510
So UP stands for
Unlimited Possibilities.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:45.770
And this is where we
serve our testing menu.

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.660
We were working on the next one.

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.860
It's going to be very
fun for the fall.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.550
And we're right here in the
middle of the kitchen, where

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:53.870
we prep the food for you.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:55.770
We turn around and we drop it.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:58.409
And we can tell you the story
from actually beginning to end.

00:35:58.409 --> 00:35:59.200
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:00.700
I think one of the
interesting ones,

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.165
I think, the tech boom, right?

00:36:02.165 --> 00:36:03.040
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Yes.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.050
The first few minutes were
eight courses of only desserts.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:11.544
And it's not too much.

00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:14.090
They're small-- small portions.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.950
And this one was the tech boom.

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:21.230
So it's essentially
one of the first Mac.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:25.940
And so I work with an engineer
to create this little computer

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.381
where we give
people a flash disk.

00:36:28.381 --> 00:36:30.380
And when you put the flash
disk in the computer,

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.380
it shoots out waffles.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.750
So it shoots out warm waffles.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:40.520
And it's a way of
experiencing UP

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.517
and to have like little stories
behind every of the dishes.

00:36:43.517 --> 00:36:45.350
ANANT SHUKLA: I think
one more we have here.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:46.370
First heartbreak, right?

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:46.640
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Yes.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.765
This is another dish that
we created for this menu,

00:36:48.765 --> 00:36:52.100
was the first heartbreak.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.670
So the menu was called first.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.300
And it was retracing every
first time of someone's life.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.680
So from the first word to the
first time living on your own,

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.870
the first heartbreak
which is right here.

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:06.520
So I got inspired by
love, it start off

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:10.040
with something beautiful,
like this beautiful flower.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.630
And we have a little rice paper
sticking out with a love note.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:16.640
And we are asking people to
take matches, light the rice

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.730
paper on fire, and this
is actually baked Alaska.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:23.360
So the entire dish will
like catch on fire.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:27.590
And in the center, you can see
this little chocolate sphere.

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.750
And inside was rocky
road ice cream.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.660
So you have your little
ice cream at the end.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.650
It was a very fun way
of telling a story

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.355
from beginning to end for us.

00:37:39.355 --> 00:37:40.250
ANANT SHUKLA: Great.

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:41.980
We're going to open
up to audience Q&amp;A,

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.979
if people want to start lining
up at the mic, on both side.

00:37:45.979 --> 00:37:48.020
Kind of the last two
questions I have for you is,

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.103
we've talked a little bit
about upcoming projects,

00:37:50.103 --> 00:37:50.810
obviously in LA.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.880
Kind of what is next for you?

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.840
And where do you see
yourself the next five years?

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.590
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Well,
what's next for me,

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.770
I think it's important to
take it one step at a time.

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:03.140
I'm really excited about LA.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.030
We're opening a bakery
there, but we're also

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:09.920
opening our first restaurant--
our first full service seated

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:10.700
restaurant.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.130
So I'm really
excited about this.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.510
I was trained as a chef, as
well [INAUDIBLE] I love cooking.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:16.754
I've always loved cooking.

00:38:16.754 --> 00:38:18.920
Always been in the kitchen,
service side at Daniel's

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.260
to see what they were doing,
how they were cooking.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.860
And it is a big step for us.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.220
It's also an
opportunity to showcase

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.234
how creative we can be, not
only with desserts but also

00:38:31.234 --> 00:38:32.150
with like savory food.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:33.085
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:38:33.085 --> 00:38:34.460
And then especially
at Google, we

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.860
have kind of my last question
is, people always ask us,

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.235
we have so much
free food around,

00:38:38.235 --> 00:38:39.651
how are you not
putting on weight?

00:38:39.651 --> 00:38:41.990
When you're in the kitchen
with all these desserts,

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:43.340
what is your secret to not?

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.798
DOMINIQUE ANSEL:
There's no secret.

00:38:44.798 --> 00:38:45.980
You sleep very little.

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.720
And you're standing
on your feet all day

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.430
long, going up and down.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.330
So I eat a lot,
taste a lot of food.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.887
It's just a matter of like--

00:38:54.887 --> 00:38:56.970
I don't know, maybe
I'm lucky too.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.230
ANANT SHUKLA: Fast metabolism.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.105
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Yeah,
maybe fast metabolism.

00:39:00.105 --> 00:39:00.938
ANANT SHUKLA: Great.

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:02.114
We can start.

00:39:02.114 --> 00:39:03.510
AUDIENCE: Hi Dominique.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:04.390
My name is Claire.

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:06.550
Amazing inspiration
on all your sweet

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.740
treats, which I
think we all love.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.560
Switching to savory, what
savory foods do you like to eat?

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.141
And do you have favorite
restaurants in New York?

00:39:15.141 --> 00:39:17.490
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: What savory
food do I like to eat?

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.400
I'm very curious, so
I love exploring food.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.180
I force myself-- even though
I don't have too much time--

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.210
force myself to go out, to
see every new restaurant.

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.820
I love eclectic cuisine.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.960
I love seeing different flavors,
different styles of cooking.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.390
Some of my favorite
restaurants--

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:37.260
I have a lot.

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.770
I have a long list.

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.360
Blue Hill is one of them.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.510
I am actually doing
a chef collaboration

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:48.000
with Dan Barber today and this
weekend at the other kitchen.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.770
And we're doing this
beautiful scotch egg.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:52.472
So, Dan Barber, which is--

00:39:52.472 --> 00:39:54.180
I don't know if you
guys know about him--

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:58.180
one of the best chefs in
the country, has a farm

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.300
Blue Hill Stone Farm upstate.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.860
And he has found a way to feed
this chicken with red pepper

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.110
and the yolk actually turns red.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:10.310
So we are doing a
fun like scotch egg,

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:13.760
like beets and these like
beautiful eggs from the farm,

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.220
baby corn that is grilled.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.350
And I love Dan Barber's food.

00:40:20.634 --> 00:40:22.300
AUDIENCE: Bonjour,
Dominique, Alexander.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.140
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.630
I have two questions for you.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:27.810
One, as a French man who
moved to New York recently,

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.140
is a basic survival question.

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.336
What do you think is the
best baguette in New York?

00:40:32.336 --> 00:40:35.646
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Ha,
the best baguette.

00:40:35.646 --> 00:40:37.532
It's tough.

00:40:37.532 --> 00:40:38.240
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.410
That's why I'm asking.

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:42.300
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: I love the
baguette at Maison Kayser,

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.760
actually.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.470
Yeah, they do a
good job with bread.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:46.280
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.180
Thank you.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.630
The second question is, so
you're supernational now.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:54.220
You have multiple locations
in the US, Japan, London.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.970
Are you thinking of
opening shop in Paris?

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:58.178
And I guess in general,
what's your relationship back

00:40:58.178 --> 00:40:58.915
to France?

00:40:58.915 --> 00:41:02.180
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: I
mean, Paris is my--

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.790
I have to say-- like I
love, love, love New York.

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:08.850
Paris is to me one of the most
beautiful cities in the world.

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:10.120
I love, love, love Paris.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.330
I will always love Paris.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:15.980
I will love eventually
someday getting back

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.200
home and doing something there.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.580
I have no plan for now.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.190
But eventually I
would love to go back.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.878
I spent so many years
of my life there.

00:41:24.878 --> 00:41:26.375
AUDIENCE: Merci.

00:41:26.375 --> 00:41:28.870
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Thank you.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:29.641
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:41:29.641 --> 00:41:30.390
How are you doing?

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.790
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: I'm good.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:31.813
How are you?

00:41:31.813 --> 00:41:33.292
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's good.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.240
When you are thinking about
opening a second location,

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.980
what made you choose Tokyo
out of all the locations,

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.211
basically, in the world?

00:41:45.211 --> 00:41:46.710
DOMINIQUE ANSEL:
Our second location

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.210
was actually the West Village.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.940
But our second
internationally was Tokyo.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:51.630
You're right.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:54.480
And Tokyo was just--

00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:00.400
it was just a matter of like
market, this huge market

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.250
for bakeries there.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:05.670
People are crazy about
bakeries, about pastries,

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:08.130
about food in general.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.930
The market is actually
quite saturated.

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.510
And there's so many
bakeries everywhere.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:14.890
They love and
understand French food.

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:20.010
And we met some good people that
help us developing the business

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:21.510
there, and opening to business.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:25.202
So that was natural
like next step for me.

00:42:25.202 --> 00:42:26.910
Tokyo is a market that I love.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:30.120
Every time I go back there's
so much to see and culturally

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.030
to learn about.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:35.400
There's like excellent
food everywhere.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.560
Even the smallest
little shop like

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.050
will make the best food ever.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:45.046
So it was a natural next
step for me to go to Japan.

00:42:45.046 --> 00:42:45.902
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:45.902 --> 00:42:48.555
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Thank you.

00:42:48.555 --> 00:42:49.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.160
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Hi.

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.160
AUDIENCE: I was curious.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.890
It sounded like you had
a whole bunch of recipes

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:54.590
that you started to build
when you arrived at the United

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:55.265
States.

00:42:55.265 --> 00:42:56.890
Are there any
ingredients or techniques

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.510
that you discovered as well?

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:01.000
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Well, tons.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:01.960
Yes.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.900
I think it's an industry where--

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.030
food industry is
an industry where

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:10.570
you learn beginning
with recipes from chef,

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:12.930
and then you, if
you're smart enough,

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:13.930
should build from there.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:17.110
Always look at the recipes why
they were done a certain way.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:18.680
There are still
recipes that I use

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.000
that two, three
generations ago were using.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.720
But I always like look at
it and try to understand it.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.410
For instance, like butter cream
that we're doing 30 years ago,

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:32.920
had lots more butter,
lots more sugar than now.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.580
And it was used just
as preservative.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.780
Like they were not putting--

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.480
they were not having the
refrigeration we have now,

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.770
leaving the food outside.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.340
But you know, time is changing.

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:46.090
People are more like
health conscious.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.590
And it's important to
always look at the recipe,

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:51.880
like tweak them, perfect them.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.550
And there's like
always tons of recipes

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:56.710
and new ideas we're developing.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:00.940
For instance, right now, between
all of our locations from Tokyo

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.970
to New York and London
there's probably like 50,

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:09.570
60 different menu items
that are being developed.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.540
So it's perpetual.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:15.944
We never stop thinking of
new techniques, new recipes.

00:44:15.944 --> 00:44:17.110
We're constantly developing.

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:20.210
It's a part of the process,
part of what we do.

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.839
AUDIENCE: Have you done
anything with kale?

00:44:22.839 --> 00:44:24.380
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: I
actually was asked

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.463
to do something with kale.

00:44:25.463 --> 00:44:27.250
AUDIENCE: Don't do it.

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:29.480
DOMINIQUE ANSEL:
It was not too bad.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.230
I did a kale sorbet.

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:33.750
It was very light.

00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:35.900
AUDIENCE: Dominique,
have you ever

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.060
tried experimenting
with using something

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:39.590
in place of egg in recipes?

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:43.101
And if you have, have found
anything that works well?

00:44:43.101 --> 00:44:46.160
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: I mean, I have
not played too much with eggs.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:52.100
But I know people use
different source of protein

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:56.170
to emulsify mixes.

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:59.750
I know there's a lot
of things out there.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.360
Not too much, I haven't played
too much with egg whites.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:08.505
But I sometimes get asked
a question [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:09.710
ANANT SHUKLA: Great.

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:12.400
Well, let's give Chef Dominique
a big round of applause.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:12.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:13.930
ANANT SHUKLA: Thank
you for joining us.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.055
DOMINIQUE ANSEL: Thank you.

00:45:15.055 --> 00:45:16.790
Thank you, everyone.
