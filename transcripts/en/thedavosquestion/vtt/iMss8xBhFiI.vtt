&gt;&gt;Nigel Morris: Okay, I'm Nigel Morris. I'm
the CEO of Isobar which is a digital marketing

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.629
network.
I actually don't think the environment is

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:20.189
going to lose out to the economy in 2009.
Partly the reason for that, is that the economy

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.780
is in many respects a subset of the environment.
I think people are beginning to realize that

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.439
the old models of mass, the old models of
producing things that we don't need, of consuming

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.910
things that we don't really need to consume
in the West is actually broken. And actually

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.600
people are beginning to realize that a sustainable
mode of consumption and a sustainable mode

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.280
of production are the only things that are
going to generate sustainable jobs, they are

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.000
going to create sustainable economies.
I think they are actually going to get us

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.420
back to having a real economy in a real world.
That's interesting coming from someone who

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.470
works in digital. Actually, again, I think
that digital is going to be the key driver.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.751
That's because: one, the more and more of
the business processes the more that go digital,

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:15.120
the more impact they are going to have in
the physical world. Anything that can be done

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.210
digitally will start to be done digitally.
And the other thing is going to be enormous

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:29.420
pressure on business, on politicians to act
sustainably, responsibly, ethically, because

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.620
everything we do is now transparent.
Digitally is all about everyone being connected

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.940
to everyone else in anything they're interested
in. What we have is a world in which there

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.150
is a transparency of actions. That you're
two clicks away from finding out whether someone

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.030
has actually done what they said they were
going to do.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.270
So therefore, I think if you look at the macropressure
of the last 20 years that's been about the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:05.570
environment. That the economy is, it's a blip,
but it's a very big blip. But actually it's

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.369
going to be a tipping point that takes sustainability,
takes the environment really, really seriously.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.879
It's actually a critical year for that.
