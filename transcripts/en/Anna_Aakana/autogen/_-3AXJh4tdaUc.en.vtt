00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
I feel like everyone is really struggling this year

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.000
I feel like everyone is really struggling this year

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.800
I feel like everyone is really struggling this year

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.720
Myself Included

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.480
At the personal, professional and political level

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.760
everything just feels a little hopeless

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.080
I mean there's just been so many retrogrades this year, ya know?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.040
And like right now Venus is retrograding into Scorpio

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.280
and then it's gonna transition into Libra

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.360
so we just have to like stay strong you guys 'cause I dunno what's gonna happen during this time!

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.320
And lately, I've really been wondering

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.100
"How do you be happy when it feels like

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.900
the world is on fire?"

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.020
And not just like the ignorant happiness of obliviousness

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.000
real, genuine happiness in the face of adversity

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.280
I mean when shit hits the fan

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.775
How do you stay in a state of joy and gratitude?

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:43.675
Is it even possible for those of us who are not the Dolly Llama?

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.320
Oh my God, he is so wise! Retweet, like, follow.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.580
I have a friend named Linda.Linda's in her early fifties,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.465
and I met her doing background like, ten years ago.

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:57.085
And for those of you who don't know, background means where the extras in the back

00:00:57.085 --> 00:01:00.065
of film and tv scenes. And something that always amazed me,

00:01:00.065 --> 00:01:04.995
about her is, just how happy she is. Like no matter what

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:13.855
our external conditions were, like if we had no food, if we couldn't go to the bathroom for hours, if it was freezing cold outside and we had to do a scene forever, she was always smiling.

00:01:13.855 --> 00:01:16.735
Even if someone was being a dick to her, she was smiling.

00:01:16.735 --> 00:01:19.805
And she just radiates genuine happiness.

00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:22.295
Its insane, and Linda and I

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:25.045
have kept in touch on Facebook over the years, and

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:26.785
randomly I was just like,

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:30.335
"Hey how are you able to be so happy all the time? I mean is it like genetic, or

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:33.815
do you do like a gratitude journal, what is it?" "Well Anna,

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:37.365
the best way to be happy later, is to be happy now."

00:01:37.585 --> 00:01:40.485
"Wh-What does that even mean? It sounds like a

00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:43.125
fortune cookie, Chinese finger trap thing.

00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:45.955
Like what?" "Well the problem is that most people,

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:48.965
specifically young people, think that they'll be happy when.

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:51.805
Y'know when I get that job, when I'm in that relationship,

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:54.825
when I find what I'm looking for. Then, when they get it and they're

00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:57.775
not happy, they just move the goal post to later down the line.

00:01:58.045 --> 00:02:01.325
And when you get to my age, you realize if you wanna be happy later,

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:03.455
you just have to learn how to be happy now."

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:07.255
And I was pretty pissed at Linda. I was like "Wow Linda,

00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:09.825
that is not what I wanted to hear. That sounds way too

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:12.965
over simplifies to be even helpful." Like how am I supposed to be

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:16.075
happy right now, just as things are, when the world is on fire?

00:02:16.075 --> 00:02:18.245
Did you not see the meme, Linda?

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:22.085
But the more I thought about it, I was like, "Y'know what? Okay fine,

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:24.835
what do I have to lose? Besides my unhappiness? I'm

00:02:24.835 --> 00:02:27.165
gonna give it a shot." So for the last few months, I have been

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:28.380
following her advise,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.500
and actively choosing to be happy in moments where I'm not.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.860
And it sounds easy,

00:02:33.345 --> 00:02:35.945
its not easy at all. It involves like

00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:39.155
really focusing hard on what I'm grateful for until that

00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:41.965
feeling is sort of evoked in me. Uhm,

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:44.815
resisting negative thought patterns, up turning limited beliefs

00:02:44.815 --> 00:02:47.615
and really staying on top of what I'm allowing

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:51.015
myself to think. But the more I do it,

00:02:51.255 --> 00:02:54.095
the only slightly, tiny bit easier it gets.

00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:56.955
And yeah, I still feel like a flailing can of emotions

00:02:56.955 --> 00:03:00.185
half the time, realigning myself to be happy,

00:03:00.345 --> 00:03:03.255
gets a little bit, just a tiny bit easier, every time I do it.And I think

00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:06.265
Linda's advice really does, ultimately have merit. If we

00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:09.125
are expecting happiness to come from some kind of external factor, we have it all wrong.

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:11.815
And if we think happens is going to come to us in the

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:14.965
future magically, we have it all wrong. If we think

00:03:14.965 --> 00:03:18.175
happiness is a mindset, that we actively have to cultivate moment, to moment,

00:03:18.175 --> 00:03:21.065
by reframing the way we se our situation and carefully

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:24.535
curating our thoughts to serve us, then unfortunately you are right, and it is a really

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:26.405
hard habit to create and maintain.

00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:30.345
But, its not impossible. I'm Anna Akana, and I'm happy now.

00:03:30.345 --> 00:03:33.305

00:03:38.905 --> 00:03:41.945
I'v been listening to The Happiness Project by Gretchen Rubin,

00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:44.975
while I drive, do laundry, or stretch.

00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:48.195
Gretchen did this year long project where she documented her journey

00:03:48.195 --> 00:03:51.175
