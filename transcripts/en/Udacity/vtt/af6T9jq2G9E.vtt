00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.050
Labels should be prominent and

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.260
visible when a user is filling
out their associated inputs.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.660
When writing HTML, use the label
element as a container for your inputs.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.500
Associated inputs get
nested inside labels.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.910
You could use the for attributes
to link inputs and labels.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.040
Either way works fine, but

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.890
I like to nest because it simplify
my HTML and makes it more semantic.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.440
As an important bonus,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.900
applying labels to our form elements
helps to improve the touch target size.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.180
The user can touch either the label or
the input in order

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.500
to place the focus on the input element,
like I'm doing right now.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.010
And you could see here that
we're using the four attributes.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.410
Okay, enough of me talking.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.570
I want you to try one
out in the next quiz.
