00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.300
You know what’s the coolest thing ever?

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.730
Not that we can send spacecraft to distant
planets but that we can get hi-res images

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.470
back!

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.210
Yeah.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.950
Awesomesauce.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.739
Hello, everyone, Amy getting nerdy about SPACE
today with you on DNews!

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:24.009
Every spacecraft, telescope, probe, or lander
we’ve ever sent into space has to communicate

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.259
with the Earth to both receive commands and
return data.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.130
Since 1957, when the Soviet Union launched
the first ever satellite, Sputnik, they’ve

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.750
all used radio waves.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.730
A radio wave has a regular pattern, so data
is encoded by either changing the amplitude,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.850
more simply the height of the wave, or the
frequency, which is how close the peaks are

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.750
together, a value measured in Hertz.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.350
If we’re changing the amplitude, for example,
some peaks can be higher than others and we

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.379
can assign values to them so the higher peaks
are 1s and the lower peaks are 0s.

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.309
If we’re changing the frequency, 1s can
be waves that are closer together and 0s waves

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.649
that are further apart.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.960
These patterns are received by radio dishes
and interpreted by mission scientists.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.090
The process of encoding data and sending it
on radio waves is the same regardless of what

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.479
the spacecraft is sending home, so that could
include voice transmissions, spacecraft data,

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.100
and pictures.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.350
Modern spacecraft have digital cameras on
board.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.149
The core of the camera is a small device made
up of light-sensitive pixels on a sensor.

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.909
Every pixel has an assigned number to denote
its position on the sensor.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.860
When the camera takes a picture, each pixel
then measures the brightness of its specific

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.240
part of the scene.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.680
The measured brightness is also given a corresponding
numeric value.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.939
So basically the image is broken down into
numbers, one for brightness and one for the

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.310
location of the pixel on the sensor.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.280
Getting the picture back is then a simple
process of sending those numbers back to Earth

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.729
on radio waves.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.790
Radio waves are easy enough to receive with
radio dishes, just as long as the spacecraft

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.619
and the dish can “see” one another -- meaning
that there aren’t any large bodies like

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.180
planets and moons blocking the wave’s path.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.780
Then it’s just a matter of the mission scientist
translating pixel information into an image!

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.289
So if we have pictures beaming down from all
over the solar system, why don't we have video

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:06.289
yet?

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.490
It comes down to how much information radio
waves can carry.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.500
The limiting factor in radio communications
is the bandwidth, or the frequency of a wave.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.590
Higher frequency waves can carry more data,
but radio waves can only have so high a frequency,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.230
even if they’re manipulated to encode data.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.260
The shortest radio waves are only 300 GHz.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.740
The frequency can get higher, the thing is,
at that point, it becomes visible light.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.040
So to have a communications system that can
carry more data, you need optical communications.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.770
More data can be held in a laser beam than
a radio wave because the laser’s frequency

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.270
is much higher.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.340
But there's a tradeoff.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.450
Radio waves are so big they're easy to receive.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.810
Laser beams are narrow and have to be perfectly
aimed at a receiver.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.310
But NASA is working on it!

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.370
In 2013, scientists beamed a picture of the
Mona Lisa to the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter’s

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.850
LOLA instrument, marking the first optical
communications beyond Earth orbit.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.370
Closer to home, the OPALS mission use lasers
to beam a video to Earth from the International

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.570
Space Station.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.980
So for now we can only have videos from space
made out of images put together to simulate

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.980
motion.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.840
But soon we could have live video from Mars!

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.760
With the light time delay, of course.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.240
But this is all how modern cameras work.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.010
Back in the 1960s, there were no digital cameras;
Apollo astronauts used film on the Moon and

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.930
then developed it back on Earth.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.190
So how did we get live footage of Neil Armstrong
landing on the Moon?

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.930
I’ve got a look at how we saw those historic
first steps over on my own channel Vintage

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:43.930
Space.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.680
But what about colour data?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.570
The story of modern images from space gets
a little more complicated when we talk about

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.120
how we know what colour things are in space.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.650
I’ve got more detail on what colour the
planets really are in this episode of DNews

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:10.310
right here.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.340
What pictures from deep space do you guys
love?

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.530
Let us know in the comments below and be sure
to check back for a new episode of DNews every

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.959
