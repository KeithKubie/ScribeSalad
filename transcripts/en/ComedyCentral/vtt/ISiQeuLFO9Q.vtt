00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.839
- So I start eating
the burger...

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.540
[audience groaning
and laughing]

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.710
While I'm taking a shit.
- Aah!

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.012
- And--yes--
and then I realize--

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.747
Someone was really disgusted
by that.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.516
They're like, "Aah!"
[laughter]

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.551
I guess we're not
fucking tonight.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:19.752
Um...
[laughs]

- Welcome to

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.919
I'm your host, Ari Shaffir.

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.655
Tonight all the stories

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:06.432
- I love drinking!

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:10.269
[cheers and applause]
Yes!

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:12.438
[scoffs]
And my friend Marcy--

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:15.775
she likes to be like, "Nicole,
you might be an alcoholic."

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.776
And I'm like, "No."
[giggles]

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.845
"No, I make it to work on time."

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:23.149
I feel like alcoholics--
they're just fucking shit up,

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.483
and I'm doing good.

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:26.619
I'm here on time, you know?

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.821
And, uh, I like drinking

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:31.457
because it's like
a real adventure.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.459
I love going on adventures.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.962
I like getting into cars
with strangers.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:38.665
It's fun. You never know
what you're gonna get.

00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:41.634
I've made several friends get in
cars with people we didn't know,

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:43.469
and they're like,
"Is this your friend?"

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.371
I'm like, "No. Yay!"

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.974
One time I met this man
in a U-Haul.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.209
I was like...

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.876
[silly voice] "Hey, you want
to take me around?"

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:52.645
[normal voice]
And he was like, "Okay."

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:56.115
So I get in the back
of his U-Haul.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:58.485
There's no seats.
There's no seat belts.

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.152
There's nothing.

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:03.556
I'm just, like, bouncing around,
just, like, loving my life.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.491
And then I, like, call
my roommate Jenny,

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:08.194
and I'm like, "Jenny, I got us
a ride to the next bar."

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.395
She was like, "Cool."

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.497
And then she was like,
"The fuck?"

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:12.832
[laughter]

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:14.900
But, like,
Jenny also likes adventures.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.670
So the two of us are just
bouncing around in this U-Haul,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.205
going around Manhattan.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.540
It was great.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.141
And then I was like,
"Ooh, I'm hungry."

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:23.843
He's like,
"Let's go to Ray's Pizza."

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:25.344
And I was like, "Okay."

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:27.513
So I get a slice of pizza.

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:28.847
[silly voice]
And I'm like,

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:30.850
"Ooh, I can't wait
to eat this pizza.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.318
It's gonna be so good."

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.687
[normal voice] So, like,
I go to take the first bite,

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.890
and I drop it,
cheese side down.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.858
And I was like, "No!"

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.861
[silly voice]
"This is the worst thing

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:43.830
that's ever happened
in my life!"

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.198
[normal voice]
And Jenny's like,

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:46.833
"We'll get you another piece
of pizza."

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.701
[silly voice] And I was like,
"No, it's okay.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.902
I'll take one for the team."

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:51.537
[normal voice]
So I...

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:55.040
pick it up
and just start eating it.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.710
Let me tell you, it was
the crunchiest piece of pizza

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.879
I've ever had in my life.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.415
All of New York
was in my mouth.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:04.884
And I made it to work on time
the next day,

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:08.187
'cause I'm not an alcoholic.

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:11.357
I went through a phase
with my drinking

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:15.060
where I liked to get real drunk,
but I also like to be clean.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.196
So I would, like, black out
and be like...

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:19.264
[silly voice]
"Got to get in the shower."

00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:20.432
[normal voice]
So...

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:22.902
[laughter]
I would, like--

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.236
[silly voice]
Just soaping it up,

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:25.771
and I'm like,
"This feels so good!"

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:27.206
[normal voice]
It feels great, you guys,

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.907
to just be drunk,
soaping your titties.

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:31.377
And, um...
[laughter]

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:35.215
I knew my shower was over
when I was out of the shower

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:39.218
on my back, like,
just tumbling out and like...

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.420
[silly voice]
"Okay, yeah, I guess I'm done.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.454
Good call."

00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:43.957
[normal voice]
And...

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.926
one of these times
I didn't fall out of the shower.

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:48.760
I just fell in the shower,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.498
and I hit every single fixture
going down.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.233
It was like,
thu--thu--thu--thunk!

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:56.302
And then I,
like, passed out.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.436
Oops.

00:03:57.436 --> 00:03:59.405
[laughter]

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:03.309
And when I came to, I was in,
like, this big pool of blood.

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.611
'Cause if you put, like,
a drop of blood in water,

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:07.012
it looks like a lot.

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:08.981
But I guess I passed out,
but it was so much.

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:10.949
[silly voice] I was like,
"Oh, no, that's not good.

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.618
"This is not good.
This is very bad.

00:04:12.618 --> 00:04:14.287
It looks very, very bad."

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:16.255
[normal voice] And then I was
trying to get the water down,

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:18.157
and I couldn't,
and I was like...

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.959
[silly voice] "I got to get
to work--I'll just leave it."

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.263
[normal voice] And I went to
work with, like, an open chin.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:26.265
And I was just, like, bleeding
in the cab.

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:29.135
He's like, "You okay?"
I'm like, "Just drive."

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:31.804
And nurses worked
on the floor above us,

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.472
and they used
our vending machines,

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:34.640
'cause they get hungry.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.342
And, um...

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:38.443
I asked them--I was like,
"Do I need stitches?"

00:04:38.443 --> 00:04:39.812
And the woman was like, "No."

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.447
And then years later,
I asked a doctor friend.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:43.015
I was like, "Should I have
gotten stitches?"

00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:46.185
He was like, "Absolutely."
So fuck that lady.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.486
But, uh...

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:48.988
- Whoo!

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:50.989
- Someone whoo'd.
Someone hates nurses back there.

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:52.558
She's like, "Yeah, fuck her."

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.027
[laughter]

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:55.995
So, like, there is a pool
of, like, bloody water

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:57.729
in my bathtub still
while I'm at work.

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.064
So I texted my roommate Evan.

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:02.535
I was like,
"Evan, I murdered somebody."

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:03.703
And then he was like,

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.171
"What happened?
What's going on?"

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.307
And I just didn't answer.

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:10.676
It was very funny to me.

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:12.177
[laughter]

00:05:12.177 --> 00:05:16.015
It's still pretty funny to me.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:20.886
Um, okay, this story
is an adventure on a airplane.

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:24.223
So I was on a red-eye
from L.A. to New York,

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:26.392
and I sit down, and I usually
wear this necklace.

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:29.195
It's a giant nameplate necklace
that says "Nicole."

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:30.729
My best friend
got it for me.

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.064
The Brooklyn jeweler
was like,

00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:33.599
"Are you sure
you want it that big?"

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.735
And she's like, "Yeah,
I have a very tacky friend."

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:39.772
So she gets me this necklace.
I'm sitting on the plane.

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:42.041
The flight attendant--
his name was Carlton.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.577
I love him. He goes,
"Oh, you must be Nicole."

00:05:44.577 --> 00:05:45.878
And I was like,
"Oh, my necklace."

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:47.413
And he's like,
"Yes, but also,

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:49.248
I know you from that show
'The Girl Codes.'"

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:50.883
And I was like, "Oh, yeah,
'Girl Code,' cool."

00:05:50.883 --> 00:05:52.684
And then he was like,
"I got you,"

00:05:52.684 --> 00:05:53.886
'cause I was sitting in coach.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:56.756
Don't tell nobody.
But, um...

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:58.891
So I'm in coach, and then he,
like, hooks me up with a drink.

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.125
He's like,
"What do you want?"

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:01.793
And I was like,
"A vodka soda, please."

00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:04.463
And he was like, "Okay, I got
you, I got you, I got you."

00:06:04.463 --> 00:06:05.764
And I was like, "Great."

00:06:05.764 --> 00:06:07.366
And, uh, so he brings three

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.936
of those airplane bottles
of vodka and a splash of soda.

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.604
And I was like, "Game on."

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:12.871
So...
[coughs]

00:06:12.871 --> 00:06:14.573
Sorry. I have
a little bit of a cough.

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:15.808
I call it my athlete's cough,

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.576
'cause one time
I played basketball,

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:19.378
and my body was like, "Stop."

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:22.080
[laughter]

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.550
So I drink those
three bottles of vodka

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.552
and the splash of soda,
and I was like, "Great."

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:28.387
Comes back around, he's like,
"Do you want another?"

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.490
And I was like,
"Absolutely. Let's do this."

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.958
So he brings three more,
no soda, and I was like...

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.127
[silly voice]
"Yeah, yeah, ooh, I like this."

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:36.462
[normal voice] Drink those.
He comes back around.

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:38.463
He's like,
"Do you want another?"

00:06:38.463 --> 00:06:40.065
And I was like...

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:42.101
[silly voice] "I don't know
how to say no," so...

00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:43.402
[normal voice]
So I drink nine

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:45.571
of those airplane bottles
of vodka--

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:48.474
yeah, you know, that's, like,
a drink and a half per bottle--

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.610
on a 4 1/2-hour flight.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.578
I was so drunk.

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:54.313
[silly voice] I was like,
"I know what I'll do.

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:56.648
I'll watch
'Back to the Future.'"

00:06:56.648 --> 00:06:58.284
[normal voice]
So...

00:06:58.284 --> 00:06:59.986
I, uh--I watch
"Back to the Future"

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:02.321
like I had never seen
it before.

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:03.956
[silly voice]
I was like, "DeLorean?

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.791
That's a lady's name."

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.460
[laughter]

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.994
[normal voice] It is.
You go to the right hood.

00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:10.963
You go, "Hey, DeLorean."
She be like, "Hi, girl."

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:12.965 line:92%
But, uh...

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:14.967 line:91%
The guy next me
was just like, "Shh."

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.535 line:91%
And I was like,
"You like Christopher Lloyd?"

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.804 line:91%
And he was like,
"What is wrong with you?"

00:07:18.804 --> 00:07:20.605 line:92%
So I was, like, knee-slapping.

00:07:20.605 --> 00:07:23.309 line:91%
I really enjoyed my time
watching that movie.

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:25.144 line:91%
I've literally seen it
100 times.

00:07:25.144 --> 00:07:29.315
But we land at JFK,
and I stumble off the plane,

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:31.183
say good-bye
to my best friend Carlton.

00:07:31.183 --> 00:07:32.385
He was like,
"Bye, girl."

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:35.120
And, uh, I see Shake Shack
is open.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.655
Do you guys know
what Shake Shack is?

00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:38.691
- Whoo.
- Fucking delicious.

00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:40.159
So it's open at 7:00 a.m.

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:41.527
So I say to nobody...

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:45.164
[silly voice]
"Jesus loves his little baby."

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:48.200
[normal voice] And then I, like,
stumble up, and I order my food.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.369
And the guy goes,
"Oh, you must be Nicole,"

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:53.239
'cause he can read my necklace,
and my response was,

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:56.475
"You know who I am
'cause I'm famous!"

00:07:56.475 --> 00:07:58.711
[laughter]

00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:02.815
Which is something famous people
don't have to say.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.550
So...

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.087
after I sufficiently terrorize
this Shake Shack,

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:10.389
I take my burger,
I'm walking to leave JFK,

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:12.057
and I was like,
"Ooh, I got to pee."

00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:14.860
So I go to the bathroom.
I start peeing.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.929
Let's get real.
I'm taking a shit.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:19.231
[laughter and applause]

00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:21.734
Yeah, mm, planes are tight.
Can't shit on a plane.

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:23.569
So I'm taking a shit,
and I smell my burger,

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.872
and I'm like,
"Ooh, it smells so good."

00:08:26.872 --> 00:08:29.075
So I start eating the burger...

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:30.743
[audience groaning
and laughing]

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:33.746
While I'm taking a shit.
- Aah!

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:36.248
- And--yes--
and then I realize--

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:38.016
Someone was really disgusted
by that.

00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:39.585
They're like, "Aah!"
[laughter]

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.553
I guess we're not
fucking tonight.

00:08:41.553 --> 00:08:43.422
Um...
[laughs]

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:48.294
So I realize what I'm doing,
so I start crying.

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:51.097
[laughter]

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:55.768
So now I'm crying,
eating a burger, taking a shit.

00:08:55.768 --> 00:08:58.237
[laughter]
And I was like...

00:08:58.237 --> 00:09:00.072
[silly voice] "I know
what'll make me feel better.

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:02.541
I'll sing myself a song."

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:04.143
[normal voice]
So I start singing

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:07.146
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow"

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:11.716
while I'm crying,
eating a burger, taking a shit.

00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:14.619
And then I look down
and see a pair of feet.

00:09:14.619 --> 00:09:16.488
And instead of just,
like, shutting it down,

00:09:16.488 --> 00:09:19.425
I knocked on the partition.
I was like...

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:22.995
[silly voice] "Excuse me.
I'm not normally like this."

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:27.299
[laughter]

00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:28.967
[normal voice]
And then the woman,

00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:30.970
being a normal,
human, adult woman,

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.072
said nothing.

00:09:34.573 --> 00:09:37.510
So then I, like,
start hearing other sounds

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.613
and realize there are dozens
of women in this bathroom,

00:09:41.613 --> 00:09:43.749
washing their hands,
moving very slowly.

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.784
They're like, "I can't wait
to see that monster,

00:09:45.784 --> 00:09:47.186
you know, behind that door."

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:49.121
"Oh, yeah, girl,
I'll definitely miss my flight

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:51.657
to see what's
behind that door."

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:54.827
So I just said out loud
to no one, I was like,

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:57.963
"Hey!
I'm okay!"

00:09:57.963 --> 00:09:59.665
[coughs, clears throat]

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:03.135
I think I'm pretty okay.

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:05.804
Oh, boy, let's tell another one,
you guys.

00:10:05.804 --> 00:10:09.174
So I got very, very drunk.

00:10:09.174 --> 00:10:11.210
And I don't condone
drunk driving.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.812
It's not cool.
It's not fun.

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:14.346
But I was so hungry.

00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:15.514
So...

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.316
[laughter]

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:20.652
So I drunk-drove
to Jack In The Box,

00:10:20.652 --> 00:10:23.689
and instead of just, like,
pulling up

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:24.990
to the thing you talk into,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.692
I went straight to the window.

00:10:27.692 --> 00:10:29.161
And I was like...

00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:31.630
[silly voice]
"Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.367
You give me
all your French fries."

00:10:35.367 --> 00:10:37.336
[normal voice]
And then the lady was like,

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:39.171
"Yes, I'll give you an order
of French fries."

00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:40.539
I was like...

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:43.575
[silly voice]
"Nah, give me the loose ones."

00:10:43.575 --> 00:10:45.644
[laughter]

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:48.347
[normal voice] And she was like,
"No, I'm gonna put them

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:49.881
in a order
and give it to you."

00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:51.016
And I was like...

00:10:51.016 --> 00:10:53.519
[silly voice]
"You know best."

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:56.021
[normal voice] And then
she was like, "Stay here.

00:10:56.021 --> 00:10:58.189
Don't drive
to the next window."

00:10:58.189 --> 00:11:00.359
So I drove to the next window,

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:03.528
and then she was running,
and that was very funny to me.

00:11:03.528 --> 00:11:06.865
And she hands me
my French fries, and I go...

00:11:06.865 --> 00:11:08.200
[silly voice]
"Thank you.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.535
Thank you for my babies."

00:11:10.535 --> 00:11:13.205
[normal voice] I called
these French fries my babies.

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:17.209
I then buckled them up
in the passenger seat...

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:19.778
swerve, swerve home,
get to my garage,

00:11:19.778 --> 00:11:21.547
get out of my side,

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:24.850
open the door to let my babies
out, and they fall on the floor.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.053
And without skipping a beat,
I was like, "Not my babies!"

00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:31.190
[imitating chomping]

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:38.130
And in that moment, I was like,
"Is this rock bottom?"

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.764
No, it wasn't.

00:11:39.764 --> 00:11:42.067
You guys have been wonderful.

00:11:42.067 --> 00:11:44.904
I'm Nicole Byer.
[cheers and applause]
