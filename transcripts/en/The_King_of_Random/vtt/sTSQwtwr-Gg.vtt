00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.520
Hey, what's up guys?

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.400
Thanks for joining us on The King of Random.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.400
Batteries are everywhere and we use them in all sorts of stuff,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.240
and a lot of the time they come with warnings

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.120
saying to make sure you dispose of them properly, and how they can be dangerous if you misuse them.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.140
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.349
Well today, we are going to take this group of batteries

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.950
and we're gonna run them through a series of

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.830
destruction tests to see what happens if you stab them, cut them open, smash them, or even burn them

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.989
So let's get started. Not too long ago

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.359
I tried using a nail to slightly dent a battery to help balance a homo-polar motor. Well now

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.019
I'm gonna see what happens if I take a nail and

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.179
drive it as far as I can into the battery; not just denting it on the top.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.860
Ooh, it's leaking something already. There is liquid coming out of this battery.

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.179
Well, that's a good start. Let's keep driving the nail and see what keeps happening.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.939
I'll be honest. I didn't really think that the nail was gonna be able to drive this far into the battery.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.299
That is pretty much all the way through it, and it's still leaking.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.459
We've got this liquid leaking out, which I believe is potassium hydroxide, which is supposed to be fairly

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.548
irritating if you get it on your skin, so try and avoid touching this stuff. Our battery is also getting pretty warm.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.099
I'm gonna hit it with this little laser thermometer.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.739
120 Fahrenheit. The battery is getting quite hot now. As a comparison, if I take a scan of a block of metal next to it

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.680
That's at 65.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.150
The battery is at 135 still heating up pretty warm to the touch

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.319
36 I'm just gonna stand back a little bit and let it go and see if anything keeps happening to it as it warms up

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.840
like this

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.180
See if I can take an accurate measurement from this far away

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.440
showing 145 now

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.979
Well if I get closer it's showing 166 let me try and pull the nail out

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.890
There's a battery with a hole in it, I think it's cooling down a little bit now

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.450
feels kind of oily

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.320
Not like really oily, but a little oily all right well

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.229
I'm gonna try that exact same thing, but I'm gonna drive the nail in from the other side

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.590
More oozing liquid

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.989
Going in a weird angle here see if I can straighten this out.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.029
Oh and since there's a hole I can now go all the way through my thermometer is showing that it's up to a hundred degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.619
Watch it just climbing in temperature our other battery got up to

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.230
166 on here and now we're only hitting 116, so it's definitely warm, but it's not as hot as the other one

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.289
Now I've driven a nail through either end of the battery

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.900
I think it's only fair that I try and drive one right through the side

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.459
Its warming up again just hit a hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Ooo something just made a fizzle noise.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.069
It's a liquid inside the battery is spurting out onto the nail. It's occasionally making a hissing sound

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.130
past 130 Fahrenheit

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.860
140, More hissing and bubbling

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.549
Seems to be Hovering right around 150 now and once again

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.159
We have a battery with a hole running right through it

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.750
Holding it still for a couple seconds. It really does start to heat up in the hand well

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.410
I would say that being stabbed with a nail is definitely not good for batteries

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.850
Now since it should be a fun way to destroy it and I want a good look at what's inside

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.400
I'm gonna take a hacksaw and cut this C cell battery down in half lengthwise

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:36.600
(Sawing noises)

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.380
There's our black liquid oozing out

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.720
All right, I've got there's a black paste just all over the blade of the hacksaw now turn this upside down

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800
Cutting through it from the other side

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.930
I think I've got it

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.439
Mmm. Gross well, I've got a gooey paste here and a

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.249
Slightly less gooey paste here

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.479
Smells a little bit like ammonia

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.380
This paste looks like it's full of little metal flecks. I need to do some research and find out. What is inside a battery

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.359
This rod is coming from the negative terminal so this rod clearly goes down into this silvery paste

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:42.559
You know about about the consistency of toothpaste. I'd say maybe a little bit thinner it's like really really compacted

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.349
dirt kind of texture

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.030
metal shell

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.599
There you go guys a c cell battery probably a little bit difficult to fit inside your remote-control car at this point

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.918
Our next method of destruction might not be quite so eventful, but I've always wondered

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.348
what would happen if you just took two 9-volt batteries and

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.098
Plug them into each other and just let them sit. I'm sure you're not supposed to do that

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.710
Let's find out why?

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.399
All right, those are now providing feedback into each other now. I'm just gonna check with the thermometer

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.070
What temperature they're getting to?

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.739
I'll see if they are warming up a little bit of time

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.789
75.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.409
Some part of the battery is a lot warm. That's measuring 85

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.729
There's different temperatures different parts parts of it at about

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.109
80 right now other parts are over 90

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.650
Oh

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.100
Over a hundred Fahrenheit now. That's interesting one of our batteries is considerably warmer than the other

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:53.169
This battery is only measuring at about 85 right now. This battery is measuring in at about a hundred and five

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.250
Serious the gloves do insulate a little bit

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.009
So it's hard to tell for sure

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.070
But I think this one does feel warmer thats warm enough to cook a steak if you like it rare

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.030
Next up. We've got a 20 ton shop press

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.410
So we're gonna see what happens if we put a couple different types of battery under that and just squish 'em

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:29.919
We've made contact now the squishing begins well that circle might just bite right into the battery

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.689
We've got some stuff oozing out good amount of stuff oozing out on the back all right

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:44.929
I think that's about as flat this jack is gonna get it

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:47.659
It's pretty squished

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.019
It actually bounced back a little bit after being squished

00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:58.999
Definitely see some of the innards of it

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.930
Now I've got a C cell battery under here, let's squish that down and see what happens

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.240
It's definitely deforming sideways, so I'm pretty sure it's just gonna pop out in a second

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.619
Or, it's just gonna burst and squirt liquid really far. That was exciting

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.569
Wow. It really is like toothpaste being squeezed out.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.900
It is obliterated; quite, completely obliterated.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.690
This squished C cell battery is

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.999
probably just as broken as the one we cut in half.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:03.029
That really just oozed out there kind of like toothpaste at one point that was fun now for our next type of destruction

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.179
I'm gonna try hitting a few different types of batteries with a blowtorch

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.650
I've got our 9-volt battery a normal double a battery and then I also have a lithium

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:17.370
Double-a battery which does contain lithium and should burn very brightly and possibly with interesting colors

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.640
We'll see if it actually burns through to the lithium well enough to ignite it

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:25.980
Not sure if it'll work or not as you can see I'm also now wearing a jacket and that's just for protection in case something

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:32.189
Burns or shoots hot liquid at me. I just want a little bit more protection. I'm gonna start out with the 9-volt.

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:40.859
I am nervous doing this holding it this close to me. Alright, I was a little too nervous

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:45.990
just holding that battery like that so I've now got the system set up so I can just set the torch on the battery and

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.390
then safely back away. Let's give a shot.

00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:54.279
Got a little glowing orange spot.

00:09:01.199 --> 00:09:05.488
The bottom seems nice and hot, but it doesn't actually look like it's doing too much.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.539
Certainly some flames coming out of it.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.990
Boozing out the back it just seems like the whole batteries kind of on fire

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.670
Alright let's turn that off for a bit.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.649
That's some interesting colors right there.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.839
Sort of a bright, glowing smoke for a second. That was interesting and we got these

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.570
smaller piles inside.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.360
I didn't think this type of battery worked like that.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.920
I think each of these is a one and a half volt battery,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.969
and there's six of them, which gives us our 9-volt battery power

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.060
Let's try it with our other types of battery and see what happens.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.310
Well it's peeling away the wrapper on the battery pretty instantly.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.610
It's starting to leak pretty quick

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:08.060
Much faster reaction than the last one that's for sure. It smells awful too.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.320
Timber!

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.400
Let's try our lithium battery

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.700
Once again, the outside gets destroyed immediately.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.200
Woah!

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.859
I think it lit. Okay!

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:45.498
And now it's. . .  no now it lit. Now it lit.

00:10:45.498 --> 00:10:47.019
That's amazing!

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.010
That's fantastic!

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.620
What even just happened? Look how pink that it is.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.659
It was just. . .  it's magenta colored. It's not a normal fire color.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:09.880
There's still something melting on the back.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.229
I don't know what liquid that is that's boiling and bubbling there.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:22.870
Now I just have like this glowing orange, I don't know it it's like glossy on the outside.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:28.659
Inside these lithium batteries there actually is a strip of lithium metal, and we're gonna see if we can take that out.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.789
That's what's causing the bright magenta flames.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.849
There we go that whole thing so there you have just coils of metal strips inside there,

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.360
and one of those strips is lithium. This whole wad of. . .

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.110
There we go.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.750
This one I believe is not our lithium

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:58.190
I don't know exactly what metal it is probably aluminum, then here inside our plastic. That is a strip of lithium metal

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.040
very lightweight like

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.179
More than aluminum. It feels like. This feels super, super light.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.220
Also tears very easily, it's

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:16.879
really soft. You can see how easily it wrinkles and everything. This is, this feels thicker than aluminum foil.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:23.359
But it's at least as soft. Maybe softer all right. Let's light this little piece of it off

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:33.140
You can see how magenta those flames are and then when it really ignites it gets very bright

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.450
That's melting into our fire brick if I can put another piece of it on top of it

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.700
Yep

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.369
Really bright kind of hurts to look at it so bright

00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:00.889
And it's like the the smoke is being lit up by the heat of it or something. That's pretty crazy

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.280
There you have it

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.789
We just destroyed a whole bunch of batteries in a whole bunch of ways. We stabbed,

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.539
cut, smashed, and burned our batteries to see what happens.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.860
I can't say I really recommend doing this because then you don't have your batteries anymore.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.810
Although burning the lithium batteries did look pretty cool.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:22.339
We found that inside the batteries was a silvery paste and a black clay-like substance.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.740
Cutting the battery in half really let us see the insides pretty well.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.759
A nail driven through a battery caused a lot of leakage and

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.859
I'm sure the batteries don't work at all anymore.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.729
And lighting the batteries on fire had different effects based on what type of battery they were.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:39.800
Regular batteries just sort of burned up and maybe oozed out some of their liquid

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.200
and the lithium battery is popped and then burned a

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.929
Bright magenta color this really satisfied a lot of curiosity

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.440
I've had since I was a child and was told that you had to make sure you don't use damaged or dented batteries

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.980
because it could cause problems. well now, I've seen some of those problems that can happen

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.289
if you take them to an extreme.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.010
I've really enjoyed this random destruction of these batteries. I hope you had a good time

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.799
Thanks for joining us for this video, and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to then.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.370
Franken-battery

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.600
Smells like rotten eggs.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.660
I don't think this one is actually gonna be very exciting. It's just yep. They're ruining each other.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.780
Hey guys! If you are on Twitter, come follow me on Twitter: @thekingofrandom.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.300
It's a great place to connect with me one-on-one.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.100
And that's all I'm going to say about that, because if you want to you will.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.700
And if you don't, you won't.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.590
So I will see you there, or maybe I won't.
