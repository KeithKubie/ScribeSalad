00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.750
Queen Lion is looking to make the elections
in her animal kingdom more fair.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.790
Currently she divides her citizens into ranges
each of which selects one representative to

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.809
go to the jungle council which makes laws
for the kingdom.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.710
But her citizens are unhappy, and it's easy
to see why: the council is full of monkeys.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.839
Of course some of her citizens are monkeys,
but not all of them.

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.630
This council doesn't fairly represent her
kingdom.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.480
Queen lion visits one of the ranges to find
out what's wrong and how to fix it.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.659
In this range there five monkeys, four tigers,
three owls, two lynx and one buffalo.

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.870
One of each runs for representative and all
citizens vote for their own species.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.910
The election rule is that the candidate with
the most votes wins, which is the monkey.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.960
But it's a pretty unsatisfying result considering
that 2/3rds of citizens in this range *aren't*

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.749
monkeys and wouldn't vote for monkeys.

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:50.440
This is the same across all the ranges of
the kingdom, the monkeys have more votes than

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.410
anybody else, so they win all the elections,
even though they are a minority of the total

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.410
population.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.050
Closer inspection reveals that the independent
advisors hired to draw the range boundaries

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.679
in the first place weren't as independent
as they first appeared.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.630
The result is unhappy citizens who don't trust
the jungle council to make the fairest laws

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.320
for all, quite rightly.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.520
Now Queen lion wants to maximize the number
of citizens happy with the election results.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.079
One way to do that is to abolish the ranges
and use a proportional system...

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.840
...But her citizens *want* local representatives.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.110
So Queen lion needs a system that both make
her citizens happier by having a more representative

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.430
council while keeping local elections in place.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.340
After doing a little research she finds out
how: Single Transferable Vote.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.430
The big change with STV is that ranges send
more than one representative, which may seem

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.590
weird, but queen lion decides to test it out:
she takes three ranges which used to each

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.329
send one representative and combines them
into one bigger range that will send three.

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.850
On election day citizens go to the polls and
the results in this new range are just the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.340
same as they were in the old ranges: 34% for
Monkey, 33% for Owl and 33% for Lynx.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.479
But this isn't most votes wins: with STV to
figure out the winners take the total votes

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.390
and divide by the number of representatives
needed, in this case 3 which gives 33% as

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.539
the amount a candidates needs to win.

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.790
So *all three* candidates go to the council
-- which accurately represents the citizens

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.830
in the range.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.420
Whereas under the old system each range would
have sent a monkey.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.940
Leaving 2/3rd of the citizens without representation.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.580
A bigger range with more representatives allows
the range to be more proportional.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.830
This test turned out well, but it was also
as simple as could be -- now Queen Lion wants

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.890
to see what happens in a race where not everyone
is a winner.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.840
The next big range she tests has five candidates
running for office: Gorilla, Tasier, Monkey,

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.280
Tiger, and Lynx, three of which can be representatives.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.580
Election day comes and goes, and here are
the results of citizens first choices:

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.500
Tasier gets 5%
Gorilla gets 28%

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.310
Monkey gets 33%
Tiger gets 21%

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.730
Lynx gets 13%

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.910
As before, a candidate needs 33% to win.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.070
Monkey has that as so is immediately selected
as one of the three representatives.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.830
But no one else reached the winning 33% so
how are the other two representatives selected?

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.790
Step one: get rid of the biggest loser.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.230
Sorry tasier -- you really had no chance at
all.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.970
Now, when the citizens voted, they could have
just put an X next to the candidate they liked

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.500
most but with STV they can also rank their
favorite candidates.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.520
This is important because it shows how the
election would have turned out if one of the

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.030
candidates hadn't run.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.720
Tiny and Worried Tasiers would have voted
for the big calm gorilla without tasier in

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.720
the race.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.050
So if their candidate can't win, they want
their votes to go to Gorilla instead.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.370
This pushes gorilla up to 33% and he become
the next representative.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.220
Ranking allows citizens to support their favorite
candidate without worry -- there's no point

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.730
in strategizing about how everyone else is
going to vote.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.290
The system works to maximize voter happiness
with the result.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.590
Back to the range: there's still one representative
to select, so the next biggest loser is Lynx.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.170
His voters don't like simians, but they do
think tiger's interests are similar to theirs

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.250
and so if Lynx can't win they want him to
have their votes.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.260
Tiger gets reaches 33% and becomes the third
and final representative.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.010
The election result looks pretty good especially
considering citizens first *and* second choices.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.570
Now more citizens have a local representative
they can feel comfortable approaching, whereas

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.480
using the old system, everybody gets a monkey.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.510
Lastly queen lion wants know what happens
in a range with just two political parties.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.079
Under the most-votes-wins systems, multiple
candidates from the same party would be a

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.900
disaster: they'd split their voters and hand
the win to their opposition.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.240
Queen lion makes one last test range with
2/3rd tigers and 1/3 gorillas that as before,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.009
needs three representatives.

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:33.469
Because with STV citizens rank their candidates
there can be more than one candidate running

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.360
at the same time without any problems.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.139
The tigers run two candidates as do the gorillas.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:52.930
White tiger becomes the first representative,
but what happens next?

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.870
While tiger seems to be the biggest loser,
it's also obvious that he would have gotten

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.250
way more votes if white tiger wasn't in the
race.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.819
If a candidate has more votes than they need,
like white tiger does, the first step is to

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.759
give the extra votes to their second choice.

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.689
This gets tiger to 33% and he becomes the
next representative.

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:14.860
If that seems strange, there are two things
to consider:

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.610
1) If instead the extra votes were ignored,
and tiger eliminated then the gorillas would

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.090
get the remaining two wins, which would obviously
not be represent the range.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.740
2) Ignoring these 'extra' votes is punishing
citizens who backed the popular candidate,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.860
which makes voters start thinking about how
everyone else will vote, rather than what

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.090
they really want.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.010
If a candidate gets extra votes in the first
place it also means that those who voted for

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.500
him are a big section of the population and
thus fairly should get more representation.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.909
Right: after the extra votes go to tiger,
the election finishes as before: Silverback

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.970
came in last, is eliminated and his voters'
second choice is the younger candidate so

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.289
gorilla gets in.

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:55.789
And the results are fair.

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.880
Queen Lion has now seen STV work.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.199
Whether a range has one party or lots the
process is still the same:

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.199
1.

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.550
Citizens rank their favorite candidates.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.550
2.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.300
Any candidate above the threshold wins immediately,
3.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.500
'Extra' votes go to their next choice.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.500
4.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.680
If no winner, last place is eliminated, and
the votes to go their next choice.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680
5.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.599
Repeat until all the winners are found.

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.659
This whole this process is designed to maximize
the number of citizens who are happy with

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:21.659
the result.

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.870
This process gives STV has many advantages
over the old, most-votes-wins system:

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.870
1.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.629
Citizens can honestly vote for their favorite
candidate without worrying about what everyone

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:30.669
else is going to do.

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:31.669
2.

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:32.669
It's more proportional.

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.349
So monkeying with the borders matters less.

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:35.349
3.

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:39.190
Almost all citizens will have a local representative
they actually voted for.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.970
In the end Queen lion decides to switch the
council's elections to Single Transferable

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.649
Vote to make a better jungle council for all.
