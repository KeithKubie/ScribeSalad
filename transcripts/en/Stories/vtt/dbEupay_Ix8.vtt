LAURA LING: Every year
professional snowboarder Mike

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.390
Basich hits the road in his
self-made traveling tiny home,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.657
searching for the perfect snow.

00:00:08.657 --> 00:00:11.639
[MUSIC  PLAYING]

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.507
This is cool.

00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:23.367
MIKE BASICH: Oh, is not bad off?

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:23.992
LAURA LING: No.

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:24.990
How long did it take?

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.656
MIKE BASSETT: It took
about three weeks.

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:29.549
LAURA LING: That's really
amazing, three weeks.

00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:31.715
MIKE BASICH: This thing is
going to be so insulated.

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:34.920
It's going to be amazing.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.420
Its 8 by 16.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.250
It's got a 100 square feet.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.230
The structure was built with
some stuff that I already had.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.230
The siding is from one
of the old buildings

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.000
that I took apart.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.950
I had the fireplace already.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.790
The sink, the windows,
all that stuff,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.355
I got out the habitat
for humanity store.

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:55.000
It probably took about
six grand to build

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.390
the whole thing, $2,000 that
was towards the trailer.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.410
And a lot of it was
in the insulation.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.670
It has a water tank, water
heater, fireplace, skylight,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.520
hot plate, bam.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.690
That's how I'm doing it.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.650
LAURA LING: But I notice,
there's no toilet.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.400
MIKE BASICH: Yeah.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.430
There's no toilet.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.210
We have hot water.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.990
We have a water tank.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.420
So it can be pretty
sustainable as far as that.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.500
But the toilet is
an outdoor thing.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.333
LAURA LING: So it's
good that you're a dude.

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.642
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.540
Where have you taken
the tiny house?

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.260
MIKE BASICH: I'm been taking
it all over the place, Texas,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.620
Wyoming, Colorado, Alaska,
Canada, the Bay Area.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.120
The view always changes,
which has been really fun.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.560
You just pull up the side
of road, all of the sudden,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.400
you have lakefront property
in a National Forest.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.270
Next one, you're on a little
creek or out in the desert.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.864
The landscape is just amazing.

00:01:52.864 --> 00:01:54.780
It's like having real
estate that's priceless.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.900
And everybody misses
home at some level.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.726
You're going to get
homesick with this.

00:01:59.726 --> 00:02:03.198
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.729
LAURA LING: You are a
snowboarding pioneer.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.670
You really move
the sport forward.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.510
But you left the
professional life

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.680
to kind of live a pretty
simple life building

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.470
this tiny off this grid cabin.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.210
We were there last year, and
it's absolutely spectacular.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.920
And now you've built
this tiny mobile house.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.960
What is it about building
things with your own hands

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.700
and using things
from nature to do it?

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.950
MIKE BASICH: When you build
something with your hands,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.580
it has some sort of
energy of yourself in it.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.700
And you know, I could buy
an RV, something like that.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.260
But working and
living in wood, it's

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.230
bring something of comfort
and relaxation with that.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.110
[MUSIC  PLAYING]

00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:51.150
LAURA LING: Part of
the thrill for Mike

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.360
is being able to head right
into the heart of a snowstorm.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.850
MIKE BASICH: What I've learned,
the snow is what I'm after,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.530
the softest snow, the deepest
center part of the storm.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.410
And so to be mobile
as the storm is,

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.764
the tiny home has brought me in
depth of the storms experience

00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:09.264
more.

00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:16.090
LAURA LING: People are normally
going in the opposite direction

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.924
of the storm, right?

00:03:16.924 --> 00:03:18.840
MIKE BASICH: And I love
driving the other way,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.560
straight into it.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.940
Because seem that the more you
put yourself into something,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.210
the more you remember
it, the more and feel it.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.927
And I think that's on some
level what I'm coming after.

00:03:28.927 --> 00:03:30.510
LAURA LING: While
he's chasing storms,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.440
Mike is also taking
in some of the most

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.455
breathtaking snowboarding
self-portraits.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.530
I think what's so crazy is
that, well, one, these stunts

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.180
that you do are absolutely
mind blowing but two,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.490
that these are self-portraits.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.230
So you set up these
shoots yourself,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.070
but are actually
taking them yourself.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.760
It's not like there's a
photographer over here shooting

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.570
you, right?

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.820
MIKE BASICH: Yeah.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.310
This has been actually
really fun for me

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.810
to put this together, because
I never got to really put them

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.480
all in front of me at once.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.160
LAURA LING: Were
the risks worth it?

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.060
MIKE BASICH: Yes.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.150
A lot of stuff you
see in photography

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.640
are a small handful of
days out of the whole year.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.540
And so these are
very special moments

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.810
where just the weather's
bright, snow is right.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.209
So you're really testing how
you function under pressure.

00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:23.900
LAURA LING: Mike has also
set up an outdoor gallery

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.200
of his photography.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.389
You just have to be able to make
it down a run to experience it.

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.430
MIKE BASICH: I wanted to
bring art into the woods

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.460
here for an outdoor experience.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.790
Some of these, this
one right here's

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.105
my very first self-portrait.

00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:38.230
LAURA LING: That's so cool.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.770
I've never seen or
experienced anything

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.616
like this, this outdoor
gallery on a run like this.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:44.990
MIKE BASICH: It
keeps progressing

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.240
with what you can do out here.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.388
And that's the part I want to
bring to peoples experience,

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:50.221
something different.

00:04:53.514 --> 00:04:54.930
When you're up at
the top, for me,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.030
it's everything
you work towards,

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.110
and then there's this moment
of like just letting yourself

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.860
fall.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.470
The feeling is
overwhelming, inspiring.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.342
I think someone
can experience it

00:05:06.342 --> 00:05:07.800
whether you're
standing on a bridge

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.430
or on the edge of a cliff
or on a mountain peak.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.470
I think just feeling
small, vulnerable

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.297
is something that is I think
part of that experience

00:05:17.297 --> 00:05:18.380
that I am chasing as well.

00:05:21.236 --> 00:05:23.620
LAURA LING: To see
pro-snowboarder

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.860
amazing off the grid
cabin that he built

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.637
by hand, watch this next video.

00:05:28.637 --> 00:05:30.720
MIKE BASICH: I like to
think of it as getting back

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.810
to the basics of humanity.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.347
I like feeling
connected to the earth.

00:05:37.347 --> 00:05:38.680
