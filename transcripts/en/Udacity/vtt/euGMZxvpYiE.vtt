00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.220
Hi, I'm Kagure Kabue. I'm from Kenya, originally,

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.390
but I live in San Francisco now. I have

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.330
darkly pigmented skin, and I lived in an

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.340
area that had a high prevalence for sickle-cell anemia.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.430
&gt;&gt; Well, we're really happy that you are interviewing with

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.170
us for, for the class today. you get to talk

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.920
to us about two traits in two different lessons for

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.920
us and one of the first traits we learned about

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.280
is skin pigmentation. And that the idea

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.100
that everyone originally, all humans had darkly pigmented

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.910
skin and that then as we migrated out of Africa, we went to various locations.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.350
And because we needed more sunlight in our skin, and melanin was keeping it out,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.020
that many people started getting mutations that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.030
made them lose melanin pigment in their skin.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.123
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:49.123 --> 00:00:51.030
&gt;&gt; so,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.440
the i, you know, the fact that you're from

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.100
Kenya, right brings us back to our ancestral origins.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.290
all humans originated originally in Africa, and there are

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.080
some great fossils, amazing fossils, in Kenya, in particular and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.310
so a lot of human history, really originated in,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.410
in sort of that region. I just wanted, can you

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.310
tell us a little bit about Kenya for those

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.070
of us who never visited or am sorry, should say,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.510
for anybody whose never been to Kenya, what's Kenya like, is it hot, is it.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.710
&gt;&gt; Well, it depends on the region, and so if you're further down at the coast,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.460
well first of all Kenya's in East Africa

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.920
and it's right under the horn of Africa, so

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.860
under Somalia and above Tanzania. And we have

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.790
the Indian Ocean to our East so, if

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.360
you're closer to the coast, it's much hotter,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.840
it's just hot at the coast, especially in January.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.380
and we're right on the equator, the country is actually almost split in half,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.570
by the line, equator line. And if you live up in the highlands, like

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.610
I do, which is on the slopes of Mount Kenya, the temperature doesn't vary much,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.700
so it will only be a few degrees celsius different from morning to evening.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.211
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:14.910
&gt;&gt; And so you can wear a sweater or not if you want, or not.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.835
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.520
&gt;&gt; And it, it's beautiful. You should check out

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.665
the Kenyan government web site for more information, lots of

00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:22.230
[LAUGH]

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.590
Lions and.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.220
&gt;&gt; Ooh, lions?

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.420
&gt;&gt; So if you don't live on the slope, if

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.630
you actually live in, I guess closer to the coast maybe.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.883
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.750
&gt;&gt; how hot does it get there?

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.670
&gt;&gt; I couldn't tell you off the top of my head but, you know, especially

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.370
with the conversion rates but, it gets hot

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.450
enough that you should probably just stay indoors.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.450
&gt;&gt;

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.669
[LAUGH]

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:40.928
Stay indoors?
&gt;&gt;

00:02:40.928 --> 00:02:41.153
[LAUGH]

00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:42.190
Yeah, don't go outside.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.690
&gt;&gt;

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.240
and what about the scenery? You, you moved to San Francisco,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.020
is is it more beautiful in San Francisco or in Kenya?

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.950
&gt;&gt; Each place has it's, you know, it's attractions and some things

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.550
are more beautiful here than they are back home and vice versa.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.990
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.620
&gt;&gt; But, in general, it's just different. It's

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.720
hard to compare the two because it's so different.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.170
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.510
&gt;&gt; San Francisco is a city and it has it's appeal in that way, and where I

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.650
grew up I lived in a town that had a pineapple plantation and that had its

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.730
charm as well, as well as coffee and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.520
waterfalls and all these things. So it's just different.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, do you get to go back and visit?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.860
&gt;&gt; Sometimes.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.250
&gt;&gt; I try and go back once a year, but you know, to get braces, airlines.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.860
&gt;&gt; I was about to say.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.050
&gt;&gt; It's expensive but I'm sure you're family loves that.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880
&gt;&gt;

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.373
[LAUGH]

00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:31.060
&gt;&gt; And I like it too.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.470
&gt;&gt; Right. so, you know, there, there's no stepping around sort of the the, the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.240
obvious issue that people in different continents on the globe have different

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.620
colored skin and that is caused by the different amounts of melanin that they

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.660
have deposited by melanocytes into the, the skin itself. so give us some idea,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.810
you know, in Kenya are most people, do they

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.680
have dark skin, do you they have light skin?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.650
&gt;&gt; I would say most people have dark skin

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.210
because it, I guess it's, is it a sliding scale, what's dark skin and what's not

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.850
dark skin? But most people would probably on

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.310
the and where your skin is considered dark.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.341
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:24.340
&gt;&gt; And that's just how I grew up with everybody

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.360
around me looking like I did with slight variations in shade.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.390
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.560
&gt;&gt; But pretty much.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.990
&gt;&gt; You know, that's interesting that you put it

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.560
like that I mean, you know, I'm someone who's

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.950
lightly pigmented and, and I don't remember exactly when I

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.020
noticed, like people, I grew up in an area

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.730
that was probably about 50%-ish, sort of like, either you

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.470
where either lightly pigmented or you were darkly pigmented.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.180
And I remember I was probably, I don't know, middle

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.080
school when I started realizing, sort of, oh, you know,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.070
we don't have the same color skin. You know when

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.270
you grow up in an area where most people have the

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.490
same color skin. Do you, is there certain age that you're

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.220
sort of notice differences you know, with other people either you

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.640
know, where you were living or even outside where you were living.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.040
&gt;&gt; Well, I had, the advantage or disadvantage of

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.460
going to a, an international school when I was

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.840
younger, and so there were a lot of Europeans

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.540
or people who were both European and African descent.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.980
And, so, I don't know when I first

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.480
realized a difference. I don't remember, except maybe when

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.830
I came here and the absolute opposite was

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.480
happening where I was suddenly the minority. Whereas, where

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.470
I grew up people with lighter skin pigmentation

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.570
were the minority. And so, I don't know, I

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.370
think that was my first time to actually, you

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.870
know, realize, it when I moved here in 2008.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:55.370
That, oh my goodness, this plane is full of people who do not like me. And...

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.600
&gt;&gt; So you moved from a place where you were the majority to a

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.820
place where you were in the minority

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.130
and I think, historically speaking, you know? There's

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.690
a lot of interesting questions in the

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.990
nexus of, you know just the human condition,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.420
and how people treated others with different

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.210
skin colors over time, is you know have

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.610
many courses about that. But in Kenya in particular, is there any I mean how

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.730
do people think of Europeans, let's say or

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.470
in generally people with lightly colored skin overall

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.760
historically? What, what are the? How do

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.780
people put that into the context? How do

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.710
people treat people with different color skins and

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.290
think about that in the context of, history?

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.500
&gt;&gt; Well,

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.720
historically Kenya was colonized by Europeans, last lot being the British.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.310
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.160
&gt;&gt; And so, there is something to say about a European coming

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.370
back into the country. I'm not sure I can't speak for all

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.340
generations and all people, but there are certain attitudes that prevail and

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.350
some which are more dominant in certain generations than in others; for example,

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.390
you'll have people who believe that, a

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.630
European or someone with lighter skin pigmentation is.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.470
&gt;&gt; Mm hm

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.720
&gt;&gt; Meant to be in charge.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.081
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:16.520
&gt;&gt; Because of that history of colonization, and then

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.160
there's the other end of that attitude, where someone else

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.870
might think to themselves, I don't want to see someone

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.370
who looks like that in charge because of the history.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.400
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.280
&gt;&gt; And all the bad things that may have been associated

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.290
with the colonization. And then there's people outside of

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.450
the country who look to a country like Kenya

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.020
and say, we need a European or an outside

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.120
force to act as the face of the country

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.160
to show that it can be run well. Because

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.900
you know there's histories of violence and corruption and

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.040
all these other things in Africa in general. And

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.440
so there's, there's different attitudes, and then I hope, I'd,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.900
I'd hope to say that with the younger generation it doesn't matter as much.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.405
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:07:58.405 --> 00:08:02.050
&gt;&gt; although it's still something that you would notice.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.320
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.410
&gt;&gt; And an education from another

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.550
country is usually considered something of value.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.710
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:15.150
&gt;&gt; but that, that may not be a skin pigmentation thing.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:15.271
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:17.100
&gt;&gt; For example myself getting an education

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.100
here and then going back there would

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.030
hopefully give me a leg up and that's the idea behind it.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.690
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. But then there's also the idea of myself and someone

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:31.930
with lighter skin pigmentation of European descent, having the same education or

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.750
the same exact background as I did, growing up in Kenya, coming

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.539
here, going back there. It's like, who would get the job and why?

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.480
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.550
&gt;&gt; And in that case I, there's the idea of this

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.540
person with lighter skin pigmentation might get that job that

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.000
I'm vying for, because they would act as a better face

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.360
to someone outside the country who might look in and see

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.960
oh, we can use this person to represent what we want.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.850
&gt;&gt; I see. Wow, that's complicated.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.050
&gt;&gt; But that's just one of the things

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.590
that could happen, there's so many, attitudes and so.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.680
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.590
&gt;&gt; Many other things that could or could not happen.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.620
&gt;&gt; Right. It seems that you know skin color's such an easy trade for people

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:10.640
to latch on to, you know.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:10.860
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.960
&gt;&gt; They associate lots of other things with it.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.390
historically I think this is like it's always been

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.300
true Do you think that in general and you

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.780
can speak from your perspective growing up in Kenya

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.780
or even from your experiences in San Francisco. Do

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.290
you think you know your generation or the current

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.930
generations perspective on skin color is different from past

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.840
generations in a, in a, in a better or

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.480
worse way?

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.680
&gt;&gt; I think its, I think it's better, but it's also very complicated because

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:45.580
there's that, sort of, love hate relationship that comes with a, a, country or a

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.930
people who've been, enslaved, or colonized. Where

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.080
you end up either identifying, because you, identify,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.710
you, you connect those two traits, you'll

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.850
connect the, the wealth, and the success to

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:05.030
the skin pigmentation. And so, I hope to think that in a reverse

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.790
situation, where skin pigmentation, someone with

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.670
darker skin pigmentation had colonized a country.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.223
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:10:11.223 --> 00:10:14.110
&gt;&gt; That was full of like, an African person had gone, Shaka

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.680
Zulu went to, I don't know, Britain or something and colonized them.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.060
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.410
&gt;&gt; That the opposite would happen, and

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.070
everyone would be outside trying to tan.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.070
&gt;&gt;

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:21.630
[LAUGH].

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.144
&gt;&gt; And, I know,

00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:22.710
[LAUGH],

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.510
I don't know if that would happen but, you

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.140
know? I like to think that that's how this

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.520
is broken down, it's not because one is better

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.960
or worse than the other. It's just, historically, there has

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.130
been a correlation or a connection between these two

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.480
and so people have tend to identify one with

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.690
success and one with failure. It just happens that

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.690
that's how it went down at this period in history.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.950
&gt;&gt; I

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:49.650
really like that thought experiment. That's

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.720
a really good thought experiment to do.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.890
&gt;&gt; Right. What's, so, even within Kenya, you know growing up, you said

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.880
most people are, have darker skin. You

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.320
know, do people still distinguish, obviously you

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.690
said too it's a spectrum, I mean,

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:05.260
do people still distinguish culturally, you know,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.950
between a really darker skinned person versus

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.590
a maybe not as dark skinned person?

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.520
&gt;&gt; Right. Well, there are, people do because we

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.490
have many tribes in Kenya and certain tribes

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.010
will have certain features that, that are more

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.840
prevalent in their tribe. And if a certain

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.160
tribe has more dark, darker, people who are

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.600
darker, a lot more people who are, have

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.520
darker skin pigmentation, then when you see someone

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.250
else who has that same coloring, you'd think

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.220
to yourself,oh, they must be from that tribe."

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:37.670
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.890
&gt;&gt; And so, that's how,

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.840
which isn't always the case. You can sometimes, you know, want to try

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.310
and find someone who's lighter or darker than you'd expect them to be.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.730
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.030
&gt;&gt; But in general people will use their signifiers to categorize others.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.580
&gt;&gt; That's actually used as an identifier for for purposes.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:53.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:59.410
&gt;&gt; even though there aren't as, you know, There's not as big a difference in

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:06.420
the spectrum between let's say me and you on the color or pigmentation spectrum.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.950
we could be treated very differently as you

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.020
said you know, by different people and different

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.810
cultures or different backgrounds just because of that.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.090
Do people treat people differently in Kenya too, even

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.450
though, maybe there's not as much of a

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.200
difference in skin color or is there still

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.310
that kind of I guess we should say

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.110
discrimination that happens even based on more subtle changes?

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:32.230
&gt;&gt; I would, yes. Sort of. It's not blatant.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.620
I don't think it would be discrimination,

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.860
I think it would be because certain people

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.870
associate these traits with positive things or negative

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.130
things. And so, if I personally thought to

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.760
myself, oh, that person has all these identifiers,

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:52.210
they have lighter skin, pigmentation. They have hair

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:57.330
that's a little bit straighter then I think to myself, oh they must be from the

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.650
North Eastern part of Kenya because they, they

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.680
have Somali blood in them or something like that.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:03.648
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:13:03.648 --> 00:13:06.190
&gt;&gt; And then, then from there after,

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.790
having identified them with a certain tribe

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.450
or a certain group of people then, personally what do I think of those people.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:12.901
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:13:12.901 --> 00:13:14.560
&gt;&gt; And so if I thought to myself, oh I love

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.120
Somali people, then I would try and make friends with that person.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.582
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:13:17.582 --> 00:13:18.260
[LAUGH]

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.380
&gt;&gt; Versus someone else was like, oh I can't stand

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.440
them and then you know, whatever else happens from there on.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.440
&gt;&gt;

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:22.940
[LAUGH]

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:29.190
&gt;&gt; So I don't, it, at that point it depends on what the attitude is.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.790
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.930
&gt;&gt; Of the person, or of the people in

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:36.570
a certain area towards others at that point in time.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.840
&gt;&gt; Sure, and actually that's really interesting that you

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.100
say it like that, I mean when you moved to

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.190
San Francisco, and you see, you know? Okay, now

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:48.290
your part of a, a minority group and, Do people,

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:53.280
you know, use skin color in the same way, as far as signifiers, in, in the San

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.050
Francisco area? I mean, you know? In the

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.510
same way that you say, I mean. Where you're

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.760
from, you can use it as, like, an

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.010
indicator of, you know? Maybe, what region an individual's

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.580
from. Do you find that people do the same

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.900
thing in San Fransico, or do they, or not?

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.410
&gt;&gt; I'm surprisingly oblivious to it.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.410
&gt;&gt;

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:10.086
[LAUGH]

00:14:10.086 --> 00:14:14.301
&gt;&gt; Like, because I think I've grown up being used to not having to think

00:14:14.301 --> 00:14:18.630
about whether I was the only person to look the way I look in a

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.265
room. I tend to do the same thing here, I'll walk in somewhere and think

00:14:23.265 --> 00:14:27.510
to myself, oh why are they looking at me? I must have something in my hair.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.510
&gt;&gt;

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.210
[LAUGH]

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.880
&gt;&gt; Something in my teeth, that I should brushed my teeth well at the house.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.470
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.130
&gt;&gt; I don't think to myself, oh my godness, I'm

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.690
the only person in here that has darker skin pigmentation.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:36.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:41.300
&gt;&gt; And so it takes me awhile, and so I can't I don't know. I have no idea.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:41.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.840
&gt;&gt; Someone else would have to watch.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.530
&gt;&gt; Do you think of skin pigmentation or

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.060
skin color as a positive or a negative trait?

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:53.160
&gt;&gt; I don't think of skin pigmentation as a negative or a positive thing,

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.510
it does have its advantages in some situations. So,

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.020
if you have darker skin pigmentation you've got into

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.880
the sun a lot more then someone who doesn't

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.810
then you're less likely to get cancer, skin cancer.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.950
&gt;&gt; Do you think of skin color, skin pigmentation

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.470
is a positive or a negative trait in anyway?

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:18.380
&gt;&gt; I think skin color can have positives, I

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.610
don't think of it as negative or positive, specifically.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:20.840
&gt;&gt; Mm hm, sure.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.480
&gt;&gt; But I do know that, when I go out in the sun, I have the advantage of

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.880
not burning or, I know that I'm less likely

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.100
to get skin cancer than someone with lighter skin pigmentation.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:34.290
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:39.110
&gt;&gt; But on the other side, I do know that, it, you do need the sun

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.780
in order for your body to produce vitamin D.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.345
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:15:42.345 --> 00:15:45.360
&gt;&gt; And in that case, if you have

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.190
a higher skin, if you have darker skin pigmentation.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:50.220
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.800
&gt;&gt; Then, you're less, you're more likely to

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.100
not have the ability to produce enough vitamin D.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.440
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, and I know that there

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.840
are some people who actually have to take

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.780
vitamin D supplements, or they have to actually

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.468
be told to go out into the sun more.

00:16:03.468 --> 00:16:03.867
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.

00:16:03.867 --> 00:16:04.268
&gt;&gt; To get

00:16:04.268 --> 00:16:05.376
enough sunlight.

00:16:05.376 --> 00:16:05.775
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.

00:16:05.775 --> 00:16:09.210
&gt;&gt; so that they can make enough vitamin D and that's even true for, for

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.690
light skinned people too sometimes who, if you don't get out in the sun enough

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:17.720
you know I believe even on ships when people crossed

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.220
the Atlantic in the 15, 1600s, that, that was the

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.650
thing right. They stayed if, if you didn't get enough

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.860
sunlight, they call it scurvy, right? It's a vitamin D deficiency.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.250
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.250
&gt;&gt; And really, the solution is just get out in the sun more.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.202
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:16:31.202 --> 00:16:34.690
&gt;&gt; What are there any other, is there

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.810
any other positive or negative aspect, do you think,

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:37.890
sorry, I should say this. Do you think

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.180
other people look at skin color or skin pigmentation

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.480
as a positive or negative trait? Maybe not so much

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.250
from the biological side, but from even a social perspective?

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:51.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely. There are people who, who, there are people who

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:56.960
think that their skin pigmentation is a positive thing.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:57.070
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:01.230
&gt;&gt; Or a negative thing. Whereas, if you're ostracised, or you're discriminated

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.400
against, for the color of your skin, then you might to start

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.079
to think that it's a negative thing.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:07.540
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.510
&gt;&gt; Where is if it's helping you in

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.859
life in general, then you'll think it's a positive

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:15.700
thing. So depending on whether you know if I'm

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.440
making it in life, so to speak because of

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.609
the color of my skin, then I'm going to

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.359
be very happy with my skin pigmentation. Versus if,

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.180
it's the thing that's causing other people to react

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.460
negatively towards me and that's a social thing. Then

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.840
I'm going to start to hate the color

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.770
of my skin, which is terrible because it's, it's

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:40.030
a genetic trait that has nothing to do with who I am on the inner inside. So.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I, I completely understand that.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.040
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt;

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:54.140
So as you mentioned, the darkly pigmented people are way less likely to get

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.280
skin cancer, I think the number is,

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.540
like, they're, If you have lighter skin, you're

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.380
500 times more likely to get skin cancer. Do you know anyone from Kenya who

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.350
had skin cancer at all? Just trying

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.070
to see if, reality bears out those statistics.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.730
&gt;&gt; I don't, I don't personally know anyone.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.400
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Is that ever a concern? Did, did

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.770
they, I don't know if they have like, you know,

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.920
in the United States, you know we have

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.900
these people who are like, oh, put sunscreen on

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.530
go outside put sunscreen on make sure you

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.900
put sunscreen on. Do people say that in Kenya?

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:27.215
&gt;&gt; No. I don't hear that too much. sunscreen is also expensive.

00:18:27.215 --> 00:18:28.110
[LAUGH]

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.730
So.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:29.970
&gt;&gt; True.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:32.500
&gt;&gt; I think if it was. I think if people, there were

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.190
more cases of skin cancer, the cost would not be an issue.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.941
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:18:36.941 --> 00:18:42.520
&gt;&gt; But, people just think to themselves, I my grandmother lived without

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.270
it, my mother lived without it, I'll be fine without it probably.

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:51.360
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. In Kenya, is sickle cell anemia a common trait?

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.210
&gt;&gt; I

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.400
don't know how common it is, but I do

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.680
know of people who've had it, or who have it.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what are the symptoms of sickle cell anemia, or what

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.040
was it like for those people that you know of who, who've had it?

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.960
&gt;&gt; It was, something I didn't know

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.610
was happening until they told me themselves.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:08.950
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.460
&gt;&gt; with one person I always thought to myself that she looked a

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.640
little sickly sometimes but I just thought that maybe she had a cold.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.481
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:19:15.481 --> 00:19:18.440
&gt;&gt; But, turns out that she had, or has

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.005
sickle cell anemia.

00:19:19.005 --> 00:19:22.330
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, is it, is it a big

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.570
deal? I mean, does it seriously affect their lives?

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:29.820
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure. I'm not sure if it does. I would imagine it does,

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.130
but she's very private with it, and so I don't know how much it affected her.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:39.320
All in all, she seemed to function normally. You know, she would show up to

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.000
class, and go through everything that we would

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.510
go through and then I'd think to myself,

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.340
oh, she's sick again?

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.930
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Is the new one. no one in your

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.200
family, though, has ever been affected by sickle cell anemia?

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:50.300
&gt;&gt; No.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.260
&gt;&gt; That you know of.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.470
&gt;&gt; No, not in family.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.840
&gt;&gt; Do you know if you're a carrier for sickle cell anemia?

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.420
&gt;&gt; I do know that, and I'm not.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:02.960
&gt;&gt; That's great. does that factor into any people's decisions

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.700
about, you know, children? Do people worry about that having sickle cell anemia?

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.570
&gt;&gt; I

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:12.930
would imagine that in a family where it was common where it

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.180
had been running through the family that they might consider it. But I've

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:21.890
never heard of people getting that test because with some people they know

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.020
it's not. It's more common in some tribes than it is in others.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:25.430
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.270
&gt;&gt; And so I think in a tribe like mine where it

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:34.430
rarely happens, I don't see why, I don't think they'd factor in sickle-cell

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:39.720
anemia or whether they were carriers or not into who they would marry.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.540
&gt;&gt; Do you know of, the treatment for sickle cell anemia,

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.510
I mean, for people who have it in Kenya, is it generally

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.620
accessible, I mean is it, do people know about it, is

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.620
it something that's able to be treated in general for most people?

00:20:54.620 --> 00:21:00.040
&gt;&gt; So, in a country like Kenya with a rural population that may be

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.230
less literate.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.251
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:21:02.251 --> 00:21:04.500
&gt;&gt; They would be less likely to know about treatment

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.660
options than a population that was more urban or more literate.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.261
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:21:10.261 --> 00:21:12.340
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily the same thing, but more literate.

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:12.970
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.890
&gt;&gt; They would know more and would have access

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.345
to treatment, so it depends on the region as well.

00:21:17.345 --> 00:21:21.916
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Kagure, why is sickle-cell anemia en,

00:21:21.916 --> 00:21:24.780
endemic to regions like Kenya in, in Africa.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.392
&gt;&gt; I think

00:21:25.392 --> 00:21:30.594
it's something that developed in order to I think it's

00:21:30.594 --> 00:21:35.796
something that developed as your, your body's response,

00:21:35.796 --> 00:21:40.940
or our body's response to a fight or stave off for malaria.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.020
&gt;&gt; Say say just say to

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.650
resistant to malaria. It exists. Well it exists. It's higher

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.580
on the region because it also provides some resistance to malaria.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:57.130
&gt;&gt; Okay. So it's higher in the region

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.020
because it provides resistance, some resistance to malaria.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.310
&gt;&gt; So, malaria is a common, sickness.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.360
&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.080
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.680
&gt;&gt; I've had malaria, everyone else in my family has had malaria too, so.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.270
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.940
What's it like to have malaria?

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:20.190
&gt;&gt; you, malaria is like the flu. I've never had the flu, but from what people

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.550
describe the flu as, you get dizzy, you

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.540
get nauseous, you get achy joints. when I

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.070
had malaria, I remember being very dizzy, dizzy

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.300
enough that the floor seemed very far away

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:36.280
and like it was teetering. And you're just kind of out of it, you get a

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.630
fever, the usual.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.650
&gt;&gt; And how does the, I mean how does

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:44.200
malaria spread. We'll wrap up by our conversation of skin

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.930
pigmentation, and what I want to do is just give

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.670
you an opportunity to, to tell us anything you might

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.560
want to share, you know a lot of people have,

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.080
a lot of people think differently about skin color. Some

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.890
people it's a big deal, other people it's not a

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:02.010
big deal. If you could give advice or just say

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:06.630
anything speaking to that idea in people about whether or not skin color's a

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.610
big deal or not. what would you say or what advice would you give?

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:15.820
&gt;&gt; I think the advice I'd give is that it

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.890
shouldn't matter. It would be naive of me to say

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.520
that you should ignore it because others are not ignoring

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:27.120
it, and so you should be aware of how others will

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.780
treat you but all in all it doesn't,

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.920
it shouldn't change who, it doesn't change who you

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.960
are on the inside, it's. A genetic trait that

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.560
simply dictates what the color of your skin, and

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.610
so, after that, it may have it's biological advantages

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.810
or disadvantages. But in the end, it doesn't, it

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.970
doesn't, your skin color is not your ethnicity, it

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.010
isn't your race. Race is a social construct and

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:57.650
so, it doesn't change who you are on the inside. It really

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:02.340
shouldn't matter and it would be great to say that it doesn't matter,

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.170
but to some it does. My advice would be to be you, be

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:11.150
who you are. I mean, nobody, nobody cares to be who you are.
