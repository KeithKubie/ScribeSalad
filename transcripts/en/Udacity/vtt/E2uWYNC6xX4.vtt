00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.873
Well, just like in the serial code we're going to have 64 multiplications to perform,

00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:08.083
but now we can perform all of these multiplications in parallel.

00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:10.848
It's going to take 10 nanoseconds.

00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:14.249
This is a good example of the throughput versus latency debate.

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:19.023
The latency of each operation is certainly longer than what we saw in the CPU case.

00:00:19.023 --> 00:00:21.158
But because we can do them in parallel,

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:25.000
we both complete faster and have a higher throughput.
