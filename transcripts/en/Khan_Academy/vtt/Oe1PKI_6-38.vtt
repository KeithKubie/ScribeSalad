00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.990
Add, and they give us 5x squared
plus 8x minus 3 plus 2x squared

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.420
minus 7x plus 13x.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.292
So we can really view this as
just adding two polynomials.

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:12.750
And actually, the
second polynomial

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.300
here can be simplified
right off the bat.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.310
We have two like terms here.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.534
It's not the 2x squared.

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:21.700
There's no other 2x squared
term in this polynomial.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.770
But you have a negative 7x term.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.690
And then you have a plus 13x.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.030
So we could actually
add these two terms.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.310
What is the negative
7 of something

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.700
plus 13 of that something?

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.880
Or another way to view
it, what's 13x minus 7x?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.577
13 of something minus
7 of that something?

00:00:37.577 --> 00:00:39.660
Well, that's just going
to be 6 of that something.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.610
So that is just going to be 6x.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.140
And then you have
your 2x squared.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.920
And you have your 2x
squared right over here.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.950
Let me write it.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.874
So 2x squared.

00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:51.290
So this polynomial
right over here

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.210
simplifies to 2x
squared plus 6x.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.380
And then we want to add it
to this polynomial right

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.880
over here.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.790
And what we can do
is, what I like to do

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.010
is just rewrite this polynomial
under this polynomial.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.450
And I'm going to align
the similar terms

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.325
or the like terms,
the terms that

00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:09.030
have the same variable
raised to the same power.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.340
So we have x raised
to the second power.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.910
So let's put the 5x
squared over here.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.900
We have an x raised
to the first power.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.660
We have an x raised
to the first power.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.320
So let's put the 8x over here.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.740
And then we don't
have a constant term

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.230
in this yellow polynomial.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.750
We don't have anything
raised to the zeroth power,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.541
any constant terms.

00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:29.650
We do here.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.690
So let's just put a minus 3.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.920
And then we could add
these two things up.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.700
We have 2x squared
plus 5x squared.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.470
That is 2 of something
plus 5 of something

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.440
is 7 of that something.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.740
So it's going to be 7x squared.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.610
And then to that,
if I 6 of something

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.910
and I add 8 of that
something to it,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.010
well, I'm going to have
14 of that something.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.620
If I have 6x's and I give
you 8 more x's, you're going

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.931
to 14x's.

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:56.180
And then we have nothing here.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.060
And so if we just add
nothing to negative 3,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.970
you're just going
to get a negative 3.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.950
So this simplifies to, or when
we added these two polynomials,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.390
we get 7x squared
plus 14x minus 3.
