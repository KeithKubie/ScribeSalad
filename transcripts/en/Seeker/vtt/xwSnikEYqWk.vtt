00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.710
The Federal Government owns 640 million acres
of land, but does federal land benefit the

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.980
people or hurt us?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.330
If you've been near media of any kind you've
probably heard about a group of men who've

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.990
seized Federal Land in Oregon as part of a
larger protest of government-owned land and

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.710
whether it benefits We The People.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.949
Well, according to the nonpartisan Congressional
Research Service, federal land serves as an

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.960
opportunity for settlement and economic development,
and [provides] a source of revenue for schools,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.880
transportation, national defense… and so
on, but is that true?

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.700
Overall, the United States government owns
28 percent of all land in the 50 states, more-so

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.720
out West.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.080
In Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico
and all points west, the US government may

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.020
own as much as 85 percent of ALL THE LAND
in a state.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.460
And the management of all that land falls
under four federal agencies.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.950
The U.S. Forest Service ensures forests and
grasslands won't be exploited.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.870
The National Park Service manages more than
400 of America’s natural jewels, like Yellowstone,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.360
Big Sky or Joshua Tree.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.960
The Fish and Wildlife Service enforces wildlife
laws in the 560 national refuges, and restores

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.720
fisheries, protects wetlands and migratory
paths.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.290
And finally, the Bureau of Land Management
pretty much does everything else.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.450
They manage recreation, timber harvesting,
wildlife conservation, mining claims, and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.450
on and on.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.700
And all this land isn't just for animals to
poop on.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.990
It has ECONOMIC benefit too.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.070
Refuges create local jobs, attract visitors,
and generate tax revenue.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.430
The National Wildlife Refuge Association found
wildlife refuges produce an annual economic

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.090
output of 2.4 billion dollars.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.390
And they're not alone, in 2014 the National
Park Service's annual report showed a direct

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.280
impact of 277 thousand jobs in and around
parks with 29.7 billion dollars in economic

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.280
output.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.780
On top of that, the BLM, charges for ranchers
to graze on public land.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.409
Though they don't make money directly, they
do subsidize cattle prices as the government

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.530
charges 93 percent less for their grazing
than private landowners.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.229
Plus, federal land is used for coal, oil,
natural gas and wealth mineral extraction,

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.259
as well as for renewable energy; generating
billions of dollars for local governments

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.790
and making up 2.6 percent of the whole US
economy.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.710
Of course, there are obvious benefits to human
livelihood and happiness as well.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.590
A 2015 study in Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, found walking in the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.930
woods reduces depression.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.480
A 2008 study in Psychological Science found
interacting with nature provides a mental

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.680
break for our attention functions increasing
attention abilities and refreshing top-down

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.680
mental tasks.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.570
And, obviously, we're not the only animals
who benefit.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.430
In a 2016 report, The Fish &amp; Wildlife Service
not only show how refuges help migrating birds

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.260
AND provide cycling and hiking for Americans,
but they also announce the Delmarva Fox Squirrel's

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.430
removal from the endangered species list,
and gush over the delisting or downlisting

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.890
of species including the first fish to ever
be delisted -- the cute little Oregon chub.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.569
From the data it's pretty obvious that federal
lands can benefit us all.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.989
The natural beauty and wildlife of this country
are just as much a power of our nation as

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.390
our politics, economy and national culture
-- and indeed they're intricately connected.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.410
America wouldn't be "the beautiful" with "mountains
majesty", or "pine-clad hills" without federally

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.849
protected lands and wildlife refuges.

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:49.930
From sea to shining sea.
