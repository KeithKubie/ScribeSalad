00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.035
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:06.910
SCOTT: Welcome, Joel.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.201
JOEL GAMORAN: Thank you, Scott.

00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:10.750
Thanks, guys.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.820
I'm so excited to be here.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.280
I've heard like-- there's
all this lore, when you don't

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.620
work at Google, about Google.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.620
Like what's the campus like,
what are the people like?

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.620
And I'm kind of blown away.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.830
It's really amazing.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.230
And I have a total
nervousness just going

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.272
to college and stuff,
being in a group,

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:29.480
and a teacher calling on you.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.590
So I won't call on you, but
I will ask for volunteers

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.269
because it's more fun to cook
with someone and not alone.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.810
A little bit about
how I got started.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.390
So at Sur la Table,
we teach classes

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.720
across the country
in 85 locations.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.170
And I was in a class, and I
was looking in someone's trash

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.860
bowl.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.140
And it was overfilled
with, like,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.530
shrimp shells, cucumber
seeds, all these things

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.870
that, as a chef,
you're taught to save.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.700
In the restaurant
industry there's

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.610
almost no profit margin,
literally very difficult.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.390
So every ingredient
can make you money,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.680
and you are taught
to not throw it away.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.994
But as home cooks, we were
never really taught that.

00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:10.660
I mean, raise your
hand if you guys have

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.900
like a grandma or a grandpa
or a great grandma and grandpa

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.980
who saved everything.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.060
Raise your hand.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.630
Most of us, right?

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.130
Sorry.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.840
I'm loud already.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.020
But most of us have that.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.340
So we have this skill, maybe
from the Depression time,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.570
where we saved everything.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.410
But now, because food is
so easy and so accessible,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.580
we kind of lost that.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.890
And I realized that
and realize that we're

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.640
throwing away like $1,500
each every year in food waste.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.780
It adds up to
about $119 billion.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.330
Food waste is the
number one cause

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.980
right now to global warming.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.460
It is the number one thing in
our dumps and in our landfills.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.660
So when you dug into
this, it kind of was nuts.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.730
And so I teamed up
with Katie Couric.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.650
She's the executive
producer of the show.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.401
Has anyone seen the show?

00:01:58.401 --> 00:01:58.900
yeah?

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.483
Couple people?

00:01:59.483 --> 00:02:00.340
Yeah, OK.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.060
The show is me in my van.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.352
This is Pippi, the red van.

00:02:06.352 --> 00:02:07.810
Her name is Pippi
because she's red

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.840
and she has freckles
like Pippi Longstocking.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.380
But Pippi was a piece of trash.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.170
She was in a farm for like 50
years untouched, scrap metal.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.000
And we turned her
into a kitchen,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.500
and we drove her
across the country.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.570
And each episode-- it's on A&amp;E--

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.600
I meet up with different chefs
and we put on this amazing meal

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.530
for locals, shocking them
that the food on their plate

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.290
was food that we'd
normally see as trash.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.760
So that's what
the show is about.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.530
And Pippi represents
the movement,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.390
represents this
idea that there's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.090
so much potential
in these ingredients

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.560
that we're throwing away, right?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.230
Like this is carrot tops.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.290
I'm calling it right now,
parsley of 2019 right here.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.690
This is the next hot herb.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.060
You're going to see
this all the time.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.790
And it's been around forever.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.050
So I hope you guys get
a little inspired today.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.120
We're going to whip
up a couple of recipes

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.880
starting with Pappa Pomodoro.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.540
What the heck is that?

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.400
Anyone know?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.020
Pappa Pomodoro.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.500
No one knows?

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.000
OK.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.444
So what did you say?

00:03:11.444 --> 00:03:12.610
AUDIENCE: Pomodoro's tomato.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.700
JOEL GAMORAN: You
go tomatoes, baby.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.200
I love it.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.530
Pappa, in this idea,
is a bread soup.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.050
Super humble recipe
using really stale bread.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.990
Who's thrown away
stale bread before?

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.570
I know.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.190
It's like Scraps
Anonymous today.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.950
OK, we all have
thrown away stuff.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.340
So stale bread is absolutely
delicious you can make things

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.662
like bread crumbs with it.

00:03:34.662 --> 00:03:35.620
There's amazing things.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.080
For this recipe, it
thickens the soup

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.480
and almost gives it
this creamy texture that

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.179
is so addictive, so incredible.

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:44.470
So we're going to whip this up.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.040
Who is willing to come cook
with me on this recipe?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.860
Yes, come on up.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.359
Come on up.

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:50.310
Yeah, give it up.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.601
Oh, yeah, we'll start with you.

00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:52.640
What's your name?

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.140
BRIA: Bria.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.690
JOEL GAMORAN: Give
it up for Bria.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.640
Takes guts coming up
here to cook with me.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.240
OK.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.530
So we've got a medium high pan,
or a pan on medium high heat.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.290
So like out of 10,
this is like a six.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.980
Cool?

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.704
So we're going to cut up
some garlic and some chili.

00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:10.120
And I've got a
cool trick for you.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.674
What's the spicy part
of a chili, Bria?

00:04:12.674 --> 00:04:13.340
BRIA: The seeds.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.340
JOEL GAMORAN: The seeds.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.899
So if you grab a chile-- and
feel free to stand around here.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:17.980
I'm cash.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.200
So if you guys can't
see, let me know.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.670
But you can take your
chile and roll it like this

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.210
and cut off the
bottom, and shake.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.580
This one doesn't have a lot.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.120
That's good.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.710
This will be a non-spicy one.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.852
But all the seeds will come out.

00:04:34.852 --> 00:04:37.060
So if you roll them, it kind
of loosens it up, right?

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.934
So why don't you try?

00:04:37.934 --> 00:04:39.760
Roll this guy, give it a shot.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.090
Now while you're doing that,
I've got some olive oil.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.460
And we've got tons of tomatoes.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.750
Now on the tomatoes, they
come with their tops.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.970
We all throw this away.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.950
Smell this, Bria.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.590
It smells like the farm.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.150
Like it smells like
a fresh tomato.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.620
These tops are unbelievable
infused in what you're cooking.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.230
You can make butter with
these tops, like melt butter,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.360
put the tops in and
take them out later,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.790
and you have this tomato
butter that's unbelievable.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.910
You can soak them in
teas, in your gazpachos.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.618
But today we're going
to kind of use them

00:05:15.618 --> 00:05:18.290
as like a flavor boost,
like a bomb in this, Cool?

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.300
So we've got some
chili, and the way

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.370
we're going to
chop this is we're

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.180
just going to slice it thin.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.100
90% of people--

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.880
Bria, show me how you
hold the knife at home.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.657
Yes.

00:05:30.657 --> 00:05:31.490
You're all laughing.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.730
You know you hold it wrong.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.230
Show me.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.750
How would you chop that?

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.830
OK.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.472
No more.

00:05:37.472 --> 00:05:38.930
I want you to keep
all your digits.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.880
Yes.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.936
So most people hold
their knife like Bria

00:05:42.936 --> 00:05:44.060
did, and it's totally cool.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.970
Some people do this.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.270
Anyone do this?

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.669
My mom does this
with the finger.

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.210
I don't know what
the finger's about.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.290
But the right way to hold your
knife is to pinch the blade

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.270
and wrap your fingers
around the bottom.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.490
It feels horrible
for like three weeks.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.880
But then you get used to it, and
you have so much more leverage,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.680
you have so much more
power, so much more control.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.617
And your knife cuts
will be more even,

00:06:08.617 --> 00:06:10.700
which is really important
in cooking so everything

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.200
cooks at the same time.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.770
Cool?

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.990
So I'll let you chop
up that other chile.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.640
Go for it.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.039
Yeah, just kind
of pinch the top.

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.330
Yeah, just kind of pinch it
and tuck your fingers back.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.871
There you go.

00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:21.600
Yeah, perfect.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.100
All right.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.450
So you got chile.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.960
I got a little bit of olive oil.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.830
I'm going to put it in the
pan, enough to kind of coat.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.710
Cool.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.160
And then I've got some garlic.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.880
And in Italy they
slice their garlic.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.500
It's more like this as
opposed to chopping it fine

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.430
or using the garlic press.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.340
So slicing it is kind
of like a kiss of garlic

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.180
instead of like a
huge kind of mouth

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.260
full of it, which is
nice if you actually

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.330
are going to kiss someone
after this recipe.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.870
So it's kind of more of a touch.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.370
All right.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.360
So we've got our chiles,
we've got our garlic.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.776
Now what I'll have you do,
Bria, is grab all these things.

00:06:55.776 --> 00:06:57.520
Do we have a bench
scraper in the house?

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.560
I totally forgot to ask for it.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.274
Cool.

00:07:02.274 --> 00:07:03.440
We're going to go like this.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.648
And then you're going to
add all of these ingredients

00:07:05.648 --> 00:07:06.310
to that oil.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.300
Thank you.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.400
By the way, if you
don't have one of these,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.830
get one because everyone
uses their knife

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.890
and scoops up their ingredients,
and your knives go dull.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.100
This saves your knife.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.670
It's also good for
smashing garlic, chopping

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.850
dough, all that stuff.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.990
So if you want a scoop that
up right into the hot oil.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.360
Are you guys with me so far?

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.890
Are we having fun?

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:27.760
We're learning.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.741
You guys are about to smell
some beautifulness right now.

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:31.240
Awesome.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.600
So we've got garlic, we've
got a little bit of chile.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.970
Everyone in the pool.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.300
And then I've got some onion.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.610
Now when you cut an
onion, how do you not

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.250
cry from cutting an onion?

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.900
Sharp knife really,
really helps.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.530
Nice job.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.040
A lot of people don't know that.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.950
And you're going to
stay there, Bria,

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.310
and make sure we don't burn.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:49.810
All right?

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.400
You can turn it
down if you need to.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.080
Sharp knife helps but--

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.460
AUDIENCE: Don't
cut off the root.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.330
JOEL GAMORAN: Don't
cut off the root?

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.010
I've never heard
that one before.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.570
There's all these like crazy--

00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:59.920
my grandma is like, freeze it.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.630
I'm like, how do you
chop a frozen onion?

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.809
I have also heard hold a
match in your left hand.

00:08:06.809 --> 00:08:08.350
I'm like, what are
you talking about?

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.020
So the right way to
not cry from an onion

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.475
is when you chop into an
onion, the gases from the onion

00:08:15.475 --> 00:08:17.360
kind of rise to the top.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.050
So they kind of just go
up towards the ceiling,

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.690
and they're attracted
to anything wet.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.860
Our eyes are wet.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:29.500
So if you put a little
wet napkin in your mouth,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.789
you look ridiculous, but it
will be attracted to the napkin

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.456
before your eyes and
make a huge difference.

00:08:36.456 --> 00:08:38.289
So that's just a little
something something.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:43.030
Now onion peels, by
the way, delicious.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.625
I make an onion peel batter
fried pickle in the book.

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:49.000
And I've been cooking this
across the country on the book

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.720
tour.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.060
People are losing their
minds around onion peels.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.710
You can put them in
your chicken stocks

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.060
and then fish them out later.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.840
But onion peels have so much
flavor and they're amazing.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.430
So I got a little onion.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.290
I'm just going to chop this up.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.050
When you chop onion
and you get halfway,

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.350
just turn the onion
over so you don't have

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.200
to get awkward with your hands.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.920
How we Doing We looking good?

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.420
All right.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:16.870
So we have onion, we've got
garlic, we've got chile.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.730
Everyone in.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.710
Beautiful.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.220
Now big pinch of salt. How
would you salt this, Bria?

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.240
That was not a bad
salt. I'm impressed.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.500
So the right way to salt is
three fingers and a thumb,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.500
always.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.670
I like kosher salt
because you can feel it.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.170
And always from up high so
the salt spreads, right?

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.200
So that's why you see
chefs do that on TV.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.030
It's not just because we look
cool, although we do look cool.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.010
But it absolutely
makes a difference.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:54.180
So we've got that
going, smelling amazing.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.600
We're all with me so far.?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.090
So far can everyone
do this at home?

00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.520
It's not too crazy.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.320
Just add a little
different type of heat,

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.640
a little pinch of chile.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.280
Save it from the next
time you order pizza.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.380
That's scrappy.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.890
And then our tomato tops.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:10.390
Cool?

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.730
So I just want to show
you guys what to do.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:17.550
Let's say you have even
these onion peels or mushroom

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.440
bottoms, or anything
that you have

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.600
that's not edible but
can give you flavor.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.020
I actually like to wrap
up butternut squash,

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.552
like outside, the shell
of butternut squash.

00:10:27.552 --> 00:10:29.760
So what you can do is wrap
it up in a little package.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.110
You want to do this, Bria?

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.100
So just wrap that up.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.300
This is cheesecloth.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.620
You can buy it Sur la Table.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.664
You can buy it on Amazon.

00:10:35.664 --> 00:10:36.330
It's everywhere.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.770
It's cheap as chips.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.810
Wrap it up in a little bundle.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.410
And that way you can throw it
in like a little tea infuser.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.149
I like to call it a flavor bomb.

00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:47.190
And it's going to just
kind of enrich everything,

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.030
and again, give that tomato
vibe all the way through.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.980
So this looks awesome.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.660
Tomatoes in.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.970
If you ever go to the
market--and I know tomatoes are

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:58.500
just getting out of season--

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.910
but ask for seconds.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.598
What are seconds?

00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:04.510
Yeah, imperfect.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.200
They're always under the
table at the farmer's market,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.670
even at Whole Foods.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.250
They have these tomatoes that
are busted, they're open,

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.660
they can't sell them.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.180
For something like
this or a tomato sauce,

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.280
it's genius because they're
bursting with sugar,

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.710
they're bursting with juice.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.350
That is prime time tomatoes,
and they'll give it to you

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.550
for much, much reduced price.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:25.050
All right.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.220
So stir that in, my dear.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.390
You got it?

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.350
Now we're going to throw
in our flavor bomb.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.440
And them-- yes.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.940
AUDIENCE: Can you
reuse cheesecloth,

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.540
or do you throw it away?

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.290
JOEL GAMORAN: You can
absolutely reuse it.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.700
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.210
Yeah.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.760
I've never done it, but
you can absolutely do it.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.400
I will start reusing
my cheesecloth.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:50.280
So undisputed King, of
cheeses, Parmesan cheese.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.950
This, a muu muu, and a rom com,
I'm pretty much good for life.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.450
OK?

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.250
I will eat this like
a piece of cake.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:00.790
I love Parmesan cheese, and I
love every bit of the Parmesan

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.290
cheese.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.940
But we all throw away
the outside, the rind.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.460
The rind you're starting
to see in specialty stores

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.320
now sold separately
from the cheese.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.500
This stuff, just smell it.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.000
This is like--

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.140
I just got chills.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.700
This is umame, you guys.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:19.350
This makes food taste rich.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.180
This makes food taste filling.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.510
This gives it layer.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.850
And so Parmesan cheese just
tossed in with a pot of beans,

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.240
or while you're boiling pasta,
or in this case, some soup--

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.860
just toss it right in--

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.030
unbelievably good.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.220
You can take it out
later, gnaw on it.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.300
You'll be fine.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.820
Or you can fry it
after you use it,

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.020
and it gets puffy, like a
chicharon, like a cracker.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.950
Dude, that's where
half of this came from.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:45.780
OK?

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.740
Really, really good.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:47.640
Give it up for Bria.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.260
Thank you very much.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.229
Thanks, buddy.

00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:52.020
So we're going to turn
our heat up, kind of

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.180
get these tomatoes going.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.460
And then we don't
add the bread yet.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.220
The bread is going to
happen kind of later.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.350
Another great thing you
can do with this is we're

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.030
going to add basil at the end.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.630
And basil stems, and the
stems of a lot of herbs,

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.640
hold so much love in them.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.470
So I want to show you
guys a quick little thing.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.800
Who wants to help me
with this next recipe?

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.670
Come on up.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.740
Give it up, bro.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.120
I love it.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.070
So I am kind of tired
of the same old,

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.010
you know, I got invited
over to someone's house

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.380
and I want to bring
over a bottle of wine.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.132
I want to bring over
something different.

00:13:30.132 --> 00:13:32.340
I want to bring over something
maybe a little bit out

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:32.860
of the box.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.150
So I'm going to teach you guys
how to make a flavored salt.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.740
OK?

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.870
You can put this in a cute
jar, give it away to someone.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:44.970
But really, this is so
good for your cooking.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.670
So turn this guy up even more.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:48.210
Let's see.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.830
We've got lemon basil here.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.990
Isn't that right, Elizabeth?

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.240
From Google gardens.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.430
You guys grew this.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.780
This is unbelievably good.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.460
So let's say you
have basil at home.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:00.960
Come on in.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.350
What's your name?

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.957
TARIK: Tarik.

00:14:01.957 --> 00:14:02.790
JOEL GAMORAN: Tarik.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.498
Good to meet you.

00:14:03.498 --> 00:14:04.350
Come on over.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.710
So Tarik, let's say you're at
home, and you had a recipe.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.160
Maybe it was a salad
that called for basil.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.800
So you take it off the stem
and you're left with the stem.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.484
I mean, the m--

00:14:14.484 --> 00:14:15.900
put this under a
pillow and you're

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.070
going to sleep really well.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.080
I mean, this is
beautifully smell.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.050
But we're going to
use it to make a salt.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.790
So the leaves we'll save
for a different time.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.530
But that's the part that
would always be saved.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:33.080
And then I've got an old
school pestle and mortar.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.420
So Tarik, what I'm
going to have you do

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.190
is I'm going to have
you take these stems.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.980
I'm just going to
kind of chop them up.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.430
And you can do this with
mint stems, parsley stems,

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.919
cilantro stems, basil
stems, whatever you got,

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:47.210
I want you to go to town, baby.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.790
Take a little stress out.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.707
Yeah.

00:14:50.707 --> 00:14:51.790
TARIK: Yeah, I'm doing it.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.331
JOEL GAMORAN: I know
you're doing it.

00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:54.840
Get in there, move it around.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.360
Yeah.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.110
Bend your knees.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.240
Yeah, go, baby.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.520
There you go.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.180
Beautiful.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:02.720
That's good.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.890
So just so everyone can
see, it's just pulverized.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.170
It's just this paste.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.030
Smells ungodly.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.440
I mean, ungodly.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.470
We could bottle
that and sell it.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.410
Chunky salt. So this is
different than kosher salt.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.680
So you guys can see big,
giant flakes, right?

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.670
This is maldon salt, sea
salt. Look for these.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.900
I'm going to add, for every
tablespoon of crushed herbs,

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.764
I'm going to add a 1/2 a cup
of salt. It's a lot of salt.

00:15:34.764 --> 00:15:35.680
I called your doctors.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.610
You guys will be [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.090
So what I want you to do
now, Tarik, is just keep,

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.500
but more kind of rub it.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.630
Go for it, yeah.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:44.739
Get in there, yeah.

00:15:44.739 --> 00:15:45.280
Look at this.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.840
He gets into it.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.380
Really.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.700
He's more passionate than I am.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.090
I love it.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.250
So as he's doing this,
as Tarik's doing this--

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.750
and you can kind
of confirm, Tarik--

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.890
the salt is turning colors.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.557
The salt is becoming what?

00:15:58.557 --> 00:15:59.140
BRIA: Greener.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.056
JOEL GAMORAN: Greener.

00:16:00.056 --> 00:16:03.590
And it's picking up all
the oils from those stems.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.630
So now I just want you
guys to be able to see.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.494
Dude, you did amazing.

00:16:07.494 --> 00:16:08.410
Let me just feel this.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.980
My god.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.170
Unbelievable.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.480
Look at this.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.880
What was once-- yeah, good save.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.400
What was once
totally trash is now

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:23.410
this stunning, floral, beautiful
salt. And you smell this,

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:24.750
and we'll pass it around.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.190
But this in a jar, this
over a piece of fish, this

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.400
to finish a salad, this
as a little garnish

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.830
over the top of
the soup, genius.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.330
And such a nice gift.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.640
If you really care
about the stems, Tarik,

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.080
you're going to hold this.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.050
I'm going to just hold it
right over that parchment.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.690
You just pour it
in and shake it.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:44.200
Yep.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.741
And it catches all
the stems for you.

00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:47.860
If you really want
like a perfect salt--

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.230
I like all the stems,
but totally up to you.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.321
Where's my little bowl?

00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:53.570
So I want to pass this around.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.220
Look at this.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:54.950
Is that awesome?

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.030
You can do mint sugar.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.020
You don't have to do
salt. That's perfect.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:03.610
So just so everyone can see,
you can gather everything up.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.940
In they goes, and the
most beautiful stem cell.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.755
Yes.

00:17:07.755 --> 00:17:09.130
AUDIENCE: How well
does it store?

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.930
JOEL GAMORAN: This
will never go bad,

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.390
because none of the
herb that's in here,

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.579
it will go dry just
like dry herbs.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.599
So there's nothing in
here that will go bad.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.990
It might lose its flavor
after about two years,

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.819
but absolutely beautiful.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:22.750
Give it up for Tarik.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.310
Nice job.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.770
I'm going to pass this around.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.900
You guys into that recipe?

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.130
It's pretty crazy, right?

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.150
It's kind of fun.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.270
Any questions so far?

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.570
Nothing?

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.110
Come on, give me something.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.800
Yeah.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.614
AUDIENCE: So like
herbs, or onion peels,

00:17:40.614 --> 00:17:41.530
those kinds of things?

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.760
JOEL GAMORAN: Great question.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.550
Great question.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.360
So the question
was is when you're

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.925
cooking at home, what do
you do when you don't know

00:17:48.925 --> 00:17:50.050
what to do with this stuff?

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.900
You're just trying
to make dinner.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.810
And the last thing you want
to worry about is this.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:55.890
Right?

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.160
Totally agree with that.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.150
So what I do is I always have a
bowl, in this case a glass one.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.989
But I always have a ball
for my scraps on my counter.

00:18:02.989 --> 00:18:04.530
Always you're going
to go to the ball

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.270
first because it's
right near you,

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.910
as opposed you don't want to
have the trash can nearby.

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.510
Then I get a piece of paper,
and I kind of do it in half,

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.250
and I put it on the bowl.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.960
So I can kind of
divide the ball up

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.770
between like savory scraps,
like herbs and onion peels

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.860
and things like that.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:25.950
Maybe there's protein scraps,
things like chicken or beef fat

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.690
or those little
things I want to save.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.310
So they kind of stay separate.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.140
Then I cook dinner.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.480
At the end of dinner I put
them in a little Ziploc bags,

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.730
and I make best friends
with the freezer, guys.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.274
The freezer is your friend
when it comes to scraps.

00:18:38.274 --> 00:18:39.690
The last thing you
should be doing

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.930
is thinking about I
gotta use this today.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.040
You totally don't.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.980
That will stay good in the
freezer for six to nine months.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.220
You'll be totally fine.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.554
So just make sure you save them.

00:18:49.554 --> 00:18:51.594
And then it's going to be
like a Wednesday night,

00:18:51.594 --> 00:18:53.487
and you're going to be
like, what do I cook?

00:18:53.487 --> 00:18:54.570
I don't know what to make.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.111
And you're going to
open your freezer

00:18:56.111 --> 00:18:58.722
and there's going to be a
treasure trove of things.

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.430
So that's kind of the
goal with all this.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.240
Really good question.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.070
Anything else?

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.670
Cool.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.060
All right, well, our
tomato is blipping away.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.680
You'll notice I didn't add
any water to this, no chicken

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.180
stock.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.770
I just kind of want to
make sure everyone can see.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.520
Isn't that beautiful?

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.230
And when tomatoes
aren't in season,

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.620
you can absolutely used canned
tomatoes for this recipe.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.820
It will work totally fine.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.620
So we're going to let that hang.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:30.850
But before we do, we've
got our stale bread.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.110
This is bread soup.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.990
So this is where I
would add my bread.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.380
And normally I would let this
go for like 20 more minutes

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.322
and really let those
tomatoes break down.

00:19:38.322 --> 00:19:40.030
But just in the interest
of Google time--

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.236
you guys have meetings
and places to go--

00:19:42.236 --> 00:19:44.110
we're going to put the
bread in and just kind

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.800
of let it soak up.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.560
Now, why is it
important, do you guys

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.660
think, to season a soup
at the very end, not now?

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.850
Like I haven't added
much salt to this.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:55.980
Why?

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.719
AUDIENCE: I think it's because
it evaporates [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:59.719 --> 00:20:00.760
JOEL GAMORAN: Bria, nice.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.380
So she nailed it, which is if
you have--I'm just going to do

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.850
a little visual aid here.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:12.500
If you have a soup that
starts off like this,

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:18.440
and when you're cooking, all
of it is starting to cook away.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.720
So it starts off like
this, but at the end

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.910
it kind of becomes like this.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:23.900
It comes to here.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.630
So that salt, let's
say it's perfect here,

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.070
won't be perfect when it's here.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.720
It's going to be too salty.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.350
So you always season sauces
and soups and things that

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.690
are reducing at the very end.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.620
Otherwise it's going to reduce
and make it totally inedible.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.150
Make sense?

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.410
Cool?

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:43.520
All right.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.160
Ready for the next
piece of magic?

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.310
I-- for as classy as
you may think I am,

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:50.810
which I am not at all--

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.240
I have a little
trashy side to me.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.650
I love me some ranch dressing.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.700
Any ranch lovers in the house?

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.010
Thank you for admitting it.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.520
Yes.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.740
He was like, yes, I like ranch.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.970
I could bathe in ranch.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:02.660
I'm sorry.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.980
I love ranch.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.770
But ranch dressing you
usually buy in a bottle.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.010
It's really creamy.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.270
It's really bad for you.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.110
So I wanted to make
a ranch dressing

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.260
that had no cream that was
actually somewhat good for you.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.450
And the basis of
this ranch dressing

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.440
is a scrap that I
absolutely love.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.280
So who wants to help me
with our ranch dressing?

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:25.700
Someone's got to come up here.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.080
Yeah, give it up for him.

00:21:29.362 --> 00:21:30.070
What's your name?

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.820
STEVEN: Steven.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.520
JOEL GAMORAN: Steven.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.228
Good he meet you.

00:21:32.228 --> 00:21:32.770
Joel.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.520
All right, So aqua faba.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.100
What the heck is aqua faba?

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.720
Have you ever heard
the word before?

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.860
I'll give you an air high five.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.180
Yes, nice.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.090
Bean water is what aqua faba is.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.060
So what I mean by
bean watered is

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.240
let's say you cook
a big pot of beans.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.700
It's the water left in the pot.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.390
Let's say you open a jar of
beans, like most of us do.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.104
It's the water inside the jar.

00:22:03.104 --> 00:22:05.020
So you said your name's
Steven, is that right?

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.657
So come on over here, Steven.

00:22:06.657 --> 00:22:07.740
So we're going to open up.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.370
We've got some chickpeas here.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.530
I just want you to hold
the lid back and just pour

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.210
the liquid right in there.

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.865
So if you look at the liquid
that Steven's pouring--

00:22:18.865 --> 00:22:19.490
that's perfect.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:20.810
That's great.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.150
It kind of looks
like egg whites.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.170
It's kind of thick.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.410
Raise your hand if you've
ever drained chickpeas,

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.470
beans over the sink and it
just goes down the drain,

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:31.651
all the stuff.

00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:32.150
I told you.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.380
It's like Scraps
Anonymous in here.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.410
We have all done it.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:35.320
We've all done it.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.540
But we're going to change that
because this right here not

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:43.575
only can make creamy dressings,
it can become meringue.

00:22:43.575 --> 00:22:45.200
There's marinades
you can do with this.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.030
You can thicken soups with this.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.230
There's so much you can do.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.720
So we're going to
turn it, though,

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.730
into my favorite little ranch.

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.640
So you're going to grab a
little immersion blender.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.146
Does everyone have one of these?

00:22:57.146 --> 00:22:59.270
If you don't, you can
absolutely just use a blender

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.280
or do it by hand, but it's a
lot easier with one of these.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:02.780
All right.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.670
So stick it right in there.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.287
Yep, and then press that button.

00:23:06.287 --> 00:23:07.120
STEVEN: Low or high?

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.750
JOEL GAMORAN: Yep.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:14.350
And in, like, I don't know,
five seconds, look at the color.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.110
It goes from kind of
like that egg whitey

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.170
to like this creamy,
gorgeous, light, cloudy color.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.637
Does that look awesome?

00:23:23.637 --> 00:23:24.970
All right, so we'll pause there.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:25.870
Good.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.410
Then what we got is a bunch
of spices, normal ranch stuff.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:32.600
So garlic powder, dried oregano.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.100
Go for it.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:33.480
STEVEN: Put this in?

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.497
JOEL GAMORAN: All
of it in, baby, yep.

00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:37.580
And you can take the one
in from underneath of it.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:39.040
Yeah, I hid it.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.840
I got a little black pepper, a
little dried thyme, right in,

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.160
go with the black pepper.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.269
A little bit of salt and sugar.

00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:50.560
I mean, this is all stuff
that's just in your cupboard.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.600
Garlic, fresh garlic.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.184
And then this is
apple cider vinegar.

00:23:55.184 --> 00:23:56.350
So blitz that up, my friend.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.410
And already you just look
at it, it's like, oh my god,

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.250
it's ranch dressing.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.860
Like it's happening right
here before your eyes.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:06.610
Look at the color.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:07.630
It's got the little flecks.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:08.500
It's got everything.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.760
I love testing this recipe.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.540
I tested it like 10 times.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.510
OK.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:14.230
Wrong thing.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.160
Cool.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.040
So make sure this guy's on.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:19.570
Good.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:20.350
There you go.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:21.100
OK.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.220
So we're nice and
creamy, frothy there.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.820
Next thing we're going to do
is we're going to add lemon.

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.700
Whenever you guys have a lemon,
and let's say it's really hard,

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.870
you can absolutely microwave
it for about 20 seconds,

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:37.870
and the juices will just
come flowing out of it.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.260
But if you have a nice,
soft lemon like this,

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.230
best thing to do is roll
on it before you chop it

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:46.270
and the juices will
really get loosened up.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.950
Now we're going to zest this.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.660
You've got a micro
plane right here.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.241
Got it right under here.

00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:53.240
There you go, my friend.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.584
Do you know to zest a lemon?

00:24:54.584 --> 00:24:55.500
Show me how you do it.

00:25:02.704 --> 00:25:03.245
It's a trick.

00:25:03.245 --> 00:25:04.430
No, I'm kidding.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.480
So what you do is-- no problem.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.780
The best way to zest
a lemon is pretend

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.150
like you're giving
someone low five.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.020
Put the micro
plane in your hand.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.770
Kind of stick it on the
board, and then on it.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:23.240
And you always turn the lemon
or the orange to a new spot,

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.850
meaning it's not like cheese
where you go like this.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.000
You do one strike,
and then a new spot.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.070
That way it doesn't get
bitter, and you always

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.224
kind of get the same thing.

00:25:32.224 --> 00:25:33.890
So you want to get
me a little bit more?

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.330
Go for it.

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:39.500
Oh, this soup is looking insane.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.050
Unreal.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.240
That looks great.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.290
That's plenty.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.180
Use this bad boy.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.290
Love it.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.460
That goes right in there.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.540
Beautiful.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:50.950
That's OK.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.570
Beautiful.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:53.932
And zip it up.

00:25:53.932 --> 00:25:56.140
While he's doing that, I'm
going to grab a little bit

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.120
of the lemon juice.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.500
Always through your fingers.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.430
This is like a sieve.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.730
Beautiful.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.920
And then I'm going
to grab some oil.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.340
And this is like vegetable oil.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.140
This is not olive oil.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.800
Olive oil, for things like
this, it's too strong.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.900
You'll taste oil
instead of tasting

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.410
all the flavor you put into it.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:18.993
So we're going to
start nice and slow.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.290
And then you're going to go big.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.040
Is this crazy or what?

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.070
I mean, seriously, I think it's
one of the coolest recipes.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.680
You guys are about to try it.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.530
You can kind of
hear it changing.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:40.100
It's going from soft to thick.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.096
You guys hear that?

00:26:42.096 --> 00:26:43.470
That means you're
doing it right.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.340
This will stay good in
the fridge for a week.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.080
And it will stay good in the
freezer for about three months.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.120
That looks great.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:54.940
Done.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:55.930
Give it up for Steven.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:58.240
Nice job, buddy.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.620
Watch the glass on your way out.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.140
Beautiful.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.330
I'm going to pick up this jar.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:03.820
OK.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.770
Me doing a demo where
I break only one

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.100
thing is a big plus for me.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.010
That's a big step up.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:14.200
So what I like to do
is grab this dressing.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.870
And just so everyone can
see, I've got a plate here.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.580
And I like to just
kind of pour it out.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.650
Look at the texture.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.090
I mean, that's ranch, right?

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.210
I mean, it's creamy.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.130
It's light.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:29.040
When you put this in the fridge,
you absolutely will have--

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.710
it will get a little thicker and
a little bit more easy to dip.

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.270
So we've got some crudites here.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.730
I wanted to show you
guys a couple of tricks.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:40.600
First of all, cauliflower, man.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:46.340
This stuff at the grocery store,
these leaves are unbelievable.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.920
They're like bok choy.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.690
You guys can throw
them in stir fries.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:51.160
You can put them in soups.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.870
They're so delicious.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:56.470
But cauliflower like this,
take all these leaves off.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.572
And again, if you're in
the middle of a recipe,

00:27:58.572 --> 00:27:59.530
don't worry about them.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:00.310
Just freeze them.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.351
You'll come back to them.

00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:03.910
They're not going anywhere.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.280
And then something like
this, these Romanescos,

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.590
Just kind of in
half, and then just

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:10.930
kind of cut off the outsides.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:15.820
The actual stem itself,
absolutely delicious to put

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.380
in soups and things like that.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.838
But I like to just kind of make
a little pile in the ranch.

00:28:19.838 --> 00:28:21.580
This is like fancy ranch.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.650
I've got some carrots.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:24.500
No big deal.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.920
I like to wash them
and leave the skins on.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.730
Totally OK to do.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.150
But I'm kind of just making
a little crudite plate.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:34.270
When I plate things I
try and get it high so

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.980
it kind of goes
into someone's face.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.370
That always kind of makes it
a little bit more inviting.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:41.650
It's one of the first things
they kind of teach you

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:42.590
at culinary school.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:45.160
So nice big pile of veggies.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.250
We have kind of the ranch
dressing on the bottom.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.930
Then tomatoes.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.410
I love this next trick.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:58.120
So cutting cherry tomatoes
is a total pain in the butt.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.990
Sucks.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.850
Cutting grapes is
a pain in the butt.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.445
Cutting olives is
a pain in the butt

00:29:02.445 --> 00:29:04.090
because you have
to go one by one.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:06.430
So I don't know if anyone's
ever seen this trick,

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.970
but you take two
deli containers,

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.850
take a handful of them.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.246
Right on.

00:29:14.246 --> 00:29:17.090
Cool.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.700
Then other one over the top.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.950
Grab a serrated knife.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.580
And right through.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.760
And you have chopped in
half cherry tomatoes.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.870
Give it up for that trick.

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.020
I love that trick.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.690
Did that just change your lives?

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.424
That totally changed your lives.

00:29:36.424 --> 00:29:38.590
So a little bit of chopped
cherry tomatoes, and then

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.610
pepper.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:42.360
Also kind of a pain
in the butt to chop.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.340
And one of the biggest things we
talk about on the cooking show

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.960
and also in the book
is how food looks.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.730
And a pepper--

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:51.521
I don't know if you
guys know this, but see

00:29:51.521 --> 00:29:52.900
how this pepper stands up?

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.060
I just learned there's a
company here in the Bay

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.440
called Imperfect Produce.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.874
Has anyone ever
worked with them?

00:29:57.874 --> 00:29:58.540
They're awesome.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.630
Yeah, they're really cool.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.770
Yeah, so Imperfect Produce
saves food that would normally

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.060
get rejected by grocery stores.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.500
So a pepper, if it
falls over like this

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.070
and it won't stand
up, it won't be sold.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.830
It goes in the trash
because grocery stores

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:19.330
need it to have symmetry so
they can stack it up high, which

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.410
is just ridiculous.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:22.960
It's absolutely crazy.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.810
And so we have to
get around this idea

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.640
that food needs to look perfect.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.090
It should look imperfect, just
like we all look imperfect,

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.470
and we should celebrate
it for what it is.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:39.100
So a good way to cut a pepper
is top off, bottom off.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.040
You can save this stuff
for kind of something else.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.160
And then I take my
knife and I roll it.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:54.930
And you have this beautiful
kind of sheet of pepper,

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.170
really easy to
chop with no seeds.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:02.190
This, unfortunately, is cooking
crappy, not cooking scrappy,

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.690
so this is not good.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.490
So don't save that.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:06.870
That can go to the chickens.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.370
And then I just
kind of cut this up,

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.890
and I've got this beautiful
kind of veggie platter

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:15.030
in like, what, five minutes,
with gorgeous Romanescos,

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:19.260
homemade ranch, all with kind
of things made from food waste.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.440
So give it up for
this dish right here.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.770
Love that one.

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.400
So we've got our
kind of appetizer.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.070
Let's revisit our soup.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.950
And just want everyone
to be able to see.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:35.700
It's been what, I don't
know, 15 minutes, 20 minutes

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.050
with the soup cooking down.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:39.690
So I just want everyone
to kind of look inside.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.710
The whole soup has transformed.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.940
I mean, it's really thick
now because of the bread.

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.830
It's absolutely beautiful.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:50.610
So what we're going to do
is just plate this guy up.

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.100
So I'm going to grab a plate.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.600
And the last step to
this, really, really easy.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.810
I grab like a ladle or two
of the actual soup, put it

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.420
in a bowl.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:08.330
Then I grab a little blender
and just kind of blitz this up.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.040
And this makes it really smooth.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.230
You can do this with-- whoops,
it's going to be a mess.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:18.400
Always is.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.550
But if you guys can see the
texture difference-- light,

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:22.720
creamy--

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.110
and then you kind
of bring it back in.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.160
And it kind of, I
don't know, marbles

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.110
throughout, gives it
a different texture.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.940
So some of it is creamy, some
of it is a little chunky,

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.210
and I love that.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.324
The Parmesan rinds themselves,
try and fish them out.

00:32:37.324 --> 00:32:39.740
But if someone gets it in their
bowl don't worry about it.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.550
It's not the end of the world.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:42.610
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:43.840
They'll love it.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.790
And then just a nice
serving of this.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.230
And you can see, this is thick.

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.630
You know, this dish
was a pleasant dish

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.880
because stale bread,
back in Italy,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.410
everyone had stale bread.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:57.200
So it was kind of thought
of as a low class dish,

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.430
but it's so beautiful.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:02.510
It's so, I don't know,
vibrant and filling.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.290
I'm going to grab a little bit
of that parm, which I am all

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:06.520
over the place with the parm.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.360
Where's my parm?

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.830
Thanks, buddy.

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.920
So a little bit that
parm right over the top.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.654
Doesn't that look good?

00:33:14.654 --> 00:33:16.820
You guys are going to be
able to try this, trust me.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.280
Little basil on top.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.130
I mean, that's homemade
tomato soup 101,

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.680
but with celebrating
stale bread.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.410
I mean, really the
centerpiece of this dish.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.950
So you can take a little bit
of basil right over there,

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:35.760
maybe our basil salt
right over the top.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.450
Fit for a king.

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.090
Give it up for that
dish right there.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.210
So we've got scraps
all over the place.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:43.080
I've got soup.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.100
I broke something.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.530
We had a real party here.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.530
But any questions
about any of this?

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.130
Yeah.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.957
AUDIENCE: Is that salt
enough for the soup?

00:33:53.957 --> 00:33:55.040
JOEL GAMORAN: What's that?

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.660
The salt?

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.450
Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.908
Just a little
finishing salt. Yeah,

00:33:57.908 --> 00:34:00.770
because the Parmesan rind
gives it a lot of saltiness.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.520
And then you'll remember
in the beginning,

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.770
we salted just a little bit.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.040
So it will get there.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.821
Absolutely.

00:34:05.821 --> 00:34:06.320
Yeah.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.790
Good question.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.515
What else?

00:34:09.515 --> 00:34:10.889
AUDIENCE: So I've
got a question.

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:13.949
You demo'd probably three of one
of your more favorite recipes.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:17.054
Or what are the top two or
three, when they open this book

00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:18.929
and they go home, that
you are the most proud

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.389
of because there's a
personal connection,

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:22.270
it's more innovative.

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:23.290
What are some of the things?

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:25.623
I mean, I think that the aqua
faba ranch was super cool.

00:34:25.623 --> 00:34:26.940
I'm going to try that for sure.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.442
What are the other recipes that
you're like, go here first?

00:34:29.442 --> 00:34:30.150
JOEL GAMORAN: OK.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:34.270
So anyone ever have
brown bananas at home?

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.810
So those brown bananas
come in a peel.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:40.920
So in the book is a
brown banana and peel

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.400
cake with whipped
peanut butter frosting.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.710
This thing is transformational.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.730
It's like religion.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:49.469
It is so good.

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:51.780
Banana peels kind of
tastes like plums.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.659
And when you think about bananas
and when they turn brown,

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.070
that's the color of caramel.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.210
That's sugar.

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:59.677
So that just means they're
sweeter bananas, so not worth

00:34:59.677 --> 00:35:00.260
throwing away.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.540
So that's one.

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:03.540
And I would say I came
up with this thing called

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.990
the sea salt, which is like
a BLT but with chicken skin.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.900
So it's chicken skin,
avocado, lettuce and tomato.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.774
And you bake the chicken skin,
so you take it off the chicken

00:35:12.774 --> 00:35:13.440
and you bake it.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.920
And it gets so crispy,
and it is insane.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.450
I come from a Jewish household.

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:20.520
My dad can't eat bacon,
and I made it for him,

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.180
and he was like done for life.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.180
He loved it.

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:25.200
Those are my two.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.230
Very cool.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:27.040
Any questions?

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:27.270
Yes.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.270
Let me pass you the mic.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.370
AUDIENCE: That bean water.

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.812
Does it matter what type
of peas or beans you use?

00:35:35.812 --> 00:35:37.020
JOEL GAMORAN: Absolutely not.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.850
AUDIENCE: Would it be
black beans or kidney

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.737
beans where it's like the
water is redder or darker?

00:35:41.737 --> 00:35:42.570
JOEL GAMORAN: Right.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.090
So the only thing I
would say is black beans

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:46.860
are a little tough for it.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.860
So black beans just
make a crazy color.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.629
But it works with black beans.

00:35:51.629 --> 00:35:52.170
I've done it.

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.045
Works with red beans.

00:35:53.045 --> 00:35:53.820
So any beans.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:57.100
But if you want to make a
kind of a creamy texture,

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.650
it's definitely a white bean.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:35:59.790
Yeah, good question.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.890
What else?

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:02.577
Yeah.

00:36:02.577 --> 00:36:05.160
AUDIENCE: You talked about the
freezer being your best friend.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.020
What's your take on refreezing?

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.350
I mean, once you've already
taken it out and it's thawed,

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.741
where do you draw the line
in terms of refreezing?

00:36:12.741 --> 00:36:14.740
JOEL GAMORAN: Proteins
is where I draw the line.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.220
So the question is
is can you refreeze?

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.380
Once you freeze something,
you take it out,

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.030
can you put it back
in the freezer?

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:26.520
If it's a protein like fish skin
or chicken bones or pork fat,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.220
once it's out, it's out
and you've got to use it.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.680
But vegetables and fruit
scraps, absolutely.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.910
You can always refreeze.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.250
Yeah, good question.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.780
What else?

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.890
Yes.

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:39.880
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.890
You mentioned that the
middle of the bell pepper

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.900
was inedible at some point.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.090
Somewhere in your book
or online, et cetera,

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.790
is there a place where we can
find out like oh, this actually

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:51.200
I shouldn't eat, like,
to not be poisoned?

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:51.960
JOEL GAMORAN: Yes.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.870
Yes, yes, yes.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:56.320
So I don't have a full list,
although that is a genius idea.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.480
So I might put that together.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.020
You could absolutely Google it.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.910
There's a great website.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:04.330
But no, I don't know
if there's anything

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.360
that I would say, particularly,
that if I have a list of things

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.410
you can't eat.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:11.110
I will say that in the
very beginning of our chat

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:13.360
we talked about our
grandparents, or maybe

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.890
other generations.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.200
They were, back then, really
trusting their senses.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.670
And so I have a whole
chapter in the book called--

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:24.010
and like I said, cooking
scrappy, not cooking crappy.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.430
That means if chicken
smells off, throw it away.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:32.230
If there's fuzz on the outside
of a strawberry, throw it away.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.350
That stuff's not worth it.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:34.730
But we know what
that looks like.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.700
We know what that smells like.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.450
What I'm asking you guys to do
is look at the whole picture.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:42.580
One thing that a
lot of people ask

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:46.630
me about is about expiration
dates, and are they real?

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.620
And do you throw your milk
away the second the date hits?

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:52.690
So we just did a whole
episode about this.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.790
And expiration dates
and sell by dates,

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:58.570
they're totally dictated
by the manufacturer.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.940
So they're all over the place.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.280
So it goes back to,
again, open up the milk.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.880
Even if it's a week past its
date, smell it, pour it out.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.020
I'm sure it will be fine.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.480
But you will know.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.220
If you have doubt, throw it away
and don't feel bad about it.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.200
Yeah, good question.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:16.700
Yeah.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.408
AUDIENCE: I really
like that salt recipe,

00:38:18.408 --> 00:38:20.340
but it doesn't use
a lot of herb stems.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.660
You have a lot of recipes
that use a lot of herb stems.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.890
JOEL GAMORAN: Oh, man, yes.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:27.220
Absolutely I have a whole
herb stem sauce in there where

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.870
you use the entire herb stem.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.300
If you use a ton of
them, like let's say

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.500
you picked a whole
bunch of parsley,

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.902
you can use them as a
bed to bake fish on.

00:38:35.902 --> 00:38:38.110
And they actually cook down
in the juices of the fish

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.180
and elevate the fish at
the bottom of the pan.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.790
So they kind of act as like
a little rack, which I love.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:44.082
So herb stems are unbelievable.

00:38:44.082 --> 00:38:45.498
And of course you
could throw them

00:38:45.498 --> 00:38:47.820
in your stocks and your
soups and things like that.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.720
Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.220
What else?

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.440
AUDIENCE: I think
another thing that

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.273
sort of goes to waste
in my personal kitchen

00:38:56.273 --> 00:38:57.140
are like condiments.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.910
Like you buy a sauce for
a one time use and then

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:00.740
you just don't really
ever use it again.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.377
In your experience, have
you ever combined condiments

00:39:03.377 --> 00:39:04.210
to make a new sauce?

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.126
JOEL GAMORAN: Totally.

00:39:05.126 --> 00:39:06.170
Totally, yes.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:13.970
So airing tonight on FYI Network
is a Scrappy Thanksgiving

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:14.480
Special.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.780
It's one hour special where
we take all the leftovers

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:21.680
from Thanksgiving, and we whip
up a whole weekend's worth

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.364
of food.

00:39:22.364 --> 00:39:23.780
And if you can't
catch it tonight,

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.580
you can watch it on
Saturday morning, too.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.120
But we do this exact thing.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.220
It's all about condiments.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.870
How do you make the most
of them in your fridge?

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.880
What do you do with
your mayo, your ketchup?

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.680
How can you
repurpose everything?

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.560
So the idea is instead of
going out after Thanksgiving,

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.990
or after any meal,
look in the fridge.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:42.440
I have a hashtag on
Instagram if anyone wants it.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.030
You take a picture
of your fridge,

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:48.110
open it up, and say scrap
my fridge at Joel Gamoran,

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:51.620
and I will respond with a video
of what you should make out

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.760
of your fridge.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:56.360
And I respond to them all,
which seemed like a mistake

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.366
in the beginning, but
now I really like it.

00:39:58.366 --> 00:39:59.990
So if you guys don't
know what to make,

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.020
you can always call on me.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.770
AUDIENCE: I want to
build on what you just

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:07.280
said because the chefs at Google
do a very similar approach.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.870
We traditionally
are always looking

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:12.884
to create menus based off
what the chef's excited about.

00:40:12.884 --> 00:40:14.300
And if you flip
the whole paradigm

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.850
and go hey, Mr. or Mrs.
Farmer, what do you have,

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:18.227
it's the same exact opportunity.

00:40:18.227 --> 00:40:20.810
So when I go home and cook, my
wife's like, what's for dinner,

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.820
I'm like, I don't know,
and we open the fridge.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.830
And it's exactly
that opportunity.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:25.894
So raise of hands.

00:40:25.894 --> 00:40:27.560
How many people here
have actually taken

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.882
that approach, whether you're
a confident cook or not,

00:40:29.882 --> 00:40:32.090
to actually look in the
cupboard, look in the pantry,

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:33.680
to your point, look
at the condiments,

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.640
and actually experiment?

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.265
Raise of hands.

00:40:35.265 --> 00:40:36.350
Who's tried it?

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:40.574
I would challenge everyone
here to make that opportunity,

00:40:40.574 --> 00:40:41.990
because there's
no right or wrong.

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:43.370
You're either going
to like it or not.

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:44.900
If you don't like it, make
it taste better or just

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.722
keep working on it.

00:40:45.722 --> 00:40:46.930
But it's a really good point.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:47.370
I love that.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:48.830
JOEL GAMORAN: And I'm
so glad you guys do that

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:49.350
here at Google.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:51.380
I'm not surprised at all
because you guys are always

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.338
on the forefront of it.

00:40:52.338 --> 00:40:55.680
But the reality is is that
everyone always asks me, well,

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.040
what's an action item that
I can take away after I

00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.360
teach a little class like this?

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.980
What is one thing I can do?

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.260
The one thing I
say you could do is

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:08.660
replace one day of cooking
out with staying in and trying

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.060
to make the most
of what you have.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.490
And if you just do that
once, it will be huge.

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:17.790
So to Chef Scott's point,
push yourselves a little bit.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:20.480
It will make a big difference.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.900
Yes.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.566
AUDIENCE: Are there
things you recommend

00:41:23.566 --> 00:41:26.920
we keep in our pantry or kitchen
in generally to enable that?

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.030
JOEL GAMORAN: Just to
always have on hand?

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:30.076
That's a tough question.

00:41:30.076 --> 00:41:31.700
That's a really,
really tough question.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.680
My pantry I invest a lot in.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.530
But I only shop my
pantry probably once

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:40.740
every three months.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:45.530
So I always have my flours, my
nut oils, my seasoning blends,

00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:46.250
all that stuff.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.270
I do that like probably
four times a year

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:49.811
and I go groceries
shopping for that.

00:41:49.811 --> 00:41:51.590
What I do every week
is for my proteins

00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:53.930
and my fruits and my
vegetables, those turn out.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.350
I always have carrots, celery,
and onions, always, always,

00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:58.450
always, always.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:02.000
I always have chicken
and neutral meats.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.790
And then I'm a big believer
in cooking on Sundays

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.920
and then really trying
to stretch it out

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.427
until Thursday, Friday,
and seeing if you can't

00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:11.510
do a little meal prepping.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:12.990
So I'm huge on that.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:13.490
Yeah.

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:14.480
Good question.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.810
SCOTT: Huge round of applause.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:19.160
Absolutely.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:22.250
This is one of
the most fun talks

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:25.052
that I've had the opportunity
to host because it's something

00:42:25.052 --> 00:42:26.510
that everyone should
have fun with.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:29.009
And it's a new discipline to
actually take home and actually

00:42:29.009 --> 00:42:30.645
see what are we
actually throwing away.

00:42:30.645 --> 00:42:32.270
I mean, going to what
you said earlier,

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:36.410
between 40 if not more
percent of the world's food

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:37.515
is essentially wasted.

00:42:37.515 --> 00:42:39.140
It doesn't make it
from the farm to us,

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.600
or when it makes it to our
house, it doesn't get cooked.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.830
And it's a travesty.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.710
And to eliminate that, or at
least help with that, let alone

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.900
look at all these
opportunities to serve

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.555
the skins and the peels and
the tops, super, super cool.

00:42:50.555 --> 00:42:53.180
So a couple more questions, and
then we're going to wrap it up.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.170
Any final questions
from the team here?

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.670
Or do you have any
questions for us?

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:57.800
JOEL GAMORAN: Yes,
I have a question.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.270
I'd like to play a
game if you guys want

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.410
to play a game with me.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.480
It's called Stump the Scrap.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.210
So I like to call
out a scrap, and I'd

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.310
like to see what you
guys would make with it.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:08.780
Cool?

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:09.890
All right.

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:13.505
What would you do with
butternut squash seeds?

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.157
Yes.

00:43:17.157 --> 00:43:19.032
AUDIENCE: Roast them,
salt them, season them,

00:43:19.032 --> 00:43:20.199
enjoy them as a great snack.

00:43:20.199 --> 00:43:21.365
JOEL GAMORAN: Exactly, baby.

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:22.400
Roast them, season them.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.700
Give it up, I love
it, for Tarik.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.490
OK.

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:28.340
What would you do with--

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.280
like you buy a steak and there's
a lot of fat on the outside,

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.090
so you cut it off.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:36.140
What would you do
with that beef fat?

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.459
AUDIENCE: Render it and
make some kind of confit.

00:43:39.459 --> 00:43:40.500
JOEL GAMORAN: Damn, dude.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.140
I love it.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:41.760
Give it up.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.580
That's amazing.

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.940
So he said render it and
make some sort of confit.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.280
So rendering fat, if
you have extra fat,

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.830
you can put it in a pan
with a little drop of water

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:52.410
and cook it really
slow for 30 minutes.

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:54.760
And it will turn
into like an oil.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:56.370
And now you have
this beef fat oil.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:58.080
You toss your potatoes in that.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.460
You cook your omelet in that.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.980
It is so, so good.

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.760
So yes, rendering
it out is great.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.260
All right.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:04.650
One more.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:05.905
Do we have time for one more?

00:44:05.905 --> 00:44:07.150
SCOTT: One more, yeah.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:10.437
JOEL GAMORAN: What
would you do with--

00:44:10.437 --> 00:44:11.520
it's got to be a good one.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.680
Oh, I'll stump you on this one.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.130
What would you do
with peach pits?

00:44:19.594 --> 00:44:22.232
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:22.232 --> 00:44:24.440
JOEL GAMORAN: I'm shocked
that you actually got that.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.171
Nice job.

00:44:25.171 --> 00:44:25.670
Give it up.

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:27.820
So what she said
was-- very nice--

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:28.960
is you can infuse it.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.430
So peach pits taste like
almonds when you infuse it.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.190
So if you put it
in vodka, you can

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:37.340
make this peach pit beautiful
vodka that you can make drinks

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.014
with, or a simple syrup.

00:44:39.014 --> 00:44:41.180
You can make a really good,
kind of almondy flavored

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:41.742
simple syrup.

00:44:41.742 --> 00:44:42.950
But you said soak it in milk.

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.010
You can make peach pit ice
cream, peach pit panna cotta.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:47.160
Lots of different things.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.530
So even look at those pits.

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:50.180
They're worth it.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.020
SCOTT: Awesome job.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.300
Let's give Joel Gamoran
a huge round of applause.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.500
"Cooking Scrappy," and
we'll see it on YouTube.

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.160
Thanks again.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.850
JOEL GAMORAN: Thank you.
