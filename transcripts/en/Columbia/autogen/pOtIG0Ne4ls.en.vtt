00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.050
meeting the promise that we set for the
 

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:39.600
meeting the promise that we set for the
world so we start considering how best

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:39.610
world so we start considering how best
 

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.060
world so we start considering how best
we can tackle this problem and the

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.070
we can tackle this problem and the
 

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.300
we can tackle this problem and the
experience of dirt to the turtle site in

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:45.310
experience of dirt to the turtle site in
 

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:50.280
experience of dirt to the turtle site in
northern Kenya shows us that this is a

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:50.290
northern Kenya shows us that this is a
 

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.070
northern Kenya shows us that this is a
very challenging but at the same time a

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:53.080
very challenging but at the same time a
 

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.560
very challenging but at the same time a
doable kind of thing and we have

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:55.570
doable kind of thing and we have
 

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.550
doable kind of thing and we have
concluded that if this is something that

00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560
concluded that if this is something that
 

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.400
concluded that if this is something that
can be done how ways we can expedite and

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:02.410
can be done how ways we can expedite and
 

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.030
can be done how ways we can expedite and
enhance you know achievements in this

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040
enhance you know achievements in this
 

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.340
enhance you know achievements in this
regard particularly when we are scaling

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:08.350
regard particularly when we are scaling
 

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:12.960
regard particularly when we are scaling
up this development practice in many

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:12.970
up this development practice in many
 

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.090
up this development practice in many
countries and countries who have never

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:15.100
countries and countries who have never
 

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.100
countries and countries who have never
been involved in this kind of integrated

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:17.110
been involved in this kind of integrated
 

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:22.019
been involved in this kind of integrated
development work so we had to ponder on

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:22.029
development work so we had to ponder on
 

00:16:22.029 --> 00:16:25.310
development work so we had to ponder on
these issues for about six months

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320
these issues for about six months
 

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.199
these issues for about six months
creating different forums inviting

00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:28.209
creating different forums inviting
 

00:16:28.209 --> 00:16:31.319
creating different forums inviting
different people expertise including

00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:31.329
different people expertise including
 

00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:34.850
different people expertise including
high-level policy makers who actually

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:34.860
high-level policy makers who actually
 

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.090
high-level policy makers who actually
believed to be engaged and included

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:39.100
believed to be engaged and included
 

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.410
believed to be engaged and included
right from the inception phase so the

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:43.420
right from the inception phase so the
 

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.139
right from the inception phase so the
objective of this program is is mainly

00:16:46.139 --> 00:16:46.149
objective of this program is is mainly
 

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:50.480
objective of this program is is mainly
to in bringing the deep assess

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:50.490
to in bringing the deep assess
 

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.220
to in bringing the deep assess
communities into the mainstream of

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:53.230
communities into the mainstream of
 

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.470
communities into the mainstream of
economic development so that they can

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:55.480
economic development so that they can
 

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.170
economic development so that they can
make meaningful contribution to the

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:58.180
make meaningful contribution to the
 

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.800
make meaningful contribution to the
development and the GDP making of their

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:01.810
development and the GDP making of their
 

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.040
development and the GDP making of their
countries and maybe the second most

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.050
countries and maybe the second most
 

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.760
countries and maybe the second most
important objective is also overcoming

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:07.770
important objective is also overcoming
 

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:12.000
important objective is also overcoming
the historical and current misconception

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.010
the historical and current misconception
 

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.520
the historical and current misconception
about the dryland system and people

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:14.530
about the dryland system and people
 

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:19.699
about the dryland system and people
living in the dryland and which actually

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:19.709
living in the dryland and which actually
 

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:22.530
living in the dryland and which actually
result would bring hope to millions of

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:22.540
result would bring hope to millions of
 

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.529
result would bring hope to millions of
people

00:17:23.529 --> 00:17:23.539
people
 

00:17:23.539 --> 00:17:25.599
people
have suffered from this neglect for

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:25.609
have suffered from this neglect for
 

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:29.349
have suffered from this neglect for
years the program is essentially an

00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:29.359
years the program is essentially an
 

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:32.320
years the program is essentially an
integrated development approach but an

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:32.330
integrated development approach but an
 

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.489
integrated development approach but an
integrated development approach in the

00:17:36.489 --> 00:17:36.499
integrated development approach in the
 

00:17:36.499 --> 00:17:39.609
integrated development approach in the
area where nothing of the basic

00:17:39.609 --> 00:17:39.619
area where nothing of the basic
 

00:17:39.619 --> 00:17:42.430
area where nothing of the basic
components are available these areas are

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440
components are available these areas are
 

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.009
components are available these areas are
not only transhumans not only suffers

00:17:45.009 --> 00:17:45.019
not only transhumans not only suffers
 

00:17:45.019 --> 00:17:48.369
not only transhumans not only suffers
from erratic rainfall situation drought

00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:48.379
from erratic rainfall situation drought
 

00:17:48.379 --> 00:17:51.549
from erratic rainfall situation drought
and flood as Professor Sachs mention but

00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559
and flood as Professor Sachs mention but
 

00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:56.700
and flood as Professor Sachs mention but
also these areas are known to have no

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:56.710
also these areas are known to have no
 

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:00.190
also these areas are known to have no
essential services and basic

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:00.200
essential services and basic
 

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.070
essential services and basic
infrastructures at all so if you start

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080
infrastructures at all so if you start
 

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.989
infrastructures at all so if you start
if you have to start the program here we

00:18:04.989 --> 00:18:04.999
if you have to start the program here we
 

00:18:04.999 --> 00:18:08.469
if you have to start the program here we
have to start from zero and in fact we

00:18:08.469 --> 00:18:08.479
have to start from zero and in fact we
 

00:18:08.479 --> 00:18:12.669
have to start from zero and in fact we
have the most important challenges to

00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679
have the most important challenges to
 

00:18:12.679 --> 00:18:14.830
have the most important challenges to
bring in all these essential components

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:14.840
bring in all these essential components
 

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.259
bring in all these essential components
in such a way that they can create some

00:18:17.259 --> 00:18:17.269
in such a way that they can create some
 

00:18:17.269 --> 00:18:20.440
in such a way that they can create some
kind of critical mass or threshold for

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:20.450
kind of critical mass or threshold for
 

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.700
kind of critical mass or threshold for
kicking of development so from this

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:23.710
kicking of development so from this
 

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.759
kicking of development so from this
point of view we strongly believe that

00:18:27.759 --> 00:18:27.769
point of view we strongly believe that
 

00:18:27.769 --> 00:18:30.849
point of view we strongly believe that
it is the only way to tackle this

00:18:30.849 --> 00:18:30.859
it is the only way to tackle this
 

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:33.219
it is the only way to tackle this
problem is to develop an integrated

00:18:33.219 --> 00:18:33.229
problem is to develop an integrated
 

00:18:33.229 --> 00:18:37.119
problem is to develop an integrated
development approach not all that takes

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:37.129
development approach not all that takes
 

00:18:37.129 --> 00:18:39.009
development approach not all that takes
care of everything of course essential

00:18:39.009 --> 00:18:39.019
care of everything of course essential
 

00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:40.930
care of everything of course essential
things including infrastructure health

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:40.940
things including infrastructure health
 

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.389
things including infrastructure health
education and others and not only

00:18:43.389 --> 00:18:43.399
education and others and not only
 

00:18:43.399 --> 00:18:46.119
education and others and not only
comprehensive but also something that

00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:46.129
comprehensive but also something that
 

00:18:46.129 --> 00:18:48.430
comprehensive but also something that
should be done simultaneously if we

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440
should be done simultaneously if we
 

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.399
should be done simultaneously if we
don't tackle these things simultaneously

00:18:50.399 --> 00:18:50.409
don't tackle these things simultaneously
 

00:18:50.409 --> 00:18:53.919
don't tackle these things simultaneously
we will not be able to kick off or to

00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:53.929
we will not be able to kick off or to
 

00:18:53.929 --> 00:18:57.129
we will not be able to kick off or to
create the kind of threshold that we are

00:18:57.129 --> 00:18:57.139
create the kind of threshold that we are
 

00:18:57.139 --> 00:18:59.009
create the kind of threshold that we are
expecting this program has to creighton

00:18:59.009 --> 00:18:59.019
expecting this program has to creighton
 

00:18:59.019 --> 00:19:04.570
expecting this program has to creighton
so with this basic assumptions actually

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:04.580
so with this basic assumptions actually
 

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.619
so with this basic assumptions actually
we started working on the program itself

00:19:08.619 --> 00:19:08.629
we started working on the program itself
 

00:19:08.629 --> 00:19:11.799
we started working on the program itself
and this is a 3gs program basically the

00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:11.809
and this is a 3gs program basically the
 

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:14.139
and this is a 3gs program basically the
first one is at the grassroots level

00:19:14.139 --> 00:19:14.149
first one is at the grassroots level
 

00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:17.109
first one is at the grassroots level
where people are living and where people

00:19:17.109 --> 00:19:17.119
where people are living and where people
 

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:22.779
where people are living and where people
have actually striving to survive we

00:19:22.779 --> 00:19:22.789
have actually striving to survive we
 

00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:25.979
have actually striving to survive we
have to come with this basic kind of

00:19:25.979 --> 00:19:25.989
have to come with this basic kind of
 

00:19:25.989 --> 00:19:27.669
have to come with this basic kind of
infrastructures and development

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679
infrastructures and development
 

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:30.909
infrastructures and development
activities but we pointed out as an

00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:30.919
activities but we pointed out as an
 

00:19:30.919 --> 00:19:34.180
activities but we pointed out as an
entry point water is a critical element

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:34.190
entry point water is a critical element
 

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.940
entry point water is a critical element
there

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:34.950
there
 

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.760
there
so we are trying to develop all other

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:37.770
so we are trying to develop all other
 

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.780
so we are trying to develop all other
things around water and on top of water

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:41.790
things around water and on top of water
 

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.350
things around water and on top of water
the other very critical entry point is

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:44.360
the other very critical entry point is
 

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.140
the other very critical entry point is
to actually increase the take-off level

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.150
to actually increase the take-off level
 

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.710
to actually increase the take-off level
of their livestock resources because

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720
of their livestock resources because
 

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.040
of their livestock resources because
livestock resources are are there as you

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:55.050
livestock resources are are there as you
 

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:59.210
livestock resources are are there as you
know but most of the time the natural

00:19:59.210 --> 00:19:59.220
know but most of the time the natural
 

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.830
know but most of the time the natural
harvest or the natural days of livestock

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840
harvest or the natural days of livestock
 

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.650
harvest or the natural days of livestock
resource is reached to the level of

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660
resource is reached to the level of
 

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.590
resource is reached to the level of
fifty to sixty percent even in a good

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600
fifty to sixty percent even in a good
 

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.810
fifty to sixty percent even in a good
year a good year in a sense a year

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820
year a good year in a sense a year
 

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.530
year a good year in a sense a year
without drought or result flood so we

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:15.540
without drought or result flood so we
 

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.860
without drought or result flood so we
are trying to bring in this basic

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:18.870
are trying to bring in this basic
 

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.070
are trying to bring in this basic
infrastructure closer to the people we

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080
infrastructure closer to the people we
 

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.660
infrastructure closer to the people we
are not expecting these people to go to

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:23.670
are not expecting these people to go to
 

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.480
are not expecting these people to go to
the market and meet and comply you know

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:26.490
the market and meet and comply you know
 

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.480
the market and meet and comply you know
is what the market is looking for at

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:29.490
is what the market is looking for at
 

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.700
is what the market is looking for at
this stage we are trying to bring the

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:31.710
this stage we are trying to bring the
 

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.360
this stage we are trying to bring the
market toward the same by bringing up

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:35.370
market toward the same by bringing up
 

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.340
market toward the same by bringing up
some of the basic things that I

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:37.350
some of the basic things that I
 

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:42.670
some of the basic things that I
mentioned in a very energetic way this

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:42.680
mentioned in a very energetic way this
 

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:48.860
mentioned in a very energetic way this
so we will be having some kind of unit

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:48.870
so we will be having some kind of unit
 

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.840
so we will be having some kind of unit
for intervention and this unit is

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:50.850
for intervention and this unit is
 

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.310
for intervention and this unit is
defined as in this case as basic grazing

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320
defined as in this case as basic grazing
 

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.530
defined as in this case as basic grazing
in it the basic grazing we need is a

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:57.540
in it the basic grazing we need is a
 

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.640
in it the basic grazing we need is a
unit where each clan is focused I mean

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:00.650
unit where each clan is focused I mean
 

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:04.160
unit where each clan is focused I mean
is thinking or as something that it

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:04.170
is thinking or as something that it
 

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:08.450
is thinking or as something that it
possesses for running the particularly

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.460
possesses for running the particularly
 

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.570
possesses for running the particularly
the livestock enterprises so we want to

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580
the livestock enterprises so we want to
 

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.850
the livestock enterprises so we want to
focus on those and to bring in all these

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860
focus on those and to bring in all these
 

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.990
focus on those and to bring in all these
development facilities together the

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000
development facilities together the
 

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.240
development facilities together the
other the second tiers of this program

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:20.250
other the second tiers of this program
 

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.150
other the second tiers of this program
is at a national level we strongly

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:23.160
is at a national level we strongly
 

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.050
is at a national level we strongly
believe that many of in many countries

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:27.060
believe that many of in many countries
 

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.990
believe that many of in many countries
actually the existing national policies

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000
actually the existing national policies
 

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.260
actually the existing national policies
are not reflecting the real life and

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:33.270
are not reflecting the real life and
 

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.700
are not reflecting the real life and
real development challenge of these

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:34.710
real development challenge of these
 

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.920
real development challenge of these
areas governments like any other

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:38.930
areas governments like any other
 

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:43.220
areas governments like any other
entities have been investing their

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:43.230
entities have been investing their
 

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.440
entities have been investing their
resources on the areas where they feel

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:45.450
resources on the areas where they feel
 

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.860
resources on the areas where they feel
like they would get

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:47.870
like they would get
 

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.200
like they would get
you know QQ in kind of reward and

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:50.210
you know QQ in kind of reward and
 

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.110
you know QQ in kind of reward and
dividends so we would like to see how

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120
dividends so we would like to see how
 

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.840
dividends so we would like to see how
based national governments will

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:54.850
based national governments will
 

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:59.080
based national governments will
accommodate this challenging areas into

00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.090
accommodate this challenging areas into
 

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:01.690
accommodate this challenging areas into

policy level intervention at all level
 

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:31.780
policy level intervention at all level
in national national levels but we also

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:31.790
in national national levels but we also
 

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.810
in national national levels but we also
try to actually help the national

try to actually help the national
 

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.320
try to actually help the national
capacity building programs in such a way

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:38.330
capacity building programs in such a way
 

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:42.580
capacity building programs in such a way
that they can have you know competent

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:42.590
that they can have you know competent

activities that we are trying to

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.240
activities that we are trying to
 

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.990
activities that we are trying to
demonstrate their the third level in the

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000
demonstrate their the third level in the
 

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.240
demonstrate their the third level in the
very interesting level where we believe

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:58.250
very interesting level where we believe
 

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.910
very interesting level where we believe
that at least the minimum forty percent

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:00.920
that at least the minimum forty percent
 

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.880
that at least the minimum forty percent
of the Holy 14 resource should go is the

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:03.890
of the Holy 14 resource should go is the
 

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.799
of the Holy 14 resource should go is the
regional level at regional level will be

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:07.809
regional level at regional level will be
 

00:23:07.809 --> 00:23:12.390
regional level at regional level will be
because we believe that these areas

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400
because we believe that these areas
 

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.710
because we believe that these areas
regardless of the geopolitical

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720
regardless of the geopolitical
 

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.919
regardless of the geopolitical
demarcations and borders these are areas

00:23:20.919 --> 00:23:20.929
demarcations and borders these are areas
 

00:23:20.929 --> 00:23:23.980
demarcations and borders these are areas
under the same ecosystem problems are

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:23.990
under the same ecosystem problems are
 

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.230
under the same ecosystem problems are
more or less homogeneous and solutions

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240
more or less homogeneous and solutions
 

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.240
more or less homogeneous and solutions
particularly technical solutions can be

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.250
particularly technical solutions can be
 

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:36.130
particularly technical solutions can be
easily actually easily transferred from

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:36.140
easily actually easily transferred from
 

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.299
easily actually easily transferred from
one corner to the other provider that

00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:40.309
one corner to the other provider that
 

00:23:40.309 --> 00:23:43.390
one corner to the other provider that
that kind of facilities and willingness

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:43.400
that kind of facilities and willingness
 

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.460
that kind of facilities and willingness
is there so we are trying actually to

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:47.470
is there so we are trying actually to
 

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.970
is there so we are trying actually to
build a regional capacity that will

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:51.980
build a regional capacity that will
 

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.150
build a regional capacity that will
focus on basic regional issues like

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:55.160
focus on basic regional issues like
 

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.970
focus on basic regional issues like
early warning system immunization for

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:57.980
early warning system immunization for
 

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.480
early warning system immunization for
livestock and human

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:00.490
livestock and human
 

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.269
livestock and human
the human being basic epidemiology

00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:04.279
the human being basic epidemiology
 

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:08.560
the human being basic epidemiology
systems and also measure infrastructure

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:08.570
systems and also measure infrastructure
 

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.039
systems and also measure infrastructure
and catchment approach and also

00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:12.049
and catchment approach and also
 

00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:14.340
and catchment approach and also
development of the hydrological systems

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:14.350
development of the hydrological systems
 

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:19.980
development of the hydrological systems
so in this case the regional approach is

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:19.990
so in this case the regional approach is
 

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.860
so in this case the regional approach is
going to be harmonized through national

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:23.870
going to be harmonized through national
 

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:28.450
going to be harmonized through national
level policy work so that every single

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:28.460
level policy work so that every single
 

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.990
level policy work so that every single
person and living in this ecosystem can

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000
person and living in this ecosystem can
 

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.430
person and living in this ecosystem can
have a feeling of living and actually

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440
have a feeling of living and actually
 

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.600
have a feeling of living and actually

set up this is something that is going
 

00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:51.970
set up this is something that is going
to be coordinated in fact at regional

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:51.980
to be coordinated in fact at regional
 

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.860
to be coordinated in fact at regional
level but it's going to be implemented

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.659
in dryland system and we will be
expecting a lot of networking and

00:26:07.659 --> 00:26:07.669
expecting a lot of networking and
 

00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:11.110
expecting a lot of networking and
informations and also harmonizing

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120
informations and also harmonizing
 

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.629
informations and also harmonizing
experiences through this approach

00:26:13.629 --> 00:26:13.639
experiences through this approach
 

00:26:13.639 --> 00:26:15.669
experiences through this approach
so this program is going to be

00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679
so this program is going to be
 

00:26:15.679 --> 00:26:18.219
so this program is going to be
implemented at least in the six of the

00:26:18.219 --> 00:26:18.229
implemented at least in the six of the
 

00:26:18.229 --> 00:26:21.009
implemented at least in the six of the
seven countries and we are expecting to

00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:21.019
seven countries and we are expecting to
 

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:24.669
seven countries and we are expecting to
have at least 10 different grazing units

00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679
have at least 10 different grazing units
 

00:26:24.679 --> 00:26:28.449
have at least 10 different grazing units
or like Millennium village kind of areas

00:26:28.449 --> 00:26:28.459
or like Millennium village kind of areas
 

00:26:28.459 --> 00:26:30.759
or like Millennium village kind of areas

of the dry lands and then go from there

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:50.750
of the dry lands and then go from there
 

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.230
of the dry lands and then go from there
to connecting that to a water challenge

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240
to connecting that to a water challenge
 

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.940
to connecting that to a water challenge
and then we talked about some of the

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:54.950
and then we talked about some of the
 

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.270
and then we talked about some of the
locations of interests so some people

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:58.280
locations of interests so some people
 

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:01.600
locations of interests so some people
define dry lands as regions where the

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:01.610
define dry lands as regions where the
 

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.300
define dry lands as regions where the
average annual rainfall is less than six

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:04.310
average annual rainfall is less than six
 

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.820
average annual rainfall is less than six
hundred fifty millimeters you'll be

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:06.830
hundred fifty millimeters you'll be
 

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.210
hundred fifty millimeters you'll be
surprised to find what places fall in

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:10.220
surprised to find what places fall in
 

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:11.590
surprised to find what places fall in
those categories so I'm going to talk

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600
those categories so I'm going to talk
 

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.660
those categories so I'm going to talk
about some of them and all the ones that

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:13.670
about some of them and all the ones that
 

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.370
about some of them and all the ones that
Jeff mentioned that we are working on

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:15.380
Jeff mentioned that we are working on
 

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.640
Jeff mentioned that we are working on
fall in that category but as Jeff also

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:18.650
fall in that category but as Jeff also
 

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.910
fall in that category but as Jeff also
mentioned and belay also mentioned the

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:20.920
mentioned and belay also mentioned the
 

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.860
mentioned and belay also mentioned the
striking thing about many of the dry

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:23.870
striking thing about many of the dry
 

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.770
striking thing about many of the dry
lands is not the amount of rainfall you

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:26.780
lands is not the amount of rainfall you
 

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.990
lands is not the amount of rainfall you
get on the average but the fluctuation

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000
get on the average but the fluctuation
 

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.320
get on the average but the fluctuation
the fluctuation comes for example where

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:33.330
the fluctuation comes for example where
 

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.180
the fluctuation comes for example where
the average where the rainfall for the

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:35.190
the average where the rainfall for the
 

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:38.360
the average where the rainfall for the
year may drop as low as 50 millimeters

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:38.370
year may drop as low as 50 millimeters
 

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.870
year may drop as low as 50 millimeters
or rise to 2,000 in the same location

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880
or rise to 2,000 in the same location
 

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.360
or rise to 2,000 in the same location
where the average is 650 so that's

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:44.370
where the average is 650 so that's
 

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.160
where the average is 650 so that's
pretty spectacular what's more

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:46.170
pretty spectacular what's more
 

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.050
pretty spectacular what's more
spectacular about it is the climate

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:48.060
spectacular about it is the climate
 

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.440
spectacular about it is the climate
context of these changes are these years

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:51.450

can come in not randomly here and there

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:54.180
can come in not randomly here and there
 

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.970
can come in not randomly here and there
but they can come in rows so you can get

but they can come in rows so you can get
 

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.890
but they can come in rows so you can get
five years in a row where you are wiped

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:57.900
five years in a row where you are wiped
 

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.040
five years in a row where you are wiped
out by floods 10 years in a row the

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:01.050
out by floods 10 years in a row the

biblical seven and seven could be a

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880
biblical seven and seven could be a
 

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.970
biblical seven and seven could be a
better example perhaps but that's what

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:04.980
better example perhaps but that's what
 

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.370
better example perhaps but that's what
happens in these places and that's that

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380
happens in these places and that's that
 

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.620
happens in these places and that's that
makes for a significant challenge that's

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:09.630
makes for a significant challenge that's
 

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.210
makes for a significant challenge that's
what I'm going to call interannual

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:11.220
what I'm going to call interannual
 

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.120
what I'm going to call interannual
variability or across here's what's also

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:14.130
variability or across here's what's also
 

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.160
variability or across here's what's also
remarkable in these places is that

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:16.170
remarkable in these places is that
 

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:19.610
remarkable in these places is that
typically you may only get 10 to 20

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620
typically you may only get 10 to 20
 

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.250
typically you may only get 10 to 20
rainfall events in a given year and it

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:22.260
rainfall events in a given year and it
 

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.750
rainfall events in a given year and it
doesn't matter whether it was a dry year

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760
doesn't matter whether it was a dry year
 

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.570
doesn't matter whether it was a dry year
or a wet here so now imagine picking up

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580
or a wet here so now imagine picking up
 

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.580
or a wet here so now imagine picking up
two meters of rainfall in a place which

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:28.590
two meters of rainfall in a place which
 

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:31.030
two meters of rainfall in a place which
is very arid so it doesn't have much

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:31.040
is very arid so it doesn't have much
 

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.100
is very arid so it doesn't have much
landscaping or ecology and suddenly you

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:34.110
landscaping or ecology and suddenly you
 

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:38.540
landscaping or ecology and suddenly you
get these dumps in 10 to 20 events this

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:38.550
get these dumps in 10 to 20 events this
 

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.550
get these dumps in 10 to 20 events this
doesn't make for the best living

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:40.560
doesn't make for the best living
 

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.580
doesn't make for the best living
conditions it leads to situations where

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:43.590
conditions it leads to situations where
 

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.530
conditions it leads to situations where
agriculture is difficult which means

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:45.540
agriculture is difficult which means
 

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.990
agriculture is difficult which means
food is hard to come by it makes for a

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000
food is hard to come by it makes for a
 

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.990
food is hard to come by it makes for a
situation in which disease whether it is

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000
situation in which disease whether it is
 

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.030
situation in which disease whether it is
vector-borne disease or waterborne

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:53.040
vector-borne disease or waterborne
 

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.940
vector-borne disease or waterborne
disease is rampant and that's the

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:55.950
disease is rampant and that's the
 

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.100
disease is rampant and that's the
challenge of water that comes in these

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:58.110
challenge of water that comes in these
 

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.070
challenge of water that comes in these
places so how do we deal with these

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080
places so how do we deal with these
 

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.630
places so how do we deal with these
challenges you know this is just the

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640
challenges you know this is just the
 

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.120
challenges you know this is just the
first part of the story so let's imagine

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:05.130
first part of the story so let's imagine
 

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.220
first part of the story so let's imagine
first that we are in the drive phase of

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:07.230
first that we are in the drive phase of
 

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:11.720
first that we are in the drive phase of
this climatic cycle so you could get

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:11.730
this climatic cycle so you could get
 

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.550
this climatic cycle so you could get
water through groundwater which means

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:13.560
water through groundwater which means
 

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.040
water through groundwater which means
you need to have some form of energy to

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:16.050
you need to have some form of energy to
 

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:19.460
you need to have some form of energy to
extract that okay if you are in the wet

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:19.470
extract that okay if you are in the wet
 

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:21.740
extract that okay if you are in the wet
face maybe it's not such a big issue but

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:21.750
face maybe it's not such a big issue but
 

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.420
face maybe it's not such a big issue but
then the quality of the water becomes an

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:23.430
then the quality of the water becomes an
 

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.550
then the quality of the water becomes an
issue so this is the challenge what is

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:25.560
issue so this is the challenge what is
 

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.160
issue so this is the challenge what is
this challenge translate into some work

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:28.170
this challenge translate into some work
 

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.990
this challenge translate into some work
we did a few years at a global scale

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000
we did a few years at a global scale
 

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.830
we did a few years at a global scale
showed us the following if you looked at

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840
showed us the following if you looked at
 

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.950
showed us the following if you looked at
every single country in the world and

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960
every single country in the world and
 

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.419
every single country in the world and
characterized it by average annual

00:31:38.419 --> 00:31:38.429
characterized it by average annual
 

00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:42.410
characterized it by average annual
rainfall by the across here variability

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:42.420

in rainfall

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440
in rainfall
 

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.200
in rainfall
and by the within year variability in

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:45.210
and by the within year variability in
 

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.080
and by the within year variability in
rainfall we learned that the poorest

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.090
rainfall we learned that the poorest
 

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.480
rainfall we learned that the poorest
countries in the world were the ones

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:50.490
countries in the world were the ones
 

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.539
countries in the world were the ones
that had high variability in rainfall

00:31:53.539 --> 00:31:53.549
that had high variability in rainfall
 

00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:56.149
that had high variability in rainfall
across years high variability in rain

00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159
across years high variability in rain
 

00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:58.159
across years high variability in rain
fall within the years and it didn't

00:31:58.159 --> 00:31:58.169
fall within the years and it didn't
 

00:31:58.169 --> 00:31:59.659
fall within the years and it didn't
really matter so much what the average

00:31:59.659 --> 00:31:59.669
really matter so much what the average
 

00:31:59.669 --> 00:32:02.269
really matter so much what the average
annual rainfall was you know so that's

00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279
annual rainfall was you know so that's
 

00:32:02.279 --> 00:32:05.720
annual rainfall was you know so that's
interesting the exception to that story

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:05.730
interesting the exception to that story
 

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.129
interesting the exception to that story
is of course the countries that have a

00:32:07.129 --> 00:32:07.139
is of course the countries that have a
 

00:32:07.139 --> 00:32:10.129
is of course the countries that have a
lot of oil by the same token if you go

00:32:10.129 --> 00:32:10.139
lot of oil by the same token if you go
 

00:32:10.139 --> 00:32:12.379

that you can measure in terms of income
and we see that so that's the challenge

00:32:35.419 --> 00:32:35.429
and we see that so that's the challenge
 

00:32:35.429 --> 00:32:37.669
and we see that so that's the challenge
now how can we address this challenge

00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679
now how can we address this challenge
 

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:39.769
now how can we address this challenge
and that's what we are doing in the

the breadbasket of india so it's sort of

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:52.169
the breadbasket of india so it's sort of
 

00:32:52.169 --> 00:32:54.320
the breadbasket of india so it's sort of
odd to think that that's a dry land but

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:54.330
odd to think that that's a dry land but
 

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.080
odd to think that that's a dry land but
it is and so if a dry land can become

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:57.090
it is and so if a dry land can become
 

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:00.110
it is and so if a dry land can become

as India you think there is hope that
 

00:33:03.259 --> 00:33:08.749
as India you think there is hope that
hope is tempered by the fact that Punjab

00:33:08.749 --> 00:33:08.759

way so my story that if you have access

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720
way so my story that if you have access
 

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.509

groundwater is a good one but everything

00:33:20.119 --> 00:33:20.129
groundwater is a good one but everything
 

00:33:20.129 --> 00:33:22.850
groundwater is a good one but everything
must be done in moderation and that's

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:22.860
must be done in moderation and that's
 

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.379
must be done in moderation and that's
hard to do once you have access to

00:33:24.379 --> 00:33:24.389
hard to do once you have access to
 

00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:27.680
hard to do once you have access to
technology so that's the challenge to

of course this is the place that is

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:11.730
of course this is the place that is
 

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.819
of course this is the place that is
known for floods and in fact the first

00:34:13.819 --> 00:34:13.829
known for floods and in fact the first

purpose of building the Three Gorges Dam
is to control floods but if you go into

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:18.210
is to control floods but if you go into

examples that are advanced in a state of
 

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:38.149
examples that are advanced in a state of

their priority therefore it is hard for
 

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:58.460
their priority therefore it is hard for
them to settle down and help schools and

00:40:58.460 --> 00:40:58.470
them to settle down and help schools and
 

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:01.430

the things which the rest of the country
 

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:09.590
the things which the rest of the country
has the second one is conflict they

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:09.600
has the second one is conflict they
 

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.920

conflicting raiding cattle there are

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240
conflicting raiding cattle there are
 

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.140
conflicting raiding cattle there are
several ethnic groups in the area and

several ethnic groups in the area and
 

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.110
several ethnic groups in the area and
they are all cut rocky paths and they

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:24.120
they are all cut rocky paths and they
 

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:29.630
they are all cut rocky paths and they
raid cattle from one another and this

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640
raid cattle from one another and this
 

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.930
raid cattle from one another and this
creates conflict and conflict is one of

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:32.940
creates conflict and conflict is one of
 

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.000
creates conflict and conflict is one of
the factors therefore which has kept the

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.010
the factors therefore which has kept the
 

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.240
the factors therefore which has kept the
region behind lagging behind in terms of

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:38.250
region behind lagging behind in terms of
 

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:44.030
region behind lagging behind in terms of
development the third one we must admit

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040
development the third one we must admit
 

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:49.900
development the third one we must admit
is that the government in the past have

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:49.910

tended to marginalize the region and to
 

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.160
tended to marginalize the region and to
keep it on the periphery in terms of

keep it on the periphery in terms of
 

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:01.850
keep it on the periphery in terms of
planning because the rest of the country

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:01.860
planning because the rest of the country
 

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:06.170
