00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
So our next class of
biomolecule that we're going to

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.431
talk about are
nucleic acids.

00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:12.444
And we can, for the most part,
describe their properties

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:17.517
by considering just covalent
bonds and hydrogen bonds.

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.819
Although,
that's a bit of an

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:23.093
oversimplification.

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:26.911
But, anyway,
these are, again,

00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:27.982
polymers.

00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:32.625
So this is DNA and RNA,
terms you've

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.110
undoubtedly heard.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.770
And these are made by splitting
out water.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.846
And,
in this case,

00:00:43.846 --> 00:00:51.125
the monomeric units are given
the special term

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:52.714
nucleotide.

00:00:52.714 --> 00:01:00.375
And a nucleotide consists of a
sugar with something

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:03.329
called a base on it.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.500
It's got a phosphate group at
one

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.181
end and a hydroxyl group,
one of the sugar hydroxyls that

00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:25.000
we saw the
other day at the other end.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.750
The B stands for base.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.500
And the way the bond is formed,
as I

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.985
said, is by splitting out water
like that to form what's known

00:01:36.985 --> 00:01:38.970
as a
phosphodiester bond.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.500
And we'll be talking a lot
about those when we

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.045
talk about DNA and RNA in more
detail later on in the course.

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:49.428
The
sugars are pentoses where N

00:01:49.428 --> 00:01:50.071
equals 5.

00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:53.269
We were talking about these the
other day.

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:55.653
The base goes in this position.

00:01:55.653 --> 00:01:59.459
That's the 1 position
of the carbon.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.605
This is the 5 position of the
carbon.

00:02:04.605 --> 00:02:09.441
And this is where the phosphate
is located.

00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:12.919
This sugar is
called ribose.

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.827
And then RNA,
which is the polymer of

00:02:16.827 --> 00:02:22.256
nucleotides that
have ribose as the sugar is

00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:26.598
ribonucleic acid or RNA,
as you've

00:02:26.598 --> 00:02:27.562
known it.

00:02:27.562 --> 00:02:33.342
If this hydroxyl here is
replaced by a hydrogen and the

00:02:33.342 --> 00:02:44.000
rest
of it's the same --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.184
-- this is deoxyribonucleoside.

00:02:47.184 --> 00:02:51.500
And if you polymerize that
together then

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.000
you get DNA or deoxyribonucleic
acid.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.109
The bases come in two flavors.

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.359
And this will be on your
handout.

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.767
Ones
that either have two rings,

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:07.066
adenine or guanine.

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:10.870
And the general term of
those is purine or they have

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.535
one ring of pyrimidine.

00:03:12.535 --> 00:03:15.876
And in DNA one
finds cytidine and thiamine

00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:17.673
abbreviated as C and T.

00:03:17.673 --> 00:03:20.870
Or in RNA,
instead of finding thiamine you

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.614
find uracil, which is the same
except

00:03:23.614 --> 00:03:28.538
that it doesn't have the methyl
group that's present at this

00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:30.443
position on thiamine.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:33.800
And the important thing about
these

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.360
particular nucleotide bases is
that they can form hydrogen

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.740
bonds in a
very special way.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.000
It's diagramed on here that
this is a guanine pairing

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.510
with the cytidine,
so a G pairing with a C.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.766
And you can form three
hydrogen bonds.

00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:55.266
Or between an A,
an adenine and a thiamine you

00:03:55.266 --> 00:03:58.006
can form
two hydrogen bonds.

00:03:58.006 --> 00:04:01.332
Those are just the things we
were

00:04:01.332 --> 00:04:03.865
diagramming on the board the
other day.

00:04:03.865 --> 00:04:07.469
And those are the forces that
hold the strands of DNA

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.025
together so that DNA is the
double helix,

00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:11.029
as you
know.

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.820
It's basically a backbone with
sugars and phosphates.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.420
And
then there'll be some sequence

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.744
of bases down this.

00:04:18.744 --> 00:04:22.291
And then on the
other strand you'll have the

00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:25.991
base that can form hydrogen
bonds with this.

00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:29.057
So C, there would be three
hydrogen

00:04:29.057 --> 00:04:29.744
bonds here.

00:04:29.744 --> 00:04:33.173
This would be a G on this side,
again, three hydrogen

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:33.554
bonds.

00:04:33.554 --> 00:04:36.278
If there's an A here that will
be a T there,

00:04:36.278 --> 00:04:37.650
two hydrogen
bonds.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.545
And so on down.

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:41.410
And we'll talk about the
implications of this

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.680
later in the course when we
talk about DNA replication,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.051
but for the
moment I think your eye can

00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:49.646
see, you can probably see that
the geometric

00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:52.150
arrangement of these is just
exactly the same,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.875
whether it's a G-C or it's
an A-T base pair.

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:57.882
You can superimpose them,
and they have just

00:04:57.882 --> 00:05:02.000
exactly the same molecular
structure.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.337
And that's really crucial for a
lot of things having to do with

00:05:05.337 --> 00:05:05.713
DNA.

00:05:05.713 --> 00:05:08.189
So, as you know,
it's not just sort of a ladder

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:09.427
with hydrogen bonds.

00:05:09.427 --> 00:05:11.311
It's twisted in 3-dimensional
space.

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.603
That's the double helix.

00:05:12.603 --> 00:05:14.780
And in
that little movie I showed you

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.855
the nitrogen atoms and the bases
are

00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:19.884
blue so you can pretty much
pick it out that there's a

00:05:19.884 --> 00:05:22.214
series of
hydrogen bonds going right down

00:05:22.214 --> 00:05:24.283
the middle of a DNA molecule
with the

00:05:24.283 --> 00:05:28.000
phosphoribose backbone on the
outside.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.473
So every one of your cells,
since you have about 3 billion

00:05:31.473 --> 00:05:34.022
base pairs
you have two point something

00:05:34.022 --> 00:05:36.531
times that many hydrogen bonds
holding

00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:37.678
your DNA together.

00:05:37.678 --> 00:05:40.798
The thing to remember about the
strength of the

00:05:40.798 --> 00:05:43.412
hydrogen bond,
it's about a twentieth a

00:05:43.412 --> 00:05:45.064
covalent bond,
and so

00:05:45.064 --> 00:05:48.848
you're able to pull those
things apart and then put them

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.108
back
together at physiological

00:05:51.108 --> 00:05:53.598
temperature while leaving all
the

00:05:53.598 --> 00:05:57.865
covalent bonds that make up
each strand of the DNA leaving

00:05:57.865 --> 00:05:59.095
those intact.

00:05:59.095 --> 00:06:02.500
It's also possible,
since RNAs are

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.810
usually single-stranded,
that if you have a little

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.779
sequence here that has
the complimentary sequence over

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:12.500
there then these can pair like
this

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.439
forming a hairpin or some
little structure like that.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:19.612
And, again,
we'll talk about transfer RNAs

00:06:19.612 --> 00:06:22.500
which play a really key role in
protein

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.269
synthesis.

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:27.500
They're the little translators
that go back and forth

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.357
between the nucleic acid code,
the genetic code and the

00:06:31.357 --> 00:06:34.241
protein code,
which is written in amino

00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:34.658
acids.

00:06:34.658 --> 00:06:37.166
And this just shows making an
RNA

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:40.535
copy for a tRNA gene from the
DNA, but then these are the

00:06:40.535 --> 00:06:43.002
relationships
between the complimentary

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:44.868
sequences right in that strand.

00:06:44.868 --> 00:06:47.743
So this thing
is able to fold up into a sort

00:06:47.743 --> 00:06:50.165
of cloverleaf structure that
some of

00:06:50.165 --> 00:06:53.185
you have certainly probably
seen at some point.

00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:56.232
It's a little bit
twisted here because you can

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:58.833
see how the complimentary
sequences have

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:00.220
found each other.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.017
And even though this is just a
single strand of RNA,

00:07:04.017 --> 00:07:06.499
by forming hydrogen bonds to
complimentary

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:09.080
sequences within itself it can
take up a structure.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.165
And I'll show you.

00:07:10.165 --> 00:07:12.558
It actually goes on,
there are some other forces

00:07:12.558 --> 00:07:13.220
that come in.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.812
And this
will fold up into a

00:07:14.812 --> 00:07:17.497
3-dimensional structure that
goes even beyond what

00:07:17.497 --> 00:07:19.874
I've shown you,
but we won't need to talk about

00:07:19.874 --> 00:07:30.000
that for just a little
bit. OK. So then the next --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.235
-- class of molecules that
we're going to spend a lot of

00:07:33.235 --> 00:07:35.391
this course
on are proteins.

00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:48.185
And these are polymers again.
-- made by splitting out water.

00:07:48.185 --> 00:07:51.399
So
that's been true of

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:53.000
polysaccharides.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.699
It's true of nucleic acids.

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:58.516
It's
true of proteins.

00:07:58.516 --> 00:08:03.500
In this case the monomers are
structures

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.151
known as amino acids.

00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:09.813
And they have an amino group.

00:08:09.813 --> 00:08:13.647
And
then it's joined to a carbon

00:08:13.647 --> 00:08:16.504
known as the alpha carbon.

00:08:16.504 --> 00:08:20.301
And then
there's a carboxyl group.

00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:24.855
So this is why they're called
amino acids,

00:08:24.855 --> 00:08:32.000
because their carboxyl group is
an acid.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:42.269
And the way they form --
We'll give these different side

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:43.535
chains here.

00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:48.578
I'll tell you about
these side chains in just a

00:08:48.578 --> 00:08:49.284
minute.

00:08:49.284 --> 00:08:55.161
The way these form a bond is by
splitting out water here.

00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:59.570
And then this will give this
very important

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:13.769
bond in nature --
-- which is known as the

00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:14.727
peptide bond.

00:09:14.727 --> 00:09:18.051
And there's a chemical
property of this that's

00:09:18.051 --> 00:09:18.695
important.

00:09:18.695 --> 00:09:21.142
Someone was bemoaning the fact
that

00:09:21.142 --> 00:09:25.712
I had to go over a bunch of
chemistry and they hadn't liked

00:09:25.712 --> 00:09:26.151
5.011.

00:09:26.151 --> 00:09:27.102
My apologies.

00:09:27.102 --> 00:09:29.881
But we won't be spending all
course

00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:30.706
doing chemistry.

00:09:30.706 --> 00:09:33.645
But if you want to understand
how these things work you

00:09:33.645 --> 00:09:36.690
do need to understand some of
the chemical principles to

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.675
understand
them.

00:09:37.675 --> 00:09:40.537
And this is a case where it's
really important because,

00:09:40.537 --> 00:09:42.884
although
it's written this way with the

00:09:42.884 --> 00:09:44.937
double bond here and a single
bond

00:09:44.937 --> 00:09:47.841
there, this double bond
actually sort of spends part of

00:09:47.841 --> 00:09:48.971
its time over
here.

00:09:48.971 --> 00:09:51.607
So this is actually sort of a
partial double bond.

00:09:51.607 --> 00:09:53.858
And that has
an important consequence

00:09:53.858 --> 00:09:56.234
because if you're a single bond,
if you

00:09:56.234 --> 00:09:59.494
remember a single bond can bend
and stretch but it can also

00:09:59.494 --> 00:10:00.000
rotate.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.087
But if you're a double bond you
cannot rotate.

00:10:03.087 --> 00:10:06.604
So the peptide bond,
and you make a lot of these

00:10:06.604 --> 00:10:09.331
when you're polymerizing amino
acids

00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:13.186
together to make proteins,
those bonds have a very special

00:10:13.186 --> 00:10:15.597
character
that they cannot rotate.

00:10:15.597 --> 00:10:18.663
Now, let me say,
I'll come back and show you

00:10:18.663 --> 00:10:21.280
why that's important in just a
moment.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.102
But let me just say a word
about the side chains.

00:10:25.102 --> 00:10:28.000
There are 20 different amino
acids.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.032
And they have side chains that
have very different chemical

00:10:31.032 --> 00:10:31.764
properties.

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:34.796
And when we start thinking
about how a chain of amino acids

00:10:34.796 --> 00:10:37.380
take up the
properties that make it into an

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.033
enzyme or part of a motor or a
structural protein or into your

00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:43.056
finger nails or your hair or
skin,

00:10:43.056 --> 00:10:45.430
they have to have very special
properties.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.388
And it's the sequence
of these different amino acids

00:10:48.388 --> 00:10:50.585
with their different chemical
properties

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:54.351
that are eventually going to
let each protein form up to one

00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:58.116
particular 3-dimensional
structure that will give it its

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.747
characteristics.

00:10:59.747 --> 00:11:05.789
So the different types of amino
acids, and again you won't have

00:11:05.789 --> 00:11:09.332
to memorize these,
but here they are up

00:11:09.332 --> 00:11:09.759
here.

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:13.765
But let me just point out the
important classes,

00:11:13.765 --> 00:11:18.310
because the thing
you really want to do with this

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.777
one is to remember the types of
amino

00:11:21.777 --> 00:11:23.332
acids we find.

00:11:23.332 --> 00:11:28.000
There are negatively charged
amino acids.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.125
An example of this would be
aspartate.

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:28.291
Under physiological
conditions, although this is an

00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:28.399
acid, it will dissociate so it
will

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:28.465
have a negative charge.

00:11:28.465 --> 00:11:28.554
And that's abbreviated as
A-S-P.

00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:28.692
Glutamine is
another one that has a negative

00:11:28.692 --> 00:11:28.713
charge.

00:11:28.713 --> 00:11:28.928
There are also amino acids
that have positive charges on

00:11:28.928 --> 00:11:29.000
the side chain.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.924
An example of this would be
lysine which has four methylene

00:11:38.924 --> 00:11:40.635
groups.

00:11:40.635 --> 00:11:46.272
And then it has an amino group.

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:56.150
But, again, under physiological
conditions, around pH 7,

00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:03.908
that will be protonated so it
will have a plus

00:12:03.908 --> 00:12:05.180
charge.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:10.271
And that is lysine or L-Y-S.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:21.174
And arginine and histidine
are two other amino acids that

00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:27.181
have a positive charge,
or can

00:12:27.181 --> 00:12:30.739
have a positive charge.

00:12:30.739 --> 00:12:36.000
Then there's a set of amino
acids

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.507
that have a polar character.

00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:41.194
They don't have a full charge.

00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:43.432
And, as
you might guess,

00:12:43.432 --> 00:12:48.000
they have one of the bonds that
we've talked about

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:56.000
that are polar. This is serine.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:56.424
Serine.

00:12:56.424 --> 00:12:59.332
There's another one that has a
hydroxyl that's

00:12:59.332 --> 00:13:00.647
known as threonine.

00:13:00.647 --> 00:13:03.000
And then there is a glutamine
and

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.434
asparagine, both of which have
an N-H bond.

00:13:05.434 --> 00:13:07.777
So just through what I've
told you here,

00:13:07.777 --> 00:13:11.000
we haven't even been through
the set, you can see how you

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.309
can begin to decorate an amino
acid chain.

00:13:13.309 --> 00:13:15.967
So there's a plus charge and
a minus charge,

00:13:15.967 --> 00:13:16.935
a polar charge.

00:13:16.935 --> 00:13:20.485
There's a tremendous amount of
diversity because at every

00:13:20.485 --> 00:13:23.000
single thing you have a choice
of 20 things

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.869
you can put in.

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:27.000
So they not only have size and
shape characteristics,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
but they have particular
charges and other properties.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.901
Then, as always,
there are a bunch of special,

00:13:36.901 --> 00:13:39.000
oh, excuse me.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Actually, before we do that,
we have hydrophobic.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.965
Or you could think of these as 
greasy or water-hating.

00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:56.399
These are the ones that are
sort of when I was

00:13:56.399 --> 00:14:00.000
talking about trying to
dissolve butter into water.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.383
These are things that don't
like to interact with water or

00:14:04.383 --> 00:14:06.591
cannot
interact with water,

00:14:06.591 --> 00:14:10.152
and so they cannot form
hydrogen bonds so you

00:14:10.152 --> 00:14:13.228
cannot get them to go under
water easily.

00:14:13.228 --> 00:14:17.607
And they come from very
simple ones that have just the

00:14:17.607 --> 00:14:22.364
methyl group which is alanine or
A-L-A or one like this which

00:14:22.364 --> 00:14:25.381
would be CH2-CH with a couple of
methyl

00:14:25.381 --> 00:14:26.078
groups.

00:14:26.078 --> 00:14:30.460
This is even more water-hating,
that would

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.776
be lucine, L-E-U.

00:14:31.776 --> 00:14:35.687
Or here's one that you probably
could guess that really doesn't

00:14:35.687 --> 00:14:36.561
interact with water.

00:14:36.561 --> 00:14:37.850
This is
phenylalanine or P-H-E.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.294
And you can see what this side
chain is.

00:14:39.294 --> 00:14:40.331
It's a
methylene group.

00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:42.331
And what's dangling off it but
a benzene ring.

00:14:42.331 --> 00:14:44.520
And I think most of you
remember from probably beginning

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.401
chemistry
that benzene is something that

00:14:46.401 --> 00:14:49.772
you cannot dissolve sugar
in or something.

00:14:49.772 --> 00:14:52.932
It's an organic solvent.

00:14:52.932 --> 00:14:59.022
It will
only dissolve things that have

00:14:59.022 --> 00:15:03.636
a very hydrophobic character.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:17.000
Then
there are some special cases.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.893
Glycine is one,
because in this case the side

00:15:19.893 --> 00:15:22.158
chain is simply a hydrogen
atom.

00:15:22.158 --> 00:15:26.599
And, as a consequence to that,
this is a very flexible amino

00:15:26.599 --> 00:15:27.006
acid.

00:15:27.006 --> 00:15:31.648
So if you want to build -- If
nature wants to build a loop

00:15:31.648 --> 00:15:34.530
into
a protein, it's going to

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.482
undergo a tight turn.

00:15:36.482 --> 00:15:41.780
You often find glycines
there because there's not a big

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.499
side chain to get in the way if
you're

00:15:45.499 --> 00:15:50.472
going to be bending the chain
in 3-dimensional space.

00:15:50.472 --> 00:15:54.515
Another one is
cysteine, which looks like

00:15:54.515 --> 00:15:58.698
serine over there,
but it has a thiol group

00:15:58.698 --> 00:16:01.350
instead of a hydroxyl group.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.666
And that's important because
that

00:16:04.666 --> 00:16:08.916
allows for the formation of
another special type of bond

00:16:08.916 --> 00:16:12.497
that if you
have one chain of protein that

00:16:12.497 --> 00:16:17.739
has a cysteine on it and another
polypeptide chain that has a

00:16:17.739 --> 00:16:22.098
cysteine on it and they're close
together in space,

00:16:22.098 --> 00:16:25.999
what can happen is you can form
a covalent bond

00:16:25.999 --> 00:16:29.808
between these under oxidative
conditions.

00:16:29.808 --> 00:16:33.359
This is known
as a disulfide bond.

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:34.980
That's covalent.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.528
So those two
chains, if that bond occurs,

00:16:38.528 --> 00:16:41.500
are now sort of
semi-permanently locked

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.142
together.

00:16:42.142 --> 00:16:45.714
They're locked together in a
very, very strong way.

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:47.626
So this
is a feature of,

00:16:47.626 --> 00:16:51.500
this is the only intrastrand
covalent bond that you'd

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.897
characteristically find in
proteins.

00:16:53.897 --> 00:16:56.500
All the rest of them we're
going to

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.176
show you, when they fold up in
3-dimensional space,

00:17:00.176 --> 00:17:03.536
depend on other
kinds of interactions.

00:17:03.536 --> 00:17:06.777
And finally there's one last
case

00:17:06.777 --> 00:17:08.165
which is proline.

00:17:08.165 --> 00:17:12.332
And this one is a little
different because in the

00:17:12.332 --> 00:17:17.478
amino acid the side chain bends
around like this and joins here.

00:17:17.478 --> 00:17:20.451
So
it's actually forming a little

00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:23.442
circle here between the
nitrogen,

00:17:23.442 --> 00:17:29.000
the amino group and the
carboxyl group.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.599
And the consequence of this is
this bond cannot rotate.

00:17:32.599 --> 00:17:35.286
The bond that
would normally be able to

00:17:35.286 --> 00:17:37.230
rotate is not able to do that.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.286
And so this is
the sort of amino acid you find

00:17:40.286 --> 00:17:42.998
that when there are some of
these regular

00:17:42.998 --> 00:17:45.914
structures, I'm going to show
you in a minute,

00:17:45.914 --> 00:17:48.930
like helices and things,
this protein won't,

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.329
this amino acid particularly
won't fit into those

00:17:52.329 --> 00:17:53.200
structures.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.998
So you tend to,
if nature wants to interrupt a

00:17:56.998 --> 00:17:59.683
particular regular structure
that's coming,

00:17:59.683 --> 00:18:04.406
it will often find a proline
right at that particular point.

00:18:04.406 --> 00:18:04.671
OK.

00:18:04.671 --> 00:18:10.671
So what we've talked about up
until now is sort of just the

00:18:10.671 --> 00:18:14.500
very, very basic piece of
protein

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:27.000
structure.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.554
It's what called the primary
structure which is nothing more

00:18:33.554 --> 00:18:37.591
than
the sequence of amino acids.

00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:41.664
However, here's a little piece
of

00:18:41.664 --> 00:18:42.503
protein.

00:18:42.503 --> 00:18:44.598
This is polyalanine.

00:18:44.598 --> 00:18:48.998
And one thing you can sort of
see is if

00:18:48.998 --> 00:18:54.606
I was trying to figure out how
to fold this up into a

00:18:54.606 --> 00:18:57.976
3-dimensional
confirmation.

00:18:57.976 --> 00:19:02.277
And let's say this had 300
amino

00:19:02.277 --> 00:19:05.336
acids or something,
there are essentially an

00:19:05.336 --> 00:19:07.741
infinite number of
confirmations.

00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:11.385
And so one of the real holy
grails still in biology is

00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:15.421
trying to understand if you see
the linear sequence of an amino

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:17.504
acid,
which we can now deduce,

00:19:17.504 --> 00:19:19.847
excuse me, of a protein,
of an amino.

00:19:19.847 --> 00:19:22.348
If you
see the linear sequence of

00:19:22.348 --> 00:19:25.054
amino acids in a protein,
and we can

00:19:25.054 --> 00:19:27.862
deduce those from analyzing
genomes and so on,

00:19:27.862 --> 00:19:31.128
how do we go from a thing
that says a tryptophan,

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:34.164
a cysteine, a serine,
a serine, a threonine,

00:19:34.164 --> 00:19:37.633
whatever down the chain to
finding its 3-dimensional

00:19:37.633 --> 00:19:40.353
structure and
ultimately its role?

00:19:40.353 --> 00:19:43.375
And you can sort of hopefully
get a

00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:46.121
sense from this of why it's
important.

00:19:46.121 --> 00:19:48.479
So there are levels this
goes.

00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:52.236
The next level is what's known
as secondary structure.

00:19:52.236 --> 00:19:55.001
These
are regions of local secondary

00:19:55.001 --> 00:19:57.625
structure and they're determined
by

00:19:57.625 --> 00:19:58.960
hydrogen bonds.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.076
And I'll show you how these go
in

00:20:02.076 --> 00:20:02.918
just a second.

00:20:02.918 --> 00:20:06.230
And then you can think about
proteins in the tertiary

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.815
structure.

00:20:06.815 --> 00:20:10.384
So what we've done and sort of
taken a chain and then found

00:20:10.384 --> 00:20:13.268
out how a little region might
take up a particular,

00:20:13.268 --> 00:20:14.538
for example,
here's

00:20:14.538 --> 00:20:16.176
a portion that's in a helix.

00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:18.692
This is fairly rigid right now
because of

00:20:18.692 --> 00:20:20.317
the way it's held together.

00:20:20.317 --> 00:20:22.846
And we'll then find maybe
another region

00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:27.000
like a beta sheet I'm going to
show you in a minute.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.537
Ultimately we have to figure
out how all these units fold up

00:20:31.537 --> 00:20:34.023
into a
3-dimensional structure.

00:20:34.023 --> 00:20:37.460
And what we get there is called
the tertiary

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.229
structure.

00:20:38.229 --> 00:20:42.690
And this has some other forces
we're going to talk about

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.983
besides covalent bonds and
hydrogen bonds that determine

00:20:46.983 --> 00:20:47.373
that.

00:20:47.373 --> 00:20:49.855
And
then, as I've tried to tell

00:20:49.855 --> 00:20:53.152
you, you can see that proteins
play a lot of

00:20:53.152 --> 00:20:57.308
roles in nature and they're not
all single proteins running

00:20:57.308 --> 00:21:00.310
around being
an enzyme or something like

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.667
that.

00:21:00.667 --> 00:21:03.307
Many of them are parts of
machines

00:21:03.307 --> 00:21:07.261
so they're made to fit together
in absolutely beautiful ways.

00:21:07.261 --> 00:21:09.910
Some of
them have, at this point,

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.453
fifty-hundred parts that all go
together fitting shapes and

00:21:14.453 --> 00:21:17.152
interacting with these shapes on
the

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:20.159
principles that we'll be
talking about here,

00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:23.673
the different forces
that make things happen in

00:21:23.673 --> 00:21:24.185
nature.

00:21:24.185 --> 00:21:28.650
And so quaternary means the
structure when there's more

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.000
than one polypeptide chain.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:40.962
So getting a handle on protein 
structure was kind of a very

00:21:40.962 --> 00:21:43.998
important intractable problem
for a

00:21:43.998 --> 00:21:48.280
long time because it was just
too hard a nut to crack,

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.229
but in the
1930s and 1940s x-ray

00:21:51.229 --> 00:21:54.664
crystallography started to come
into

00:21:54.664 --> 00:22:00.000
usage where basically you'd
bounce x-rays off of a crystal.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.645
And then they would refract and
you'd see characteristic

00:22:03.645 --> 00:22:04.319
reflections.

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:07.291
And you could work backwards to
figure out what the

00:22:07.291 --> 00:22:08.802
structure of the crystal was.

00:22:08.802 --> 00:22:10.938
This had been applied to
minerals and a

00:22:10.938 --> 00:22:13.333
lot of structure,
but it hadn't been applied to

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:13.802
proteins.

00:22:13.802 --> 00:22:16.043
When people
started to look they found

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:18.231
there were certain proteins that
gave

00:22:18.231 --> 00:22:19.873
characteristic reflections.

00:22:19.873 --> 00:22:21.150
Keratin, for example.

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.134
Your hair
gives a characteristic

00:22:23.134 --> 00:22:24.958
reflection around 5.4 angstroms.

00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:27.033
So that
suggested that there was a

00:22:27.033 --> 00:22:29.174
repeating unit somewhere in
keratin

00:22:29.174 --> 00:22:30.312
that had this.

00:22:30.312 --> 00:22:33.400
And, again, with artificial
peptides

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.910
sometimes they were able to see
these reflections.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:40.561
And so that was
where things stood for a while.

00:22:40.561 --> 00:22:44.341
And then one of these secondary
structures, a very,

00:22:44.341 --> 00:22:47.799
very important one known as the
alpha helix was

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:49.618
deduced by Linus Pauling.

00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:51.799
Some of you have heard of him.

00:22:51.799 --> 00:22:54.382
He was a
famous chemist at Caltech.

00:22:54.382 --> 00:22:55.960
He got the Nobel prize.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.581
He also got famous
later in his career because he

00:22:59.581 --> 00:23:02.200
championed the use of vitamin C
to

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.430
cure every ill known to
mankind, including the common

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:07.000
cold.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.214
Although there's some merit to
what Linus stated,

00:23:10.214 --> 00:23:13.913
he probably overstated
some of those later findings,

00:23:13.913 --> 00:23:16.776
but his contributions to the
underlying

00:23:16.776 --> 00:23:20.656
chemistry and biochemistry of
proteins was amazing.

00:23:20.656 --> 00:23:24.025
And he was
the one that figured out the

00:23:24.025 --> 00:23:28.338
structure that explained the
5.4 angstrom repeat.

00:23:28.338 --> 00:23:31.461
And it was kind of an
interesting

00:23:31.461 --> 00:23:31.908
story.

00:23:31.908 --> 00:23:33.772
He was in Oxford,
England.

00:23:33.772 --> 00:23:34.966
And he got sick.

00:23:34.966 --> 00:23:38.023
I think it was
some time in the winter.

00:23:38.023 --> 00:23:41.305
And he got bored reading
detective books after

00:23:41.305 --> 00:23:45.475
a while so he thought he'd try
and figure out the structure of

00:23:45.475 --> 00:23:48.064
proteins
that gave rise to this

00:23:48.064 --> 00:23:49.900
characteristic repeat.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.747
So he made a
simplifying assumption.

00:23:52.747 --> 00:23:56.076
He decided he'd forget all the
side chains and

00:23:56.076 --> 00:24:00.452
just focus on this peptide
backbone just with the peptide

00:24:00.452 --> 00:24:01.000
bond.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.501
And he was a chemist.

00:24:02.501 --> 00:24:04.860
And he knew,
what I just told you,

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.292
that this had
a partial double bond character

00:24:08.292 --> 00:24:09.865
so it couldn't rotate.

00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:13.690
And he reasoned
that this was held together by,

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:18.520
since these things could form
hydrogen bonds that this was

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.439
probably forming a hydrogen bond
with a carboxyl group of some

00:24:23.439 --> 00:24:26.383
other amino acid and this was
probably

00:24:26.383 --> 00:24:31.461
forming a hydrogen bond with an
amino group of a different

00:24:31.461 --> 00:24:32.438
amino acid.

00:24:32.438 --> 00:24:35.461
And so what he did was he made
a

00:24:35.461 --> 00:24:39.383
sort of chain like this and he
started to pleat it at the alpha

00:24:39.383 --> 00:24:42.692
carbon, which is the one that
has the side chain on it,

00:24:42.692 --> 00:24:44.646
and was
trying to find the structure

00:24:44.646 --> 00:24:45.940
that would let him do this.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.679
And
basically what he found was

00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:50.152
that if he made a helix that
looks something

00:24:50.152 --> 00:24:53.149
like this, right-handed helix,
and he could get a repeat

00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:57.346
structure that
allowed him to form a hydrogen

00:24:57.346 --> 00:24:58.000
bond.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.102
And the repeating unit was 5.4
angstroms and 3.7,

00:25:02.102 --> 00:25:04.888
excuse me, amino
acids per turn.

00:25:04.888 --> 00:25:07.212
And it's a right-handed helix.

00:25:07.212 --> 00:25:10.478
It's the same
sort of thing if you're trying

00:25:10.478 --> 00:25:11.761
to turn in a screw.

00:25:11.761 --> 00:25:14.228
It's got that kind
of structure.

00:25:14.228 --> 00:25:18.343
And this shows you a little
movie of an alpha helix.

00:25:18.343 --> 00:25:20.883
You
can see this is just showing

00:25:20.883 --> 00:25:21.800
the backbone.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.597
So this is the part you
can look right down the end of

00:25:25.597 --> 00:25:25.793
it.

00:25:25.793 --> 00:25:28.213
See how you can look right
though?

00:25:28.213 --> 00:25:31.969
And you can see how the
hydrogen bonds are formed by

00:25:31.969 --> 00:25:34.666
turning this
thing into this regular

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:35.391
structure.

00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:38.000
And the neat thing about this
then

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.598
is if you put on the side
chains, and you can put them on

00:25:43.598 --> 00:25:45.870
in any
order, you can build a

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.925
tremendous amount of diversity
even within that

00:25:48.925 --> 00:25:50.098
helical structure.

00:25:50.098 --> 00:25:51.661
I think I can stop this.

00:25:51.661 --> 00:25:55.393
I just want to show you
one thing, if I can manage to

00:25:55.393 --> 00:25:57.784
this when it comes around again.

00:25:57.784 --> 00:25:58.982
Stop it there.

00:25:58.982 --> 00:26:02.066
One of the things you can see,
now

00:26:02.066 --> 00:26:03.854
we're looking down the helix.

00:26:03.854 --> 00:26:06.198
And although you won't
recognize the

00:26:06.198 --> 00:26:08.832
structures of all the amino
acids right away,

00:26:08.832 --> 00:26:11.650
you may be able to see
in this particular one.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.462
Here are a couple of aromatic
rings off on this

00:26:14.462 --> 00:26:14.762
side.

00:26:14.762 --> 00:26:17.878
So this side of the helix
wouldn't like to see water,

00:26:17.878 --> 00:26:20.481
and over
here are a bunch of charged and

00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:21.575
polar amino acids.

00:26:21.575 --> 00:26:24.288
So you could see
how you could build into a

00:26:24.288 --> 00:26:26.865
helix like that,
a surface, one part that

00:26:26.865 --> 00:26:30.491
wouldn't like to interact with
water and another part that

00:26:30.491 --> 00:26:31.000
would.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.518
So that was an extremely
important contribution.

00:26:34.518 --> 00:26:38.556
And there are alpha
helices in almost all proteins.

00:26:38.556 --> 00:26:41.332
They'll be in little chunks
coming

00:26:41.332 --> 00:26:43.463
down an amino acids chain.

00:26:43.463 --> 00:26:46.498
But they'll take up that
structure.

00:26:46.498 --> 00:26:49.965
And, as you can see,
it's driven by these hydrogen

00:26:49.965 --> 00:26:52.712
bonds that we've been
talking about.

00:26:52.712 --> 00:26:56.832
There turns out then to be a
second type of secondary

00:26:56.832 --> 00:26:59.464
structure that's important.

00:26:59.464 --> 00:27:02.000
It's called a beta sheet.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.013
And in this case you can either
line up two polypeptide chains

00:27:07.013 --> 00:27:09.909
running in
the same orientation,

00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:13.181
amino to carboxyl,
amino to carboxyl,

00:27:13.181 --> 00:27:16.526
or you
can run them in opposite

00:27:16.526 --> 00:27:20.000
orientations,
amino to carboxyl,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.238
amino to carboxyl in the other
way.

00:27:23.238 --> 00:27:28.347
The latter one is called an
anti-parallel beta sheet.

00:27:28.347 --> 00:27:31.727
And if you line things up this
way

00:27:31.727 --> 00:27:35.600
you'll see you can find
hydrogen bonds between the

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.181
chains like that.

00:27:37.181 --> 00:27:41.808
So this allows two things to
form in this way and gives a

00:27:41.808 --> 00:27:44.203
sort of
sheet-like structure.

00:27:44.203 --> 00:27:48.088
Whereas, that alpha helix has
this tight coil like

00:27:48.088 --> 00:27:48.473
this.

00:27:48.473 --> 00:27:52.468
So over here I think we have a
movie of a beta sheet.

00:27:52.468 --> 00:27:57.669
And you'll
see again you can build up more

00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:59.000
than one.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.361
Because if you look up here you
can see how you are all set up

00:28:03.361 --> 00:28:06.261
to form
more hydrogen bonds out in that

00:28:06.261 --> 00:28:07.107
kind of way.

00:28:07.107 --> 00:28:09.152
And, as I said,
you can do

00:28:09.152 --> 00:28:13.752
this same trick putting the
polypeptide chains so they have

00:28:13.752 --> 00:28:15.321
the
same polarity.

00:28:15.321 --> 00:28:19.305
And so you can approximate,
look at the structure

00:28:19.305 --> 00:28:23.167
of most proteins then by
depicting them either as alpha

00:28:23.167 --> 00:28:27.012
helices, which
you'll see in these diagrams.

00:28:27.012 --> 00:28:31.341
You've already seen a few
in the examples given.

00:28:31.341 --> 00:28:33.307
They'll look like this.

00:28:33.307 --> 00:28:36.282
Or a beta
sheet which are indicated as

00:28:36.282 --> 00:28:37.536
these flat arrows.

00:28:37.536 --> 00:28:40.878
So here's a little
piece of a protein made up of

00:28:40.878 --> 00:28:42.887
alpha helix, these beta sheets.

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:44.598
What this
is, actually,

00:28:44.598 --> 00:28:46.751
is a piece of the BRCA-1 gene.

00:28:46.751 --> 00:28:49.954
That's the familial
susceptibility to breast

00:28:49.954 --> 00:28:50.427
cancer.

00:28:50.427 --> 00:28:52.998
The gene that causes that is
called

00:28:52.998 --> 00:28:53.592
BRCA-1.

00:28:53.592 --> 00:28:57.665
And it has a special
interaction domain called

00:28:57.665 --> 00:28:59.010
the BRC T domain.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.750
This is the structure.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.474
And the only
point I'm trying to make,

00:29:03.474 --> 00:29:05.810
it's of a protein that's
involved in

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.146
preventing you from getting
breast cancer.

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:11.137
If you get a mutation in
it, or particularly in this

00:29:11.137 --> 00:29:13.558
region, for example,
you can end up with an

00:29:13.558 --> 00:29:15.930
increased susceptibility to
breast cancer.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.797
But what is it?

00:29:16.797 --> 00:29:18.858
It's an
alpha helices beta sheet.

00:29:18.858 --> 00:29:20.739
There's green fluorescent
protein.

00:29:20.739 --> 00:29:22.527
You've
seen that a few times.

00:29:22.527 --> 00:29:25.184
Maybe now you'll recognize it's
mostly made of

00:29:25.184 --> 00:29:25.849
beta sheets.

00:29:25.849 --> 00:29:28.396
There's a little bit of alpha
helix down there,

00:29:28.396 --> 00:29:30.250
a little
bit right there.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:33.000
And that has the property that
we've

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.623
talked about of fluorescing.

00:29:34.623 --> 00:29:37.000
This is a protein I'll tell you
later on

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.848
that recognizes mismatches in
DNA, and you get a

00:29:39.848 --> 00:29:42.142
susceptibility to
cancer if it breaks.

00:29:42.142 --> 00:29:45.000
The only thing you notice here
are a lot of alpha

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:45.888
helices in it.

00:29:45.888 --> 00:29:49.000
And hopefully already your eye
can begin to pick

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.606
these out.

00:29:49.606 --> 00:29:50.696
This is an enzyme.

00:29:50.696 --> 00:29:53.000
What it does is it's got a
catalytic

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.545
ability to cleave other
polypeptide chains.

00:29:55.545 --> 00:29:57.776
The functions of these
don't matter.

00:29:57.776 --> 00:30:01.000
But you can see once again
alpha helices beta sheets.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.335
Here's another one.

00:30:02.335 --> 00:30:05.359
It looks just about the same,
alpha helices,

00:30:05.359 --> 00:30:07.742
beta
sheets, except in this case

00:30:07.742 --> 00:30:10.844
this is the human gene known as,
the protein

00:30:10.844 --> 00:30:13.198
encoded by human genes called
RAS.

00:30:13.198 --> 00:30:14.553
That's an oncogene.

00:30:14.553 --> 00:30:17.431
That's a gene
that if it mutates in a

00:30:17.431 --> 00:30:20.690
particular way will cause the
cell that has

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.792
that to move a step down the
pathway to cancer.

00:30:23.792 --> 00:30:27.950
So what I've done is put
up a whole lot of structures

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:32.145
that have some alpha helices,
some beta sheets.

00:30:32.145 --> 00:30:35.453
But you can get the idea that
you

00:30:35.453 --> 00:30:38.511
can get very,
very different biological

00:30:38.511 --> 00:30:42.297
activities from just
depending on how you arrange

00:30:42.297 --> 00:30:42.712
those.

00:30:42.712 --> 00:30:42.919
OK.

00:30:42.919 --> 00:30:47.413
So there are a couple of other
then forces that I need to tell

00:30:47.413 --> 00:30:50.179
you about if we're going to go
all the

00:30:50.179 --> 00:30:54.138
way to understanding the
3-dimensional structure of

00:30:54.138 --> 00:30:55.088
proteins.

00:30:55.088 --> 00:31:00.000
What we can get to from that is
alpha helices beta sheets.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.451
But you saw there were loops,
there were other interactions

00:31:04.451 --> 00:31:06.855
that I
haven't accounted for in

00:31:06.855 --> 00:31:09.855
showing you those 3-dimensional
structures.

00:31:09.855 --> 00:31:12.356
So
one of them is ionic bonds.

00:31:12.356 --> 00:31:14.812
This is the third class of
force.

00:31:14.812 --> 00:31:17.763
This
is an extreme case of electron

00:31:17.763 --> 00:31:20.567
sharing where one atom gets all
of

00:31:20.567 --> 00:31:21.568
the electrons.

00:31:21.568 --> 00:31:24.496
So aspartate,
which I had up on the board,

00:31:24.496 --> 00:31:27.017
aspartic acid
looks like that,

00:31:27.017 --> 00:31:30.855
but under physiological
conditions the oxygen

00:31:30.855 --> 00:31:36.000
will get all the electrons and
you'll have a hydrogen on it.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.266
And a consequence of that then
is that if you have a

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:46.446
polypeptide chain
that over here has an aspartate

00:31:46.446 --> 00:31:50.664
and over here has a lysine,
which is the

00:31:50.664 --> 00:31:55.998
four methylene groups,
and the positively charged

00:31:55.998 --> 00:32:00.911
thing here, you
can get an ionic bond between

00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:05.332
those two amino acids that can
be very far

00:32:05.332 --> 00:32:08.371
apart on the polypeptide chain.

00:32:08.371 --> 00:32:12.000
There may be a lot of amino
acids in

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.782
between, but what they then do
is bring these two points

00:32:16.782 --> 00:32:19.690
together and
hold them like that.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.154
The next class of force is kind
of tricky.

00:32:23.154 --> 00:32:27.103
You may
have heard of it in chemistry.

00:32:27.103 --> 00:32:31.499
It's referred to as van der
Waals interaction.

00:32:31.499 --> 00:32:34.665
And the basis of this,
without going

00:32:34.665 --> 00:32:38.000
into it too much,
is even a nonpolar bond --

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:48.500
-- can have a transient
polarity.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:33:02.619
And this then induces --
-- a transient polarity in a

00:33:02.619 --> 00:33:03.742
nearby bond.

00:33:03.742 --> 00:33:07.555
And it has to be a really
nearby bond.

00:33:07.555 --> 00:33:10.637
So about 0.2 to 0.4 nanometers.

00:33:10.637 --> 00:33:15.145
Remember, covalent
bonds are roughly half that

00:33:15.145 --> 00:33:17.117
distance or something.

00:33:17.117 --> 00:33:21.972
So it's got to be a
very, very close interaction.

00:33:21.972 --> 00:33:22.967
It's weak.

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:28.634
It's only one-third to
one-quarter of a hydrogen bond,

00:33:28.634 --> 00:33:33.845
which you may recall is about
one-twentieth of a covalent

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:34.221
bond.

00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:37.076
But there can be many,
many of them

00:33:37.076 --> 00:33:40.102
if the surfaces fit together
really, really tightly.

00:33:40.102 --> 00:33:41.980
So if you have a
protein fold,

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.384
so there's a surface here,
and then it folds up in such a

00:33:45.384 --> 00:33:48.917
way that there's a surface
here, then you can get a lot of

00:33:48.917 --> 00:33:51.234
van der
Waals interactions down here.

00:33:51.234 --> 00:33:53.692
Now, I've never had a really
good way of

00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:54.669
explaining this.

00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:57.846
But today, part of these
activities of this Hughes

00:33:57.846 --> 00:34:01.137
Professorship,
I've set up some seminars on

00:34:01.137 --> 00:34:02.000
teaching.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.098
And I've invited a guy from
Berkley named Robert Full who is

00:34:07.098 --> 00:34:09.845
talking in
68-180 at 4:00 PM.

00:34:09.845 --> 00:34:14.443
And I borrowed some things from
him this morning.

00:34:14.443 --> 00:34:19.674
And we're just going to take a
quick tour because I want to

00:34:19.674 --> 00:34:21.167
show you
this.

00:34:21.167 --> 00:34:25.382
He works on,
well, he does a lot of things.

00:34:25.382 --> 00:34:30.244
He works on
biomotion and how animals work.

00:34:30.244 --> 00:34:34.141
But one of the things he works
on,

00:34:34.141 --> 00:34:39.159
let's see if we can get this
guy to go here.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:39.743
Oops.

00:34:39.743 --> 00:34:45.669
How do I figure out
how to get it to play here?

00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:47.710
Hang on a second.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:55.547
I just discovered that
the PowerPoint is not really

00:34:55.547 --> 00:34:59.000
terribly effective.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.147
So this isn't working as nicely
as I would like.

00:35:03.147 --> 00:35:03.411
OK.

00:35:03.411 --> 00:35:05.000
Let's try this.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.253
Just a minute.

00:35:06.253 --> 00:35:07.417
Where are we?

00:35:07.417 --> 00:35:08.402
Here we go.

00:35:08.402 --> 00:35:08.671
OK.

00:35:08.671 --> 00:35:11.970
Let's see if I can get
this to go.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:17.000
So he studies a bunch of
things, but he did an undergrad

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.952
project library studying
geckos.

00:35:19.952 --> 00:35:23.685
And here this is a transparent
surface.

00:35:23.685 --> 00:35:28.228
And he's studying how the
geckos climb up and down the

00:35:28.228 --> 00:35:29.000
thing.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.775
And they were making
measurements.

00:35:30.775 --> 00:35:32.873
And they found they couldn't
account

00:35:32.873 --> 00:35:35.253
for why this was such an
efficient organism.

00:35:35.253 --> 00:35:37.702
It used much less energy
than most things,

00:35:37.702 --> 00:35:40.621
so they started looking into
how it adhered to the

00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:41.084
surface.

00:35:41.084 --> 00:35:43.917
It can go up a vertical wall,
as you can see here.

00:35:43.917 --> 00:35:45.714
And so
they were able to look

00:35:45.714 --> 00:35:48.371
underneath and they could see,
see how it sort

00:35:48.371 --> 00:35:49.796
of peels off the surface?

00:35:49.796 --> 00:35:52.246
And this was a robot that they
eventually

00:35:52.246 --> 00:35:56.123
built that's not using the same
molecular bases but uses this

00:35:56.123 --> 00:35:56.998
peeling thing.

00:35:56.998 --> 00:36:00.000
And they can get a robot that
climbs up a wall.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.179
But that's not what we're going
to talk about here.

00:36:04.179 --> 00:36:06.957
We're going to
instead, I hope,

00:36:06.957 --> 00:36:08.315
go back to here.

00:36:08.315 --> 00:36:13.171
And you can see that all of the
geckos have these sort of

00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:16.800
bizarre toes,
and so they started looking to

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.252
see what the underlying
principle of this was.

00:36:20.252 --> 00:36:22.950
And they saw it has these
setae.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:28.000
And they got looking in greater
detail and blew it up.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.618
And then they found that there
were, as they started looking

00:36:32.618 --> 00:36:35.258
there were
these little hairs.

00:36:35.258 --> 00:36:38.247
And that's a 900-fold
magnification.

00:36:38.247 --> 00:36:41.732
And once
they got looking in more detail

00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:44.907
they found the ends were split
so that

00:36:44.907 --> 00:36:49.526
they were, the very ends are
about 200 nanometers roughly at

00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:50.964
the end of
this.

00:36:50.964 --> 00:36:55.592
And so a gecko has about a
billion of these on its feet.

00:36:55.592 --> 00:36:58.463
And
what it turns out it does --

00:36:58.463 --> 00:37:01.152
And just to see,
here's a human

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:01.469
hair.

00:37:01.469 --> 00:37:03.179
You see how it splits down?

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:05.460
Now, this is made of keratin,
the

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:08.736
molecule I just mentioned that
was used, alpha helices,

00:37:08.736 --> 00:37:10.374
but it's very,
very fine.

00:37:10.374 --> 00:37:13.044
And what it can do,
it can make van der Waals

00:37:13.044 --> 00:37:14.076
interactions.

00:37:14.076 --> 00:37:18.384
This is an animal that sticks
to the wall by van der Waals

00:37:18.384 --> 00:37:19.219
interactions.

00:37:19.219 --> 00:37:22.692
And the peeling away allows it
to break those bonds.

00:37:22.692 --> 00:37:27.000
But, as you can see,
they're enormously important.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.672
He's got here a micrograph.

00:37:28.672 --> 00:37:31.398
They're measuring the force,
and the force

00:37:31.398 --> 00:37:32.240
is just huge.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.798
This is the end of the thing,
the frayed end sticking

00:37:35.798 --> 00:37:36.692
to a surface.

00:37:36.692 --> 00:37:40.199
And for those of you who didn't
think biology any

00:37:40.199 --> 00:37:43.071
relevance to you,
Bob was telling me about this.

00:37:43.071 --> 00:37:44.599
They followed up,
he's

00:37:44.599 --> 00:37:48.093
an engineer as well and builds
interdisciplinary teams,

00:37:48.093 --> 00:37:50.312
and they've
measured this stuff.

00:37:50.312 --> 00:37:53.398
But this is turning into what
appears to look

00:37:53.398 --> 00:37:57.798
like it's going to be a $30 to
$50 billion industry as all

00:37:57.798 --> 00:38:02.199
sorts of things are -- They're
beginning to realize it can

00:38:02.199 --> 00:38:05.514
hold car parts together,
it can go in space shuttles,

00:38:05.514 --> 00:38:06.599
Post-it notes.

00:38:06.599 --> 00:38:09.057
And here's a little Band-Aid
they made.

00:38:09.057 --> 00:38:12.746
They own the patent on this
self-cleaning dry adhesive.

00:38:12.746 --> 00:38:15.398
It doesn't have to be made out
of gecko

00:38:15.398 --> 00:38:15.805
stuff.

00:38:15.805 --> 00:38:18.715
It could be made out of all
sorts of things.

00:38:18.715 --> 00:38:21.798
But, anyway,
here's an example of where not

00:38:21.798 --> 00:38:24.199
only are van der Waals forces
very

00:38:24.199 --> 00:38:28.265
important, but where somebody
who studied a very simply aspect

00:38:28.265 --> 00:38:30.505
of
biology worrying about the

00:38:30.505 --> 00:38:35.024
efficiency of how geckos ran and
pushed it all the way down to

00:38:35.024 --> 00:38:39.889
the molecular level understood a
principal that's going to make

00:38:39.889 --> 00:38:43.047
somebody a very large
amount of money.

00:38:43.047 --> 00:38:43.281
OK.

00:38:43.281 --> 00:38:47.187
The last, and if anybody wants
to come, he's an amazing

00:38:47.187 --> 00:38:47.630
speaker.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.570
Perhaps one of the most
exciting

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.619
speakers I've ever heard.
68-180, 4:00 PM if you want to

00:38:52.619 --> 00:38:52.786
go.

00:38:52.786 --> 00:38:55.457
He'll
have more of that sort of stuff

00:38:55.457 --> 00:38:56.649
to show you then.

00:38:56.649 --> 00:38:57.000
OK.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.864
So the last force here,
it's not really a force,

00:39:01.864 --> 00:39:06.273
but what we'll call
hydrophobic effects.

00:39:06.273 --> 00:39:11.284
And what I mean by this is that
the principle

00:39:11.284 --> 00:39:18.427
of this is that amino acids
that don't like to interact

00:39:18.427 --> 00:39:33.862
with water, so --
So hydrophobic amino acids.

00:39:33.862 --> 00:39:36.823
These are ones like lucine and
phenylalanine.

00:39:36.823 --> 00:39:40.000
Well, I showed you the water
the other day and how it

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.823
was forming hydrogen bonds
between the molecules.

00:39:42.823 --> 00:39:45.647
So if you're going
to stick another molecule in

00:39:45.647 --> 00:39:48.000
there, you're going to break a
bunch of

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:48.333
bonds.

00:39:48.333 --> 00:39:51.611
And if you're not charged or
polar you cannot make new bonds

00:39:51.611 --> 00:39:52.563
with
the water.

00:39:52.563 --> 00:39:55.154
And so what happens,
if you put these together,

00:39:55.154 --> 00:39:57.671
just like if
you put oil together it will

00:39:57.671 --> 00:40:00.000
all bundle up and it will
minimize its

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.737
interactions with water.

00:40:01.737 --> 00:40:03.764
And that's what proteins do.

00:40:03.764 --> 00:40:06.646
Here's
the structure of a protein all

00:40:06.646 --> 00:40:09.248
folded up in 3-dimensional
space.

00:40:09.248 --> 00:40:13.583
And you can see at the core of
the protein how there are these

00:40:13.583 --> 00:40:16.101
many
hydrophobic amino acids that

00:40:16.101 --> 00:40:17.255
are interacting.

00:40:17.255 --> 00:40:18.914
And let me just,
I'm

00:40:18.914 --> 00:40:22.707
going to close by showing you
one more little movie.

00:40:22.707 --> 00:40:25.809
And the new
version of PowerPoint doesn't

00:40:25.809 --> 00:40:28.582
do this well so I'm just going
to get

00:40:28.582 --> 00:40:36.000
out of this for a second here.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.799
This is a really cool movie I
saw.

00:40:39.799 --> 00:40:47.507
I want to show you a DNA repair
protein sticking to a piece of

00:40:47.507 --> 00:40:48.266
helix.

00:40:48.266 --> 00:40:53.389
Can you hit the lights
somebody there?

00:40:53.389 --> 00:40:59.141
So this is a lesion on a piece
of, see the

00:40:59.141 --> 00:41:01.159
double helix here?

00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:05.083
And what I especially liked
about

00:41:05.083 --> 00:41:07.455
this is this is sort of a Star
Wars movie.

00:41:07.455 --> 00:41:11.093
You're going to fly down the
major groove of a double helix.

00:41:11.093 --> 00:41:13.414
And you can see where this
particular

00:41:13.414 --> 00:41:16.539
protein folded up in
3-dimensional space is reaching

00:41:16.539 --> 00:41:17.948
down into that
helix.

00:41:17.948 --> 00:41:21.257
So this is sort of putting
together the two things that

00:41:21.257 --> 00:41:23.372
I've
been telling you about.

00:41:23.372 --> 00:41:25.914
This blue is a DNA repair
protein.

00:41:25.914 --> 00:41:26.976
Oopsy daisy.

00:41:26.976 --> 00:41:30.250
A DNA repair protein that's
able to

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.980
find a lesion in the DNA.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.750
And here's the double helix
that's the

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:37.449
two chains held together by
hydrogen bonds.

00:41:37.449 --> 00:41:41.169
And then, as you can see,
there's a groove on each side.

00:41:41.169 --> 00:41:44.635
And the protein is searching
down into that groove --
