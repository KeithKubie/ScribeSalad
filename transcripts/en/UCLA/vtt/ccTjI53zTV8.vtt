We want to know whether this medication

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.689
may actually reduce cravings for alcohol;

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.730
whether it might change how you feel when you

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.699
do drink alcohol. And to get those answers

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.220
we bring them into the laboratory,

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.960
we administer the medication for a period

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.329
of time and then present our patients

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.700
with alcohol and record how they respond to alcohol.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.510
A lot of people drink to feel good while

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.420
medications that help people experience

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.670
less of the rewarding effects of alcohol

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.470
ultimately can help them quit.
