00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.112
Sugar is playing hide and seek with you.

00:00:11.112 --> 00:00:13.417
You'd think it would be pretty easy for you to win,

00:00:13.417 --> 00:00:14.833
considering all the sugar in

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:19.847
sodas, ice cream, candy, and big white bags labeled sugar.

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:21.683
People get about half of their added sugars

00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:23.219
from those drinks and treats,

00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:24.943
so it might seem like sugar

00:00:24.943 --> 00:00:26.443
is hiding in plain sight,

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.289
but like someone in the witness protection program,

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.089
the other half is hidden in places you'd least suspect.

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:34.680
Check the ingredients on ketchup, bologna,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.067
spaghetti sauce, soy milk, sports drinks,

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:40.356
fish sticks, and peanut butter.

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:43.115
You'll find sugar hiding in most of those products.

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:45.016
In fact, you'll find added sugars

00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:48.030
in three-quarters of the more than 600,000 items

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.284
available in grocery stores.

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:52.094
But how is sugar hiding?

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:54.131
Can't you just look on food labels?

00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:55.700
It's not that easy.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.301
Just like your friend Robert

00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:00.512
might go by Bob, Robby, Rob, Bobby, or Roberto,

00:01:00.512 --> 00:01:02.966
added sugar has a lot of aliases.

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.412
And by a lot, we don't mean five or six,

00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:06.775
try fifty-six.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:09.975
There's brown rice syrup, barley malt,

00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:12.797
demerara, Florida Crystals, muscovado,

00:01:12.797 --> 00:01:15.396
and, of course, high fructose corn syrup,

00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:19.399
sometimes called HFCS, or corn sugar.

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.107
Even sugar's tricky nicknames have nicknames.

00:01:23.107 --> 00:01:25.661
Grape or apple concentrate has the same effects on your body

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:27.911
as its 55 sugary twins.

00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:31.120
And even though organic evaporated cane juice sounds healthy,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.595
when you evaporate it,

00:01:32.595 --> 00:01:34.045
you get sugar!

00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:36.437
Chemically speaking, it's all the same.

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:37.652
And even trickier,

00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:39.336
when multiple added types of sugars

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:41.046
are used in one type of product,

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:44.067
they get buried down in a long list of ingredients,

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:46.470
so the sugar content might appear to be okay,

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.925
but when you add them all together,

00:01:47.925 --> 00:01:51.015
sugar can be the single biggest ingredient.

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:53.310
Currently, the FDA doesn't suggest

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.329
a recommended daily limit for sugar,

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.228
so it's hard to tell if this 65 grams in a bottle of soda

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:00.398
is a little or a lot.

00:02:00.398 --> 00:02:02.677
But the World Health Organization recommends

00:02:02.677 --> 00:02:05.981
limiting sugar to just 5% of your total calories,

00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:08.146
or about 25 grams per day.

00:02:08.146 --> 00:02:12.121
So, 65 grams is well over twice that amount.

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.204
But just what is sugar?

00:02:14.204 --> 00:02:17.907
What's the difference between glucose and fructose?

00:02:17.907 --> 00:02:19.730
Well, both are carbohydrates

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.297
with the same chemical composition

00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:23.647
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

00:02:23.647 --> 00:02:25.714
But they have very different structures

00:02:25.714 --> 00:02:28.258
and behave quite differently in our bodies.

00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:30.681
Glucose is the best source of energy

00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:33.155
for nearly all organisms on Earth.

00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:36.018
It can be metabolized by all organs in the body.

00:02:36.018 --> 00:02:38.103
Fructose, on the other hand,

00:02:38.103 --> 00:02:40.815
is metabolized primarily in the liver,

00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:42.775
and when your liver gets overloaded

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:44.422
with sweet, sweet fructose,

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:47.562
the excess is metabolized to fat.

00:02:47.562 --> 00:02:49.824
Fresh fruits actually contain fructose,

00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:51.479
but it's naturally occurring

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.170
and doesn't cause an overload

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.732
because the fiber in fruit slows its absorption.

00:02:55.732 --> 00:02:57.816
This gives your liver the time it needs

00:02:57.816 --> 00:02:59.421
to do its job.

00:02:59.421 --> 00:03:01.545
It's sugar that makes cookies chewy

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:03.506
and candy crunchy.

00:03:03.506 --> 00:03:06.408
It even turns bread crust a beautiful, golden brown.

00:03:06.408 --> 00:03:08.468
It's also a great preservative;

00:03:08.468 --> 00:03:10.345
it doesn't spoil or evaporate,

00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:12.100
so the foods it's added to are easier

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.974
to store and ship long distances

00:03:13.974 --> 00:03:15.998
and tend to be cheaper.

00:03:15.998 --> 00:03:18.483
That's why sugar is hiding everywhere.

00:03:18.483 --> 00:03:21.333
Actually, it might be easier to list the foods

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:23.480
that added sugar isn't hiding in,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.858
things like: vegetables, eggs, meats,

00:03:25.858 --> 00:03:29.963
fish, fruit, raw nuts, even your kitchen sink.

00:03:29.963 --> 00:03:33.366
Simply choosing water over soda, juices, and sports drinks

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:35.938
is a great way to avoid hidden added sugar.

00:03:35.938 --> 00:03:37.586
At the very least,

00:03:37.586 --> 00:03:39.219
try to pay attention to food labels,

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.587
so you can keep your sugar intake at a healthy level.

00:03:42.587 --> 00:03:44.856
Because in this game of hide and seek,

00:03:44.856 --> 00:03:46.980
every time you don't find added sugar,

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.965
you win!
