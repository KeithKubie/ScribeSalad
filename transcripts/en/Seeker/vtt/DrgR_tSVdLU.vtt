00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.020
The evolutionary process is one that takes
hundreds of thousands of years...right?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.090
Not so much.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.010
For some species, we’re seeing evolution
right in front of our eyes.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.150
This is what’s called rapid evolution where
major environmental changes in predation,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.570
food, or climate can alter the natural selection
to favor genes that were previously disadvantaged.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.369
It can happen in a very short amount of time.

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.199
For example, in a period of five years, male
Polynesian field crickets in Hawaii lost their

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.210
ability to make noise to avoid parasitic attacks.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.000
That is one of the fastest evolutions in the
wild ever recorded!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.070
Graduating college can take longer than that!

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.850
Basically, one gene mutation led to a very
silent cricket, and his silence helped him

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.150
avoid the parasitic attacks that were killing
his brothers.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.240
The problem is, female crickets like the song,
so without it the silent males needed to change

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.820
their behavior.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.320
They started creeping on the singing males,
mating with those females that would show

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.490
up and passed on their mutation.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.490
Boom.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.490
Rapid evolution.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.880
All this happened in just 5 years!

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.850
90% of the population is now songless.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.960
This fast-moving evolution isn't exactly what
Charles Darwin envisioned back in 1859.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.020
He thought any changes would take many generations,
which sounds like a long time -- but it doesn’t

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.020
have to be.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.950
Darwin knew almost nothing about genetics.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.969
He was simply observing patterns in the wild,
but he couldn’t pinpoint why or really how

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.229
long these things could take.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.429
But now, with advances in modern tech and
molecular biology, we can.

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:33.090
Evolutionary biologists can identify and track
the exact gene adaptations that species have

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.090
over time.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.149
But it ain’t the 19th century anymore, and
the environment for our planet’s little

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.209
critters is changing quicker than ever before.

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:44.459
What used to take hundreds of years now can
take a few because the animals are keeping

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.600
up with their rapidly changing surroundings.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.109
In just 15 years, green anole lizards in florida
have evolved to have better grips in their

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.100
feet to escape invasive species.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.009
Tawny owls, typically a grey dominant species,
are now becoming more brown as winters grow

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.649
warmer, and maybe closer to home, in the last
50 years bed bugs have developed stronger

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.850
enzymes to make themselves more resistant
to insecticide.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.340
You might think you’re safe because humans
are apex predators, but you’re not.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.830
Organisms can acclimate fast, and this includes
pathogens that can harm humans, and tumors

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.330
that can resist chemotherapy.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.500
So yeah, humans should pay attention to rapid
evolution too.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.000
But now that we know about this, the better
we can understand how our environment affects

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.770
our genes and have a greater chance to create
better medicine and other means of improving

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.770
our longevity.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.440
We’ve come a long way from Darwin simply
observing finches in the Galapagos, but we

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.040
still have a long way to go.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.250
Hey apex predators, like science in your day?

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.120
Go ahead and check us out now on Prime Video.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.510
We made it big guys, you can stream all the
episodes you love, ad-free, and all in once

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:54.740
place. We'll throw the link in the description below. 
Fun fact: Darwin went to the Galapagos and

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.200
noted how different finches all had different
beaks.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.820
Today, we know the gene BMP4 helps determine
the different beaks of the birds that Darwin

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.820
based his first theories on.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.070
Cool eh.
