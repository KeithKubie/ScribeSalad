00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.660
Albert Camus was an extremely handsome,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.600
mid 20th century French Algerian philosopher and writer

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.759
whose claim to our attention is 
based on three novels:

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.000
The Outsider, The Plage,  The Fall and
two philosophical essays:

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.250
The Myth of Sisyphus and The Rebel.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.099
Camus won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.300
and died at the age of 46, inadvertently
killed by his publisher Michelle Gallimard

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.240
when his Facel Vega sports car they
were in crashed into a tree.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.320
In his pocket was a train ticket he had
decided not to use last-minute.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.020
Camus' fame began with and
still largely rests upon his novel of 1942:

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.700
The Outsider.
Set in Camus' native Algiers,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.870
it follows the story of a laconic
detached ironic hero called Meursault.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.280
A man who can't see the point of love or work or friendship,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.820
and who one day, somewhat by mistake, 
shoots dead an Arab man

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.300
without knowing his own motivations and
ends up being put to death

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.890
partly because he doesn't show any
remorse but not really caring for his

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.370
fate one way or the other.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.430
The novel captures the state of mind,
defined by the sociologist Emile Durkheim, as

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.680
"Anomie,"

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.540
a listless, affectless, alienated condition where one feels entirely cut off from others

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.820
and can't find a way to share their
sympathies or values.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.860
Reading The Outsider has long been a well-known

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.590
adolescent rite of passage among french
and many other teenagers,

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.280
which isn't a way of doing it down for a
lot of the greatest themes

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.860
are first tackled at 17 or so.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.320
the hero of The Outsider, Meursault,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.060
cannot accept any of the standard answers
for why things are the way they are.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.030
He sees hypocrisy and sentimentality
everywhere and can't overlook it.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.060
He's a man who can't accept the normal
explanations

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.110
given to explain things like the
education system, the workplace,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.110
relationships or the mechanism of government

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.200
He stands
outside normal bourgeois life

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.900
highly critical of its pinched morality
and narrow concerns for money and family.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.260
As Camus put it in an afterword he
wrote for the American edition of the book:

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.399
"Meursault doesn't play the game. He refuses to lie..."

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.780
"...he says what he is, he refuses to hide
his feelings..."

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.060
"...and so society immediately feels
threatened."

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.910
Much of the unusual mesmerizing quality
of the book comes from the coolly

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.910
distant voice in which Meursault speaks to us, his readers.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.930
The opening is one of the most legendary in
twentieth-century literature, and sets the tone.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.780
"Aujourdâ€™hui, maman est morte.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.440
Ou peut-Ãªtre hier, je ne sais pas."

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.760
The ending
is a stark and is defiant.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.480
Meursault condemned to death for a murder 
committed almost off hand,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.610
because it could be interesting to know
what it's like to press the trigger,

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.760
rejects all consolations and heroically
accepts the universe's total

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.240
indifference to human kind.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.709
"My last wish was that there should be a
crowd of spectators at my execution..."

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.300
"...and that they should greet me with
cries of hatred."

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.840
Even if we're not killers, and we'll ourselves
be really quite sad when our mother dies,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.980
the mood of The Outsider is one we're
all liable to have some experience of.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.090
When we have enough freedom to realize
we are in a cage but

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.980
not quite enough freedom to escape it.
When no one seems to understand and

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.840
everything appears a little hopeless,
perhaps in the summer before we go to college.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.520
Aside from The Outsider, Camus' fame
rests on an essay published the same

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.450
year as the novel

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.000
called The Myth of Sisyphus. 
This book, too, has a bold beginning:

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.240
"There is but one truly serious
philosophical problem..."

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.420
"...and that is suicide."

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.080
"Judging whether life is or is not worth living,"

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.040
"...that is the fundamental
question of philosophy."

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.360
The reason for this stark choice is
in Camus' eyes because

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.239
as soon as we start to think
seriously, as philosophers do,

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.440
we will see that life has no meaning and
therefore we will be compelled to wonder

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.120
whether or not we should just be done
with it all.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.100
To make sense of this rather
extreme claim and thesis,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.570
we have to situate Camus in the
history of thought, his dramatic

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.170
announcement that we have to consider
killing ourselves because

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.560
life might be meaningless, is premised on
a previous notion

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.820
that life could actually be rich in
god-given meaning.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.360
The concept which will sound remote to
many of us today

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.580
and yet we have to bear in mind that for
the last two thousand years in the West

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.500
a sense that life was meaningful
was a given,

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.330
accorded by one institution above any other -
The Christian Church.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.940
Camus stands in a long line of
thinkers, from Kierkegaard

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.760
to Nietzsche,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.130
to Heidegger and Sartre

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.550
who wrestle with a chilling realization
that there is in fact no preordained

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.790
meaning in life.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.280
We're just biological matter spinning
senselessly on a tiny rock,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.840
in a corner of an indifferent universe.
We were not put here by a benevolent deity

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.340
and asked to work toward salvation in the
shape of the Ten Commandments,

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.880
there's no roadmap and no bigger point and,
it's this realization that lies at the heart

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.360
of so many of the crises reported by
the thinkers we now know

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.400
as the existentialists.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.500
A child of despairing modernity,

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.410
Albert Camus accepts that all our
lives are absurd in the grander scheme

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.840
but, unlike some philosophers, he ends up
resisting utter hopelessness or Nihilism.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.080
He argues that we have to live with the
knowledge that our efforts will be

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.139
largely futile,

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.260
our lives soon forgotten, and our species
irredeemably corrupt and violent

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.720
and yet we should endure nevertheless.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.140
We are like Sisyphus,

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.500
the Greek figure ordained by the Gods
to roll a boulder up a mountain,

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.370
and to watch it fall back down again in
perpetuity.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.560
But ultimatelly, Camus suggests we 
should cope as well as we can

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.730
at whatever we have to do, we have to acknowledge
the absurd background to existence,

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.169
and then triumph of the constant
possibility of hopelessness.

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.149
In his famous formulation 
"One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.580
This brings us to the most charming
and seductive side of Camus,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.979
the Camus wants to remind himself
and us of the reasons why life can be

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:37.960
worth enduring,

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.669
and who in the process writes with
exceptional intensity and wisdom

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.139
about relationships, nature, the summer,
food, and friendship.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.500
As a guide to the reasons to live,
Camus is delightful.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.420
Many philosophers have been ugly and cut
off from their bodies,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.700
think of sickly Pascal,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.420
crippled Leopardi,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.380
sexually unsuccessful Schopenhauer or

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.180
poor peculiar Nietzsche.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.700
Camus was by contrast very
good-looking, extremely successful with

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.450
women for the last ten years of his life,

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.900
he never had fewer than three
girlfriends on the go, and wives as well

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.870
and had a great dress sense, influenced
by James Deen and Humphrey Bogart

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.970
It isn't surprising that he was asked to
pose by American Vogue.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.560
These weren't all just sylistic quirks, once
you properly realize that life is absurd

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.090
you're on the verge of despair perhaps,
but also compelled to live life more

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.800
intensely.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.690
Accordingly Came grew committed to
and deeply serious about the pleasures

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.850
of ordinary life.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.870
He said he saw his philosophy as

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.210
"A lucid invitation to live and to create
 in the very midst of the desert."

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.060
He was a great champion of the ordinary

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.070
which generally has a hard time finding
champions in philosophy

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.890
and after pages and pages of his dense
philosophy, one turns with relief to

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.240
moments when Camus writes with
simplicity in praise of sunshine, kissing

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.030
or dancing.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.430
He was an outstanding athlete as a young
man, once asked by his friend Charles Poncet

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.620
which he preferred, football or the
theater.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.139
Camus is set to have replied:
"Football, without hesitation."

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.270
Camus played as goalkeeper for the
junior local Algiers team

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.190
Racing Universitaire de Algier, which won
both the North African Champions Cup

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.530
and the North African Cup in the
1930's.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.520
The sense of teamspirit fraternity and common purpose,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.240
appeal to Camus enormously.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.200
When he was asked in the 1950s
 by a sportsmagazine

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.900
for a few words regarding his time with
football, he said:

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.660
"After many years during which I saw many things..."

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.039
"what I know most surely about morality
and the duty of man..."

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:25.639
"I owe to sport."

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.820
Camus was also great advocate of the Sun,
 his beautiful essay Summer in Algiers

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.300
celebrates the warmth of the water and the
brown bodies of women.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.950
He writes "For the first time in two
thousand years the body has appeared

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.280
naked on beaches,

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.889
for twenty centuries men have striven to
give decency to Greek

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:46.180
insolence a naiveity to diminish the
flesh and complicate dress

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.530
but today young men running on
Mediterranean beaches

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.669
repeat the gestures of the athletes
of Delos." He spoke up for a new

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:56.780
paganism, based on the immediate
pleasures of the body.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.220
This extract from Summer in Algiers:

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.500
"I recall a magnificent, tall girl who
danced all afternoon. She was wearing a

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.800
jasmine garland on her tight blue dress

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.190
wet with perspiration from the small of
her back to her legs

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.199
she was laughing as she danced and
throwing back her head

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:16.930
as she passed the tables she left behind
her a mingle scent of flowers and flesh."

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.490
Camus railed against those who would
dismiss such things as trivial and longed

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.539
for something higher, better, purer.

00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:25.039
"If there is a sin against this life..."
he wrote,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.060
"it consists perhaps not so much into sparing of life,"

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:33.039
"as in hoping for another life and eluding
 the quiet grandeur of this one."

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.699
In a letter he remarked:

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.440
"People attract me insofar as they are impassioned
about life and avid for happiness..."

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.500
"There are
causes worth dying for, but none worth killing for."

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.920
Camus achieved huge acclaim in his
lifetime, but the Parisian intellectual

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.940
community was deeply suspicious of him.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:53.150
He never was a Parisian sophisticate,
he was a working-class Pied-Noir,

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.270
that is someone born in Algeria but of
European origin,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:01.450
whose father had died of war-wounds when he was
an infant, and whose mother was a cleaning lady.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.060
It isn't a coincidence that Camus'
favorite philosopher was Montaigne,

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.150
another very down to earth frenchmen,

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.740
and someone one can love as much for
what he wrote, as for what he was like.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.630
Someone one would have wanted as a 
wise and a life-enhancing friend.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.150
This, too, is what philosophy is about.
