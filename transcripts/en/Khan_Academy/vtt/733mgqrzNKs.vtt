00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:01.873
Narrator: Whenever we talk about money,

00:00:01.873 --> 00:00:05.444
the amount of money is not
the only thing that matters.

00:00:05.444 --> 00:00:08.363
What also matters is when you have to get

00:00:08.363 --> 00:00:11.070
or when you have to give the money.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.135
So, to think about this
or to make it a little bit

00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:16.286
more concrete, let's assume
that we live in a world

00:00:16.286 --> 00:00:19.002
that if you put money in
a bank, you are guaranteed

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:27.007
10% interest, 10% risk
free interest in a bank.

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:28.951
This is high by historical standards,

00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:30.477
but it will make our math easy.

00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:32.784
So, let's just assume
that you can always get

00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:35.938
10% risk free interest in the bank.

00:00:35.938 --> 00:00:38.736
Now, given that, let
me throw out scenarios

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:40.735
and have you think about which of these

00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:42.801
that you would most want.

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:47.269
So, I could give you $100 right now.

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.355
That's option 1.

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:51.603
I could, in one year,
instead of giving you

00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:54.066
the $100 immediately, in one year

00:00:54.066 --> 00:01:02.735
I could give you $109 and then in 2 years,

00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:09.268
this is kind of option 3,
I'd be willing to give you

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:16.104
$120, so your choice is,
someone walks up to you

00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:16.764
off the street.

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:19.540
I could give you $100
bill now, $109 bill ...

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.345
(laughing) $109 bill, $109 in
a year, $120, 2 years from now

00:01:24.345 --> 00:01:25.684
and you know in the back of your mind

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:28.096
you could get 10% risk free interest.

00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:31.128
So, given that you don't have
an immediate need for money.

00:01:31.128 --> 00:01:33.868
We're assuming that this
money, you will save.

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:36.738
That you don't have a
bill to pay immediately,

00:01:36.738 --> 00:01:40.015
which of these things
are the most desirable?

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:42.738
Which of these would
you most want to have?

00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:45.934
Well, if you just cared
about the absolute value

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:47.933
or the absolute amount of
the money you would say,

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:50.736
"Hey, look. $120, that's the
biggest amount of money."

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:53.626
"I'm going to take that one because
that's just the biggest number."

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:55.469
But, you probably have
in the back of your mind,

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.667
"Well, I'm getting that later,
so there's maybe something

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:58.674
I'm losing out there?"

00:01:58.674 --> 00:01:59.673
And you'd be right.

00:01:59.673 --> 00:02:01.878
You'd be losing out on
the opportunity to get

00:02:01.878 --> 00:02:05.808
the 10% risk free interest if you
were to get the money earlier.

00:02:05.808 --> 00:02:09.669
And if you wanted to
compare them directly,

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.662
the thought process would be,

00:02:11.662 --> 00:02:15.474
"Well, let's see. If I took
option 1. If I got the $100."

00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:17.387
And if you were to put it in the bank,

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:23.003
what would that grow to based
on that 10% risk free interest?

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:27.231
Well, after 1 year 10% of $100 is $10.

00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.137
So, you would get $10 in interest.

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:32.669
So, after one year, you're entire savings

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:36.223
in the bank will now be $110.

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:37.739
So, just doing that little exercise

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.885
we actually see that $100 given now,

00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:43.331
put it in the bank at 10% risk free,

00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:46.559
will actually turn into
$110 in a year from now,

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.469
which is better than the
$109 one year from now.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.407
So, given this scenario, or
given this kind of situation

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:56.141
or this option, you would rather do this

00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:57.226
than do this.

00:02:57.226 --> 00:03:00.720
A year from now you're better off by $1.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.405
What about 2 years from now?

00:03:02.405 --> 00:03:04.674
Well, if you take that $100 after 1 year

00:03:04.674 --> 00:03:10.402
it becomes $110, then 10% of $110 is $11.

00:03:10.402 --> 00:03:17.896
You want to add $11 to
it, so it becomes $121.

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:20.468
So, once again you're
better off taking the $100,

00:03:20.468 --> 00:03:23.738
investing it in the bank
risk free, 10% per year.

00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:27.804
It turns into $121. That
is a better situation

00:03:27.804 --> 00:03:30.069
than just someone guaranteeing you to give

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.405
the $120 in 2 years.

00:03:32.405 --> 00:03:35.882
Once again, you are better off by $1.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.676
So, this idea that not
just the amount matters,

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:41.072
but when you get it, this idea is called

00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:43.637
the time value of money.

00:03:43.637 --> 00:03:49.201
Time value of money.

00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:50.466
Or another way to think about it is,

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:54.215
think about what the value
of this money is over time.

00:03:54.215 --> 00:03:56.204
Given some expected interest rate

00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:58.222
and when you do that you
can compare this money

00:03:58.222 --> 00:04:01.800
to equal amounts of money
at some future date.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.550
Now, another way of thinking
about the time value

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.738
or, I guess, another related
concept to the time value of money

00:04:07.738 --> 00:04:13.803
is the idea of present
value, present value.

00:04:13.803 --> 00:04:16.351
Maybe I'll talk about
present and future value.

00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:23.470
So, present and future
value, future value.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.669
So, given this assumption,
this 10% assumption,

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.298
if someone were to ask you,
"What is the present value

00:04:31.298 --> 00:04:35.218
of $121 2 years in the future?"

00:04:35.218 --> 00:04:37.808
They're essentially asking you,

00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:40.604
so what is the present value?

00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:42.802
PV stands for present value.

00:04:42.802 --> 00:04:47.138
So, what is the present value
of $121 2 years in the future?

00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:49.803
That's equivalent to
asking what type of money

00:04:49.803 --> 00:04:52.737
or what amount of money would
you have to put into the bank

00:04:52.737 --> 00:04:56.867
risk free for the next
2 years to get $121?

00:04:56.867 --> 00:04:58.989
We know that. If you put $100 in the bank

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:04.393
for 2 years at 10% risk
free, you would get $121.

00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:06.532
So, the present value here,

00:05:06.532 --> 00:05:12.387
the present value of $121 is the $100.

00:05:12.387 --> 00:05:15.282
Or another way to think about
present and future value

00:05:15.282 --> 00:05:18.052
if someone were to ask
what is the future value?

00:05:18.052 --> 00:05:24.387
So, what is the future value
of this $100 in 1 year?

00:05:24.387 --> 00:05:28.389
So, in 1 year. Well, if
you get 10% in the bank

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.612
that's guaranteed, it's
future value is $110.

00:05:32.612 --> 00:05:38.323
After 2 years, it's 2
year future value is $121.

00:05:38.323 --> 00:05:39.528
So, with that in mind let me give you

00:05:39.528 --> 00:05:41.523
one slightly more interesting problem.

00:05:41.523 --> 00:05:43.724
So, let's say that I have ... let's say,

00:05:43.724 --> 00:05:45.650
we're going to assume this the whole time

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.279
that makes our math easy
at 10% risk free interest.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.613
And let's say that someone
says they're willing

00:05:51.613 --> 00:06:01.120
to give us $65 in 1 year

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.055
and we were to ask ourselves,

00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:05.920
"What is the present value of this?"

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.251
So, what is the present value of this.

00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:12.862
Remember, the present
value is just asking you

00:06:12.862 --> 00:06:15.187
what amount of money, that if you were to

00:06:15.187 --> 00:06:17.456
put it in the bank at
this risk free interest,

00:06:17.456 --> 00:06:21.362
would be equivalent to this $65?

00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:23.525
Which of these 2 are equivalent to you?

00:06:23.525 --> 00:06:26.786
You would say, "Well, look.
Whatever amount of money that is?"

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:28.687
Let's call that X.

00:06:28.687 --> 00:06:30.651
Whatever amount of money that is, times,

00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:33.119
if I grow it by 10%, that's literally,

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:38.022
I'm taking X+10%X+ ...
let me write it this way.

00:06:38.022 --> 00:06:43.856
+10%xX ... Let me write it ...
Let me make it clear this way.

00:06:43.856 --> 00:06:52.455
X+10%X should be equal to our $65.

00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:55.687
If I take the amount I
get 10% of that amount

00:06:55.687 --> 00:06:58.523
over the year, that
should be equal to $65.

00:06:58.523 --> 00:07:01.114
This is the same thing as 1X

00:07:01.114 --> 00:07:04.855
or we can say that
1X+10% is the same thing

00:07:04.855 --> 00:07:09.453
as 0.10X is equal to
65, or you add these 2.

00:07:09.453 --> 00:07:14.185
1.10X = 65, and if you want to solve

00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:16.690
for the actual amount of
the present value here,

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.693
you would just divide
both sides by the 1.10.

00:07:20.693 --> 00:07:24.325
You get X is equal to ...
let me do it this way.

00:07:24.325 --> 00:07:26.389
It will be a little bit
more clear about it.

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.105
So, let's divide both sides by 1.0

00:07:29.105 --> 00:07:30.452
and really that trailing
zero doesn't matter.

00:07:30.452 --> 00:07:32.649
We're not really too worried
about the precision here

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:36.058
because this actually exactly 10%.

00:07:36.058 --> 00:07:38.027
So, this is going to
be ... these cancel out

00:07:38.027 --> 00:07:40.525
and X is going to be equal to,

00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:42.891
let me get the calculator out,

00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:49.796
X is going to be equal
to 65 divided by 1.1,

00:07:49.796 --> 00:07:53.956
$59.09, rounding it.

00:07:53.956 --> 00:08:01.855
So, X=59.09, which was the present value

00:08:01.855 --> 00:08:03.995
of $65 in one year,

00:08:03.995 --> 00:08:05.689
or another way to think about it is

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:08.625
if you wanted to know
what the future value

00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:12.944
of $59.09 is in 1 year,
assuming the 10% interest,

00:08:12.944 --> 00:08:15.464
you would get the $65.
