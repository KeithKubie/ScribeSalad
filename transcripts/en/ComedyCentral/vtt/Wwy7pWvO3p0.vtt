THOSE ARE KENTUCKY FANS, I'M
SORRY, AFTER LOSING,

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.413 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE LAWLESS -- NO, I'M

AFTER WINNING, NO I AM SORRY,
THAT'S A PUMPKIN FESTIVAL

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:23.790 line:91%
GONE AWRY, COME ON, THOSE ARE
KIDS JUST BLOWING OFF STEAM

WITH GOOD-NATURED ARSON. THERE
YOU GO! THAT'S THE WORRISOME,

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.028 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET'S CALL IT URBAN VIOLENCE WE
WERE LOOKING FOR.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:30.163 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT HAS BEEN A NIGHT OF CHAOS,
VIOLENCE, LAWLESSNESS IN

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:32.732 align:start position:0% line:91%
BALTIMORE OVER THE
DEATH OF FREDDIE GRAY.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:36.002 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW THE NATIONAL GUARD
IS ON THE SCENE TRYING TO

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.170 align:start position:0% line:91%
RESTORE PEACE AND AS WE SAID ALL
PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.938 align:start position:0%
TODAY.

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:48.514 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT -- AH, -- (BLEEP).

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:53.019 line:91%
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S PROBABLY
THE ONE TIME EVEN KIDS DON'T

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.687 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVEN WANT TO HEAR THE
ANNOUNCEMENT SCHOOL IS CLOSED.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.623 align:start position:0% line:91%
HONEY, NO SCHOOL! YOU HAVE A
RIOT DAY.

00:00:57.656 --> 00:01:01.994 align:start position:0% line:91%
JUST STAY IN YOUR PJS AND WATCH

00:01:02.027 --> 00:01:05.098 align:start position:0% line:91%
BE PREEMPTED BY FOOTAGE OF OUR
NEIGHBORHOOD IN FLAMES.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:09.102 line:91%
YES, ONCE AGAIN THE COMBINATION
OF AN ECONOMICALLY STRUGGLING

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.438 line:91%
INNER CITY, POLICE FORCE CHARGED
WITH KEEPING ITS CITIZENS OUT OF

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:18.845 size:78% position:39% line:91%
EVERYONE ELSE'S VIEW HAS
COMBUSTED, LIKE WATTS AND

APPEAR LIKE TRAGEDY CICADAS.

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:33.693 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEPRESSING IN THEIR SIMILARITY,
PREDICTABILITY AND

INTRACTABILITY, OR TO PUT THAT
ANOTHER WAY --

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.429 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HARD TO BELIEVE.

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:39.765 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS GOING ON IN A MAJOR
AMERICAN CITY RIGHT NOW, THIS IS

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:43.936 line:91%
A SCENE THAT A LOT OF US NEVER
ANTICIPATED SEEING IN A CITY

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.406 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE BALTIMORE, HARD TO BELIEVE
THIS IS GOING ON AS I KEEP

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.540 line:85%
SAYING IN A MAJOR AMERICAN CITY.

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:50.576 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING
ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN THE UNITED

00:01:50.609 --> 00:02:03.055 align:start position:0% line:91%
STATES OF AMERICA IN A LONG

THROUGH A CITY STREET, THAT
WOULD BE HARD TO BELIEVE.

00:02:11.063 --> 00:02:18.004 align:start position:0% line:91%
 THIS (BLEEP), THIS (BLEEP)
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:18.504 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
FERGUSON WAS JUST A FEW MONTHS
AGO AND YOU WERE

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:20.973 align:start size:97% position:3%
TALKING ABOUT IT.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:24.977 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT IS HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE
THAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE, 2014,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.214 line:91%
SO MANY YEARS AFTER DR. MARTIN
LUTHER KING AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:32.218 line:91%
MOVEMENT WE ARE SEEING NATIONAL
GUARD TROOPS ON THE STREET TO

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:35.955 line:91%
PREVENT THIS KIND OF VIOLENCE IN
THIS DAY AND AGE, IT'S SOMETHING

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:41.194 align:start size:88% position:13% line:91%
I DIDN'T THINK WE WOULD
BE SEEING AGAIN.

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:45.164 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: I AM WORRIED ABOUT
YOU.

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:51.270 line:91%
DO I NEED TO GET SANDLER TO GO
OVER TO YOUR HOUSE AND -- JUST

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:56.008 align:start position:0% line:91%
RUN (BLEEP) BY YOU EVERY
MORNING.

00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:59.712 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL LOOK, BLITZER MAY HAVE BEEN
TAKEN OFF GUARD BUT CERTAINLY

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:01.747 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE MAYOR OF BALTIMORE WOULDN'T
BE TAKEN OFF GUARD.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.684 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH
OUR GOVERNOR AND HE HAS AGREED,

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:08.721 line:91%
AND I HAVE REQUESTED AND HE HAS
AGREED TO DEPLOY THE NATIONAL

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:09.922 align:start position:0% line:85%
GUARD.

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:13.259 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHEN THE MAYOR CALLED ME,
WHICH QUITE FRANKLY WE WERE GLAD

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:17.630 line:91%
THAT SHE FINALLY DID, INSTANTLY
WE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER.

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:22.134 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, OH, OH.

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:28.174 align:start position:0% line:91%
 WELL, ISN'T THE GOVERNOR A
LITTLE BIT PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE?

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.943 align:start position:0% line:91%
 I MEAN I WAS THERE ALL
WEEKEND.

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:36.349 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
BY THE PHONE, BUT FINE, IF SHE
WANTS THE CITY TO BURN?

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:39.819 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHO AM I, I'M JUST A SIMPLE
GOVERNOR WITH EXECUTIVE

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:46.292 align:start position:0% line:91%
AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE A STANDING
ARMY OF RESERVISTS?

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:51.664 line:91%
BUT I GUESS CALLING THEM OUT
WOULD NOT BE ON FLEEK AS THE

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:54.433 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOUNG PEOPLE --
(LAUGHTER)

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:56.435 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
YOU MOTHER (BLEEP), YOU SWORE
THAT THAT'S A THING!

00:03:56.468 --> 00:03:58.371 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
YOU SWORE THAT ON FLEEK WAS A
THING.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.673 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
THEY SWORE TO ME. I SAID, ON
FLEEK?

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:06.245 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
AND THEY SAID, NO, THAT'S A
THING. I WAS LIKE --

00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:11.617 align:start position:0% line:91%
 I AM GOING TO (BLEEP) PUNT YOU
MOTHER (BLEEP).

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.853 align:start position:0% line:85%
I KNOW THAT'S A THING.

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.789 align:start position:0% line:85%
I KNOW THAT'S A THING.

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:22.295 line:91%
 SO TO THE MAYOR WAS A LITTLE
LATE WITH HER EMERGENCY STATE

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:22.962 align:start position:0% line:85%
DECLARING.

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:24.197 line:85%
WHEN SHOULD SHE HAVE DONE IT?

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.034 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A STATE OF EMERGENCY
AFTER A NIGHT OF VIOLENCE AND

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:28.735 align:start position:0% line:85%
CHAOS.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.336 line:85%
WAS BALTIMORE CAUGHT OFF GUARD?

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:32.938 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT CALL SHOULD HAVE CAME IN
TWO OR THREE DAYS AGO.

00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:35.975 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHY WAS THIS NOT IN PLACE
SATURDAY OR SUNDAY WHEN THE

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:37.143 align:start position:0% line:85%
SITUATION BEGAN?

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.978 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL, SURE, NO, THEY
COULD HAVE DECLARED A STATE OF

00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:42.348 align:start position:0% line:91%
EMERGENCY IN BALTIMORE ON
SUNDAY, MAYBE SATURDAY, OR MAYBE

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:45.818 align:start position:0% line:85%
SOMEWHERE IN THE 1970S.

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:49.255 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THIS SEEMS TO INDICATE
THE ISSUE IN OUR CITY EMERGENCY

00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:50.456 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALERT SYSTEM.

00:04:50.489 --> 00:04:54.093 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE APPEAR TO BE ONLY TWO
POINTS ON THE SCALE, NORMAL AND

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:57.229 align:start position:0% line:85%
ON FIRE.

00:04:57.262 --> 00:05:02.101 align:start position:0% line:91%
 EVEN VOLCANOES HAVE A FOUR
STEP WARNING SYSTEM.

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:08.874 line:91%
IT DOESN'T GO FROM CLEAR SKY
TO, THE FLOOR IS LAVA! AND

00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:13.546 align:start position:0% line:91%
CLEARLY BALTIMORE WAS BELCHING
SMOKE FAR BEFORE SATURDAY.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.015 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BALTIMORE'S POVERTY RATE IS
NEARLY DOUBLE THE NATIONAL

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:17.283 align:start size:97% position:3%
AVERAGE.

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:19.051 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AGAIN, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
AMONG YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:20.353 size:78% position:39% line:85%
HOVERS AROUND 30 PERCENT.

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:22.288 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES
FOR BLACK MALES ARE

00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:24.590 align:start position:0% line:85%
DEVASTATINGLY LOW.

00:05:24.623 --> 00:05:26.759 line:91%
&gt;&gt; A LACK OF ACCESS TO LABOR
MARKETS, HEALTH CARE, HOUSING.

00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:28.627 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HAS CHRONIC SEVERE DRUG AND
CRIME ISSUES.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.464 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE HIGHEST VIOLENT
CRIME RATES IN AMERICA.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:37.069 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU KNOW YOUR CITY IS
(BLEEP)ED UP WHEN IT IS LAST

00:05:37.102 --> 00:05:40.439 align:start position:0% line:91%
MOST SUCCESSFUL EMPLOYMENT

TELEVISION SHOW ABOUT HOW
(BLEEP) UP YOUR CITY IS.

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:52.151 line:91%
AND WHEN GETTING ARRESTED -- AND
WHEN GETTING ARRESTED IS ONE OF

00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:55.221 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOUR MORE RELIABLY LUCRATIVE
OPTIONS.

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:59.058 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SINCE 2011, THE CITY OF
BALTIMORE HAS PAID OUT CLOSE TO

00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:02.061 line:91%
$6 MILLION IN COURT JUDGMENTS OR
SETTLEMENTS TO VICTIMS OF POLICE

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:03.295 align:start position:0% line:85%
ABUSE.

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:10.736 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THE POLICE BRUTALITY
LOTTERY IS NOW $6 MILLION! ALL

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:15.307 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU NEED IS A BROKEN
TAILLIGHT AND A DREAM.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND TO THE POLICE'S DEFENSE,
HEY, IT'S (BLEEP) TRUE.

00:06:20.512 --> 00:06:22.915 size:78% position:39% line:85%
THEY PAID OUT $6 MILLION.

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:25.518 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DIDN'T MAKE THAT UP.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.121 line:91%
AND BY THE WAY, TO THE POLICE'S
DEFENSE, IT IS NOT REALLY THEIR

00:06:29.154 --> 00:06:31.123 size:81% position:41% line:85%
JOB TO FIX THE WHOLE MESS.

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:36.128 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS HAS BEEN OUR RESPONSE TO
COMMUNITIES ASKING FOR

00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:37.329 align:start position:0% line:85%
RESOURCES.

00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:40.599 line:91%
LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS ESSENTIALLY
BECOME A SURROGATE FOR JOBS,

00:06:40.632 --> 00:06:43.102 line:91%
HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION AND ALL
THE THINGS THESE COMMUNITIES

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:44.136 align:start position:0% line:85%
NEED TO BE HEALTHY.

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.605 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE.

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:50.176 size:84% position:42% line:91%
MAYBE A MORE NUANCED ALERT
SYSTEM COULD ALLOW FOR MORE

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:55.614 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRODUCTIVE INTERVENTION BEYOND,
YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS TO

00:06:55.647 --> 00:06:56.848 align:start position:0% line:85%
DISPERSE.

00:06:56.882 --> 00:07:03.756 align:start position:0% line:91%

THE ROOTS OF HOW SYSTEMICALLY

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:07.760 align:start position:0% line:91%
