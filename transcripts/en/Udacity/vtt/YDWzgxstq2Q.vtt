00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.820
So we talked to Muriel about
vitamins versus painkillers, and

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.620
I wanted to ask you this same question.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.180
What do you think is better for

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.930
an entrepreneur when he
thinks about types of ideas.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.430
Vitamins or painkillers?

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.260
&gt;&gt; It's funny.
I don't really think about it in those

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.720
terms, but I guess the way I think
about it is kind of the same way.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.640
I would say the pain killer
is a much bigger deal.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.450
But even more than the pain killer, I
think you want like a life saving drug.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.810
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; You want something that someone

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.900
really, really needs.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.400
My partner Paul Buheight said way
better to build something that

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.950
a few people love than a lot
of people sort of like.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.800
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And so that's what we look for.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.340
It's something that people really,
really want.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.580
Because those are going to be your
initial core of passionate users

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.330
who are going to engage
with you sufficiently

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.500
to help you develop your product and
make it better.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.810
If you just have something
that people kind of like,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.570
they'll use it a couple of times and
then they'll go away.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.670
And if your initial users just go away,
you're left with a ghost town.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.720
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; I think that the biggest challenge

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.300
for startups, people talk about, you
know, you are going to run out of money.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.489
You're going to this or that..

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.760
I think the biggest problems that most
startups have, you run out of time.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.560
And part of the reason you run out
of time is because you're fighting

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.190
the apathy of the market.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.210
It's not that people know about you and
don't like you,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.720
it's that no one has
any idea who you are.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.570
And if you solve something that is
a really deep pain for someone,

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.660
they're going to talk about you.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.150
So forget all the conversation about
viral marketing, this kind of marketing,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.710
that kind of marketing, these tactics.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.200
If you solve something really important
to someone, they're going to mention it.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.730
&gt;&gt; Can you give me an example
of a vitamin and a painkiller?

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that again it's this

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.340
idea of it's different things for
different people.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.450
I think Stripe's a pretty good
example of the pain killer.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.530
Integrating payments into a website.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.780
Is such a big pain in the butt
without something like Stripe.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.280
I remember when we integrated PayPal it
took days and weeks just to like, they

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.960
didn't even have developer documents
that you could read in any kind of way.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.500
&gt;&gt; Right
&gt;&gt; And it took weeks and

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.350
to get this and the that and
the other thing.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.490
It was a nightmare.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.130
Stripe's a couple lines of code and
you have payment set up.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.050
For some people, if you're not building
a website that seems like a vitamin.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.700
It seems like a nice to have.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.460
But in terms of supportability, and all
these things, and ease of use, that's

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.711
a huge painkiller for anyone building
something for e-commerce, honestly.

00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:32.660
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.200
&gt;&gt; In terms of vitamins, I don't know,
there's kind of a lot of them.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.960
Not to say and some of them are probably
really successful companies or

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.380
become successful over time, but

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.420
I think that they are,
they don't scale quite as quickly.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.621
You know an incremental hair
dresser closer to your house.

00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:53.190
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.763
&gt;&gt; You know five miles
closer is a vitamin.

00:02:54.763 --> 00:02:56.910
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; You can drive another five mile.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.800
When it comes to software,
there are a lot of things out there.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.720
If you look at the app charts,
you probably see a lot of them.
