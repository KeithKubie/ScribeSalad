00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.709
hey it's me Destin welcome back to

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.659
smarter every day. A while back on the

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.220
smarter every day subreddit someone made

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.990
a post that said something like no one

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.610
ever believes that I can talk backwards.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.800
This caught my eye and I watched the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.750
video and it was fascinating it's a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.000
skill this guy has clearly worked very

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.470
very hard on it. If you remember in the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.359
backwards bicycle video, when I was first

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.890
learning, if I had a phone in my pocket

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.230
that rang when I was trying to do it,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.090
it would break that skill instantly and I

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.890
would no longer be able to steer.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.779
It's really curious how the brain works.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.000
I asked this guy if he would come to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.800
Alabama and basically become a human

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.870
test subject and let me try to test the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.630
limits of this skill. I'm really excited

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.940
because he actually accepted my invite,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.160
and today on Smarter Every Day, we're

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.140
gonna get to test someone's brain trying

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.540
to talk backwards. Let's do it.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.740
This is Kurt Quinn and...uhh...is it a talent or a skill?

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.230
I think it's a skill. A skill? --that you can

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.760
acquire. I think it's something that I've...yeah

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.940
Okay so Kurt can do this thing. He can

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.030
talk backwards and I have questions. So,

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.739
first I want to demonstrate the skill,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.939
okay. --and then I'm gonna put you in

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.549
stranger and stranger situations until I

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.650
see if I can break it, so, my brain? yeah

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.750
how many words can you start with?

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.280
Uh let's start with one word and gradually work up

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.250
okay; is that okay?; really?; yeah that's

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.750
how it works; yeah because it really it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.070
after a while it gets easier and easier

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.470
as I as I do it; okay let's start with

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.180
this; okay banjo (Talking backwards)

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.579
(Talking backwards) okay (Talking backwards)

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.040
say uh i'm in alabama with a banjo woman

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.840
can you get your banjo out? sure okay go ahead

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.350
move my underwear off it, okay

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.300
I'm in alabama with a banjo on my mind

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.820
(Talking backwards)

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.560
This is bizarre dude

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.299
i'm in alabama with a banjo on my knee

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.479
I'm impressed okay okay I know this is

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.220
kind of strange but there is a method to

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.989
my madness i'm going to start simple by

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.150
just demonstrating the skill and then

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.709
slowly ramp up the weirdness with

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.050
animals eventually I want to see if I

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.390
can completely task saturating by doing

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.430
different kinds of distractions and just

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.590
see what his brain does as a reaction

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.830
you ever held a chicken no I haven't

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.060
(Talking backwards) I'm holding a

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.330
chicken, this cat's name is Ganymede

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.120
(Talking backwards) this cat's

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.600
name is Ganymede

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.140
Dirty fish bowl

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.200
Dirty Fish Bowl

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.460
He has fifty animals

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.480
all of them I have to hold 50 of 50 the animals

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.600
bunny rabbit

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.780
is that how it works? yea

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.880
okay uh

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.040
my dog's name is Buckshot

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.440
my dog name

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.380
is Buckshot

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.060
when I started to think about

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.260
the physics of speech I started to gain

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.060
a much deeper appreciation for the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.799
algorithm that his brain has created

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.959
think about it this way in the English

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.600
alphabet there are 26 letters but in the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.310
international phonetic alphabet there

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.889
are one hundred and seven letters if you

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.720
think about that it's not that he's

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.579
actually reading the letters of a word

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.739
backwards, he has to phonetically

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.049
recreate the sounds of those letters are

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.569
making backwards. Okay I think this might

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.859
be awkward but I think it's worth it

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.530
think about your mouth as a control

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.530
volume you have a tongue inside and you

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.540
have teeth in the interaction between

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.299
your tongue and your teeth restrict and

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.310
allow airflow in certain directions

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.400
on the outside you have lips that can

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.799
hold back pressure and then they can

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.049
release that pressure all at once to

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.790
appreciate what his brain is doing you

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.989
have to understand that there's some

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.750
physical sounds you can't make backwards

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.139
for example plosives plosives or where

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.060
you pressurize the inside of your mouth

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.389
and you briefly let it go for example

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:39.180
pooh-bah cup yah tah dah those are

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.610
plosives the fact that you can create

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.590
those backwards is very strange because

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.450
if you look at a spectrogram of those

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.330
sounds you have this very sharp spike

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.460
where the sound starts and then this

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.040
release of air PAH bah KAH GAH TAH in

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.660
order for us to hear what he's saying

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.660
backwards he has to fake a plosive

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.970
because you can't instantly like in a

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.310
matter of milliseconds repressurize air

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.380
and make it sound good so he has tricks

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.050
that he's using to make it sound like a

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.770
duh ha ha it's really interesting for

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.240
example the CH sound, backwards is Tsch

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.940
can you can you do it while you play

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.220
your banjo I've never tried.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.060
Say Rainbow. What?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.900
Is that are? super hard! okay, yeah I'm

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.260
gonna tell you rolling well oh man okay

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.020
Leprechaun

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.780
When this went up. Oh man..

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.660
so was it harder yeah okay what's

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.060
What would your brain do in there now. I felt

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.650
good while i was doing this song that

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.750
I've played a million times and then you

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.400
threw the word in and then my brain just

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.240
forgot about this that's interest.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.740
Is this embarrassing to you? I mean a little.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.090
What is it? Why does it bother you that

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.440
you didn't get it right this isn't like

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.380
a challenge? Yeah it is! wha.. is it? yeah

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.810
right what are we doing if not trying to

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.420
do it right. okay.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.300
Leprechaun

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.120
It's your face! It is like I

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.350
could see the gears go eeEERRRRRR

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.920
okay the grand finale my friends Jared

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.510
and Daniel wanted to help me come up

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.100
with a situation that would completely

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.530
task saturate his mind so this video

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.150
that you're about to see starts

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.610
immediately after the safety brief which

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.230
is when he understood that there were

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.850
going to be two rifles on each side of

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.400
him firing at an array of bottles in the

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.590
field while a drone is hovering overhead

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.270
recording the whole event it was really

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.980
fun but one thing I find super

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.230
interesting is that the sound of the AK

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.660
as it fires is just like a plosive is

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.660
the rapid release of pressurized gas so

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.580
when we play it backwards think about

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.310
that gas repressurizing and that's what

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.040
a plosive sound sounds like when played

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.370
in reverse so Jared and Daniel are going

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.320
to be going after these bottles I'm

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.970
going to be yelling words at you okay

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.780
Alright. So first word is ready

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.600
alright put the weapons down

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.420
welcome to Alabama

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.380
okay that was a super fun video

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.060
and I just wanted to show you that we

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.530
have ducks as well we really like

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.080
animals. Anyway today's sponsor is who I

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.460
want to say thank you to and that is

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.370
audible we uh we have a book that we've

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.410
been reading together don't we? what is

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.810
it? Harry Potter, I know you're in

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.210
chapter.. aren't you in chapter 9? maybe

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.490
maybe.. anyway you go you can do on their

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:22.840
I.. we're gonna talk about it a

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.850
little bit later. You're in chapter 11?

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.550
awesome, so here's the deal i use audible

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.770
to stay relevant in my kids lives.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.330
He likes to read I want to encourage that

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.460
he enjoys Harry Potter's so what I'm

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.050
doing is even though I don't have a lot

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.900
of time on my way to work I am listening

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.460
to the Harry Potter books so that when i

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.560
come home at night I have something I

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.110
can relate to with my son Kenneth can

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.270
you do the pirate thing he is in the

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.100
second book now and I am listening to

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.050
the same books that he does, just because

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.940
I want to be able to have intelligent

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.860
conversations with my eight-year-old

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.480
way you can get a free trial and that

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.310
would really get big help for smarter

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.260
every day in all seriousness

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.440
Please consider supporting smarter every day by

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.810
going to audible.com/smarter and

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.030
getting a free trial as you can see from

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.130
my son's face he really enjoys the fact

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.900
that I'm staying relevant with him

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.990
anyway em.. also Kurt wanted to tell you the

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.360
URL backwards so that you can remember it

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:53.290
Smarter everyday, it's so silly but it

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.360
feels so good doesn't it? yeah it's so

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.180
satisfying if you don't see some of Kurt

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.800
Quinn skills this is smarter every day

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.840
he's got his own YouTube channel it's

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.210
Kurt Kurt Quinn yeah he's got some

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.980
really interesting skills this one is

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.360
pretty cool but I think my favorite is

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.040
the fact that you are a world record

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.840
banjo player yeah I hold the world
