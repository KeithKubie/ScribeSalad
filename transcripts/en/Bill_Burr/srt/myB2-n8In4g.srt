1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,220
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:05,610
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday.

3
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:10,110
Fucking June 27th June.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,070
What stuff? What happened
to this month? My goodness.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,330
Where's it going? You know what? I
think July 18th. That's my half day.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,640
July 18th I think we'll be wrapped.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,700
We'll be done with the writing of the
10 episodes of efforts for family.

8
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,670
Then all we gotta do is look
at the drawings and edit
them for the next fucking

9
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:40,080
10 months. But the heavy
lifting will be out of the way.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,040
Um, would you guys like to know
on an animated show works well?

11
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,460
You sit in a room and you come
up with fucking whatever. Yeah.

12
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:49,680
You have figured out how the
whole season is going to go.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,160
Then you fucking write it and then
it changes like 50 fucking times.

14
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:55,980
You rewrite, you rewrite, you
rewrite your record, you write more,

15
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:58,170
you do table reads, you
do all his fucking shit.

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,010
Then once you get all of that done,
what starts coming in as the animatics,

17
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:06,630
which is basically the rough
drawings of a, of the shit,

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,620
you know that you recorded and
then you say, ah, well you know,

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,820
why is he standing next to that chair?
He should be over in the kitchen.

20
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,580
You've got to do all of that
shit. He's not moving enough.

21
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,920
Have him take his glasses off
their of heaven. Fucking be.

22
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,170
You got to do all of that.

23
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,940
And then they fucking draw it and then
you look at it and then it still might

24
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:30,660
not be funny. And then you gotta be
like, all right is what we wrote.

25
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:35,460
Not Funny or is the way it's
executed here? Not Fun in that.

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,290
That's why it takes so fucking long in
case you wondering, cause you're like,

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,970
well shit, you recorded.
I mean you wrote them.

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,770
Why don't they just take out some magic
markers and fucking put them on a piece

29
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:47,221
of paper?

30
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:51,270
And then somebody stands there and they
flip through it like they used to in the

31
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,540
old days. So they used to do, they'd
have somebody, a the village idiot,

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,260
go up on stage with a giant fucking
notebook and he'd sit there going

33
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,120
from just going through the thing and
people would sit there and they enjoy it

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,340
and the guy screwed up. They A,

35
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:07,440
they shot him cause
everybody had guns back then.

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,160
At least that's the way
it was in America. Um,

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,460
speaking of America,
what's going on in Ireland,

38
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,460
I decided I was going to start looking
to see what the fuck is going on in these

39
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:19,590
countries and we're
going to be going to, uh,

40
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:21,990
evidently might know Neil Martin O'Neill,

41
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,740
the Republic of Ireland's Martin
O'Neill there, there, Bill Belicheck.

42
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,080
He was fucking pissed because Ireland
just lost to France in some game where

43
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,930
you're not allowed to pick the ball up
with your hands for whatever fucking

44
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:34,681
recent, you know,

45
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:37,820
you'd figure if you're only allowed
to use your feet or your hands,

46
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,920
or let's say you use your
fucking hands. I mean,

47
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:44,580
there's no style of fighting where
you just use your feet, right.

48
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,600
Maybe taekwondo, but they didn't, you
know, if you fucking come at them,

49
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,920
they're still gonna Punch you in the
nose, right? I just don't understand it.

50
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,490
I'm fucking with you. It's
actually, it's a beautiful game.

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,290
I went in to get my head fucking
shaved the other day. Right now.

52
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,290
What to this blob

53
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,800
of shop? A real barber shop when?

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,050
Where you walk in and there's
fucking men in there, right?

55
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,060
Rubbing their hairy
chest. And I'm kidding.

56
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,110
There's men in there and you just fucking
go at and you sit down until it's your

57
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:15,850
fucking turn. Unlike these fucking
Goddamn hips to fucking things,

58
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,820
whether they got the little fucking,
what do you call that barbershop?

59
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,810
Little swivel thing that goes around to
me that says I can just walk in. Right?

60
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,360
And then you walk in again. There's
nobody here. Can you shake my head?

61
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,230
I'll do Hilton appointment. Dude. Look
at me. How long is it gonna fucking take?

62
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,680
You want to make an extra
fucking 20 bucks? Huh? You don't,

63
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:35,670
I can go fuck yourself. You know,

64
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,470
you fucking 28th president of the
United States fucking haircut.

65
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,460
Who is that by the way?
Who is the 28th president?

66
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:49,690
Nobody ever talks about the
28th presidents. Let's look
it up. Let's look it up.

67
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,810
Uh, 28 president. You know,
if I, if I had to guess,

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,160
I'm going to say Grover
Cleveland, uh, 28th,

69
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:00,100
President Calvin Coolidge,

70
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,940
the Fuck Oh, oh, oh,

71
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,730
the content itself. Woodrow
Wilson, Woodrow Wilson,

72
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:13,450
who signed the fucking
Federal Reserve Act and uh,

73
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,300
and we're all still paying
for it today. You know,

74
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,330
it's a good one to look up
Woodrow Wilson's letter of regret.

75
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,020
What are the fucking odds I would've
said that sent me down this conspiracy

76
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:27,640
theory. Woodrow Wilson Letter of regret.

77
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,180
All right, where is it?

78
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,190
Where is did Wilson w did Woodrow
Wilson regret handing America

79
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,050
to the Federal Reserve? Woodrow Wilson,
after creating the Federal Reserve,

80
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:43,810
said, uh, let's see. Here we go.

81
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,790
I have unwittingly ruined my country. I
don't know how to pronounce that word,

82
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,900
so maybe he didn't. All right. This is
what he wrote. I am a most unhappy man.

83
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:56,590
I have unwittingly,
unwittingly ruined my country.

84
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,490
A great industrial nation is
controlled by its system of credit.

85
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,520
Our system of credit is concentrated.
See, they always got to write it.

86
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:05,440
So sophisticated.

87
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,740
Sophisticatedly I can't even understand
what the fuck they're talking about.

88
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,380
Like that thing, Dwight d Eisenhower,

89
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:15,090
when he gives that speech about the
industrial military complex itch,

90
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,140
I watched that over and over again.

91
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,200
I have no fucking idea
what he's talking about.

92
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,380
Even it's explained to me before I
watched the speech and by the end of it I,

93
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:30,910
I don't understand it and I feel like he
said it that way either because he was

94
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:34,390
so fucking smart. He couldn't
relate to the common man,

95
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,770
which I don't understand because he had
all those soldiers or he said it that

96
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:43,750
way because he had to say it in a
way that he wouldn't get off. Right.

97
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,080
I don't fucking know. Anyways, he said
the growth of the nation, therefore,

98
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,430
and all our activities are in the hands
of a few men. This is a president.

99
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,080
A former president wrote this. Okay, so
I don't want to hear any guys saying,

100
00:05:56,081 --> 00:05:58,520
oh conspiracy, go fuck yourself.

101
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,420
It's just like when I told you that the
NBA was fixed and then there was the

102
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:06,260
mobbed up ref and you guys all tried to
wiggle out of it. And what did they say?

103
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,760
Oh yeah, there was just one
of them. Oh yeah. Was there,

104
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,370
there was just one of them.
All right, we have to come too.

105
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,920
We have come to be one
of the worst, ruled,

106
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:18,620
one of the most completely
controlled and dominated,

107
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,840
govern governments in the civilized world.

108
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,420
Lone longer a government by free opinion.

109
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:26,870
No longer a government by conviction
and the vote of the majority,

110
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:31,700
but a government by the opinion and
duress of a small group of dominant men.

111
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,960
Oh, there you go. He still didn't
quite fucking say what he did.

112
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,403
Um,

113
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,150
Jesus Christ.

114
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,170
Okay.

115
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,500
Oh God. They got, they got fucking,
you know what they did Woodrow?

116
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:46,840
They put woody from cheers.

117
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,420
Their version of chairs or their
version of woody from fucking chairs.

118
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:53,360
They put them in the office. Well,
what am I even talking about right now?

119
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,120
I didn't want to talk about
this. I was talking about soccer.

120
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:59,060
How the fuck do I go from
soccer to that? So anyways,

121
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,790
it's Martin O'Neill who I would not fuck
with some of it at an Irish brogue in

122
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,750
those fucking glasses, you
know, you know, just some,

123
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,070
somehow we teach Xapi to the throat. Um,

124
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,130
he said they got the short end short
straw when they played France for whatever

125
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:17,630
fucking reason. I never
even finished the story.

126
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:19,960
So I wanted to get my
fucking head shaped. And a,

127
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,840
they had that European champion was
championship, was on the highlights,

128
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:26,030
the whole fucking thing. Everybody
in there was into the game.

129
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,580
So I automatically got into
it. So, oh, hope you guys know,

130
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,170
I'm just fucking with you
when it comes to that.

131
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:33,830
It's just that when the world
loves something as a comedian,

132
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:37,940
it's just so easy to make fun of it
and to get the feedback that you want,

133
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:42,890
which is totally people losing their
minds typing at you and all capital

134
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:46,940
letters. It's just fun. Um, so anyways,

135
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:51,380
for some reason France got an extra three
days to rest their tired legs in their

136
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,700
swollen feet before they got to play
the little footy game again in Ireland.

137
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,590
Didn't like it. You know,
it's funny, the guy,

138
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,920
the guy like trashes them
and says, uh, you know,

139
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,630
we got fucked over three days is
an incredible amount of time. Uh,

140
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,160
one side could have as an
advantage over another, uh,

141
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,430
Blahblahblahblahblah that said,
France friends who are really,

142
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:17,030
really fine team and good luck to them
and the tournament. I love that shit.

143
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:20,450
After you fucking trash him. I'm just
completely unfair. Go Fuck Yourself.

144
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,550
But I haven't said that out.
You've got a hell of a team now.

145
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,710
[inaudible] good shot.
Chia. Matey alright.

146
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,970
Irish news headlines March
going on in Ireland. Roy Foster,

147
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,030
Britton Co's signed a
margins by this stupid party.

148
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,380
I don't know what that means. Mary
Robinson is, that's not a real name.

149
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,360
Mary Robinson.

150
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:42,800
Okay.

151
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,360
Is that an alias? [inaudible]

152
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,340
Brexit could have a domino
effect. What the fuck is Brexit?

153
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:50,960
Isn't this shit Trump got in trouble for,

154
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,940
that's what I loved about Trump this week.

155
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,160
When he fucking went to
Scotland and it, yeah, just like

156
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,140
Scotland, we're going to
take our country back.

157
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,380
Cause I guess Scotland was voting about
whether they still wanted to be a part

158
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,780
of the European Union and uh,

159
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,070
Scotland overwhelmingly agreed to
stay part of it. Evidently, I dunno.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,470
And Trump went there and didn't know it.

161
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,270
And I was reading like what everyone
was saying and it was, you know,

162
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,830
trashing Donald Trump.

163
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:20,670
And it was so similar to what
people write to me every week. John,

164
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,830
Sally isn't dead. You fucking moron.

165
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,470
I said the wrong name. I didn't mean
John. Sally, you know what? What do,

166
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,160
what do you want from me? All
right. A former president,

167
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,740
president or what?

168
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,130
Yeah,

169
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,510
Mary Robinson. She was
president of Ireland.

170
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,660
You know what? She's a lovely
lady. I'd vote for her when the,

171
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,950
when the fuck was she
president, former president.

172
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,110
Mary Robinson has said that young people
in the UK must feel very let down by

173
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:58,111
the outcome of the Brexit
Brexit modal referendum.

174
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,840
And she appealed to the EU
to remember its core values.

175
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,590
One of the vague shit that
she say, Jesus Christ,

176
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:06,760
can you help out an American here?

177
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:09,820
What the fuck's going on
over there and that crisis,

178
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,920
there's some bullshit I have
to know when I go over there

179
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,720
some sort of referendum.

180
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:18,830
Should the United Kingdom remain a
member of the European Union or leave the

181
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,270
European Union? What's going on with the
European Union, the EU? What happens?

182
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:26,450
You guys formed a super group, but now
all the egos are getting in the way.

183
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,651
What happened?

184
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:31,400
How Greece is fucking economy went down
and all of a sudden it's fucking with

185
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:36,260
you guys. You'll never do that.
Never join a fucking group.

186
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,750
Take it from a complete loner who does
stand up, right? You don't join a group.

187
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,440
You know what I mean? You use the group,
okay, what do you guys do? Oh yeah,

188
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:47,720
you cater parties. All
right, I'm having a party.

189
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,840
I don't want to join your party operation.

190
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:54,500
I'd like you to come over here and a
Tyson balloons to some fucking lampposts.

191
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:59,180
Could you do that and how much would that
cost and here's your check and get out

192
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:03,860
of my life. That's how you do it.
Why the fuck would you go, hey,

193
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,330
it's actually amazing that they
got it done. You know what I mean?

194
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:12,410
Considering all the fucking wars
they've had over the years, you know?

195
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,513
Yeah.

196
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,640
Fascism, communism, fucking,
whatever the fuck we're called.

197
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,440
I don't know what the fuck we are.

198
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,460
Okay.

199
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,770
How the fuck did they do all that
and why did they do all that?

200
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:27,300
That just all comes down to bankers.

201
00:11:27,301 --> 00:11:32,301
What was wrong with having the pound and
then the fucking Ireland had this Shell

202
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,710
Ailey, right? What they have in Sweden,
I don't know what the fuck they had.

203
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:40,470
Some sort of thing. A leg of that
design the way a little shrinker.

204
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,271
I don't fucking know.

205
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:45,420
I don't understand why everybody has
to get in bed with everybody yelling.

206
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,640
It's going to be better. It's going
to create more jobs. No, it isn't. No,

207
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,160
it isn't. It's just going to make the
people at the top make more fucking money.

208
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,650
It's just like, you know, can we
have more people to fuck in the ass?

209
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:54,170
Can we have some of your people? What

210
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,230
a, if we would, if we combined
all the people, right?

211
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:59,230
We fucking microchipped them.
We phased out fucking money.

212
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,390
What if we did that right? And now, yeah,

213
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:03,670
everything's on your little
microchip here, right?

214
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,900
People getting mugged in the future.
It's going to be fucking hilarious.

215
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,860
It's going to be some fucking nerdy kid
getting dragged in by a football player

216
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,490
and you're going to grab a bunch of Dr
Peppers and some fucking Sag nut bars,

217
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:18,730
and then they're going to grab the nerds
risks and fucking just keep swiping it,

218
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,430
making them pay for all this shit, right?
If you're fucking rich, you're gonna.

219
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,260
You can't even go out
of the fucking house.

220
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,340
Someone's going to grab you and take
you to a Lexus dealership. Civil fucking

221
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,570
grabbed the guy. Just fucking, just
start scanning. Oh, that'd be great.

222
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,470
You know, it's not going
happen. They're gonna have,

223
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:46,210
you're gonna have like 50 men. Oh my God.

224
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,560
This is this going to be some
shit going down. If you get,

225
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,160
if you're going to have a microchip in
your fucking body that has every fucking

226
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:57,820
cent you ever earned, that you didn't
blow on fucking bud lights and hookers,

227
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,510
you know, doesn't that make you like,

228
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:06,850
what's going to stop somebody from just
coming up and just sucker punching you

229
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:11,290
and then carving your fucking
microchip out of your arm? Right.

230
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,100
And then it's like they got an extra
life and then they just have this fucking

231
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:17,290
thing and they just start
running around with tweezers,

232
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:20,650
just scanning a bunch of
shit. Why wouldn't they just,

233
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,400
you know what they're gonna do? They'll
fucking chop your arm off, right?

234
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,480
And then fucking hide
your body. Okay. You know,

235
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,710
like how they used to do
that, like allegedly the, uh,

236
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,053
the Westies,

237
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,290
they chop some guy's arm off and then
they would go around committing murders

238
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,320
and then they'd take the arm out of the
fridge and they put the fingerprints on

239
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,770
the gun and then they just put
the arm back in the fridge. It's,

240
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,620
if you get past the
fucking humanity, you know,

241
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:52,621
it's really brilliant and slash
borderline fucking hilarious.

242
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,620
Um, man, I bet those guys could
tell a story. Jesus Christ,

243
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,650
you know the shit they did.
Horrible Shit. But Jesus,

244
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,550
you have to be a funny
Bastien on some fucking level.

245
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,110
I know you're out of your mind,

246
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:12,940
but there is something fucking
hilarious about that. You know?

247
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:16,360
And then the cops, you know, when they
were drinking, the cops are just like,

248
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,470
that's fucking guy struck again. You
know, they will laugh and go, dude,

249
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:22,450
you realize we're
inventing a serial killer.

250
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,380
And they'd all be sitting there laughing
their balls off and then at some point

251
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:29,320
the laughter would died down is that
they then realize like, wait a minute,

252
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,950
where we're kind of serial
killers. Well, we're all doing it.

253
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:36,100
It's a group effort. You know, it's not
like it's one person. So yeah. You know,

254
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,900
whatever, go to another Jamieson. Um,

255
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,461
anyways,

256
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:45,130
I have no fucking idea what I'm talking
about and I have no idea what's going on

257
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:48,550
in the world and I evidently I need to
learn it. I need to learn it before,

258
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,180
you know, I go to Scotland, they start
handing up, fuck those signs. You know,

259
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:56,690
Trump is a cunt. I just all of that Shit,

260
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,490
Donald Trump is fucking,

261
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,090
he's back to being fucking hilarious
again to me because I know he's not going

262
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,080
to win. He's not gonna win. The
whole world can fucking relax.

263
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,270
Everybody knows Hillary's
getting in. Okay.

264
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:11,240
And what's funny is everybody's
going to relax, relax. Like, oh,

265
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:13,040
thank God we dodged that fucking bullet.

266
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,220
Like Hillary isn't a fucking bankers
wet dream coming down like a fucking

267
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,520
freight train. Um, now cheesy.
She better not get elected.

268
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,370
I'm getting a fucking audited. Do you
want to times I've trashed her. Oh my God.

269
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,730
Oh God. That fucking, ugh.

270
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,400
Some of the Shit I want to say.

271
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:33,890
I can't fucking say it because
in this day and age, you just,

272
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,930
you just cannot say that.

273
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:39,860
You understand why a certain
person did what he did.

274
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:42,320
Um,

275
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,250
age is Christ just coming home to that
fucking air raid siren every fuck he can.

276
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,880
He at least fucking, you know,
doll yourself up a little bit.

277
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:53,840
Jesus Christ with the fucking the paper
chase. Look over here. I mean, what,

278
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,580
what, what, what was the guy's
supposed to do? I'm just kidding.

279
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,490
Bill Clinton would fuck a hole in a tree

280
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,680
and he would do it with his
fucking pants down with this,

281
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,060
the fucking secret service standing
with their backs to them like five feet

282
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:15,250
away. They could literally film,

283
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,200
don't feel the wind of his hips
as he was pumping the tree.

284
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,460
Guys at Animal Day in and fucking day out,

285
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:25,640
that guy is a fucking animal. God
blow. You know what? God bless him.

286
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,470
God bless him. You know,
it's just how he's wired.

287
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,860
Did you guys ever see
that episode of cheaters?

288
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:35,690
Remember that show they'd
catch people cheating, right?

289
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,150
And that lady cut the fuck. Can anybody
find this clip from me? This Liz Lady,

290
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,610
a southern Belle. She catches her
fucking redneck guy stepping out on it,

291
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:50,900
right? And this fucking guy, she, you
know, he was supposed to be embarrassed,

292
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:51,734
but he was hammered.

293
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,930
She usually like, oh my God, if I can
pacy shit, I could cheat. Dude is cheese,

294
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,590
you know, slap rat fuckin two
dudes. And he goes, well honey,

295
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,690
did it ever dawn on you?

296
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Then maybe just maybe I was tired of
fucking you and I wanted to fuck someone

297
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:12,634
else

298
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:18,080
and he said it. The wiz delivery of
that epic line was just, it was like,

299
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:22,340
he was saying like, like hello, you know,

300
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,790
fucking get your shit together.
The fucking answers right here.

301
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:33,140
Like he said, it was such, he was
putting it on her. It was one of the,

302
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,003
one of the,

303
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,400
one of the more amazing things I've
seen a human being do in that situation,

304
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:41,120
you know what I mean? Um, anyways,

305
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,940
let me get back to the fucking,
what's going on here in Scotland?

306
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,630
What's going on here? Oh, by the
way, uh, so Belgium has been added.

307
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,160
Germany has been added even
though, you know, I'm making,

308
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:52,680
I think that paying me, like
with a couple of steins of beer,

309
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,860
which I don't give a fuck. I just
want to go over there. I want to,

310
00:17:55,861 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm that close. You know,
I'm going to do Germany,

311
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,220
some weird fucking town I never heard of.

312
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,250
And then I'm driving over to
Belgium and I'm not doing a,

313
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,850
what the fuck was the fucking capital
of Brussels? I don't, fuck it wasn't,

314
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,860
no, it is Brussels, right? A
Belgium, Brussels, right. Sorry,

315
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:17,880
I'm doing like 20 things here.

316
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,630
I just realized I never found out who
the fuck Mary robins were. Jesus Christ.

317
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,990
She must've been a great, she looks
honest as the fucking days long.

318
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,560
Maddie. Robyn said, if I production,

319
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:33,000
I didn't always tell you
she's cute as a button,

320
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:36,630
but I wouldn't want to cross hair.
That fucking shit. Any field.

321
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,470
Is that what you guys said over there?
What the fuck is his Shalala bill?

322
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,950
You don't know. All right.
Mary Robinson. Mary,

323
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,610
Mary, Mary. Oh, Jesus. That's
an unfortunate fucking picture.

324
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,810
Jesus Christ. Has she ever
used conditioner in our life?

325
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,950
Her fucking hair. It looks
like the Hollywood hills.

326
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:00,110
Right before they catch on fire.

327
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:07,290
Did the Santa Ana winds come out
of her fucking hairdryer? Oh,

328
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,240
I thought she was dead.
She's not dead. Is she

329
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,100
in office from 1969 to
1989 she's 72 years old.

330
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,620
She's got three kids. Wait a
minute away. Married three same

331
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,340
[inaudible] I eight ish,

332
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:28,341
born at 20 fish that made 1844
he never back Amish intellect.

333
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,320
I don't have time to read all
of this presidency. All right.

334
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:35,790
Open the fucking link account.

335
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,350
Robinson was inaugurated as the seventh
president of Ireland under the well,

336
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:45,450
how many fucking dumb along to you stay
in office seven presidents since caveman

337
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:47,214
days.

338
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,990
She proved a remarkably popular president
earning the praise of Brian Linehan

339
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:55,350
himself. Well, shit, if Brian
says it well then fuck you know,

340
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,990
before his death, five years later,
sorry, Brian in the Linehan film. Uh,

341
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,140
so that she was a better president
than he ever could have been. Oh,

342
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:07,860
that was the guy that went
after your can let fucking hire.

343
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,610
All right. I'm Saturday.
She was great. Uh,

344
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,890
that was every fucking I
accident over there. Okay.

345
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:18,720
She took an office that had a reputation
as being little more than a retirement

346
00:20:18,721 --> 00:20:22,030
position for a prominent politician
and breathed new life into the road.

347
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,790
How is that a retirement position?
You're president of Ireland. Oh God.

348
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,410
I got some questions
when I get over there.

349
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,073
Okay.

350
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,340
Brian fucking Linehan. Let's see what
Brian Lee lend a hand look like. Yes,

351
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,040
we get oldies.

352
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,560
You really want to see what people
look like to figure out why they died.

353
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,510
Brian Linehan.

354
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,153
Okay,

355
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,790
Brian, Linda, and let's see what it
looks like. Let's see the old, give me a,

356
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,510
Ah, you fucking in
shape. Cons. Come on man.

357
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:51,160
You supposed to have
the heart attack face.

358
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,020
Okay.

359
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,260
Oh, that's not the guy.
Cleo, did you just fart?

360
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,600
Who that? Well, hang on a
second. What the fuck is,

361
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:06,390
what the fuck is the guy's name? Man.
Brian Linehan. He died five-year.

362
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,630
They actually, the guy just
looked up was from Canada. I got,

363
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:12,610
I still have a chance
here that this guy was a,

364
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,443
Oh my God.

365
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:20,770
Do I have to hit fucking pause to find
this again? All right. Presidency,

366
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,490
Brian Lynn Ad. All right,
there it is. Brian Lenahan.

367
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,270
Come on. You can't Ireland. Hey or didn't.

368
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,080
40 Amber Day.

369
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,690
Okay, there we go. Okay.

370
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,970
Let's see what this fucking did. Son
of a bitch. Oh, there it is. Oh yeah,

371
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,780
that's a heart attack face. If I
ever saw, I'm saying heart attack,

372
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,760
I'm going heart attack.

373
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,470
He died on my birthday was
an Irish and a barrister.

374
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:57,850
What the fuck is that? Does that
mean he sings while he tends bar a

375
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,550
death? Just get to death.
Died. Okay. Die Dead. Oh God.

376
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,320
This spending up your disease. Come
on. I say heart attack. Heart attack.

377
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,910
Nice and quick. Pancreatic
cancer. 52. Fuck.

378
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:17,870
I'm to 48. Jesus Christ.

379
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,970
All right, let's get off
this fucking subject. Uh,

380
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:25,720
Micah Dolan says to the Lenahan
family anyways, it's such a fucking,

381
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,190
it's the fucking worst. I got a buddy
of mine. I, this is something too,

382
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:31,930
I'm going to be doing a
sh a benefit coming up.

383
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:34,170
I just had to figure out
how to put it together. Uh,

384
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,740
I got a really good friend of mine.

385
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:40,000
His wife just got cancer for the second
time and dig in fucking buried in bills.

386
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,650
So, um,

387
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,880
I'm gonna put together a
show out here in La and uh,

388
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,140
you know, all the proceeds are going to
go to that. That's fucking all right.

389
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,570
I'm sorry. I didn't, I, I thought it was
gonna be something for heart attacks.

390
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:56,290
Fucking funny, right? You just stand in
there. Hey Bill, you want another rag?

391
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:01,120
You know, actually, and
just whenever you drop dead,

392
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:05,620
people laugh at first cause they think
you fucking around. Like wow man,

393
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:07,780
he really committed to
that fucking face plant

394
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,070
bell right now all of a sudden you
just lay in them. Alright, I'm sorry.

395
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,181
Oh last week. You know,

396
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:17,000
I recommend that you guys go to the
all things comedy website, you know,

397
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:19,190
for all these great podcasts
and videos and all this shit.

398
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,140
So of course these fucking millennials,

399
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,080
they get there and they just stare
at it. They're fucking overwhelmed.

400
00:23:24,081 --> 00:23:28,520
So like who could you please tell me a
couple of podcasts that you like? Lou,

401
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:32,480
maybe I could look here cause I
can't do anything myself. All right.

402
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,180
Last week already should fear from the
skeptic tank podcast did a podcast with

403
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:42,070
comedian A. I'm going
to butcher this name.

404
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,570
Hormoze Rashidi that's how I'm
saying it about the Middle East.

405
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,010
It's hilarious and informative.
Uh, this dude was born in Iran.

406
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,180
So rather than listening to bill
O'Reilly talk about the Middle East,

407
00:23:56,181 --> 00:24:00,160
even though he's never fucking been
there, or fucking Wolf fucking bullets,

408
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,020
all these talking heads
with the books, you know,

409
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,350
and the aligns of suits right from
the bill O'Reilly collection from the

410
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,230
earliest is a wolf blitzer tie, right?

411
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,490
Whatever the fuck it is that they do to
get the XD or extra hor money, you know,

412
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,440
who you think has a better walk in
closet. Bill O'Reilly, a Wolf Blitzer,

413
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,510
you know though, they're
fucking shiny loafers, you know,

414
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:33,710
set. Just so you know, all
their suits all lined up,

415
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,730
their pocket squares and all of
that shit. You know what I mean?

416
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,010
He fucking take you downstairs to the
wine cellar and show you these bottles of

417
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:46,730
wine that fucking hundreds of years
old. He see that, look at that.

418
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,660
Look at that. I get this
for lying everyday on
television. Isn't that amazing?

419
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:53,240
Come on. You do cocaine. Want
to do some coke? All right.

420
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,580
I'm just saying with Downey, I
just figured I'd ask you. You know,

421
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:59,390
the wife does, wife's got a rule,
no coke on the fucking main floor.

422
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,310
Um, anyways, I'll speak into my
wife. Oh, let me tell you my wife.

423
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:09,290
It's a rough one. You know, um,
I got this new thing that I,

424
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:13,820
that I'm into, man. And uh, you'd think
it wouldn't be a big deal. I like,

425
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,830
uh, I like fucking tennis
and golf shirts. I like them.

426
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,740
They're comfortable, they're
breathable. It's a collared shirt.

427
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:25,250
People let you into restaurants when you
wear them and she fucking hates them.

428
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,290
I like the Izod tennis wear.

429
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,520
So today I'm walking out the house to
go meet a buddy of mine and I got one of

430
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:34,280
those on and I got these fucking a,

431
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:37,860
I got these Phil Mickelson shorts,
whatever the fuck they are, just,

432
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,560
they're just black shorts or
whatever. So as I'm walking out,

433
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,500
I go, I need lcls. She goes, all right,

434
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,430
she goes till tiger
woods. I said, what's up?

435
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,730
She fucking hates how I dress. And this
is one of these things where you know,

436
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,390
as much as you want to remain your own
person, when you're in a relationship,

437
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:05,630
when you're the person you fucking
says you're not, you don't look good,

438
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,690
it affects you. But there's some I have,

439
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,270
this is how comfortable
these fucking shirts are.

440
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,920
I don't think I give a shit. I
think for the first time ever,

441
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,120
I don't care that my wife doesn't
approve of what the fuck I'm wearing.

442
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,150
They had that fucking comfortable. You
never have to iron them. They're great.

443
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,320
They're fucking great. So I
was a, I was at the mall there.

444
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,660
Um, I really should fucking,

445
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,230
this is just like free advertising
for all these fucking people. Um,

446
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,950
what's the shit that the uh,
the honor roll student wears?

447
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,920
What's it called? Barnet
and body armor. Yeah.

448
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,740
We're not taking that shit
in our house. Clothes.

449
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,470
Whatever was over the
top fucking sports thing.

450
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,540
Armor wear underarm, whatever the
fuck it is. You know what it is?

451
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,060
Defense shields some fucking space
odyssey shit. You know the fucking thing,

452
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,520
the thing that Steph curry wears
is on underarm under armor.

453
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,560
That's what it is. Under arm's
deodorant. Bill a under armor. Right?

454
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,210
They got some fucking, they got
some great clothes. So I, I knew,

455
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:18,540
I knew she didn't like that shit cause
I said to her for my birthday, I go,

456
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:19,640
I don't, I don't fucking need that.

457
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,800
You know what I would love
though this the summers here

458
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,280
and the tab is rat for
wearing some golf clothes.

459
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:33,890
Um, so I told her that,
uh, you know, I told you,

460
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,300
just get me a couple of those shirts
and pairs of shorts and I'll be fine.

461
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,840
I'll be good. She's like [inaudible]
usually she such into fashion,

462
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:43,170
she gets excited when I tell
her the clothes and you know,

463
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,200
my fucking birthday comes along and I
gotta tell you there was not a hint of any

464
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:52,200
of that shit. So I called her on it
like a couple of days ago. I said, hey,

465
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:55,680
you know, uh, I noticed, you know,

466
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,620
I asked you for those things.
They're not expensive.

467
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,320
You were right there and it was an easy,

468
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,560
it was an easy gift to
get me to pad, you know,

469
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:08,040
make it look like you actually
spent time shopping. You know,

470
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,010
which is why I always go and I get
her a little, some workout clothes.

471
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:13,050
That's always an extra fee. He
would go right there, friend.

472
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,390
Do you give him a couple more?
It looks like you give a shit,

473
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:17,670
you know more than, you know.
Not saying you don't give a shit,

474
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:21,570
but who the fuck wants to shop? Nobody.
All right. I don't want to do it,

475
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:25,980
therefore nobody wants to do it. That's
how I, that's my worldview. Okay.

476
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,180
I'm really starting to learn from
Trump. If I feel something then um,

477
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,880
everybody else also feels
it and if they don't,

478
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:35,880
then we should ram it down their
throats. It's somewhere in there.

479
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,770
We take their coats is,
isn't that how it works?

480
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Have you ever seen a guy like less tough
in your life talk so fucking tough.

481
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:47,880
Like I dunno,

482
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,120
I don't understand why he's mistaking
having money with actually being

483
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:58,500
physically intimidating, um, with
that stupid scowl on his face.

484
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,420
I don't know if like Gene Simmons
had a brother that didn't make it,

485
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,970
that wasn't in a band.
That's what he looks like.

486
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:09,810
He looks like he's related to Gene
Simmons and he resents gene success.

487
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,510
Um, anyways, plowing ahead here.
So my wife fucking hates this shit.

488
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:17,340
And I called her on and I was just
going like, you didn't like that stuff,

489
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:22,260
did you? And she just fucking started
smiling and looking down at her food. And,

490
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,990
um, I was over there today and I,

491
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,820
I was gonna stop and go
in and buy some and uh,

492
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,683
I didn't.

493
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,500
And the only reason why I didn't is
because it's Sunday and it's a mall.

494
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,450
And um, that's just like, I
dunno, I don't know what it is.

495
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,010
I don't know what it is
about the weekends and malls.

496
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,750
Now I understand kids go in there,

497
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:48,520
teenagers going there because then you
run into other teenagers and you fucking

498
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,210
go like,

499
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,350
Hey, will you go out with me?

500
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,540
Do that shit. At least that's what
we did when we were of that age.

501
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:57,360
But like parents, like I just don't
understand what, why would you go there?

502
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,930
Especially if you get like some little
kid and you got to fucking push them

503
00:30:00,931 --> 00:30:04,740
around and that damn stroller trying to
weave in and out of all those people,

504
00:30:04,741 --> 00:30:09,330
I just can't imagine the fucking
misery of that, you know?

505
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,010
That's definitely a Wifi idea. You
know, we should go to the mall today.

506
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,890
I don't want to go to the mall. You know,

507
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:21,330
I have all these theories as to
why men die before women. And uh,

508
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,820
you know what it is. Women have to
include you in their shitty day.

509
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,480
You know, I fucking, um,

510
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,680
this my sister in law's
birthday this weekend, right?

511
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:39,900
So we ended up going to a, uh,

512
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,010
to a movie. I was all excited and
we saw, what did we see? We saw, uh,

513
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,560
independence day. Whew. It was
actually so bad. It was good.

514
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:54,540
We actually ended up having a great time
and uh, I don't wanna ruin the movie,

515
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:59,370
but like the fact that the white
guide precedent has to come back,

516
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,110
you know, and get shit done is
a little fucked up. You know,

517
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,410
Hollywood tries to be liberal, you
know, they'll have a chick president,

518
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:10,440
they'll have a black guy flying a
fucking jet and all that type of shit.

519
00:31:10,441 --> 00:31:11,460
But at the end of the day,

520
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,910
they bring back the old founding
father to come in and save the day.

521
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:23,430
Anyway. So I had a great time doing
that. Right. So the next night, you know,

522
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:26,430
my wife's going to go meet some
friends. I think it was actually,

523
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:30,090
it was a continuation of the birthday
celebration and I was actually tired so I

524
00:31:30,091 --> 00:31:35,010
wasn't going to go. So, um, I
was just like, you know what,

525
00:31:35,011 --> 00:31:36,510
I'm gonna hang in. Um,

526
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:40,140
I have a ton of shit to do cause you know,

527
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:42,900
I sit in a writer's room all fucking day.
She goes, fine coat. I'm like, great,

528
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,690
this is perfect. I'll get a bunch
of shit done and blah, blah blah,

529
00:31:45,691 --> 00:31:47,130
Blah Blah and all that type of stuff.

530
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,030
So right around the time it's
time for her to go right. And I'm

531
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,250
about ready to have a beer or anything
and she just goes, can you try me over?

532
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,000
She didn't say it like that, but
that's what she probably said, honey,

533
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,190
can you drive me over? But like,
cause I didn't want to do it.

534
00:32:01,191 --> 00:32:02,270
That's what it sounded like.

535
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,340
And I was just like, you can't,

536
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,100
why don't you drive yourself over?

537
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,750
Just like [inaudible] me.

538
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,890
And so I go for fucking Uber. He's like,

539
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,230
put a one take me,

540
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,770
you know, and I, I just went like,

541
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,950
why can't you know I'm home?

542
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,320
Why do you got to drink? You're the
one who's going across fucking town.

543
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,180
You're going across town.

544
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:36,330
Why do I got to go across town to
you know why you don't fucking know.

545
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:40,130
Why is it the end of
the fucking day? They,

546
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,460
if they have a something
shitty to do, they can't do,

547
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:48,110
I can't fucking do it on their
own. Somehow you gotta be, that's,

548
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,980
it's like when they have a fucking kid
now they dragged the husband in there.

549
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:53,540
What the fuck is he doing in there?

550
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,880
What the fuck is he doing
in there? He's not a doctor.

551
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,900
Do you know, I know a guy went in there
where you fucking saw what was going on.

552
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:07,400
He passed out. Now they got two
patients. The fuck is that, you know?

553
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,560
Well, if I have to go through
the equine and well fuck it,

554
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:16,760
talk to God. Talk to God for once,

555
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,630
for once, for once.

556
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,250
This shit ran your way and
now I gotta go in there too.

557
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,980
So you get to hold my fucking hand and
break my God damn finger. That's fucking,

558
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,250
that is the defect that fucking men gave
into that shit that you got to fucking

559
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,544
be in there.

560
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,990
Is that if you were getting
fucking gallbladder surgery,

561
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,660
would I be standing in there
holding your fucking hand?

562
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:49,160
I don't know, but I guess if fucking
them gave him gallbladders I,

563
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,490
I don't know that gallbladder
kidney stones is some shit.

564
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:55,640
I guess you'd have to be. That's
the dumbest shit in the fucking,

565
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:00,010
it's the stupidest shit
ever. My wife has talked to,

566
00:34:00,011 --> 00:34:02,240
if we have ever kid, you're going
to go in there. I was like no,

567
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,310
she got so fucking mad at me
over a hypothetical child.

568
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,150
You know,

569
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,520
if I was smart I just would've
said I'm getting smarter though.

570
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,510
I if I was smarter,

571
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,870
smart married guys go lapse allele
and I'll have to go at that. Yeah.

572
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:20,250
Yeah. [inaudible] your
way to put the baby in me.

573
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:24,120
I would fucking shit it up my ass
daddy. Thanks for you sweetheart.

574
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,660
Right. Oh, I'm getting heated here. Right.

575
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,270
I'm getting smarter though as a married
man, cause I'll tell you this right now,

576
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:34,990
the other, when we went to go
see the movie, I got there first.

577
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,760
Okay. And uh, I got there,
it was seven o'clock show.

578
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:43,150
I got there by like six 30 and I was like
fuck, you know I get time. Maybe I'll,

579
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:45,970
you know, it was a place to get a
sandwich. I didn't want to eat movie food.

580
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,010
So I got a wrap and then
they fucking had a beer too.

581
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:54,580
And by the way, I, every fucking
time I ordered this beer from Mexico,

582
00:34:54,581 --> 00:34:59,200
it fucking sucks. I'm not saying all
their beer stinks, but I gotta tell Ya,

583
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,560
I didn't want, let me tell
you that fucking bear steaks.

584
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:04,300
I'm going to get you the
name of this right fucking,

585
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,270
this can be a reverse
commercial. There it is.

586
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,430
The fuck is that shit called Modelo.

587
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,070
Hang on a second. I think
that's what it's called.

588
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,610
It is the fucking most
bitter hoppy fucking,

589
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,470
it's like a job trying to get the
thing down. But I was still a beer.

590
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:28,890
So it's at the end of the day, it's
not all bad. So I'm sipping this beer,

591
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,850
I'm having this sandwich. I got plenty
of time to eat it. A fucking relaxed.

592
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,820
My wife, the lovely Nia, she, yeah, she

593
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,320
texts me. She goes, Hey, I'm almost there.

594
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:43,260
And I like a dope. I started
to text, Hey, I'm already here.

595
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:46,530
I mean, I'm having a
sandwich and a beer. Okay,

596
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,760
now this is the deal for all
you youngsters out there.

597
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,380
One of the things women hate the most
is when their guy is having fun without

598
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:56,760
them. All right?

599
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,010
So any fucking time you're having a good
time and they're not there, you gotta.

600
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:05,280
How's it gone? Eh? You know, it's kind
of crowded. Y'All always say it sucks.

601
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,570
Okay? If you're having
a good time, [inaudible]

602
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,260
fun, you're

603
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:16,770
gonna have to fucking deal with that
shit, right? This is the thing my wife is,

604
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,780
is, is cool as it gets. All right. I
still have to go through this shit.

605
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:25,490
So I almost fucking texted her.
I'm sitting here having a rap,

606
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,960
enjoying a fucking beer, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. And then, you know what?

607
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:32,150
I was like, what the fuck am I doing

608
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,590
if I say this, she's going to then say,

609
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:41,710
can you get me one or she's going to
tell me to go over and go get the fucking

610
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:44,540
tickets. She's going to give me a job.

611
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:49,790
There is no fucking way she's going to
allow me to just sit here and relax and

612
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:53,900
enjoy this sandwich and this
beer that I fucking pay for.

613
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,750
I've worked all fucking day.
What am I a fucking asshole?

614
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,430
So I just erased all of it. And
rather than saying all of that,

615
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,920
you know, I'm on my way over here. Oh,

616
00:37:06,921 --> 00:37:08,660
I'm sitting here having
a sandwich and a beer.

617
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,010
I erased all of that and
I just wrote, okay, send,

618
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,790
that was it. I didn't say I was
there. I didn't say I wasn't there.

619
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:20,510
And I sat there and I enjoyed it even
though that beer was not my favorite.

620
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:25,430
And then, um, I ended up walking over and,

621
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,530
uh, I ran into my sister in law
and then I, and then look at dope.

622
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,100
I texted my wife gone yet, I'm just uh,

623
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,040
you know I'm here with your sister
in law, blah blah blah, blah blah.

624
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:40,850
And then she immediately texts back,
okay, buy the tickets immediately.

625
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,140
Fucking is a job for you is a fucking job,

626
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,940
you know? And she always goes, why
Nike's trying to streamline our life?

627
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,770
No you're not. No you're not. You're
treating me like your fucking assistant.

628
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:01,100
I'm 37 minutes. Holy Fuck. What am
I doing here? So that's one for you.

629
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,640
Okay. This is what you, you kiss
him. You tell him you love him.

630
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:08,150
You tell him that beautiful every
fucking day. But I tell you this, okay,

631
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,430
when you're having a good
time and they're not there,

632
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,360
you never ever tell them you having
a good time. No fucking pictures.

633
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,840
None of that shit. Cause they will
sit there and they'll either, they'll,

634
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,060
you'll, you'll sit there,
you'll be that guy.

635
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:22,760
You know that guy on the phone while
everybody's having a good time.

636
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:25,130
The guy in the corner was on
the phone talking to his girl.

637
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,640
Why is he talking to his girl?
Cause he told her he was having fun.

638
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,790
Stupid, stupid, stupid. It's your
fucking head in the game. All right.

639
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,340
By the way, the Australians

coming up this Sunday. All right,

641
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:41,770

now. No Hoop, no hockey, no football.

00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,420

643
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,890
And the fucking goddamn Dodgers
struck up some fucking deal with,

I dunno who, I don't know
where their games are.

00:42:41,571 --> 00:42:43,760
department store. Watch.
Why would you do that?

711
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:47,630
There's some brands out there charging
insane prices for watches that aren't

712
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:51,080
even worth it. Well, if you want to
look great without when you go out,

713
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,620
but still have enough money to buy
him or her a drink, checkout movement,

714
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:56,900

715
00:42:56,901 --> 00:43:01,901
these watches is shap originally
founded by two broke college kids.

716
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,130
Um, I never understand that.

717
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,460
Like they had no money and then they
started a watch company with what money.

718
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,480
What collateral? Uh, so you have no
money and you start a watch company.

719
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,140
All right.

720
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,100
Movement watches cut out the middleman
and their big brand retail markups in

721
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:17,780
order to give you a stylish wash.

722
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:22,100
Watch for an affordable price move and
watch it start at just 95 bucks a watch

723
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,160

quality for a fraction of the price.

724
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,330
There's sleek and minimalistic. Sorry,
talking to him through a yawn here.

734
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:05,450
Trips to the post office had
become second nature to you.

735
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,050
They seem easy because you've been doing
your mailing and shipping that way for

736
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:12,800
so long. But think about all the
hassle, man. Dropping what you're doing,

737
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:16,370
driving there, finding parking,
waiting. There's a much better way.

microphone@thetopofthehomepageandyoutypeinburrthatstamps.com
and
[inaudible].

751
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:01,130
All right, mercifully that's over. Yeah,

752
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:04,710
advertising is all right. Where the
fuck is the reeds for this week?

753
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,930
Um, okay. Lab grown food.

754
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,180
All right. Hey Bill, wondering if
you've heard of lab grown meats.

755
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,590
Basically scientists have figured out
a way to make plants tastes like meat.

756
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,080
Why aren't they fucking
with the food supply?

757
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,270
I don't understand what they're doing.

758
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:30,770
This could eliminate our need to raise
and kill millions of cows a year and help

759
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:35,330
stop the ass gas coming from these cows
from continuing to ruin our planet.

760
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,300
I'm not sure how I feel about
it, but I like the idea of it.

761
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,580
Here's an example from the article.

762
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:44,900
The impossible burger is more than
just peas and carrots smashed together.

763
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,750
It's the result of some
pretty high tech research.

764
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:53,390
Brown's team analyzes meat at a molecular
level to determine what makes a burger

765
00:45:53,391 --> 00:45:55,520
tastes smell and cook the way it does.

766
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,120
He wants his burger to be
squishy while raw gross.

767
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,440
Then from up and Brown on the grill,
he believes everything from an animal,

768
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:08,470
from an animals fat tissue to muscle
cells can be replicated using plant

769
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,170
compound compounds. Before
starting the company,

770
00:46:12,171 --> 00:46:16,340
Brown had a hunch that a certain
ingredient made meat tastes different than

771
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:17,150
other foods.

772
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:22,150
I had a strong suspicion early on that
I don't want to say that h e m e him

773
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:27,640
would be the magic ingredient
for flavor, not hemp.

774
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:31,930
A said Brown. Here's a link to the whole
article. Would you eat this? Thanks.

775
00:46:31,931 --> 00:46:35,350
Come back to Boston. No, I try not
to fuck with that type of shit. No,

776
00:46:35,351 --> 00:46:39,340
I would not eat that. If I want meat,
I eat meat. If I want ice cream,

777
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:42,340
I get ice cream. I don't get low fat
ice cream. I don't try to eat ice cream.

778
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,390
That doesn't make me fat cause you're
gonna pay the price somehow. All right.

779
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,310
And the reason why there's so many
fucking cows shitting and farting into the

780
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:55,540
fucking air is because there's so many
people. The problem, time and time again,

781
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,530
there's too many fucking people. That
is the fucking problem. So, okay,

782
00:46:59,531 --> 00:47:03,100
we all switch to these fucking plants,
then what are we gonna do then?

783
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,890
We're gonna need all this water
to grow all these fucking plants.

784
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:10,720
We are too much of a fucking burden on
the natural resources of this planet.

785
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:15,820
We need to thin the fucking herd.
That's the deal. That's it, everybody.

786
00:47:15,821 --> 00:47:18,970
If you want a kid, you have
one too, at the fucking most.

787
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,320
So you know you're not creating more
people than there is you. Right?

788
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,870
But that workout, no,

789
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,840
that wouldn't work out because
then they both have two than you.

790
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,240
Two people and the who then go create
two each. Now it keeps getting bigger.

791
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,340
One Kid, right? Everybody has one kid,

792
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,690
two creates one and another
to meet and they create one.

793
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:46,630
That's the only way to reverse.
Fuck our way out of this thing.

794
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:51,580
And if you never have kids, you ought to
get some sort of massive tax break. Um,

795
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,690
I think that that's what you should do.

796
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:56,440
So then scientists don't have to sit
around and like, you know, well, you know,

797
00:47:56,441 --> 00:47:58,840
at some point there's going to be no more
state cause there's gonna be too many

798
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:02,800
fucking people. You know, I don't
wanna live on a planet with no steak,

799
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:03,250
you know,

800
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,190
and I would like to go back to just
the way cow has just sort of ran around

801
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:07,650
chickens ran around then every,

802
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:11,460
I don't know where he just gave me all
right there for it as opposed to I having

803
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,460
miserable lives, you know? I don't
know. Anyways, let's blow ahead.

804
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:16,990
I don't know how I feel
about the whole fuck.

805
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,470
I fucking love animals and I hate when
people torture them and treat them like

806
00:48:20,471 --> 00:48:25,090
shit and all that. I also like eating
them. I love chicken. I love steaks.

807
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,810
I love fish. I like all that
shit. So like, you know,

808
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:32,770
if we could just get somebody to get out
from underneath these corporation cons

809
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,680
and just get everybody on the
same page and be like, look,

810
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:38,680
this is what we're doing.
Okay, this is the problem.

811
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:43,780
This is what everybody needs to do to
try to at least keep it at bay, you know?

812
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,050
But there's none of that, you know what
I mean? It's just this, I don't know.

813
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,440
It doesn't come from the right
fucking people. All right.

814
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:55,090
Getting through college.
Fuck a Mr Burr. Um,

815
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,920
how do I get through this college shit.

816
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:01,950
I'm currently taking anatomy
and physiology one in the
summer since they failed

817
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:08,650
it and it fucking blows ass.
But why are you taking it?

818
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,770
Did you ever feel like when
you were going to college,

819
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:15,460
you just couldn't do it because maybe
there was that one class that was

820
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:19,570
impossible to pass? If so, how
did you get through it? You know,

821
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,370
it's hard for me to even imagine
passing this class ever getting a,

822
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,230
I didn't know what that it,
I can't even say at k I n.

823
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:34,150
E s I ology kinesiology degree.

824
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:39,190
Same kinesiology. Sam Kinison
degree. Thanks by the way. Uh,

825
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:42,160
I saw on your Wikipedia page that
you died and I felt horrible.

826
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:46,810
I know you don't care, but just thought
I'd tell you. Oh, you know. Well,

827
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:51,220
that's good. Well, I guess I don't have
to pay taxes this year. Um, anyways.

828
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,560
Uh, all right.

829
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,720
Do you ever think that you're in the
wrong major or maybe you're in the wrong

830
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:58,320
school? Like life shouldn't
be that fucking hard dude.

831
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,200
It's not like you're dumb if you
taking these kinds of classes. Um,

832
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,640
I would say that, um,

833
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:11,740
the turning point in my college career
was when I decided that I wanted to be a

834
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:14,800
standup comedian and, um,

835
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,190
I still wanted to get a college
degree for whatever reason.

836
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,800
It was important to my
parents and I don't know,

837
00:50:20,801 --> 00:50:24,370
I just want to be a college
graduate. I don't know why. Um,

838
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:29,371
so I got out of the college I was at
and I transferred to Emerson College,

839
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,430
which was more of a performance school
and people made movies and it was acting

840
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:37,820
and radio and all of this shit. And, uh,

841
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:43,270
all of a sudden my grades went up
cause I was doing shit that I was into,

842
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:49,670
um, there, but there was a couple
of fucking classes that just sucked.

843
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,790
There's always going to be a couple
of those. How do you get through,

844
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,260
you know what you do? Don't blow
it off cause if it's already hard,

845
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,590
you get three days behind
in that thing. It's,

846
00:50:59,591 --> 00:51:01,700
it's going to be like being
a month behind four years.

847
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:06,620
So what I would do is I would just
stay on that shit and just be like,

848
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:10,640
all right. Plus Dude, this taken
over the summer as a joke. Dude,

849
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:13,160
it's practically impossible. You know,

850
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:16,120
I was so old by the time I
fucking graduated college,

851
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,600
like Matt transferred to
Emerson. I was like, I forget,

852
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:24,590
I was almost 23 years old and I was
still just beginning my sophomore year.

853
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:30,290
I transferred there in
January of whatever year. Um,

854
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:33,770
by December of the following year
I had done three years of college.

855
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,060
I just fucking, I just,
I just said fuck this.

856
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:43,880
And I did. I finished my sophomore
year, the January to April.

857
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,760
And then in the summer I picked
up a semester. So I finished that.

858
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,300
Then the next year was my junior year
and then I went to summer school again,

859
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:54,080
picked up another semester. And then the
following fall was my second semester,

860
00:51:54,081 --> 00:51:56,210
my senior year. And that was it.
I gave it the old right there,

861
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:57,343
Fred and fucking out of here.

862
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,460
But what you have to do is when you're
going straight through like that,

863
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,310
or if you're doing like the summertime
shit is, you got to stay on it.

864
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:09,290
Just treat it like a fucking job.
It's actually a good exercise.

865
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:14,150
It's something that sucks. It's something
that you hate and you just, you know,

866
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:17,090
rather than running from just turn around
and face it and get through it if this

867
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:21,200
is the degree you want. Um, but
sometimes if it's that fucking hard,

868
00:52:21,201 --> 00:52:25,580
it means that you're a square peg trying
to go into a round hole and you need to

869
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,180
go after what you really want
to fucking do. Cause you know,

870
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:31,970
when you do what you want to do, you have
a passion for it and it's, it's easy.

871
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:33,953
Um,

872
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:37,110
cheap hill. That was original.
Well, whatever that, that it fit,

873
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:41,340
that advice fit. Alright. Would
you consider a Vegas residency,

874
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,600
a deer country, McCann face at this
point in your career? If offered,

875
00:52:45,601 --> 00:52:50,601
would you accept a comedy residency in
Las Vegas or would you be offended as

876
00:52:51,031 --> 00:52:55,230
there's plenty of life in that old
dog yet? If not, how bad would you,

877
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:00,620
your career have to be going before you
accepted and which hotel would you like

878
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:04,740
to work in next time you
come to Australia? Play a Gig

879
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:09,770
in, uh, Adelaide. I Dunno,

880
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:14,620
we're not all backwards Fox. I mean,
I never thought you were take it easy,

881
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:18,310
your cunt. Um, what I do
that well, I couldn't,

882
00:53:18,311 --> 00:53:20,750
well if I didn't have efforts
for family or anything like that,

883
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,990
um, I don't think that that's for,

884
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:31,170
I think my ACC would dry up if
I just stayed in the same venue.

885
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,620
Um, [inaudible]

886
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:38,430
having said that, the way
you're, the way you're, uh,

887
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:43,390
framing that Gig as if it's a sad
thing that happens to comedians do,

888
00:53:43,391 --> 00:53:45,790
those are multimillion dollar contracts.

889
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,030
And, um,

890
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:50,270
anybody who's ever done one of those,

891
00:53:50,271 --> 00:53:53,080
as long as they didn't go to the crap
table after this show every night,

892
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,613
uh,

893
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,900
rides off into the sunset,

894
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:01,170
like with bags and bags of cash.

895
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,443
Um,

896
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:08,790
that's just something that I have no
interest in at this point in my career and

897
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,510
doing, I still like traveling
in that type of stuff.

898
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:12,890
I do have to tell you though,

899
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:15,403
um,

900
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,250
if she, if it just wasn't Vegas, it just,

901
00:54:19,251 --> 00:54:23,060
that town does nothing for me just
sitting there in the fucking desert.

902
00:54:23,061 --> 00:54:26,900
I would go nuts. But I do have to
say that, you know, if I could,

903
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,313
okay.

904
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:31,190
You know, all of a sudden
just get off the road.

905
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:36,830
I totally understand why comedians
do that after a while. Um,

906
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:41,240
all right. So there you go. All right.
And I'll, I'll tell you fucking town.

907
00:54:41,241 --> 00:54:43,190
I'll try to get close to it
next time. All right. Okay.

908
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,870
Built getting people you hate fired.
All right, this already sounds evil.

909
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,220
Hey Bill, love your shit.

910
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:53,000
I'm almost 30 mistakes are made
and now I work at a shit factory.

911
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,210
I shovel literal shit with a pay loader,

912
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,990
a for about 10 hours a
day, which isn't so bad,

913
00:54:59,991 --> 00:55:04,460
but it's made worse by my terrible
coworkers. It's a small operation.

914
00:55:04,461 --> 00:55:08,990
Everyone is about twice my age and for
the most part they are pretty average

915
00:55:08,991 --> 00:55:13,400
blue collar guys. We all hate our
boss and his yes man. Aaron boy,

916
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:18,440
a about Aaron boy. He's the
kind of guy who is always right.

917
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,660
Uh, done his way. Run and tell the
boss what the rest of us are doing.

918
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,170
Rat bastard tight. All right. Uh,

919
00:55:27,171 --> 00:55:32,171
he's also the kind of guy who says
the n word to let the rest of us know.

920
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,740
He's a no guff taking no
shits given type of guy.

921
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,260
He's not, uh,

922
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:44,290
he's white as the driven snow and think
he's Indian because he purchased a tee

923
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:48,500
shirt at Walmart and
with wolves on it too.

924
00:55:48,501 --> 00:55:51,950
This is fucking pretty random so
far. Well today I took my stand.

925
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,060
I snitched to human resources.
A you fucking rat bastard.

926
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:01,970
He goes, I told them how one
black employee knows Erin.

927
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:03,440
Boy, a racist

928
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:09,290
to you. You're pumped. You
have no punctuation in this.

929
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:10,953
Okay,

930
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,510
this is the thing I, you know,

931
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:15,090
I didn't like how in the beginning
you just fucking played the victim.

932
00:56:15,091 --> 00:56:18,360
Like I'm almost 30 mistakes were made
and now I work at a shit factory.

933
00:56:18,361 --> 00:56:23,361
Like you just glossed over all your stuff
and then you saying you got terrible

934
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:24,340
coworkers

935
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,960
or, well, what about, what
are you, what about you?

936
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,620
You fucking off a punctuation
here. Mistakes were made.

937
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:34,080
Mistakes are continuing to be made, sir.
All right, let me try and get through.

938
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:39,090
I told them how one our one black employee
knows Aaron boys are racist and that

939
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:43,590
he's pissed. I also told them
about the weird sexual shit.

940
00:56:43,591 --> 00:56:47,580
He says like fisting his girlfriend.
All of this is true and the,

941
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:51,840
the guy's a complete asshole who knows
the boss won't fire him and he takes

942
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:55,500
complete advantage of that
by making our lives. Hell.

943
00:56:56,430 --> 00:57:00,720
Is this like animal house is the
guys named Niedermeyer. Anyway,

944
00:57:00,721 --> 00:57:05,520
I come home and smoke some weed because
that's what you do when you shovel shit

945
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:10,080
and now I'm feeling shitty myself. I
hate the guy and I really hate my boss.

946
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:15,030
But sure enough, human resources called
me and I could sense their panic.

947
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:20,100
My money's on their fire on they're
firing him. Everyone else at work,

948
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:23,910
once I'm gone and is hoping he gets
fired. But now I'm starting to feel bad.

949
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,600
He's an asshole who I hate and I
feel like I'm sticking it to the man,

950
00:57:27,601 --> 00:57:30,280
but that I go too far. I don't,

951
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:34,230
I'm not big on rat and people
out to be honest with you. Um,

952
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:41,200
was there a way that you could have
gone to him and just said, hey, listen,

953
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:45,910
not for nothing. I don't want to listen
to you dropping the n word. You know,

954
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:48,550
and I don't want to listen to you talking
about fists and your girlfriend that

955
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:51,040
has nothing to do with the job. Okay.

956
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,330
And then he would make your life
unbelievably and, and then I would, I,

957
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:57,520
that's what you should've done. You
should have [inaudible] come in.

958
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:01,930
All you guys should have
just approached him, right?

959
00:58:01,931 --> 00:58:05,260
Like Mickey Rourke at the end of
Pope Bridge of Greenwich Village,

960
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,410
cause of f tape. I took off
a fucking dead cop. Right.

961
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,980
You'd just come up to him and just
say, listen, here's the deal. Okay,

962
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:13,240
you're still our supervisor,

963
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:17,020
but no longer are you dropping the n
word and no longer you talking about fist

964
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,450
and your girlfriend around us.
We don't want to hear it anymore.

965
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:24,130
You understand us? If you do, we're
going to human resources. All right?

966
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,310
A fucking creepy name. Human Resource.

967
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:31,430
So fucking disgusting. Yeah, that's
what you should have done. But you know,

968
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:35,880
you live and you learn. This guy sounds
like a condo. You know what I mean? Uh,

969
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:40,030
just do that in the future. Oh. And
then you could say, and by the way,

970
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:42,790
if you try to get any of his
fired, that's going down too.

971
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,260
So basically what we're saying is you've
lost all control to intimidate us now.

972
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,570
Uh, but we'll still do what you say.
As long as you're not a, all right,

973
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:54,640
go fuck yourself. Run A lot. Uh,

974
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,430
why don't you do that? You
like what I just pitched there.

975
00:58:57,431 --> 00:59:00,490
That's like when the cast of friends all
got together and negotiated together,

976
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:05,020
right? They got their money. You
could do that at your shit factory.

977
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,320
All right. Laying off the
booze. Hey, Billy blunts.

978
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,280
After hearing you talk about drying out,
you really inspired me to do the same.

979
00:59:12,281 --> 00:59:16,420
I drank entirely too much. Right now after
about eight days of daily commitment,

980
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:21,450
I'm up to about a half a fifth
a day with the odd beer mixed in

981
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,380
a wait. I thought you said

982
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,080
after about eight years
of daily commitment.

983
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:32,540
I thought that eight days I thought he
was like drying out and then all of a

984
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:34,190
sudden he's boosting that
confused me. All right.

985
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,870
After about eight years
of daily commitment,

986
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:39,860
I'm up to about half a fifth a
day and with an odd beer mixed in.

987
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:41,000
I know it's a lot,

988
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:44,750
but I've worked up my tolerance so much
that I don't really get drunk anymore.

989
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:48,440
I just lose an hour here and
there. No big deal, right? Yeah.

990
00:59:48,441 --> 00:59:50,690
The two that's called
blacking out. Anyways,

991
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:54,440
I was able to quit smoking weed after
five years of heavy daily use. No problem.

992
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:59,540
I was even able to quit using oxycotton
Jesus after about three years of eating

993
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:01,100
and sniffing pills all damn day.

994
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:04,940
I've been able to maintain a normal
life while going through these ups and

995
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:07,970
downs. I'm married with a kid
and a house and a great job.

996
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:10,040
If you make more than a million dollars,

997
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:12,800
I probably manage your retirement account,

998
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,580
but despite being able to
put the hard shit down,

999
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,490
boos has been the hardest so far.

1000
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:25,550
Last week I decided to jump off the
wagon with you. It's been hard as hell,

1001
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:28,100
but I've been able to stick
to it better than I ever had.

1002
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:32,480
I'm trying to limit beers to two a day
and only drink liquor on the weekends.

1003
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:36,710
I've slipped once, but I'm doing my
fucking best. I don't have a question.

1004
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:39,410
More of a requests. Please keep
us updated on your progress.

1005
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:43,370
It's helping me with my own journey
because none of my friends really drink at

1006
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:47,750
all much less the way I do and my wife
doesn't even know the extent of my issue,

1007
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:49,700
which is an issue on its own. Yeah, it is.

1008
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:54,810
It makes my struggle a bit easier to
hear you having the same troubles as, um,

1009
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,790
I have was sticking, uh, to my resolution.

1010
01:00:58,791 --> 01:01:01,190
Thanks for giving me the kick in the
ass. I need to get my shit together.

1011
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:04,610
All right, two, this is what
you need to do. All right.

1012
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:08,300
After just saying don't text your
wife that you have in a good time,

1013
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,240
you got to let you know. You gotta
let your wife know about this.

1014
01:01:11,241 --> 01:01:12,200
This is a major thing.

1015
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:15,740
You're not sitting there eating a fucking
Turkey rep having a fucking bitter

1016
01:01:15,741 --> 01:01:19,510
Mexican beer. Whatever the
fuck it was called. Um,

1017
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:25,450
I would talk to her about it because
then she can, she can watch it. Dude.

1018
01:01:25,451 --> 01:01:27,980
I can't fucking watch it. I
can't, I can't do this for you.

1019
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,270
You need to have your wife involved
in this and just say, listen,

1020
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:35,140
I've been drinking entirely
too much and I need your help.

1021
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,513
All right,

1022
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,310
so, um,

1023
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,170
I gotta be honest with you, dude. I
try. Like right now I have a beer a day.

1024
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,341
And that's the only,

1025
01:01:44,341 --> 01:01:49,020
because my wife had some people over and
they left a bunch of beer in the fridge

1026
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:53,550
and it's taken up all this space and
I don't want to dump it down the sink,

1027
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,880
you know, I'm not dumping out a bunch
of beers. I just have one a day.

1028
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:01,230
And what sucks is that corona light,
which are fucking horrific. Um,

1029
01:02:01,231 --> 01:02:05,820
so I don't even enjoy them. Um,
but I just have like one a day. Uh,

1030
01:02:05,821 --> 01:02:09,960
but last night, you know, it
was Saturday night, I'm home,

1031
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:14,370
you know, I got the best
fucking bar in town,

1032
01:02:14,371 --> 01:02:18,540
I got high end booze and you know,
I had a couple of home pores,

1033
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,560
which know, as I've mentioned
before, there's the bar pour in,

1034
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:23,550
there's the home pour.

1035
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:26,640
Cause you can lie to yourself that
you have in two scotches a night.

1036
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,430
But you know, when you go out to a bar
and you see what their scotches are,

1037
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:33,690
you like, oh wait, did I
say two? I met nine. Um,

1038
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,940
so, uh, yeah, like last night,
you know, I had a couple of two,

1039
01:02:38,941 --> 01:02:42,210
three of those after having the beer
during the day and I woke up today,

1040
01:02:42,211 --> 01:02:45,150
I felt like I got hit by a
truck, you know, it was awful.

1041
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:48,480
I walked my dog around the block and I
shook it off and I was just like, like,

1042
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:53,100
you know what it is at nighttime, it's
brutal. Being sober at night sucks,

1043
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:56,760
but being sober in the
waking up the next day,

1044
01:02:56,761 --> 01:03:00,990
stone sober is the greatest. It's, it,
it feels better than getting shit faced.

1045
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,670
Um, so, you know, and my wife, you know,

1046
01:03:06,671 --> 01:03:09,730
she stays on me. She stays
on me about it. It's weird.

1047
01:03:09,731 --> 01:03:12,270
Like I don't want like you sound
like, you know, you've, you,

1048
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:17,230
you've had some Harcourt. Luckily I
don't have like an addictive personality.

1049
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:19,360
My thing is I have time,

1050
01:03:19,361 --> 01:03:23,620
I have free fucking time
and I get into like,

1051
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,190
and I am a creature of habit. Like if
I can't, if I like, this is how I work.

1052
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:32,140
Like if I was to go out and buy a
fucking pint of ice cream, right.

1053
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:37,510
And I was the wolf, that fucking thing
down one night, I would start doing that.

1054
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:43,000
That's what I would do. So
like if I, you know, and,

1055
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,280
and all these fucking addicts
who go to AA and all that shit,

1056
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:47,110
they always trying to make
sure that they try to make,

1057
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:50,110
like everybody's a fucking
addict, you know, I'm not dude,

1058
01:03:50,111 --> 01:03:55,060
I don't have like a fucking bottle in
the back of my fucking toilet and shit

1059
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,140
sitting there shaken drink and fucking
mouthwash and shit. You know what I mean?

1060
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,970
I just like drinking. I enjoy it, you
know what I mean? But as I get older,

1061
01:04:03,971 --> 01:04:08,260
like just paying for it the next day
is making it not fucking worth it.

1062
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:12,280
So I just don't do it. And
whenever I decide to stop,

1063
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:17,170
I just stop and it sucks for a few days
and then what it is is it's not part of

1064
01:04:17,171 --> 01:04:20,980
my daily routine and then I
literally just forget about it.

1065
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:23,523
Um,

1066
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:24,780
okay.

1067
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:29,100
You know, but I don't know, you seem
like a little bit, uh, beyond that.

1068
01:04:29,101 --> 01:04:32,670
So I would definitely reach
out to you, your wife and uh,

1069
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,730
see if she can help you and
maybe if she can help you,

1070
01:04:34,731 --> 01:04:38,430
you stop there and if you need more
help, I would go do that. But, uh,

1071
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:43,850
don't depend on me because I don't have
any kids and I live like a fucking 14

1072
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:50,340
year old, so I'm not a good person
to use. I mean, having said that,

1073
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:54,090
I'm just doing a bare day if
that helps you. All right.

1074
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:59,280
Okay. S t d o Jesus.

1075
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:04,290
S t doe Jesus. Alright, Bill
Billy, what's that red mark?

1076
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,540
I don't know what that means.

1077
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:09,330
Is that something else I need to
be self conscious about? All right.

1078
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:14,280
This is a gnarly one. Um, I
recently found out that I have

1079
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,070
HPV Aka genital awards and he then he

1080
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,940
says gross. Uh, it's actually very
common and it's just a few small bumps,

1081
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:24,370
but it fucking sucks anyways.

1082
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:27,940
It can show up f years
after you've received it.

1083
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,480
So I have no idea who I got
it from. And once again,

1084
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:35,560
another great reason to get married
to stay out of that fucking world.

1085
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,680
Here's my question. I
recently met an amazing girl.

1086
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:43,480
We have a lot of the same interests.
She's a hard 10, Yada, Yada, Yada.

1087
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:47,260
Point is, I really like her.
I'm getting treated for the HPV,

1088
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:50,480
but I respect her enough to
tell her of the risks. Uh,

1089
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:54,370
she's getting into in the case,
in case it goes that far. So Bill,

1090
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,480
how do I tell her that I have an STD and
that there's a small chance she could

1091
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:02,260
get it? Uh, I don't want to
mess up this opportunity,

1092
01:06:02,261 --> 01:06:06,250
but my other options are basically to
move to a cabin in the woods for six

1093
01:06:06,251 --> 01:06:10,000
months until this is completely gone. Uh,

1094
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,210
thought it'd be funny to hear your
advice. Oh Dude, fuck you. Yeah,

1095
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:18,130
you've got to tell her totally 100% teller
and then just don't just say, listen.

1096
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:23,020
So I can't do anything for six months
other than to get to know you better.

1097
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,540
You know? And this is the thing,

1098
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,870
if she doesn't want to stick
around for that gay, God bless her.

1099
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:33,580
Who gives a fuck? You know what I
mean? You got to look at it like,

1100
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:35,770
well what else wouldn't she stick
around for it? But then again,

1101
01:06:35,771 --> 01:06:38,840
you're also coming out of the gate
saying, you gotta fucking STDA. You know,

1102
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,740
there's no right or wrong
answer other than to not,

1103
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,530
you got to tell people
that shit, you know,

1104
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:49,220
don't you watch the person that
had it told you? You don't want it.

1105
01:06:49,221 --> 01:06:51,250
You don't want, you ain't gotta.
You gotta break the chain there.

1106
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:56,280
Women are so much more
advanced emotionally,

1107
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,790
so much more. They understand
love, they understand emotions,

1108
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:03,700
they understand so much more than guys do.

1109
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,980
And it's not our fault.

1110
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:09,040
It's not their fault the way that
they are and all that type of shit.

1111
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:13,570
It's just how we're fucking wired.
I don't fucking understand it. Um,

1112
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,530
it is what it is. But I, you know,

1113
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,700
if she really likes you
and she's understanding,

1114
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,830
and then you're sitting there
saying, you know, if she's a hard 10,

1115
01:07:20,831 --> 01:07:22,930
people are trying to fuck her all the
time. So you're gonna be going like,

1116
01:07:22,931 --> 01:07:25,180
listen, here's something embarrassing,

1117
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:29,590
but it's going to be cleared up in six
months and I respect you enough to tell

1118
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:31,630
you, you know, we can hang out,

1119
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:34,420
get to know each other better and
all that type of stuff. But you know,

1120
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:37,570
there's no way I'm having
sex with you or anybody else.

1121
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,540
You'll come off responsible.
You'd come off as honest.

1122
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:43,960
And if that's what the fuck she's
looking for, she'll stick around.

1123
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:47,380
If she doesn't, then fucking
lay low for six months.

1124
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:53,590
Lay Low for fucking six months
and then, you know, whatever,

1125
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:57,580
go to the gym and get fucking
shredded. No, don't do that.

1126
01:07:57,581 --> 01:08:01,990
You'll get more ladies coming
up to you. Stay away. Um,

1127
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:06,640
anyways, let's, uh, let's,
uh, let, let me, uh,

1128
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:10,150
let me finish off this fucking
podcast. What are we up to here?

1129
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:12,740
Hour and eight minutes. All right.

1130
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:15,230
Is there anything else I
wanted to talk about? Oh,

1131
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:20,920
okay. Fucking Billy red faces. Uh,
finally gonna get himself a car.

1132
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:22,340
Okay.

1133
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:25,820
I'm gonna order it this fucking week
cause they don't have the color that I

1134
01:08:25,821 --> 01:08:26,151
want.

1135
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:29,300
And if I'm going to buy a new car or
Frugal Freddy's getting the fucking color

1136
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:32,450
that he wants and I'm not going to
tell you guys what kind of car that I'm

1137
01:08:32,451 --> 01:08:35,240
getting because I, cause I
want to enjoy the process.

1138
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:38,150
I don't want listen to who to
bug you. Good yet with pull.

1139
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:40,760
You fucking get this one.
You go get the one you want.

1140
01:08:40,761 --> 01:08:43,790
But I fucking looked at everything.
I looked at the January,

1141
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:48,380
I looked at the fuck, I looked
at a BMW, I looked at Alexis,

1142
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:52,190
I decided that I want one of those fucking
four doors sedans at fucking cruises.

1143
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:57,410
Um, I found the BMW to
basically be a, you know,

1144
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,610
I love the German,

1145
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,890
like push precision and
precision back at my kids.

1146
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:07,730
Say that precision. There you go.
But I don't think I can speak. Um,

1147
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:11,180
you know, you could just sit in
there and you just fill the German.

1148
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:14,090
All of it's no wasted movement. CF,

1149
01:09:14,091 --> 01:09:17,060
this suspension as stiff as
he wants a comfortable ride,

1150
01:09:17,061 --> 01:09:19,490
you get the seven series. Um,

1151
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:23,960
I looked at Alexis, I
don't like that grill.

1152
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:28,620
It looks like Darth Vader's mouth
on his fucking helmet. And um,

1153
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:34,930
I dunno. I Dunno. I think
I found the one though. Oh,

1154
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,640
I, I literally looked at
everything. Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar,

1155
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:43,240
Lexus, the whole fucking thing. You know,

1156
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:45,550
I'm not getting the sick ass model.

1157
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:49,960
I'm getting the one debt decking
debt has the right and this is what,

1158
01:09:49,961 --> 01:09:52,810
this is what I'm going to get a four
door sedan that has the biggest fucking

1159
01:09:52,811 --> 01:09:57,400
engine I in, in the, that I
can get in it, right? And,

1160
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:01,180
but I'm not going to buy a high end car
so I can still take it to the fucking

1161
01:10:01,181 --> 01:10:04,840
grocery store. And when some
fucking opens that in my car,

1162
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,270
it's not going to kill
me. You know what I mean?

1163
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:10,210
Cause I don't get,

1164
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:14,950
I just don't understand having a
high end car like psycho high end.

1165
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:18,760
Like I'm buying a mid range, you know,

1166
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,333
car, Amy,

1167
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:24,910
all of them seem fucking high end to
me because I've driven a Prius for nine

1168
01:10:24,911 --> 01:10:28,390
fucking years. Do you guys know I'm on
my fourth car of my life? That's all.

1169
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:33,160
I had an 83 Ford ranger. Then I
had this funny, I bought a used,

1170
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,450
I bought that used. I drove that
for fucking 10 years and then,

1171
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,840
and then it burned down to the side of
the road. That's a long fucking story.

1172
01:10:40,841 --> 01:10:42,880
Then I bought a a

1173
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:49,750
in like 96 at 97 I bought
a 1988 Honda accord.

1174
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:52,720
Four to a five speed.
Fucking love that car.

1175
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:58,570
And it was the top of the line, Honda
accord, the DX, whatever the fuck it was.

1176
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:02,500
It was fun. That was a
great fucking car. Um,

1177
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:07,240
and then I got a, then I moved back
to New York, so I didn't need a car.

1178
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:14,730
Wait a minute. Yeah. And then I bought
my Prius and then I got the f 100.

1179
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:18,150
That's all I've had. That's
pretty fucking good. Right?

1180
01:11:18,151 --> 01:11:22,860
Almost 50 fucking years old. I've
been driving since 1984 Jesus Christ,

1181
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,930
mom and driving for 32 fucking years.
I've had basically, I've had three cars,

1182
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,580
right? One, two, three, four, four cars.
That's pretty fucking good. How frugal,

1183
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:35,910
Freddie. So I've had enough of
the Prius and I had enough of it.

1184
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:37,050
You know what's funny about that car?

1185
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:40,020
Cause it's a Toyota and I've changed
the oil and I've maintained it and

1186
01:11:40,021 --> 01:11:40,500
everything.

1187
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,340
Like there is a major part of me that
wants to drive that car for the rest of my

1188
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:45,174
fucking life.

1189
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,720
Cause it's hilarious to me because I
know I could get a million miles out of

1190
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:52,710
that car because at the end of the day
all these fucking dopes whose cars shit

1191
01:11:52,711 --> 01:11:55,860
the bed unless like you remember like
the BMWs a few years ago when they were

1192
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:59,850
just designed to fall apart
at 50 to 60,000 miles. Um,

1193
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,450
you know, unless it's being done on
purpose, at the end of the fucking day,

1194
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:06,600
the engine block, it's made
out of fucking steel like that.

1195
01:12:06,601 --> 01:12:09,260
That thing's not supposed. You're not
supposed to have any problems with that.

1196
01:12:09,261 --> 01:12:10,530
That thing. In theory,

1197
01:12:10,531 --> 01:12:14,380
all of that Shit's should last for
fucking ever granted thing here.

1198
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,940
Thing there will come loose or something
like that. But the engine itself,

1199
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:22,270
when people just have the,
when your engine is just
fried, the valves are fried.

1200
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:25,050
And all that shit. You weren't
maintained in the fucking car.

1201
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:29,010
And for the life of me now when you
can go to all of these fucking places,

1202
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:33,390
I still never go to Jiffy Lube. I
still take it to the dealership. Um,

1203
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,840
Jiffy lube cause it's so
getting in and out of there.

1204
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,660
I always get nervous as you always
see those stories that, you know,

1205
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,270
they drain the oil out and
they forget to put it back in.

1206
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,010
Basically the poltergeist, you know,

1207
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:47,050
you move the headstones but
you didn't move the bodies.

1208
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,840
It's basically the car version of that.

1209
01:12:48,841 --> 01:12:52,260
Like they take the fucking
oil out and you know,

1210
01:12:52,261 --> 01:12:55,650
whoever's supposed to put it in up top
doesn't do it. The guy down the bottom,

1211
01:12:55,651 --> 01:12:57,870
it's, he just drains
the fucking oil. Right?

1212
01:12:57,871 --> 01:13:00,630
Then he puts the plug back in and
then he's got the fucking grease gun.

1213
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:03,330
He lubes the chassis all up,
hits all the points. Right?

1214
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:08,510
Like he fucking knows like he even
knows what model you have and where,

1215
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:12,780
where they all are. Right?
He's just fucking looking
for those plugs to fill up.

1216
01:13:12,781 --> 01:13:16,410
Right. And meanwhile, some other con at
the top is supposed to drop, you know,

1217
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:19,980
four, five, six quartz, oil, whatever
it takes to the top of your engine.

1218
01:13:19,981 --> 01:13:23,990
And sometimes they forget, then you
drive away, right? And then we'll,

1219
01:13:23,991 --> 01:13:24,750
then when are you going to do,

1220
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:27,120
you're going to go down there and
they're not going to give you your,

1221
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:30,360
they're going to give you the amount
of money that your car is worth,

1222
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:35,880
which is the total fuck over. Right?
Cause if it's a, you know, like my car, I,

1223
01:13:35,881 --> 01:13:37,620
I can't imagine what my
car is worth right now.

1224
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:41,850
I mean it has to be
worth like maybe $1,200.

1225
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:48,870
But the thing is, is for me to replace
it to go out by another car. I mean, I,

1226
01:13:48,871 --> 01:13:51,600
I can't buy a $1,200 fucking
car. You see what I'm saying?

1227
01:13:51,601 --> 01:13:54,300
So I was taken down to the
goddamn dealership. So anyways,

1228
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:55,860
I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

1229
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:00,120
Some weeks I got diarrhea of the mouth
and this is fucking one of them. Um,

1230
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:01,920
that's it for the podcast.

1231
01:14:01,921 --> 01:14:05,220
I'm still trying to figure out a
way to bring a couple of listeners.

1232
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:10,800
I decided that a, a contest isn't
the right fucking way to do it.

1233
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:16,480
Um, I want to have a couple of podcasts,
maybe a couple of two, three podcasts.

1234
01:14:16,481 --> 01:14:19,310
Listeners come in for
the final table read, um,

1235
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,730
of the year provided you don't tell
everybody what happened in the script,

1236
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:28,210
which could also be a fucking problem.
I think this whole idea was stupid.

1237
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,170
I think it was a stupid idea. You
know what? Fuck that. You know what?

1238
01:14:32,171 --> 01:14:37,090
Fuck it that offers off the table.
I'm sorry. I just, this day and age,

1239
01:14:37,091 --> 01:14:39,820
everybody's gonna fucking go high.
I won't fucking say anything.

1240
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:41,550
And then you know what? They're
going, they're going to go right away.

1241
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:44,610
And what did she do after
all the yeah, yet bullshit.

1242
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:49,210
You're gonna go right fucking down. You're
going to fuck me over. I know things.

1243
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,070
It's too much of a risk. I'll come up
with something else. Alright, here we go.

1244
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:57,010
Hour and 15 minutes. Say you
go, you guys enjoy your Monday,

1245
01:14:57,190 --> 01:15:01,960
you're fucking cunts and a, I'll
check in on you on Thursday. Um,

1246
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:05,110
I have put guys, have a nice couple
of days there. All right. See Ya.
