Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. All right. Let me ask you this, because you're all in the technology. Go ahead. What do you think about aliens? It's doesn't seem tech related at all. Yeah. Um, do you think they exist? Do you think they've ever visited here? Oh God, no. No, I don't think so. I think they would've destroyed us. Brilliant. Yeah, but why? When we visit primitive tribes, we don't destroy them necessarily. Like we try to leave them alone. Do we try, but we end up destroying him one way or the other. Anyways, I was a few. Even when people do for sure. Even when we try to be nice, it's like, yeah, look that tribal, let's analyze them, sent a few photos, let's give them food, and they nearly die pretty much. Yeah. There's always that. There's that image of famous image of these tribes, people in Brazil and uncontacted tribe and they're painted their body paint and then the arrows drawn at the helicopter.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Now they know about helicopters and slowly and surely the freaking house, the new song, God, yeah. Now they worship. Any religion can see you think about it. Imagine if you were an uncontacted tribe and all of a sudden you saw the helicopter shows up. Whenever I see a helicopter show, I freak out in general. Yeah. In general. You know what I mean? So like imagine that's, that's insane. Have you ever been in one helicopter? Yes. So weird. Right? Right. It's weird, but yeah, around like, okay, we're in the sky way. It makes noise. Absolutely. But no, I think, um, I don't know man. I think they would've destroyed us. They'd be like, these guys are stupid. Don't you think it would want to watch look like if you go to the zoo, right? You go to the, the chimpanzee exhibit and you watch them swing around and shit.

Speaker 1:          01:28          People love to watch the chimps. It's probably one of the most popular parts of the exhibit and we love watching them like, oh, look at them, look at them. And if you could go someplace where you could wash them in the wild. Yeah. Like if there was like a Webcam or you can tune in to the Congo right now, you would definitely. How do we, how do we know they're not watching us right now? Exactly. That's the thing. They probably are. They probably are, but wouldn't they just like watch and observe? So we just, we don't blow ourselves. So we would never know that in general they can live among us. We wouldn't know. I mean, I would imagine that if there was a civilization that's on the cusp of some major breakthrough as far as artificial intelligence goes, which is where we are. Right?

Speaker 1:          02:05          And in many ways I think that we're all super fortunate to be alive right now. Absolutely. Because even though this is a time of incredible turmoil, it's also a time of an amazing potential and change. I'm greedy as hell though. I want to see more. I know I want to see more. I want to see, I really want to see a robot uprising. I, I'm dead serious. What don't I do ask. I really do. And I want to be like 90 ish years old and I want there to be this super advanced AI robot just to take over and that shooting shit. And I also want, I will, cause Ilan mosque has head, he'll still be alive because it had to be in a jar and he'd be like, I told you so. I told you a little robot hand. I told you what I want to say because it's like, it's the, it's a cool, it's like Terminator Shit.

Speaker 1:          02:46          I'm going to shit. I want to see that. Why at all. I want to see the aliens come in and stop us. Right. And we're about to hit the, the green switch to turn on artificial intelligence on what? The aliens to come down with their little legs greenhand hand go, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, no. They weren't. They were this, the robot gave this dynamic. Yeah, it's, it's wrestling with him, right? Yeah. It's going to grab your Dick like that. I might like it. You're going to be beating off that things gonna come and let me help you. But the thing is, what's, what's stopping that from not wrapping around his neck and just crushing it. There's nothing stopping it. If you get hacked, think about the same people that helped you make your Tesla work, right? They're going to hack into this fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          03:22          It's going to run right through your walls. Skynet, it's going to eat your dog. If you've seen the ones that flip they, they didn't have them on trap pieces like Cirque de Solei actually, have you seen the part where they actually beat the robots and less like, yeah, you know what my favorite part of that is? Well, they, they beat the robots to find out the robots fall over, right? Kick them and shit. Hida released a statement saying it's not cool. You can't do the robot. Get involved in everything. You know what I mean? It's not cool. Wait, how about, how about a robot coalition should be a robot coalition. We're like, we stand with robots to say, listen, we built these things but we can't hit them. Like, let me ask you this. Here's the real question. If you're 90 years old and you're still lucid in your put, your body's failing, you've got and your knees are gone and your, your hip's bad and your back hurts all the time and your, your shoulders are all torn apart.

Speaker 1:          04:10          You can't pick things up and they say, rich, we can download your consciousness, not this into this artificial body. It's like you, if you were Anderson Silva when he was 30 years old, Black Mirror Shit. Yeah. They give you the super powerful body, right? It's, it's, you're going to feel it just like that, but now you're going to be like a super elite athlete and it's going to be you and we'll put your consciousness or you can just go to black and see what happens in the afterlife. He had to just let, let this 90 year old body dies. The silliest question ever. You're going to take the course. I would shake it bird in the hand, right? Yeah. What's APP to let my might be bullshit, right? I can just myself right now. When you do that, fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. If you want to do it right now.

Speaker 1:          04:54          I'm not even at 90 well I think that's how they're going to get us. I think slowly but surely they're going to replace parts like there's already amazing, um, artificial hands that you're creating and you know limbs that are articulating rems. He's a thing. Would you want one of the limbs that looks like a human limb? Would you want like a robotic limb? I can terminate her. I don't want to terminate her limb for sure. What'd you for sure. I want to, you want to stare at me? But what if it was a nice and soft? Do you think we're close to Robo cop then? Like would that be maybe the first, first step? Yeah, that's probably right. They'd probably going to do that with like soldiers. Chefy all the money's in the military. Yeah, they'll drop the skeleton. Drop 10 billion on that. I met social robots, I saw was at Pachanga casino at the mall.

Speaker 1:          05:33          It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever weird. I'll fuck that thing up. The one in the middle, the one in the middle. I want. So like I said, I put my hat on it and it said freaking out. They get mad at you. Yeah. It just that it's going around in circles. I would, if it had, I wish it had a gun on it. Oh No. Then people will take it seriously. Well that's the worry about those dog things. Those dog like robots that they just put guns in those motherfuckers. That is an episode of Black Mirror episode. No, I didn't see that one. Yeah, it's called heavy metal. Really? One of the best episodes. This lady's run out, the spoiler alert. This ladies running from these robots had dogs not to have, I wrote it on something. The dog looks like one of those things.

Speaker 1:          06:07          Yeah, I gotta check that out. Yeah. And it has potential like actual real technology that it's using. So like it's not outlandish things about black mirror. Everything is, yeah, that could happen. That's 100% but yeah, even a whole, the thing where they implant memories and you like live this crazy fake life. Right. That's all that's on the horizon. So you know, the interesting part about Black Mirror is that there's a pro and a con to everything. So there was a, an episode where a woman wanted to keep better track of her daughter. So she implanted that ship so she could see whatever her daughter sees, right? Then her daughter got older and older and she started to see some wild shit that the kid was doing. Right? But then to your example, what would be the downside of putting my consciousness in someone with a jacket and like ripped body?

Speaker 1:          06:53          Well, the downside would be, would you even really be a human anymore or would you be some sort of a thing that we've created that keeps your brain alive? Right? But who cares? Who does care? Yeah. Well, here's the thing. Would you want to live a whole nother life? Like how much time do you want in this fake body? Do you want to be a mortal? Do you want to keep going forever? Not Forever now. I mean, what do well, at 200 years, you know, there's an old story about that, about a guy, God dammit. It's like an old legend about um, a man who kept killing his son's in order to live longer like that. God came to him and told him if you kill the son, and he lived to be like thousands of years old, but he just had no one around him. They cared about him and love somebody, a job in the Bible or something like that, whatever.

Speaker 1:          07:37          Keep going since from something. Yeah, I don't remember. But but point is like when you got to 200 years, if you said, okay, I'm going to take this body and I live in it for 200 years, 200 years I'll be done. That's it. Right? 198 years comes along and you still like a 30 year old Anderson Silva. I couldn't do it. You're having a great time. It's a good point. But you might be like super wise. That's the other thing. If you think, if you've, if you think of how smart a person is, they keep their shit together and they become like a mature older man who's just wise and understands the way the world works. He was well read and it really is taking the time to do the work on themselves personally. They know themselves better than they did when they were young. Foolish man.

Speaker 1:          08:15          That's hopefully most of us as we get older. But what if you could live 300 years, how wise would you be done? My biggest concern isn't necessarily about being wise. I think it's about my loved ones cause like I'll watch, you know what I mean? Cause you see a lot in 300 if you see a lot of shit like that's like three wives actually maybe four six on who knows. Right. But like as they pass you'd be like you have your kids and like your kid will live to be 80 years old and you're just like hey you know you your kid a new body. Yeah that's more tend to want to go on forever though. Cause I feel like what's the world gonna look like in 300 years? Maybe the dope, maybe it would be the shit. Maybe people would be, maybe it would you want it done?

Speaker 1:          08:51          You don't mind. The most fascinating thing I keep thinking about is us going to and know Eli Musk really wants that. Do you want to go? Would you go? Nope. Why not interested? It's a one way trip. I know. Look, I don't want to go to Antarctica. Really? Fuck what I want to go to Mars. I don't want to go anywhere where people can't live. You go to Utah and the woods and shoot deers and stuff. People live, they're beautiful. The streams and trees. It's gorgeous. But you were just saying that you don't like when people come up to you at a restaurant, harass you so like you're living alone. I like being around people though. That's why I go to a restaurant. I'm not like in a cave somewhere and trying to eat. You know what I mean? I mean there's nothing wrong. I feel like you would want to do that. I feel like all this, all this manly shit that you do, like men want to just go and just like light fires and caves and shit and just like do go on. Mars is stupid. You can't come back. That's like going to the shittiest neighborhood in the known universe. Even get to one way. Guess what your name? Oh yeah, we'll live forever. We'll live on with doesn't mean Shit. Assholes. No one cares. No. What's his name? Lives forever. Hitler. Fuck.
