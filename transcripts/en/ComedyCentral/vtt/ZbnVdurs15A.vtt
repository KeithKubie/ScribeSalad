00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.901
Hello. I'm Tess Lynch,

00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:03.669
and today we're going
to be talking about

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:06.239
Marjory Stoneman Douglas.

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:09.042
Listen. I'm gonna
transport you back in time.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.845
 Picture it. Florida.
 The 1920s.

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:15.014
 There's a special place

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:18.785
 that is the craziest
 environment that you can find

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.653
 called the Everglades.

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:23.156
 But South Florida
 is experiencing

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.125
 an unprecedented
 population explosion.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:29.462
 So they're draining wetlands,
 building houses.

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:31.964
 The developers are like,
 great!

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:35.234
 I'm gonna build condos!
 I'm gonna build little tiny

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:38.004
 ticky-tacky, ticky-tacky,
 ticky-tacky houses.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.506
 Hey, look at this swamp.
 It's full of bullshit.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.709
 I'm gonna put a [bleep]
 99¢ store on it.

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:45.678
 But the problem with this

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:48.481
is that everybody's
draining the resources

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:52.585
of one of the most unique
ecosystems on the planet--

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.954
the Everglades!
- [laughs]

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:57.890
 - And Ernest Coe,
 and landscape architect,

00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:00.927
 realizes, like,
 this place is special as hell.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.962
 I'm gonna get this place
 certified as a national park

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:04.931
 if it's the last thing I do.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.332
 And so he's flipping through

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.135
 the "Important People of
 Florida Directory,"

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:12.738
 and he comes across a name--
 Marjory Stoneman Douglas.

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:15.374
 Very interesting lady.
 She's like, you know,

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:18.444
 I'm a very early supporter
 of the ACLU,

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:21.247
 and I'm supporting, you know,
 women's suffrage

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.282
 and civil rights,
 and that's just what I do.

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.251
 I'm opinionated!

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:28.121
 And Coe's like,
 this is the perfect person

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.922
 to get on board with my cause.

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:32.859
 And Coe is like, come with me
 to the Everglades.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:34.627
 And so she goes down
 to the Everglades,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.329
 and she's all in her
 [bleep] pearls,

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.997
 and she's wearing
 her straw hat,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.533
 and she's like, yikes,
 this place is too muggy,

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.002
 too buggy, too inhospitable.

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.505
 It's mucky and gucky!
 I don't like it.

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.773
 And then she's looking around
 like, holy shit,

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:50.409
 that's a crocodile holding
 hands with an alligator

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:52.011
 is what that is!

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:53.813
 That's a manatee!

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:56.549
 That [bleep] thing looks like
 a cow under the ocean floor.

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:58.351
 And that's a mangrove tree!

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.785
 That's growing
 in the brackish water

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:02.021
 that's half salt, half fresh,
 and I don't know

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.524
 how that thing grows,
 but it's [bleep] doing it.

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:07.293
 I actually think
 I love this place.

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:10.363
 I'm gonna be a champion
 for here.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:13.199
 There's a bug in front of me.
 - What?

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:15.168
- You see that bug.
I see you seeing the bug.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.236
 - Yeah, I see the [bleep]--
 - I love bugs,

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.838
 but that bug I don't like.

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.841
It's like he's, like,
antagonistic. He's there.

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:24.210
 I could grab him.
 But I don't wanna kill him.

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:26.312
 I just wanna release him
 to nature.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:28.714
You know what I mean?
- That's nice.

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:31.083
- Can we keep going?

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:34.287
 So they go to these
 town hall meetings.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.490
 The developers are like,
 malls, malls, malls!

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:39.091
 Coe and Marjory are like,

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:41.027
 shut the [bleep] up.
 Protect the Everglades.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.430
 And the legislators
 are like...[stammering]

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:46.432
 Ahh. All right.

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:50.136
 But, I mean, it's not gonna be
 so simple as like pffftt.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.605
 Coe says to Marjory,
 I think they're saying

00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:55.007
 that this land
 is pretty much protected.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.076
 And Marjory's like,
 don't you know the government

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.380
 by now? It's gonna be
 a long-fought battle, Coe!

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:05.851
 So Marjory goes down
 into the Everglades,

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:09.956
 and she spends
 13 crazy long years

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.525
 writing every detail down.

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:14.460
 You know,
 I'm gonna write a book!

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:18.898
 "The Everglades:
 River of Grass."

00:03:18.931 --> 00:03:21.767
 That's a good title,
 God damn it.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.003
 1947, this thing is published.

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:25.538
 Immediate best seller.

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.473
 So people are like,
 holy shit!

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:30.042
 I was just sort of
 thinking about my casseroles.

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:31.777
 Now I'm a [bleep] activist!

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.180
All of a sudden, the Everglades
are really important to people

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:35.881
who never cared before.

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:37.750
 And then later that year,

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:40.987
 the first 1.3 million acres
 of the Everglades

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.589
 are officially desigignated--

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:44.857
 desigignated.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.927
♪ Designated ♪
as a national park,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.830
 just like Coe and Marjory
 had wanted.

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.432
 But then
 Ernest Coe dies.

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:55.234
 - Oh.
 - It's so sad.

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:58.137
Most people could kinda
kick back.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.006
Guess what.
She doesn't quit.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.675
You know why?
Girl likes a challenge.

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:05.811
 So when she hears
 the Nixon administration

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:10.249
 is planning to build Miami
 Nat--International Airport

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:14.153
 on the Everglades,
 she just can't let it slide.

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:15.020
 ♪ ♪

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:15.855
- Would you mind if I made

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:17.456
just a little higher?
- I would love it.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.924
- Is that okay?

- Yeah. They catch up
on you, though.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.500
- Let me know when.
Now?

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:29.468
Cool.
So what she does--

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:33.005
 Marjory Stoneman Douglas
 meets the Nixon administration

00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:35.007
 on the [bleep] runway.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.877
 And they're like, ugh, oh!
 You're such a pebble

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.613
 in my shoe.
 She's a nuisance.

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:42.381
She won't budge.

00:04:42.414 --> 00:04:44.283
 And Nixon is like,

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:48.287
 puhhhh. Fine!
 We'll build it somewhere else.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.523
 And she goes,
 hah hah hah hah hah hah hah!

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.692
 I'll see ya next time,
 bozos.

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.794
 And she skips away.

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:57.029
 How can you argue with
 someone who's like,

00:04:57.062 --> 00:04:59.065
 don't destroy nature.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.299
How can you?

00:05:00.332 --> 00:05:02.868
 So Marjory is looking back

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:05.404
 at what she's done,

00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:07.807
 and she's like, holy cow,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.842
 it's the third largest
 national park,

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:11.777
 and that's nothin'
 to shrug at.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.480
 I'll just keep goin'
 till I die.

00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:19.151
 And she does.
 In 1998, at the age of 108,

00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:22.988
the Everglades, for a moment,

00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:26.292
 grow silent,
 and there's a manatee,

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:31.330
 and he's like,
 ah...there she goes...

00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:36.602
 the mother of the Everglades.

00:05:36.635 --> 00:05:40.005
 [whispers]
 Darkness.

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:42.742
To quote Marjory:

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:45.578
 "Be a nuisance
 where it counts.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:50.216
 "Be depressed, discouraged,

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.818
 "and disappointed at failure

00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:56.055
 "and the disheartening
 effects of ignorance,

00:05:56.088 --> 00:06:01.360
 "greed, corruption,
 and bad politics.

00:06:01.393 --> 00:06:03.996
 But never give up."

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.564
 Today the students

00:06:05.597 --> 00:06:07.933
 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas
 High School

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:10.569
 carry on that idea

00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:13.906
 by turning their pain
 into action.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.609
 They are the pebble
 in the shoe,

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:18.677
 they are the nuisance,

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.847
 they are the people
 who will not let

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.285
 something so important
 be taken away.

00:06:26.318 --> 00:06:29.922
There are some things
that are too special to take.

00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:32.892
 [soft music]

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:34.160
- Cheers.

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:35.728
Be a nuisance.
- Cheers.

00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:37.963
Sweaty here in the Everglades.

00:06:37.996 --> 00:06:39.132
- Very sweaty.
