CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Hi.

00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:01.800
I'm Cliff Lungaretti.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.412
Welcome to another
Talk at Google.

00:00:03.412 --> 00:00:05.245
I'm a member of the
Talks at Google program,

00:00:05.245 --> 00:00:06.994
and it's a pleasure
to have you guys here.

00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:09.057
It's also a pleasure to
have Adam Garone, the CEO

00:00:09.057 --> 00:00:11.640
and co-founder of the Movember
Foundation, with us here today.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.190
So Adam, welcome to Google.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.470
ADAM GARONE: Thank you.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.300
Thank you for having us.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.883
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
You're very welcome.

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:17.720
So let's just jump
right into it.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.650
Let's talk about
Movember and see

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.589
who actually knows
about Movember

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.380
and what we can tell
them out in the world.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.280
So just as bare
bones as possible.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.690
ADAM GARONE: Right.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.610
Yeah, so Movember-- the month
formally known as November--

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.270
it's a campaign to raise funds
and awareness for men's health.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.770
So three causes that we
fund-- prostate and testicular

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.520
cancers, the two male-only
cancers; and also mental health

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.670
challenges that men face.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.886
And for the first
time in the US,

00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:52.010
a portion of the funds on
the back of this campaign

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.920
will go to that cause.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.730
The 101 stuff-- men sign up,
start the month clean shaven,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.700
grow a mustache for the
30 days, and effectively

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.900
become walking, talking
billboards for men's health.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.510
And then we have a
Mo Sistas program

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.350
for the women that want to
participate in the campaign.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.360
A very, very important
part of Movember

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.000
is women that are
often the gatekeepers--

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.090
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: A lot
of Mo Sistas in the house.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.180
Thank you for joining
us, Mo Sistas.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.020
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.735
The gatekeepers to
allowing us to grow

00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:29.415
a mustache in the first place.

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:31.790
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: So Movember's
been around for how long?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.720
ADAM GARONE: 2003.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.195
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: 2003.

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:35.010
And how did Movember
start, since you're

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.296
a co-founder of the
Movember Foundation?

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420
ADAM GARONE: In sort of
traditional Australian way.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.740
It was over beers on a
summer afternoon and--

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.955
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Approved.

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:47.420
ADAM GARONE: It was
my brother and a mate,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.035
and they were talking
about fashion.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.590
And they were
talking about trends

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.280
and how things eventually come
back into style-- and then

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160
was 2003.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.580
And the conversation then turned
to what hasn't made a comeback.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.495
And they could think of two
things-- macrame and mustaches.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.160
And so our next campaign will
be to bring back macrame.

00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:15.110
A few more beers and the
day ended with a challenge

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.760
to bring back the mustache.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.680
And really, the initial idea
was to put the mustache back

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.280
on the face of fashion.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.330
So "mo" is slang for
mustache in Australia,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.490
so the month was renamed.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.170
And 30 of us
participated in 2003.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.140
And we were literally the only
late 20-year-old, 30-year-old

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.930
guys rocking
mustaches back then.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.770
And the response
was amazing, really,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.260
and shocking because
people would just

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.630
stop and go, why
are you doing that?

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.060
And boss wouldn't let me go
and see clients and things

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.600
like that.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.290
And it just generated
so many conversations

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.920
that at the end of the campaign,
the four of us got together

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.120
and we thought, let's
put this toward a cause.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.419
And we were inspired
by the women around us

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.210
and what they were
doing for breast cancer,

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.760
and just thought there's
nothing for men's health.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.160
So that became the merger of
the two activities-- growing

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.360
a mustache and men's health.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.674
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: How much
money did you raise in 2003?

00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:22.590
ADAM GARONE: No money.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.120
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: No money.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.036
ADAM GARONE: No money.

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:26.934
No, it was literally an
excuse to grow a mustache,

00:03:26.934 --> 00:03:28.100
have a mustache [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.050
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
When we get to 2004,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.216
how much money do you raise?

00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:34.230
ADAM GARONE: Yeah,
2004, we had 450 guys

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.730
sign up and participate,
and we raised $54,000.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.540
And it was the single biggest
donation, the Prostate Cancer

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.700
Foundation in Australia,
had ever received.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.740
And that year changed our lives.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.030
And since then, on the back of
all the funds that were raised,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.230
literally means men's lives have
been impacted by the campaign.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.320
So yeah, long story short, over
the years, we've had 4 million

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.690
Mo Bros and Mo Sistas sign up.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.774
We've raised $580 million,
$135 million last year.

00:04:09.774 --> 00:04:11.440
The foundation is now
the biggest funder

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.562
of prostate and testicular
cancer research in the world.

00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:18.527
So yeah, it's been
an amazing journey.

00:04:18.527 --> 00:04:19.610
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Awesome.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.089
Well, it's great
to have you here.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.050
And actually, I'm not going
to throw it to a video

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.925
as now that we've
discussed what is Movember,

00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:27.500
we're going to just show a
little shiny thing if we could.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.390
Let you have a glass of water.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.890
All right.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.220
So if we can cue that up, Dave.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.913
Thanks, man.

00:04:31.913 --> 00:04:32.579
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:34.970
-A movement is the
power of people inspired

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.950
by a common passion that
is determined for change.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.470
A movement can be sparked by
something pretty unlikely.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.410
We are Movember.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.950
-We shave down on the
first, and for 30 days,

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.380
raise awareness and
funds for men's health

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.670
by growing mustaches.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.790
We were born over a few
years in a Australia.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.400
We are now in over
21 countries, making

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.280
us the largest men's health
movement in the world.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.420
-We are Mo Bros, and we
at our strongest when

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.090
we stay true to who we
are-- real men growing

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.540
real mustaches talking
about real issues.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.060
We're a global community
standing together,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.380
welcoming each and every
Mo Bro and Mo Sista

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.610
as a friend and
fellow change agent.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.840
-We sign up in
Movember.com in October

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.160
and raise funds in Movember
for prostate cancer, testicular

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.480
cancer, and men's
mental health problems.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.770
-Our mustache is our hairy
ribbon, our badge of honor.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.780
Grow a mustache this Movember
or support those who do.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.200
Together, we can change
the face of men's health.

00:05:34.907 --> 00:05:35.850
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.600
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: I
joked with you earlier

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.290
that I blame my entire career
trajectory on my mustache.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.840
So I know we've talked about
how you said you weren't allowed

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.690
to go to client meetings
with your mustache.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.810
And how do you feel
that you've actually

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.420
been able to use the Movember
Foundation and the Movember

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.760
movement to actually affect
the fashion statement that you

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.570
were talking about?

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.320
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.690
I mean, it's been
interesting over the years

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.370
to watch grooming trends change.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.350
And I'm positive Movember had
a fair bit to do with that.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.750
And we arguably have
put the mustache back

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.280
on the face of fashion.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.200
And it's gone even
further than that now.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.310
And beards are in style
for the most part, as well.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.606
So it's been interesting
to watch that,

00:06:24.606 --> 00:06:27.190
and there's so many
layers to Movember,

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.470
and I often think
about grooming trends

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.850
and how that relates
to masculinity

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.640
and the shift in masculinity
over the last sort of 15 years.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.880
And you post that phase
of being a metrosexual

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.600
or whatever that
actually ever meant,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.450
probably 10 years
ago, men started

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.670
to express their masculinity
through facial hair.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.600
And it's been a very,
very interesting journey.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.690
And it's to the extent
now where we even

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.490
need to bring the
mustache back again.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.760
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Well, I
think interesting you mentioned

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.200
beards, and I do
know whenever you

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.824
talk to somebody
about, hey, you should

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.310
grow a mustache this Movember,
everyone's just like, oh

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.720
yeah, I'm going to not
shave, which I know something

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.624
that we've had with Movember
and then the No-Shave-member

00:07:12.624 --> 00:07:14.040
and all of the
stuff that happens.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.670
So if we could just
definitively explain

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.980
why it is the mustache
and not the beard.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:19.730
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.465
For us, it's about creating
a conversation that matters.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.370
And our tagline is "Changing
the face of men's health."

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.760
So it's literally about
changing your appearance,

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.260
and whether that's going clean
shaven when you've normally

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.590
got a beard and then
growing a mustache.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.350
And when you do
that, it generates

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.710
so many conversations.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.790
It's quite amazing how changing
your appearance like that

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.520
does create interest in people.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.962
And I always say
to guys that are

00:07:53.962 --> 00:07:55.920
on the edge about doing
Movember the first time

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.670
or have done it a few
times and are contemplating

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.430
having a year off, I always
say that I guarantee you,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.110
because of Movember and
because of your mustache,

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.810
you'll have one really
significant conversation.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.650
And I've been doing this
12 years, I think, now.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:17.092
Every year that I do Movember,
I have at least one conversation

00:08:17.092 --> 00:08:18.300
that makes it all worthwhile.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.008
Forget sort of the
funds that are raised.

00:08:20.008 --> 00:08:21.750
And it's quite amazing.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.050
We've commissioned some
research around how

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.830
do we get men more engaged
in their health beyond just

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:27.330
Movember.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.000
And there's so many nuances to
approach men with this view.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.370
If you go directly to
men on their health,

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.299
typically we shut down.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:42.510
And it's so interesting that
the research we did sort of

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.600
uncovered that the women,
generally speaking,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.320
are very good at having
face to face conversations,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.810
like physically face to face
conversations, where men are

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.380
far more comfortable
having shoulder to shoulder

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.530
conversations,
particularly when there's

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.070
something else going on.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:01.780
And for us, it's the act
of growing a mustache

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.070
and doing that shoulder to
shoulder with someone else.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.460
And that creates
this environment

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.110
that the conversation
starts about how good or bad

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.830
your mustache is and then goes
over into often really quite

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.300
serious issues that
we don't normally

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.876
have a bridge to get to.

00:09:18.876 --> 00:09:20.500
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Very true.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.390
So we talked about the causes.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.720
As you said this year,
you're doing mental health

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.570
for the first time.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.420
So what's brought us there?

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.290
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.560
Movember's always
been holistically

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.460
about men's health.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.510
And people often ask us, why
do you focus on men's health?

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.260
The state of men's health
and in boys and men

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.130
is significantly worse
than girls and women.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:55.900
And on average, a man dies five
years younger than a woman,

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.590
and there's no biological
reason for that.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.400
And over the years, the
average age has been going up

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.670
and the gap is closing
between men and women

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.220
living the same amount of time.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.790
And no one's really
putting a focus on that.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.000
And I mean, five years is a
significant amount of time.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.640
And we know that
if we can improve

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.210
the state of men's
health-- and I'm

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.950
talking physically
and mentally here--

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.670
that will improve
society as a whole.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.560
Children, women, everyone
will benefit from that.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.055
So that's why we're focused
on men's health holistically.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.860
Our first cause that we decided
to support was prostate cancer.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.705
And as we dove into
this, people often

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:40.580
go-- because one of the
other co-founder's is

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.010
my brother-- people often
assume that our dad was

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.100
sick from prostate
cancer and that

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.870
was part of the inspiration.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.970
And we often joke now that, no,
he had a really sick mustache

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.555
back in the day and that
was more the inspiration.

00:10:56.555 --> 00:11:01.870
But started to dive into and
research the cancers that

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.216
affect men-- and
there's two-- and then

00:11:04.216 --> 00:11:06.090
we were just shocked
that prostate cancer has

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.280
the same social impact
as breast cancer.

00:11:10.105 --> 00:11:11.980
Roughly the same number
of men are diagnosed,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.845
roughly the same amount of
men pass from prostate cancer

00:11:15.845 --> 00:11:18.050
as women with breast cancer.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.690
And you only need
to look around now

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.606
during October, Breast
Cancer Awareness Month,

00:11:21.606 --> 00:11:25.660
to see the amazing number of
cause marketing initiatives

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.860
for that cause.

00:11:27.512 --> 00:11:29.470
And if you sort of take
Movember off the table,

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.820
there's really
nothing else out there

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.570
of any sort of scale
or significance

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.790
for prostate cancer.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.010
So that became
our initial focus.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.300
And then when we got
some scale, we then

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.050
also started to attack
testicular cancer.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.430
And that's a rare,
highly curable disease,

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.930
but it's the most
common cancer that

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.170
affects young men--
so 17 to sort of 35.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.830
And as you know, a lot of the
guys participating in Movember

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.280
are in that age range,
versus prostate cancer

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.040
is a disease that when
you're in your 40s plus,

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.450
you need to be
really conscious of.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.410
And so that was
the initial focus.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.390
And then mental health.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.860
And we often get asked,
well, obviously, that

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.820
affects men and women.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:23.080
But when you dive
into that issue

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.010
and look at the
statistics, it's really

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.680
quite a sad story for men.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.560
So three out of four
suicides are men.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.260
Men often don't understand
the signs and symptoms

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.110
of a mental illness.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.622
Men are typically
good at masking those,

00:12:40.622 --> 00:12:42.830
whether it's diving into
work, whether it's drinking,

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.250
or whatever it is, and
not good at seeking help.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:52.835
And in the US, it's about 83
men a day take their lives.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:59.070
And so often, imagine
if 83 guys washed

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:02.680
on the shores of, say, Santa
Monica Beach tomorrow morning.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.596
That would be global
and national news.

00:13:04.596 --> 00:13:05.970
And then it happened
the next day

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.450
and the next day
and the next day.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:13.850
And it's just an issue that
is not being spoken about,

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.280
and we're putting
the a large torch

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.210
to this in terms of the issue
from a mile perspective.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.540
So it's really four causes--
men's health holistically,

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.060
prostate and testicular
cancer, and then mental health.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:27.720
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
A lot of times when

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.940
I talk to somebody about growing
a mustache, if someone refuses,

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.847
I always just ask them
to do me one favor

00:13:31.847 --> 00:13:34.430
and to actually go to the doctor
and get their yearly physical

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.638
and get all those things
checked out, because I think

00:13:36.638 --> 00:13:40.140
that's the best thing you can
do if you actually don't want

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.060
to physically change your
face, to at least do that.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.730
So I think that's usually
my bargaining chip of you

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.590
really should grow a mustache,
but if you don't really

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:52.150
want to, at least do this
for me because that's

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.110
the conversation there.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.150
So it's very interesting to
know those suicide facts.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.850
It's really actually
unexpectedly harrowing.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:59.600
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.770
I mean, then there's different
segments of the community.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.300
So if you look at the
military, more men

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.630
have taken their lives after
serving in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.010
than died in the battlefield.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.770
And that is a shocking outcome.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.370
And again, it's a
really complex issue.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.470
With prostate and
testicular cancer,

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:28.230
we're on the path to effectively
curing both of those diseases.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.540
And what we mean by that is
we will soon be at a stage

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.320
where no man should die from
either of those diseases.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:41.310
For sure, if a guy doesn't
present and he's got an issue,

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.890
he will pass from
testicular cancer.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.590
There's no doubt about that.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.040
But through ongoing
awareness, education,

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.400
getting guys going
to the doctor,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.030
there's one last piece of the
puzzle with testicular cancer,

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:58.150
and we've just launched a
global collaborative research

00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:59.980
initiative to the tune
of about $3 million,

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.704
bringing together the
best minds to solve

00:15:03.704 --> 00:15:04.870
that last bit of the puzzle.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.310
And then it'll
effectively be cured.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.300
Prostate cancer is a
more complex disease.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.140
We help fund at the
University of Michigan

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.380
the identification of 28
types of prostate cancer.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.470
And we know of those prostate
cancers which are aggressive,

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.720
and it's about 20% of them
are aggressive and need

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.520
radical treatment.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.690
So that could be
surgery or radiation.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.150
But 80% are
slow-growing, indolent,

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.990
and guys can live
with that cancer

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.150
if it stays within the prostate.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:43.150
Normally, it's OK.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.150
The issue at the moment
is with prostate cancer,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.691
we can't tell a guy definitively
what type of prostate cancer

00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:48.990
he's got.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.290
So a lot of guys are
rushing in and having

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:52.300
surgery or radiation.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:59.564
And the real issue with
that is the side effects

00:15:59.564 --> 00:16:00.480
from those treatments.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.470
So it strikes everything
it is to be a man.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.970
It's like incontinence,
impotence, bowel disorder,

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.710
depression, let alone
the financial burden that

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:10.410
goes with it.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.162
So that's the big
contentious issue

00:16:13.162 --> 00:16:14.620
with prostate cancer
at the moment.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.280
We don't have a
great screening test.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.940
And there's a lot
of debate around

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.010
should you get screened or not.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:25.845
Lot of confusion in the public
and also with GPs around it.

00:16:25.845 --> 00:16:27.720
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: I
think one of the things--

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.094
I saw you speak maybe two,
three years ago, when you said

00:16:30.094 --> 00:16:33.230
that you wanted Movember
not to be the charity that

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.820
raised money for
prostate cancer.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.640
You wanted it to
be the charity that

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.940
kept moving on to new
diseases and new issues.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.360
So it's great to hear that
there is progress being made

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.710
and we are taking on
new and exciting things.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:47.460
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.150
And it's interesting, like as
we got into the whole research--

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.890
well, particularly with
prostate and testicular cancer--

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.520
it's really interesting in
how that industry, for want

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.010
of a better term, has
been sort of structured.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:05.470
And it's all around competition,
and they will compete and spend

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.960
so much time putting together
proposals for limited grants,

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.430
and they get notoriety by
getting written up in journals,

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:18.420
and then more funding
comes off the back of that.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.839
And it was about
five years ago, we

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.339
were in six countries
at that stage,

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.089
and we didn't [INAUDIBLE]
the research we were doing.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:28.540
And there were common
themes and people actually

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.080
researching exactly the same
thing across those countries.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.662
And we sort of said to
the guys here in New York,

00:17:34.662 --> 00:17:36.370
do you know the guys
in Sydney and London

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.960
and Montreal that are
researching the same thing?

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.290
And they didn't, in many
cases, know each other existed

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.690
let alone collaborate.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.405
So a fundamental principle for
us now is around collaboration.

00:17:46.405 --> 00:17:49.320
And typically, the
only thing that gets

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.250
collaborated is a
breakthrough in a journal.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.010
And what's so
important-- and you guys

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.390
know this-- is sharing
what doesn't work,

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.380
and then people can iterate
off the back of that.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:05.080
So Movember's truly
uniquely placed

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.530
to have this influence because
we're in 21 countries now

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.670
with a major funder, so you
get to define the rules,

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.210
haven't you, when you're
handing out these funds.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.090
And a key principle now
is around collaboration.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.100
And for us, we want to unite
this research community

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.100
and get them working together.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.160
And it's quite a cultural
shift for those researchers

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.770
to get to that stage.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.670
They're normally
used to competing.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.880
So it's been a really
interesting process.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.010
And I often think
about this journey,

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:41.430
and one of the key ingredients
for our success, I think,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.210
over time has been naivete.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:47.980
The four of us that
started Movember had never

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:53.370
worked in charity, had no idea
around how to run a charity.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.250
We're all sales, business
development type people.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:02.290
And we just came at it
from a brand perspective

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.320
and infused that
with technology.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.950
And we sort of disrupted
the way you could possibly

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.850
raise awareness and
funds for a cause.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.400
And in the same way, when we
get into this research world,

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.930
you just stand back and go, the
way you guys are operating just

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.330
doesn't make sense.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.520
Why don't you collaborate?

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.480
And there was no reason to.

00:19:24.574 --> 00:19:26.490
There was absolutely no
reason to collaborate.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.480
So for us, disrupting
that environment

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.500
and getting these
guys in the same room

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.250
is so critically important--
and then virtually connected

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.198
as well.

00:19:36.198 --> 00:19:37.656
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Very interesting.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.980
Now let's jump.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.480
I feel like we've
gotten really deep

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.490
on some cancer things,
some sad things.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:44.970
So let's get back to the fact
that we're growing mustaches

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:45.910
and we're having a good time.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:46.600
ADAM GARONE: Having
fun doing it.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.045
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
All right, and we're

00:19:47.045 --> 00:19:48.040
having a great time doing it.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.640
And that's why we all
are grow mustaches

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.070
for all the good
reasons, but also

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:52.900
because it's a good
time and it's fun.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.320
So let's throw on the 2014
Made in Movember campaign

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:57.904
for this year.

00:19:57.904 --> 00:19:59.236
If we could throw that on, Dave.

00:19:59.236 --> 00:20:00.060
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.370
-Making things.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.640
Getting it grown.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.220
Because what we make in life,
what we do for others makes us.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.700
Doing something, even
just making conversation

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.080
or making time for someone, it's
a reality check on your health

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.580
and a responsibility
to take action.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.410
Makers.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:20.240
Thinkers.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.240
Growers.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.110
Doers.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.150
Changing the face
of men's health.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.180
We are Made in Movember.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.233
Sign up, grow, and
donate at Movember.com.

00:20:28.233 --> 00:20:29.066
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:29.066 --> 00:20:31.274
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: So this
year it's Made in Movember.

00:20:31.274 --> 00:20:36.630
I know we have many Movember
mates all around the world

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.220
in Google, and I
know that we seem

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.540
that we're pushing a
this moustache is made

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.350
in America this year, this
moustache is made in Ireland.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:48.400
So is this more of a drive
to competition for that?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.530
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:52.350
So we each year, we come up
with a new campaign creative,

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:56.130
and again, it comes back
to treating a brand as sort

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.490
of central to
everything that we do.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.400
And we treat it almost
like a fashion brand,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.080
and each year there's a
new style and a new theme.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.250
So this year is
Made in Movember.

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.340
And the literal
interpretation of it

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.994
is the mustache is
made in Movember,

00:21:10.994 --> 00:21:12.160
the man is made in Movember.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.370
But the inspiration for it
came from this whole makers

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:21.430
movement, this whole
movement back to locally

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:25.170
grown, locally produced, the
farms to tables movement.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.660
And it's really
interesting to see--

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.530
and I think it was in part
driven by the economy,

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:35.130
and also in part driven
by access to things

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.110
like Kickstarter and stuff like
that where people have a way

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.170
to raise a little
bit of capital to get

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.230
their idea off the ground.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.710
And it's quite amazing to
see how many maker fairs

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.720
and things that are going on.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:54.150
But yeah, it's really about
locally grown and locally grown

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:54.790
mustaches.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.780
And we've sort of even taken
it down to a city level,

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.419
so Made in Movember New
York or Montreal or--

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:02.710
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: As the
captain of the Google New York

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.200
team from Movember,
I have already

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.974
called out the
Mountain View team

00:22:06.974 --> 00:22:08.640
that we're going to
beat them this year.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.420
And I actually am not afraid
to say that last year, I

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.990
was the highest raising
Googler in the entire world,

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:16.310
so that was exciting.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.670
ADAM GARONE: Congratulations.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:17.950
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
So just saying.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:18.350
Thank you.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.590
Thank you.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:19.910
ADAM GARONE: Who won last year?

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:20.710
New York or--?

00:22:22.244 --> 00:22:24.660
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: I don't want
to say who won that battle.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.760
I just want to say that--

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.080
AUDIENCE: Who won per capita?

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.530
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: I'm sorry?

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.396
AUDIENCE: Who won per capita?

00:22:27.396 --> 00:22:29.440
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: I'm not
sure, actually, truthfully.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:29.940
Sorry.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.231
ADAM GARONE: But it'd have
to be you guys, wouldn't it?

00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:33.732
Per capita, per head count.

00:22:33.732 --> 00:22:34.940
How many people you got here?

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.390
Like 25,000 people here, right?

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:37.330
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: I don't know.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:37.795
We'll see.

00:22:37.795 --> 00:22:38.970
But we gotta look into that.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.582
Actually, do we want to
jump into a little bit

00:22:43.582 --> 00:22:44.165
of technology.

00:22:44.165 --> 00:22:44.915
ADAM GARONE: Sure.

00:22:44.915 --> 00:22:46.650
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
And has Movember

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.532
changed almost the face the
way charity works almost?

00:22:50.532 --> 00:22:51.282
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:53.820
So there's been a
couple of things

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.470
that we've held central, which
is the brand and then also

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.095
the technology.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.850
And back in 2004, when we
first sort of cobbled together

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:06.150
our very first website, we've
developed our own technology

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.160
right from the start.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.280
And there's a lot of white
labeled platforms out there

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.360
now, which make this whole
landscape a little bit

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:14.860
different.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.650
But for us at Movember,
with our technology what

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:23.110
we've tried to do is create,
really, a social media

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.320
platform albeit
around a cause and

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.830
albeit around a
short period of time,

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.410
and injecting in that
ways for the community

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.000
to come together online, to
communicate with each other,

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.210
to check out what's going on in
different parts of the world,

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.950
but with a collective vision.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.570
And as you know, one of the
key things we've built in here

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:46.020
is layers and layers and
layers of competition,

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.450
because obviously that drives
fundraising within a team,

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:54.330
within a city, within a
country or an organization.

00:23:54.330 --> 00:24:00.430
So it really is interesting
because our technology

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:04.510
platform, we raised
last year $135 million,

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:08.822
and that was in essentially
a six-week period.

00:24:08.822 --> 00:24:10.530
So if you sort of
amortize over the year,

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:14.230
it's like at least a billion
dollar e-commerce platform.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.690
But the challenge
our guys have is we

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.580
have an avalanche
of traffic that

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:23.440
starts to ramp up now and
then throughout November.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.780
So one of our
challenges is we only

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:29.140
get to do this once a year,
so the tuning we're doing

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.920
and the testing and the
experiments the guys

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.360
are doing on different
buttons and different paths,

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.360
we do a lot of that
in October, and then

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.790
we sort of lock it down because
we can't afford for their to be

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.360
any issues with the platform.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:49.280
But it is interesting that
even though we are a charity,

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.155
people expect the
technology experience, be it

00:24:52.155 --> 00:24:58.395
on mobile or on a computer, to
be as good as they experience

00:24:58.395 --> 00:25:01.680
at Google or
Facebook or Instagram

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.660
or whatever it is
they're used to using.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.670
When they come across to us and
it's not as seamless to sign up

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.210
or whatever it is,
they're out the door.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:14.510
And so we spend a lot of
time thinking about the user

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.910
interface and the
paths people go down

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.740
to make it as simple and
as intuitive as possible.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.830
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Interesting.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:27.980
And how does the technology in
the Movember programs kind of

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:28.810
come together?

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.130
ADAM GARONE: Yeah, there's a
couple of areas that we do.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:37.510
So the collaboration piece that
I talked about, one of the ways

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.110
we get the researchers
collaborating

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:43.470
is through a sort of
Wiki-based platform.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.130
So again, it was
an off the shelf

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.630
product that we've packaged up.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:52.190
And yeah, they are able to
come together online and share

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.690
things.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.210
And it's quite
amazing that you see

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:56.830
these conversations happening.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.975
There will be a
researcher saying--

00:25:58.975 --> 00:26:01.150
I think it was the
Netherlands posed

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.610
a question in a
particular forum,

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:06.060
and then there was a guy,
I think, from New York--

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.870
a researcher-- that
said, hey, yeah, we've

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.520
been down this path.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.360
Here are all the results.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.255
It ended in this.

00:26:13.476 --> 00:26:15.100
I wouldn't suggest
going down that path

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.350
because it didn't lead anywhere.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:20.130
So for that, the researchers
in the Netherlands

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.550
then iterate off
of that, and then

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.008
that whole community
that's focused

00:26:23.008 --> 00:26:26.970
on that particular project,
to able to observe that

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.660
is really, really powerful.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:34.037
The other thing that
we're doing-- as I say,

00:26:34.037 --> 00:26:35.870
we'll get to a stage
where we'll effectively

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.080
cure these diseases,
but it doesn't

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.350
mean we've got a vaccine
coming anytime soon that'll

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.735
wipe them off the table.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:47.380
So as we live older,
there's going to be more men

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.670
and their families going through
the prostate or testicular

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.410
cancer journey--
particularly prostate.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.370
And so we're
developing new program.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.165
It's called True North.

00:26:58.165 --> 00:26:59.540
It's our biggest
investment ever.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.390
It's like $40 million globally.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:07.540
That's going to provide a
whole range of applications

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.900
and products to allow
the guy and his family

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.390
to navigate through
this whole journey.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.350
And the journey being from
the time of diagnosis,

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.480
through treatment, and
then life after treatment.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.910
So it'll help them
access clinical trials.

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.210
It'll advise them on
optimal diet and exercise.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.960
It'll connect them
with other people going

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.910
through the same journey if they
want to chat with other men,

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:38.390
or the caregivers
can do that as well.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.630
It'll sure, if you're
in New York, what

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:45.810
facilities and things
that are around you,

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.930
and similarly with wherever
you are in the country.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.120
Because one of the big
issues is the access often

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.130
that you have to
medical services

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.620
is defined by where you live.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.360
And if you live in
New York, there's

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.460
an amazing array of
institutions, organizations,

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.580
and research going on.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.340
But if you're
Alabama or somewhere,

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.550
there's just not, and so being
able to through technology

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:13.355
connect everyone.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.330
And there's a quarter
of a million guys

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.740
a year get diagnosed just in
the US with prostate cancer.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.435
So we're just starting
down that path now,

00:28:24.435 --> 00:28:28.830
and we've connected about 10
institutions across the US

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.719
to work on this
technology platform.

00:28:30.719 --> 00:28:32.010
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: That's great.

00:28:33.384 --> 00:28:35.800
Is there anybody here in the
house that has any questions?

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.810
We have two microphones
in the aisle ways.

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:40.515
If anyone wants to step up,
I'll just throw it over to you.

00:28:40.515 --> 00:28:41.390
But just let me know.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.515
I think we've got some
lights coming on over those.

00:28:43.515 --> 00:28:44.259
Yes?

00:28:44.259 --> 00:28:46.300
AUDIENCE: Any particular
mustache style you think

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.300
should be stopped and
not allowed to occur?

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.194
ADAM GARONE: Well, there's
the obvious one, isn't there?

00:28:53.194 --> 00:28:54.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.920
ADAM GARONE: Yeah, the-- well,
we call it a Charlie Chaplin.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.400
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
It's the Chaplin.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:58.900
Yeah.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.970
ADAM GARONE: Yeah,
it's the Chaplin, which

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:03.300
he did a lot of bad
shit, and one of them

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.110
was banishing that style.

00:29:07.156 --> 00:29:08.530
So yeah, that
would be the go-to.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.340
AUDIENCE: The more real
question is you clearly

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.590
didn't set out your
life to do this.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.650
It's become a passion of yours.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.199
What keeps you involved
year after year?

00:29:21.199 --> 00:29:22.990
ADAM GARONE: Yeah, it's
funny you say that.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:24.880
It's like every day
I wake up and go,

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.895
somehow my life has
become about a mustache.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.265
And when you stop, step
back, and think about it,

00:29:30.265 --> 00:29:33.530
it's ridiculous
that this happened.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.160
But it's far more than that now.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.280
And I often talk about a
lot and think about a lot

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.640
the difference between
being successful and being

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.140
significant.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:49.590
I think on reflection, we
spend a lot of-- the first half

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.380
of our life trying
to be successful,

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.790
and whether that's academics,
with sports, with work, getting

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.180
more promotions and
all that sort of stuff.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.270
I think-- and certainly
for me on reflection--

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.250
there was a point
in my life where

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.740
that was great, but wanted
to do something significant.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.620
And for me, doing
something significant

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.460
is serving other
people or a cause

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.220
that you can truly
have an impact on.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.710
And when you get into
this space and you

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.210
meet so many great people and
you hear so many great stories

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:24.140
about how a dodgy-looking
mustache actually transformed

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.830
and changed someone's
life-- beyond the research

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:31.110
we're funding-- and
becomes quite addictive.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:35.140
And what motivates
me now is we've

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.990
done a great job of building
all this financial capital,

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.230
and now what's coming
along is this human capital

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.680
and the researchers and
connecting them, and just

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.350
seeing that interaction and
the progress they're making

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:50.200
is quite amazing.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.640
And there's no other
cancer category

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.460
that's able to do this.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.840
If you look at other
cancer categories, at best,

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.160
organizations like ours
that are nationally focused,

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:06.620
there's no international
organization like ours

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.040
that has that reach and ability
to bring people together.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.710
So for me, it's that impact
and seeing this progress now

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.780
on the research side.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.737
That's what gets
me up every day.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.784
As well as this, of course.

00:31:24.295 --> 00:31:25.420
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Yes, sir?

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.590
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.950
So I'm actually
in college still.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:29.840
I'm an intern here.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.950
And I know a lot of college
students take part in Movember,

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.167
but a lot of them don't
know what it's about,

00:31:35.167 --> 00:31:39.550
and even more don't get
involved in fundraising at all.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.897
So I was wondering if you
have any strategies to sort

00:31:42.897 --> 00:31:44.730
of leverage that untapped
potential in terms

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:46.605
of fundraising and just
spreading information

00:31:46.605 --> 00:31:47.522
about what it's about?

00:31:47.522 --> 00:31:48.271
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:31:48.271 --> 00:31:49.070
I mean, we do.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.955
Yeah, there's a lot
of guys that-- I mean,

00:31:50.955 --> 00:31:53.080
if you're doing Movember
and you're not registered,

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.430
then you're just
a creep, really.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:57.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.160
ADAM GARONE: So we try
and shame people into it.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:03.070
But we do.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.870
We have-- and [? JJ's ?] up in
the back of the room there--

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:10.050
a group of people focused
on college engagement.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:15.100
And it's a market that's turning
over all the time as people

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.120
come into and then
leave, and hopefully

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.620
type the Movember journey
into their workplace.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.640
So yeah, we've got
active programs

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.980
to tap into the college
market through the athletics

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.320
apartment, through
the fraternities,

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:36.810
and then champions on campus
to help us spread that message.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:37.850
Because it is important.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:42.940
Like the fundraising
part aside, it's

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.290
great that people
raise money, but we

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.370
don't push that hard on that.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:51.080
For us, what's really
important is signing up,

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.750
because when you
do that, you get

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.300
then armed with why it's
important you do it.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.870
And we use growing
mustaches as a Trojan horse

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.440
for getting men
involved in this thing.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.910
And that's the most
important thing for us,

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.617
that they are
knowledgeable-- or more

00:33:08.617 --> 00:33:10.200
knowledgeable than
at start-- and that

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.832
will enable them to have that
conversation that matters.

00:33:13.832 --> 00:33:15.040
But there's no easy strategy.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.260
It's hard.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:21.780
But as Movember
becomes more known,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.390
people do realize that
it's important to sign up.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.510
We actually have got a
video-- we'll send it to you--

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:29.870
with Samuel L Jackson
doing the voiceover--

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:30.290
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:31.040
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.360
It's like-- what's the
title of that video?

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.720
Do you remember?

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.440
It's basically--

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.560
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: It's very-- as
you said, it's shaming people.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.185
ADAM GARONE: Yeah,
it's shaming people.

00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:41.342
If you don't register,
you're a loser, essentially.

00:33:41.342 --> 00:33:42.243
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:33:42.243 --> 00:33:43.326
ADAM GARONE: Thanks, mate.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.049
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Yes, sir?

00:33:46.049 --> 00:33:48.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so most of
the marketing and everything

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:52.050
is aimed at men, but more
women-- who may not be able to

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:55.580
also grow a mustache-- how
can they be involved as well?

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.450
ADAM GARONE: Yeah, So we've got
a Mo Sista program, and the Mo

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.360
Sista program, it's so
critically important for us.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.640
As I mentioned, the Mo Sistas
are often the gatekeeper for us

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.689
to participate.

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:14.139
And we encourage that Mo Sistas
sign up as a team captain,

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:16.980
recruit the guys in their
life to be part of their team,

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.880
and then encourage them to grow.

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:22.280
A program that I'm
working on, which

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:27.250
we'll look to launch next year,
it's a program called Move.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.940
So the first four letters
of Movember are "move."

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.462
And one of the most
important things

00:34:31.462 --> 00:34:33.420
you can do for your health
throughout your life

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.900
is staying active and moving.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.429
And I don't mean
going to the gym.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:38.820
I mean just being active.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.500
We've built-- this life.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.414
Because of wonderful
technology, we've

00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:44.705
built this sedentary lifestyle.

00:34:45.477 --> 00:34:47.310
And there's all this
research coming out now

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:50.800
around the impact of seating
for six to eight hours a day,

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.460
and it is as bad if
not worse than smoking.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.115
So if you're sitting for six
to eight hours a day and smoke,

00:34:58.115 --> 00:34:59.240
you're in a lot of trouble.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:03.899
So for us, Move--
next year, you'll

00:35:03.899 --> 00:35:05.940
be able to sign up and
make a commitment to move.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.720
And that will enable the
Mo Sistas to do actually

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.490
something tangible, make
a tangible commitment

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:13.245
during Movember.

00:35:13.245 --> 00:35:15.120
And the way we'll tie
it back to men's health

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.540
is if a Mo Sista does
that, they'll then

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.110
be encouraged to issue
a challenge to the men

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.230
in their life to
match their move.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:26.130
And it'll be a great
way-- we'll sort of track

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:27.640
that activity then online.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.190
And over time, we'll integrate
the wearable technology

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:35.260
to make sure that
if they're walking

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.790
a certain amount
of time per day,

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.680
that that's actually happening.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.236
so we're sort of particularly
excited about the Move program,

00:35:41.236 --> 00:35:43.360
and as I said, that'll come
to life more next year.

00:35:46.102 --> 00:35:48.845
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: All right,
so what is your ideal mustache?

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:52.600
ADAM GARONE: Ideal mustache.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.960
This is my go-to stache.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.650
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
That's your go-to?

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:55.400
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:35:55.864 --> 00:35:58.155
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Who has
the most impressive mustache,

00:35:58.155 --> 00:36:00.856
of all the guys that you've
met in your journey now?

00:36:00.856 --> 00:36:05.570
ADAM GARONE: Oh
I'd have to say--

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:06.480
AUDIENCE: Right here.

00:36:07.757 --> 00:36:09.340
ADAM GARONE: That's
a ginger mustache.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.782
That doesn't count.

00:36:11.782 --> 00:36:13.601
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:13.601 --> 00:36:16.100
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: There is a
very, very powerful ginger Move

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:16.600
team.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.552
I know of this.

00:36:17.552 --> 00:36:18.260
ADAM GARONE: Yes.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:21.570
Who would it be?

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:23.240
Probably Hulk Hogan.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.010
It's impressive.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:24.400
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Yeah.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.620
The Hulkster's been
doing it a long time.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.370
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:36:28.344 --> 00:36:29.510
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: All right.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.480
Anybody else here?

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:35.369
Any other questions from
the live audience here?

00:36:35.369 --> 00:36:37.660
Well, Adam, I want to thank
you so much for being here.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.600
I do want to encourage everyone
that's in this room, everyone

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.349
that's watching the
live stream and that's

00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:44.390
watching on YouTube to join
on Movember.com sign up.

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:46.889
And Mo Sistas, Mo
Bros, grow a mustache.

00:36:46.889 --> 00:36:47.930
ADAM GARONE: Get growing.

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.888
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Get
the people in your lives.

00:36:49.888 --> 00:36:52.080
And at the very least, get
your health check, and--

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.400
ADAM GARONE: Create a
conversation that matters.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:53.960
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: That's right.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.150
And let's change the
face of men's health.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.926
Thank you so much
for being here, Adam.

00:36:55.926 --> 00:36:56.610
I really appreciate it.

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:56.910
ADAM GARONE: Yeah.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:57.410
No problem.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:58.110
Thank you.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.660
[APPLAUSE]
