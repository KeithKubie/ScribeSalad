00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.015
We're on question 95.

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:07.090
A certain sales person's weekly
salary is equal to a

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.750
fixed base salary plus a
commission that is directly

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.730
proportional to the number of
items sold during the week.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.770
So let me write this.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.010
95.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:26.100
So the salary is equal to some
base plus a commission that is

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.950
directly proportional to
the number of items

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.430
sold during the week.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.610
So let's say the number
of items sold is x.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.960
x items times the commission
per item.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.580
So, I'll call that
lowercase c.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.420
And this is the total
commission.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.670
Fair enough.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.020
If 50 items are sold this week,
what will be the sales

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.960
person's salary for this week?

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.030
OK, so they actually told
us that there's

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.660
50 items. Fair enough.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.480
What will be the sales person's
salary this week?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.560
So statement number 1
tells us, last week

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.420
45 items were sold.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.800
So 45 in last week.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.730
That alone doesn't
tell me much.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.150
Because I don't know how
much he made last week.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.490
Statement 2.

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.900
Last week's salary was $405.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.110
Well, does this help me still?

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.310
Last week.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.240
Because in order to figure out--
we need to figure out--

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.490
right now we need to know how
much of his salary in any

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.440
given week is base, and
how much commission

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.190
does he get per unit.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.560
And the only way we can figure
that out is if you tell us

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.690
that last week we know that
he sold 45 items. So, for

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.010
example, last week
he made $405.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.810
If I use both statements, let me
see if I can get anywhere.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.440
He made $405 last week, which
is equal to his base plus 45

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.190
units sold times his commission
per unit.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.180
So that's all this information
gives me.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.800
Actually if I use both
statements, that's

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.240
all it gives me.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.500
That 405 is equal to
b plus 45 times c.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.610
And we need to figure out s
is equal to b plus 50c.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.580
What is s equal when
you sell 50 units.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.580
And so we have two
linear equations.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.020
But we have how many unknowns?

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.130
We have one unknown, two
unknown, three unknowns.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.620
Sorry.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.550
One unknown, two unknown,
three unknowns.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.770
b and c was already there.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.720
So we have 3 unknowns, but only
two linear equations.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.370
So we don't have enough
information to solve it.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.070
So the answer is E.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.380
All of these statements still
do not give us enough

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.630
information.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.170
96.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.030
If Juan had a doctor's
appointment on a certain day,

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.420
was the appointment
on a Wednesday?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.920
So we want to know, was
it on a Wednesday?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.190
1, exactly 60 hours before the
appointment it was Monday.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.150
60 hours before the appointment
it was Monday.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.880
This is interesting.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.260
OK, so how many days?

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.120
60 hours is 2 days.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.240
2 days is 48 hours.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.200
It's exactly 2 and 1/2 days.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.130
48 and then another 12.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.070
So this is equal to
2 and 1/2 days.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.010
So this is interesting.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.900
If we said that 2 days before,
it was a Monday, then his

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.940
appointment had to have been
on a Wednesday, right?

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.840
Because if you pick any hour
in Wednesday and you go

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.080
exactly 48 hours ago, it
would be that same

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.900
exact hour on Monday.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.610
So if you said 48 hours ago it
was Monday then this would be

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.740
enough information.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.830
This is 2 and 1/2 days ago.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.360
So for example, if his
appointment-- and you know it

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.920
might sound weird-- but
if his appointment was

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:27.470
at Thursday 1 a.m.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.510
and you go 2 and 1/2 days
before-- let's see if you go 2

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.530
days before you to Wednesday 1
a.m., Tuesday 1 a.m., and then

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.670
you go 12 hours before.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.470
You would end up at
Monday at 1 p.m.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.140
So, I've given a case that meets
condition 1, where his

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.250
appointment wasn't
on Wednesday.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.125
It was on Thursday.

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.950
But of course, I can give
a condition where his

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.210
appointment was on Wednesday.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.180
His appointment was on
Wednesday at 10 p.m.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.870
Then if you go 1 day back you're
at Tuesday 10 p.m.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.510
I'm sure you can't read that.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.310
Then you go another day.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.390
You're at Monday 10 p.m.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.880
And then you go a half a day.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.290
You're at Monday 10 a.m.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.390
So, statement 1 does not give
us enough information.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.595
That's because of this
pesky half day.

00:05:15.595 --> 00:05:19.460
Now let's see what statement
2 gets us.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.070
Statement 2.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.120
The appointment was
between 1 p.m.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.370
and 9 p.m.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.910
Now, this by itself, obviously,
is useless.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.740
I mean, you could have
an appointment any

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.750
day between 1 p.m.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.310
and 9 p.m.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.360
But used in conjunction with
each other, it seems like I

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.800
have enough information.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.840
Because let's say the
appointment was at 9 p.m.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.260
and 2 and 1/2 days ago
it was a Wednesday.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.340
So let me see, sorry, 2 days
ago it was a Monday.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:58.200
So if I have it at Wednesday 9
p.m., if I go back 1 day, I'm

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.450
at Tuesday 9 p.m.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:02.410
Sorry.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.350
1 day back I'm at
Tuesday 9 p.m.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.160
2 days back I would be
at Monday 9 p.m.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:18.630
And then if I go 1/2 a day more,
I'm at Monday 9 a.m.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.340
And if I take the lower bound.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.870
Wednesday at 1 p.m.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.110
Do the same logic and
you're going to end

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.600
up at Monday 1 a.m.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.720
So at either end of this range,
if I know that if you

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.720
go 2 days ago, you end up at
Monday, the only day that

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.000
works is Wednesday.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.720
You could try this with
Thursday or Tuesday.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.720
You won't end up on Monday if
you go 2 and 1/2 days back.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.100
So for this problem, both
statements are necessary in

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.860
order to know whether his
appointment was on Wednesday.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.520
Next problem.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.320
97.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:04.940
What is the value of 5x squared
plus 4x minus 1.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:14.030
First they tell us, x times
x plus 2 is equal to 0.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.920
Well let's see, can
we use this alone?

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.890
Let's just multiply it out.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:23.220
We get x squared plus
4 x is equal to 0.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.630
And that tells us that x squared
is equal to minus 4x.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.140
Well maybe we could substitute
this in for

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.590
4x, or for x squared.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.240
So we get 5 times x squared.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.230
Well we know that x squared
is minus 4x.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.380
Minus 4x plus 4x minus 1.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.800
That's minus 20x plus
4x minus 1.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.640
No it doesn't get us anywhere,
even playing

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.360
around with the algebra.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.820
So we get minus 16x minus 1.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.130
So statement 1 by itself, at
least as far as I can figure

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.310
out, does not help us
solve this problem.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.560
Statement number 2.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.460
x is equal to 0.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.000
Well that's all we need.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.980
x is equal to 0,
then this is 0.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.010
This is 0.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.200
And we're just left
with negative 1.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.510
So this is the only piece of
information we need to solve

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.500
this problem.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.400
And statement 1 doesn't
really help us much.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.710
So only statement
2 is necessary.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.640
What is that, B?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.890
Next problem.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.730
98.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.400
At Larry's Auto Supply Store,
brand x antifreeze is sold by

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.539
the gallon.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:42.330
So x by gallon.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.250
And brand y is sold
by the quart.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.090
Excluding sales tax, what is the
total cost for 1 gallon of

00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:07.700
brand x antifreeze-- so 1 of
x-- and 1 quart of brand y?

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:14.290
OK, so we want to know the cost.
Equals how much dollars?

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:18.300
So let x be the number of
gallons of x and y be the

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.410
number of quarts of y.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.840
So we'd have to know their
prices in order to figure out

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.560
how much the combination
costs.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.690
So let's see, at
least I think.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.010
Statement 1.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.760
Excluding sales tax, the cost
for 6 gallons of brand x

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:43.750
antifreeze and 10 quarts
of y-- so plus 10 of

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.520
y-- is equal to $58.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.350
Well this, once again, by itself
does not help me much.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.700
I have two unknowns with
one linear equation.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.600
So I can't solve for what
x plus y is equal to.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.360
If I could have factored out--
if this was 10x plus 10y I

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.850
could have factored out a 10,
and I would have had x plus y

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:04.640
sitting there.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.920
So actually I probably
could have solved,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.570
if it was that way.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.050
But this isn't quite as easy.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.720
So statement number 2.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:19.870
Excluding sales tax, the total
cost for 4 gallons of brand x

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:30.330
plus 12 quarts of brand y-- so
it's 12 quarts of brand y-- is

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.360
equal to $44.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.480
And actually, just
to be exact, I

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.910
realize I misspoke something.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:45.710
Let x be the cost of x
antifreeze per gallon.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:51.210
And y is equal to the cost of
y antifreeze per gallon.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.476
And so we are still trying to
figure out x plus y, but I

00:10:55.476 --> 00:10:56.390
just wanted to be exact.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.430
Because we've got 6 gallons.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.730
So the cost would be 6 times
x plus 10 quarts of y.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.830
So this would be 10
times y to get 58.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:03.710
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.080
But now we have two equations
with two unknowns.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.580
So it's trivial now to
solve for x and y.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.250
This is your algebra
1 problem.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.060
So, both equations combined are
enough to solve for it.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.530
But each independently
are not enough.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.240
Because you can't just factor
out a number and just be left

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.480
with x plus y here.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.210
That could have been a trick, if
this was a tricky problem.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.390
But it's not.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.810
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
