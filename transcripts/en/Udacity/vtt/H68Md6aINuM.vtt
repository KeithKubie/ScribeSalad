00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.800
Now let's do a quiz on the relationship between

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.790
dependencies and hazards. Let's say that we have a

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.310
three-stage pipeline, where here we are fetching and encoding

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.363
the instructions. Here, we are reading the register inputs that

00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:15.994
we need and doing the ALU operation. And here

00:00:15.994 --> 00:00:18.438
we're accessing the memory and then writing the result

00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:21.496
to the register. For an ALU operation we just

00:00:21.496 --> 00:00:25.236
write to the register. Let's say that we have these

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:28.410
four instructions The first one is producing R1, and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.608
the next three are using it. And I can

00:00:30.608 --> 00:00:33.661
tell you that these three dependencies are the only

00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:37.252
dependencies that exist in this program. The question for

00:00:37.252 --> 00:00:39.953
you is whether there is a dependence from the

00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:43.457
add to this instruction, and whether that dependence is

00:00:43.457 --> 00:00:47.025
a hazard. Put a check mark into these six

00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:50.850
boxes, depending on which one has a dependence, and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.910
which one of these dependents is a hazard.
