[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:06.660
BOB CORNWALL: I
want to start off

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.540
by welcoming everyone to
the next Talks at Google,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.590
and next Talks at Google in the
Detroit office specifically.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.340
And today we're really
excited, because we

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.370
have the creative team behind
the new opera "Hadrian," which

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.154
is debuting this Saturday.

00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:22.320
It was commissioned by the
Canadian Opera Committee,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.240
and it will be across
the street at the Four

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.370
Seasons of the Performing
Arts Opera House,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.000
which is very exciting.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.260
So with me here today on
the panel I've got Rufus.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.789
I've got Daniel, Peter,
Cori, and Isaiah.

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.080
So could you guys please give
them a round of applause?

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.770
And I really just want
to start off really

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.950
quickly by saying thank you
to you guys for coming today.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.420
It's the day before
you open, so I

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.128
imagine your schedules
are kind of crazy.

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:53.360
You've got a lot going on.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.070
So know that we
appreciate your time,

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.664
and we wanted to thank you
for all being here today.

00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:00.080
We hope to spend this time
getting through each one of you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.190
a little bit better.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.122
We really want to
learn about the opera.

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:04.830
This audience is
curious about the opera.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.590
We're not aficionados
by any means,

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.256
and so we want to learn a little
bit about the opera in general.

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:11.270
And then we want to talk
a lot about "Hadrian."

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.478
So that's what we want to
accomplish over the next 45

00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:14.750
minutes to an hour or so.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.596
So to kick things
off, what I love

00:01:16.596 --> 00:01:19.220
to do is just go down the line,
and if you could really quickly

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.040
say your name, what you
do, and because we're

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.322
at Google, the last
thing that you Googled.

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:24.822
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:24.822 --> 00:01:25.822
CORI ELLISON: Oh my god.

00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:27.820
BOB CORNWALL: It's
really revealing.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.320
Yeah.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.030
Who wants to go first?

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.780
Isaiah, I'm looking at you.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.010
ISAIAH BELL: My
name's Isaiah Bell.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.030
I am a tenor.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.280
I play the role of
Antinous in "Hadrian."

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.420
And the last thing I
googled was Grey Gardens,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.600
but the restaurant.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.130
BOB CORNWALL: Well done.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.192
Cori?

00:01:45.192 --> 00:01:46.650
CORI ELLISON: Oh,
I'm Cori Ellison.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.250
I'm the dramaturg on this show.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.750
And nobody knows
what that is, but I

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.910
suppose we'll talk a little
bit about that later.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.970
And the last thing
I actually Googled

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.530
was Google to find
out how to get here.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.390
BOB CORNWALL: Did we show up?

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.300
We did, good.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.126
CORI ELLISON:
(LAUGHING) Yes, yes.

00:02:03.126 --> 00:02:04.100
BOB CORNWALL: Whew!

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.600
That would have been awkward.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.160
PETER HINTON: Hi,
I'm Peter Hinton,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.300
and I am the stage
director for "Hadrian."

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.380
And the last thing I Googled--

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.280
I got to say I
think was weather.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.810
BOB CORNWALL: Oh, yeah.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.110
PETER HINTON: Just because it's
been so hot and then so cold.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.940
BOB CORNWALL: Lot
of utility there.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.321
Love it, thank you.

00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:32.070
DANIEL MACIVOR: My
name is Daniel MacIvor.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.940
I'm the librettist.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.975
I had to look-- what do I do?

00:02:35.975 --> 00:02:36.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.770
The libre-- sometimes,
I'm so new at this,

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.690
I want to say librettisist.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.550
So anyway, I'm the librettist.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.470
That means I wrote the words.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.290
And the last thing I Googled was
does popcorn cause indigestion?

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.335
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:51.710
BOB CORNWALL: Have
you recently--

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.420
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.870
CORI ELLISON: Does it?

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.500
DANIEL MACIVOR: It can-- acid.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.540
It can be--

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.310
BOB CORNWALL: Not
only entertaining,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.480
but this is being educational.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.521
I love it, this is great.

00:02:59.521 --> 00:03:00.170
And Rufus.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.050
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Hi,
I'm Rufus Wainwright,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.820
and I am the composer
of the opera.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.520
I'm also a performer,
and singer, and ex-model.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.092
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:13.300
BOB CORNWALL: That's obvious.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.966
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:
When you boil it down,

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:18.760
and what was the
last thing I Googled?

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.500
I hate to say it, but I've
been Googling the stock market,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.950
just because it's looking like
it's going to get fun again.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.100
Because of the midterms,
it's a long story.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.700
Anyways, OK.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.210
BOB CORNWALL: Is there
anything specifically you're

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.290
watching on the stock market?

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.998
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: I'm
just waiting for it

00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:39.380
all to crash so that
the Democrats win back

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.506
the House and the Senate.

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:42.380
BOB CORNWALL: OK, OK,
got it, got it, got it.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.432
Get it, we get it.

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:44.890
So part of today
too, I want to get

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.806
to know you guys a little
bit more personally.

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:50.950
So Rufus, you've had
an incredible career.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.020
I've read everything
on your Wikipedia.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.767
I haven't remembered it all,
but you've accomplished a lot.

00:03:56.767 --> 00:03:58.600
You're a singer/songwriter,
albums released,

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.700
millions of views on YouTube,
which is very, very cool.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.110
So I mean, other than me, who
is the most thrilling person

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.225
you've shared the stage with?

00:04:08.225 --> 00:04:10.480
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Who was
the most thrilling person?

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:21.670
For those of us who are here
and tuning in at a certain point

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.690
and have a love of opera,
I had the opportunity once

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.890
of doing a concert with
Jessye Norman, the two of us.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.590
And it was certainly thrilling.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.190
Also somewhat
infuriating as well.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.020
And there was an amazing
thing where we had done it

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.620
on a summer afternoon
and the weather

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.850
had been really up and down.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.390
It had been raining all day,
and it was in the evening.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.390
And suddenly it was
very hot and very balmy.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.760
And it was in Long Island
in the countryside.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.130
And she got out and
started singing,

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.210
and all of a sudden,
all of these bugs

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.162
appeared because of
the drastic weather.

00:05:06.162 --> 00:05:07.870
You know when that
happens in the summer.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.340
And these bugs appeared.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.954
And she started singing, and the
bugs started to surround her.

00:05:12.954 --> 00:05:13.870
BOB CORNWALL: Oh dear.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.640
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:
And she completely

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.984
was oblivious to this.

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:18.400
I mean, she knew
it was happening,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.110
but she just didn't react.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.434
And she sang this note--

00:05:22.434 --> 00:05:24.850
and I think she was doing the
song "Summertime," actually,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.620
and she sang this
very high note.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.030
And all of a
sudden, all the bugs

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.300
attacked the entire front
row of the audience.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.630
And they had to go running
away from their seats.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.370
And she didn't bat an eyelid.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.282
She was like, this
happens sometimes.

00:05:38.282 --> 00:05:39.740
BOB CORNWALL: That's
very exciting.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.860
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: So she could
control bugs with her voice.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.820
That's pretty amazing.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.195
BOB CORNWALL:
That's really cool.

00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:45.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.660
That's awesome.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.485
And Isaiah, so you
introduced yourself

00:05:48.485 --> 00:05:50.860
as a tenor, which-- to people
in the audience and online,

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.500
if you guys don't know,
that's an opera singer.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.410
And opera singers
notoriously are sometimes

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.402
known as a little diva-esque.

00:05:59.402 --> 00:06:01.360
What do you think is your
biggest diva quality?

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.570
ISAIAH BELL: I think for the
most diva-esque thing about me

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.660
is that I have enough
self-possession to hide

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.140
all my typical diva qualities.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.720
BOB CORNWALL: Oh, great answer!

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.570
I love that, I love that.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.787
And Cori, you had sort of
mentioned you're a dramaturg?

00:06:23.787 --> 00:06:24.620
CORI ELLISON: Mm-hm.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.370
BOB CORNWALL: Can you
explain a little bit

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.565
about what is a dramaturg
and how do you become one?

00:06:28.565 --> 00:06:30.200
CORI ELLISON: How
do I become one?

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.000
Well, with great difficulty.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.800
I was just saying to my friends
here that there currently

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.070
exists no training program
in North America for opera

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.240
dramaturgs.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.020
And I'm in the process of
creating one for American Lyric

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.100
Theater in New York.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.140
But to answer your question, an
opera dramaturg, or a dramaturg

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.800
in general in the context
of developing a new work

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.760
is a person who works with
the composer and librettist.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.019
And the first thing is
to really understand

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:07.310
what it is they're trying to
do, the piece that they're

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.570
trying to create, and
to help them do that.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:17.302
And it sounds like a
no-brainer sort of no-show job

00:07:17.302 --> 00:07:18.260
or something like that.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.250
But often it's not,
because artists

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.680
have very distinct visions.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.930
And a composer
and librettist may

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.620
come to the same project
with different visions

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.990
because of just who they are.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:39.740
So the trick is-- without at
all imposing my own opinions

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:45.830
about it-- to try to bring them
together and show them where

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.240
they're really intersecting.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.740
And maybe they don't
think they are.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.114
But just really
help the project--

00:07:54.114 --> 00:07:55.280
BOB CORNWALL: Come together.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.840
CORI ELLISON: --gel by helping
the artists gel together.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.660
And that boils down to big
aspects of the piece, details,

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.420
lots of different
things along the way.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.310
And then of course, when Peter
Hinton joined in as director,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:18.260
then my task with
the creative team

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.000
was sort of to introduce them
to this piece, which was not

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.236
something they could look up in
a book or Google at that point.

00:08:26.236 --> 00:08:27.664
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah, that's true.

00:08:27.664 --> 00:08:31.200
CORI ELLISON: And so I sort
of introduced it to them.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.450
BOB CORNWALL: You were Google.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.100
CORI ELLISON: I was.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.915
I was Google.

00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:36.039
BOB CORNWALL: That's right.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.429
DANIEL MACIVOR: You
are kind of a Google,

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.970
because you know so
much about opera.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.580
That's another thing, right?

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.110
You have a wealth of knowledge.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.669
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:
Wide variety of--

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.755
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah,
I was going to say,

00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:46.880
what got you to this point?

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.900
What have you done
in the past that

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.191
enables you to do this so well?

00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:51.590
CORI ELLISON: Well,
I've grown up--

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.010
I mean, I've been an opera geek
since I was seven years old,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.000
really and truly.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.760
And so I've absorbed
a lot of opera.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.520
And it's really
just been my life.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.890
And so I know a lot about the
existing repertory of operas.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.970
And that's really helped me work
with composers and librettists

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.040
of today.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.970
Because the best
teachers, in a way,

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.360
are the great composers
and librettists like Mozart

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.810
and Da Ponte or Verdi and Boito.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:28.250
And there's no challenge that
a composer and librettist

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.125
of today is going to encounter
that a great composer

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:33.710
and librettists of
the past didn't.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:38.220
So often, when you're
trying to solve a problem,

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.680
you'll go to a model in
the standard repertory

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.440
and say, look at
what these folks did

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.230
with the same challenge.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.540
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah,
that's awesome.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.685
It sounds like an
incredibly challenging role

00:09:51.685 --> 00:09:53.060
as you bringing
everyone together

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.643
and try to get everyone on the
same page with the same vision.

00:09:55.643 --> 00:09:57.320
CORI ELLISON: It
can be challenging,

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.750
but it's also
incredibly rewarding.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.880
It really, really is.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.088
BOB CORNWALL: That's awesome.

00:10:02.088 --> 00:10:05.330
CORI ELLISON: And this
week, after so many years--

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.744
over four years in my
case of being involved

00:10:08.744 --> 00:10:10.160
in the development
of this piece--

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.700
it almost seems unreal
that tomorrow it's

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.107
actually going to happen.

00:10:15.107 --> 00:10:16.440
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah, that's true.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.100
And now Daniel, you had
the other interesting title

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.331
of librettist?

00:10:20.331 --> 00:10:21.455
Am I saying that correctly?

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:22.210
DANIEL MACIVOR: Librettist?

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.600
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah,
and so can you explain

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.890
like what is a librettist?

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.880
DANIEL MACIVOR: A librettist
is the writer of the words.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.880
So I write the words, whether
they're-- well, all the words.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.610
There's very few words
spoken, a few words spoken.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.550
There's probably about
maybe 30 words spoken.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.800
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Actually,
my daughter, who's seven,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.590
went to the opera.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.980
And we said, what's
your favorite part?

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.220
And she went, the
part where the woman

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.418
says, the underworld suits you.

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:53.365
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:53.365 --> 00:10:55.406
DANIEL MACIVOR: That's so
funny, that's so funny.

00:10:55.406 --> 00:10:56.900
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: That's
one of the spoken parts.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.983
BOB CORNWALL: I love that.

00:10:57.983 --> 00:11:00.500
DANIEL MACIVOR: Good.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.540
So there are spoken
words, and I wrote those.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.850
And I also write the
words that are sung.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:08.840
So basically, I write something,
and I give it to Rufus.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.140
And then we sort of--

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.240
Rufus writes music, and
sometimes he writes music

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.100
to what I've written, and
sometimes he writes music

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.720
and then we incorporate
what I've written,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.100
or sometimes he
makes suggestions

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.599
about something else I might
write that would fit the music.

00:11:21.599 --> 00:11:25.190
So I'm just the word guy.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.157
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah, OK.

00:11:26.157 --> 00:11:26.990
And it sounds like--

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.550
I was curious about
how the process works

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.883
between like writing the words
versus writing the music.

00:11:30.883 --> 00:11:32.930
And it sounds like
sometimes the music leads,

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.435
sometimes the words
lead you guys.

00:11:34.435 --> 00:11:36.060
It's really just
about coming together,

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.580
depending on what you've
got in front of you.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.445
Is that fair to say?

00:11:38.445 --> 00:11:39.320
DANIEL MACIVOR: Yeah.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:39.650
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah?

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:40.630
DANIEL MACIVOR: That's fair.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.800
That's fair.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.091
BOB CORNWALL: The other thing
for the audience too, I'm

00:11:43.091 --> 00:11:46.640
wondering, Rufus, if you can
explain what is "Hadrian?"

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.884
What is it all about?

00:11:48.884 --> 00:11:49.925
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Oh boy!

00:11:49.925 --> 00:11:51.300
BOB CORNWALL:
Yeah, big question.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.716
DANIEL MACIVOR:
Could Google that.

00:11:52.716 --> 00:11:53.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.806
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Well,
why don't we ask Peter?

00:11:54.806 --> 00:11:56.030
BOB CORNWALL: Sure, Peter?

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.750
PETER HINTON: Well,
I'll give it a go.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.041
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: He actually
has the best perspective,

00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:02.810
because he's--

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:07.430
PETER HINTON: "Hadrian" is an
opera about the second century

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:12.590
Roman emperor who
most of you probably

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.260
have heard about or
studied in school,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.550
and is associated
with Hadrian's Wall.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.980
But there are many things
that Hadrian was famous for.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:27.410
And the opera looks at him
at the last day of his life.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.800
And one of the things that
occurred during his reign

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:39.620
was he had a young male
lover named Antinous,

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:47.000
who, in October at this
very time of year in 130 AD,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.920
he died.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.290
And there was a lot of
mystery around his death,

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:56.840
whether it was a murder, an
accident, or a sacrifice.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.520
And it radically shaped
Hadrian's latter part

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.600
of his reign.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.840
And the opera is about that
relationship, about Hadrian

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.890
and Antinous, when they
met, their love affair,

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.830
and Hadrian's pursuit of that
mystery, what happened to him

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.620
and how he died.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.880
So it's an opera that's
a lot about empire

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.000
and what empire
represents and means.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.940
But it's also about
personal desire and love,

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.820
and it's cost and it's risk.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.080
So it's historical, but also
incredibly contemporary.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.780
And it's the thing
that really drew me

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:44.044
to it is that it's not
like BBC "Masterpiece

00:13:44.044 --> 00:13:44.960
Theater" or something.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:50.000
It's not like the
historical in that way.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.420
It's very romantic and very
political at the same time.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.490
So I think in our own age
of how we define ourselves,

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:02.820
and how we are socially
identifying ourselves,

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.854
it's very modern in that sense.

00:14:05.854 --> 00:14:07.520
BOB CORNWALL: You hit
on a lot of themes

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.630
about why this story
is so relevant today.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.790
And what I'm
curious about is how

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.000
long ago did you guys actually
start working on this opera?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.630
And at that point, how
did you choose this story?

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.555
Why this story and why now?

00:14:22.555 --> 00:14:26.230
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Well, I read
the book over 20 years ago.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.810
BOB CORNWALL: Wow.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.310
And--

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.450
CORI ELLISON: You
have to say what book.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.170
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:
Oh, sorry, the book.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.110
I read the book "The Memoirs
of Hadrian" by Yourcenar.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.200
It wasn't over 20 years,
it was almost 20 years ago.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.400
And I knew that it would
make a great opera, just

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.840
the whole context
with those characters

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.720
and in that time
period and so forth.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:52.010
So I always held onto that
idea of writing that opera.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:57.230
But I also had been
at McGill in music.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:02.089
And at one point, I was
studying composition and piano.

00:15:02.089 --> 00:15:04.130
And then at one point I
thought, well, maybe I'll

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.960
study opera singing.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.426
And I went in, and
I was wearing clogs.

00:15:08.426 --> 00:15:09.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.840
And the opera teacher said,
you have a great voice,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.460
but you can't wear those clogs.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.470
At which point I dropped
out of music school thanks

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.350
to that comment.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.967
Either the clogs go or I do.

00:15:22.967 --> 00:15:23.957
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:23.957 --> 00:15:25.040
BOB CORNWALL: Good choice.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.081
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Yeah,
so I went with the clogs.

00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:30.780
So needless to say I sort
of skipped out, literally,

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.550
of sort of the formal
musical education

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.790
in the classical sense.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.130
And I knew I wanted to
write "Hadrian" as an opera,

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.730
but I didn't feel confident
enough in my abilities

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.960
in terms of orchestration, and
just doing that kind of stuff

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.160
that I could do it.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.050
So I wrote "Prima Donna" first--

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.100
my first opera-- and
learned all that I could.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:01.590
And then thankfully, Alexander
Neef, the head of the COC,

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.920
he came to those performances.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.850
He heard that I wanted
to do "Hadrian,"

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.850
and he commissioned me to do it.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.840
BOB CORNWALL: Wow, and
how long ago was that?

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:10.840
Like how many years ago.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.245
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: That was--
oh God, almost 10 years ago.

00:16:13.245 --> 00:16:13.810
BOB CORNWALL: Wow!

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:14.350
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: 10 years ago.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.750
BOB CORNWALL: So this has
been like a work in progress

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:16.400
for a decade?

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.358
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Yeah.

00:16:17.358 --> 00:16:19.704
DANIEL MACIVOR: And then
about five years ago,

00:16:19.704 --> 00:16:21.370
Alexander got in touch
with me and asked

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.750
if I would get involved.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.860
And so Rufus and I
met, and we immediately

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.140
started talking about ideas.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.290
And it seemed like there
was something there.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:36.820
Then about three,
four years ago, Cori

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:43.330
became part of our little
thing, and the three of us

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.810
would work together.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:51.610
And then about a year ago,
Peter became part of the team.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.276
And then from Peter,
then we got cast.

00:16:55.276 --> 00:16:57.400
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Then we
gave birth to this child.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:57.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.200
BOB CORNWALL: To this young man.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.380
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.900
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: --of
all of our genetic traits.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.775
PETER HINTON: Isaiah.

00:17:02.775 --> 00:17:03.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.254
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: With
his mother's hair.

00:17:04.254 --> 00:17:05.087
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:05.087 --> 00:17:06.791
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:
He's got my face.

00:17:06.791 --> 00:17:08.087
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:08.087 --> 00:17:09.838
DANIEL MACIVOR: He's
an ectomorph like me.

00:17:09.838 --> 00:17:11.045
BOB CORNWALL: That's amazing.

00:17:11.045 --> 00:17:13.099
PETER HINTON: Isaiah in
the opera plays Antinous.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.300
And Antinous was like--
it's such a daunting

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:17.650
challenge for a performer.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.740
Because he was known
throughout antiquity

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.720
as being the most beautiful
male, the epitome of--

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.490
And so it's like it's
such a huge thing.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.310
and so I remember it
was last December,

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.810
and we were beginning design
meetings and stuff (LAUGHING)

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:33.790
in Toronto.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.220
And Alexander came and said, oh,
we found a fantastic Antinous

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:37.720
for you.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.890
His name is Isaiah Bell.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.150
And we're Googling what
he looks like right away.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.780
That's the first thing we did.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.410
And Isaiah has an app
which adapts your face

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.230
to what you might
look like at age 60,

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.298
and that's what came up.

00:17:52.298 --> 00:17:53.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.020
Wow, he's got a great voice.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.860
Well, he's kind of wild-looking.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.140
BOB CORNWALL: One more time.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.800
DANIEL MACIVOR: Isaiah came
to see a performance of mine

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.950
in Victoria, because
he lives in Victoria.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:11.292
And someone came and said, I
want you to meet your Antinous.

00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:12.750
And I turned around,
and I saw him.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:14.710
And it was kind of embarrassing,
because the first thing I said

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:15.878
was, you're handsome!

00:18:15.878 --> 00:18:16.705
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:16.705 --> 00:18:17.830
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Oh, good!

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.060
DANIEL MACIVOR: --excited.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.401
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:20.401 --> 00:18:22.150
CORI ELLISON: And it
took a while to find.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.040
Antinous was actually the last
cast member that we found,

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.400
because it was kind
of like a bake-off.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.990
All of us were
running around trying

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.070
to find handsome young tenors.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.450
We were kind of emailing
Alexander-- oh, I

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.010
heard somebody, I saw somebody.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.654
But Isaiah was the winner.

00:18:37.654 --> 00:18:39.070
BOB CORNWALL: Wow,
that's amazing.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:43.180
And so this will be the
world premiere this Saturday.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.270
And so, Isaiah, I'm curious
from your perspective,

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.010
what is it like
prepping for a role

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.920
that actually, no one else
has really had before?

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.500
Like what have you done to
prep for this role of Antinous?

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.000
ISAIAH BELL: People have been
asking me this question a lot.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.610
And I actually think that for
me personally as a performer,

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.870
the actual process of preparing
the role of a new opera

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.447
isn't or shouldn't be that
different from preparing

00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:08.530
a role from another opera.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.520
Because when I'm preparing
a role of something that's

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.020
been performed for
hundreds of years

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.030
or even written from
this last century,

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.210
I don't like to
spend a lot of time

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:23.320
at the beginning of the
process going through all

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.799
the famous performances of it.

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:28.090
We were talking about this
before we came on, actually,

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.090
the idea of as a performer,
whether you see yourself

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.130
from the outside
in, like what you're

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.620
doing as it appears
to other people,

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.080
or whether you try
to make it more

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.690
motivated from the inside out?

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:42.610
And so when I'm
preparing any role

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.510
I try to start with
what's there in the text,

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.250
and what's there in the music.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.970
And what we discuss
based on that,

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.110
and what we build from
the inside of the project.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.029
And then maybe if
I'm doing something

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.570
that has been done
many times before,

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.030
maybe at the very end, if I
have a problem with something,

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:05.030
or if I want to see just some
small detail how someone else

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.280
did it I might listen to them.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.321
But I don't think that
you want to model yourself

00:20:08.321 --> 00:20:09.430
on other performers.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:13.510
So for me, all the
stuff around it

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.670
is very different in
terms of the hype,

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.070
and in terms of
you're not necessarily

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.310
going to do a Google talk
about "The Elixir of Love"

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.830
or one of these operas
has been done 300 times

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.020
unless you're doing it
in a really radical way.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.120
But from the inside, it's
a very similar process.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.180
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: I actually
have an interesting question

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.030
about that, which I think
it's OK to talk about, though.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:40.000
I mean, I think for
you, for a young singer,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.150
it's probably a
wise role to take.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:47.830
But I do feel like for someone
like Thomas Hampson, who

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.820
plays Hadrian--

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.800
and he's one of the great
opera stars of the world.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.100
For him it's actually
really interesting for him

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.820
to do new roles, because he's
done all the other ones so

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.050
many times.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.900
And he's sort of--

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.410
and the voice changes, shall
we say, as you get older.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:13.310
And they'll always be
compared to past performances

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.100
of how many Alfredos
or how many Toscas--

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:20.210
but then to come and do a
new role is a great kind of--

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:24.350
I think for an older singer,
and a very established singer,

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:28.100
it's a really good
move in terms of just

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.780
keeping your career going.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.370
Is that true?

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.220
CORI ELLISON: Yeah, I would
say definitely, absolutely.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.260
But I think for singers
all across the board,

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.960
to have the feeling
that you participated

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.070
in the creation of this piece--

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.870
I mean, when this
piece gets done again--

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:51.400
and I have every confidence that
it will be done a lot again,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.500
that people will come
to it-- and things

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.050
that have been set
kind of in stone

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:01.640
were partially the way they are
because of Isaiah, and Thomas,

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.070
and Karita and Ambur
Braid, and all the people

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:07.130
who are participating in the
world premiere production.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:12.270
We did rewriting of music
and words to suit them,

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:16.470
and certain staging
choices as well.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.529
So they've been very much a part
of the formation of this piece.

00:22:20.529 --> 00:22:22.070
ISAIAH BELL: I would
say that once we

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.460
got into the rehearsal room,
the thing that was really great

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:30.410
is how much we did have
a dialogue about how

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.080
things worked practically.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.830
And that's something
that's very exciting,

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.770
and that you don't do if you're
singing an opera that's been

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:37.980
established by someone else.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.690
And I also like that no
one is coming to the show

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:44.800
and thinking, well, Jon Vickers
is my favorite performer

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.300
of this.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.436
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:46.436 --> 00:22:48.060
So it must be amazing
to work with him.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.185
PETER HINTON: But I think
it's an interesting thing

00:22:50.185 --> 00:22:52.160
with a new work
for the audience.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.390
Because we come to
our favorite operas

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:01.100
with already our impression
of what we love about it.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.960
So we come to
"Tosca" with an idea

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.320
of what we think "Tosca" should
be and how she should sound.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.840
And what's great is to sit there
last night in the theater--

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.990
we had our sort of
open dress rehearsal--

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:16.620
and going, everyone is hearing
this for the first time.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.870
And never mind, they don't
know how it's going to end.

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.110
They don't know what's
going to happen next.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.609
And they don't know
about the music.

00:23:22.609 --> 00:23:25.400
They're hearing this aria
for the very first time.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.150
It's so thrilling.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.733
CORI ELLISON: It's
an amazing feeling.

00:23:27.733 --> 00:23:28.604
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:28.604 --> 00:23:30.020
CORI ELLISON:
Because a way, opera

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.120
can be like the "Rocky
Horror Picture Show,"

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.160
that you come to it knowing
what's going to happen,

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.520
and you have your little
props with you and all that.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:37.805
BOB CORNWALL: And you're ready.

00:23:37.805 --> 00:23:39.500
CORI ELLISON: And
this is one reason

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.630
why even with
standard repertory,

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.660
I'm a firm believer
that synopses

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.136
shouldn't have spoilers.

00:23:46.136 --> 00:23:48.260
Because maybe there is
somebody in the audience who

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.570
hasn't seen "Boheme" before.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.989
Do they have to know that
Mimi dies at the end?

00:23:51.989 --> 00:23:53.030
Sorry if you didn't know.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.025
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:54.025 --> 00:23:55.150
BOB CORNWALL: Just ruin it.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:56.775
CORI ELLISON: But
you know what I mean?

00:23:56.775 --> 00:23:58.760
And for them to know
enough about the piece

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.520
to know that they're
interested to come see it,

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.940
the story engages them, and
then come and have an experience

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.510
just like you would
if you were going

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.080
to a new film or a new play.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.051
You don't come-- you know.

00:24:11.051 --> 00:24:11.550
yeah.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.340
BOB CORNWALL: Go ahead.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.423
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: But you
know what's interesting,

00:24:14.423 --> 00:24:20.390
though, is that because I'm
mostly in the pop world,

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.922
and that's where I
spend most of my time

00:24:23.922 --> 00:24:25.880
and where most of my fans
are, a lot of my fans

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.350
have never been to the opera.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.795
BOB CORNWALL: That's true.

00:24:28.795 --> 00:24:31.940
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: And I
have had many experiences

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.000
where my opera was the
first opera they ever saw,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.140
which is also exciting.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:39.610
Because then, I think for
the opera world in general,

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.260
it's like, god, think of all
the incredible stuff (LAUGHING)

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:47.276
that you're about to
discover of the great works

00:24:47.276 --> 00:24:51.380
that we kind of take for
granted that everybody knows.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.260
There are actually huge pockets
of people, younger people,

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.870
mostly, who don't know that,
because it's not-- so it's

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.660
a nice sort of double sword.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.770
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.872
CORI ELLISON: --creating
new opera fans for us.

00:25:02.872 --> 00:25:05.330
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah, and this
is actually your second opera?

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:06.020
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:
This is my second.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.610
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah, so curious--

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:10.040
second time around-- what
are the lessons learned?

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.595
What are you doing the
same, what's different?

00:25:12.595 --> 00:25:14.090
What is the process like?

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.298
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: We were
talking about this at lunch

00:25:16.298 --> 00:25:21.710
today, Cori and
I. At the time, it

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:26.630
was pretty horrific what I had
to put up with my first opera.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.780
Because it had been commissioned
by the Met, and then

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.820
we had a falling out.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.660
And then I had to bring it
to England and so forth.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.150
And what was going to take five
years had to take one year,

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.880
and it was all over the place.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.800
And I could go on and on.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.890
But I'm very happy with
"Prima Donna," my first opera.

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.670
It's a piece I love
very dearly, and I

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.360
think it'll actually survive.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.090
But needless to say,
the whole experience

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:57.520
was pretty traumatic.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:03.040
Whereas this one is light years
away from that in terms of what

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.160
I had to contend with.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.470
But funnily enough,
I am so happy that

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.330
happened with "Prima
Donna," my first opera.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:11.720
Because it really--

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.730
I don't know, I can
now appreciate fully

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:22.450
all the wonderful people
and talent, and really,

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:24.970
the opportunity that
I've had on this piece,

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:30.520
to have every facet
be of such excellence.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.480
Whereas I think if I had not
had that struggle at the outset,

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.370
I wouldn't be aware
of how fortunate I am.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.432
And so it's all the way
it's supposed to be.

00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:41.890
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah,
they always say

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.223
it's those moments that are
harder where you do the most

00:26:44.223 --> 00:26:46.610
learning, and where you
find gratitude too, right?

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:48.460
So I totally get that.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.690
I also think--

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:52.930
Peter, you were talking
about how this story has

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:54.730
a ton of history.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.190
And so as you're going
about building this opera,

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.100
I'm really curious about
what kind of research

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:01.930
you would have done.

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.730
How did you guys go
about mining the story,

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.320
and figure out how
you want to tell it

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.694
and what choices you
guys want to make?

00:27:07.694 --> 00:27:09.560
PETER HINTON:
Well, there's lots.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.610
I mean, there's lots of research
you can do on ancient Rome.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:19.250
And I have my favorite go-tos,
like I really love Mary Beard.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.280
If any of you have read Mary
Beard or seen her BBC program,

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.480
I adore her.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:28.130
And she sort of makes
that classical world

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:32.160
very available, very relatable.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.710
And so I really
love that in her.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.276
But a thing that I really
said to the singers a lot

00:27:36.276 --> 00:27:38.150
and to the designers
when we're working on it

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.916
is there are lots of
different Hadrians.

00:27:40.916 --> 00:27:42.290
That's what you
find out when you

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.260
start researching, different
interpretations of Hadrian.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.290
And our job was to
really to try to learn

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:53.840
Daniel and Rufus's Hadrian,
their telling of this story.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.110
And they both have very
different inspirations,

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.020
very different reference
points, very different

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.430
historical influences,
and together

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.250
is the take on
Hadrian in this opera.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.940
So that's the part I
really loved embracing,

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:15.855
was trying to understand how
these guys saw that story.

00:28:15.855 --> 00:28:19.780
CORI ELLISON: If I could
elaborate a little bit on that.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:23.090
The fact that any
time you create

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.090
a work of art that's
historically based,

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:30.824
whether it's a novel, or a
play, or an opera, a film,

00:28:30.824 --> 00:28:32.240
you have a lot of
choices to make.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.760
Because sometimes
there's a plethora

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.640
of material about the
character, and sometimes there's

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.900
very little.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.740
And you have to either
fill in a lot of blanks

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.330
or make a lot of choices.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.880
And also, the kinds
of choices you make

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.000
are for dramatic reasons.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.040
You may sometimes
depart from actual fact

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.681
in order to get
at a deeper truth.

00:28:59.681 --> 00:29:00.680
That happens very often.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.300
There are other
historical operas

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:07.400
like "Don Carlos" by Verdi, or
"Boris Godunov" by Mussorgsky,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.060
that don't tell the
letter of history,

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.540
but they really get at the
essence of a lot of who

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.734
these characters were.

00:29:15.734 --> 00:29:17.150
DANIEL MACIVOR:
What did you say--

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.510
something this morning about
we have to imagine our past,

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.230
and imagine--

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:22.146
PETER HINTON: Oh yeah.

00:29:22.146 --> 00:29:24.500
Like, I just think
we just get very

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:29.690
obsessed with historical
accuracy and fact-based things

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.540
as being based on a true story.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:36.710
Where the way we imagine
our way into history to me

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:42.410
is far more interesting
than a history book

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:44.340
kind of telling of it.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:51.090
Because why tell a story about
the second century AD today?

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.970
And how does it speak
to our own times?

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.800
It's a way to reflect
upon our own times

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.320
by considering it in
a Roman Empire way.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.710
And that doesn't mean
you have to put senators

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.352
in business suits and give
people iPads in a production

00:30:04.352 --> 00:30:07.652
to say it's relevant, you know?

00:30:07.652 --> 00:30:09.360
BOB CORNWALL: That
makes me think about--

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.480
when you're in the process
of building this opera,

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.580
you must be thinking
about the audience,

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.150
and what impact you want this
opera to have on the audience.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.820
So I'm sort of curious--

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:23.580
as the audience walks out
from opening night, what

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.550
is the impact you hope
this opera will have.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.590
DANIEL MACIVOR:
We want to think,

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.510
I'm coming back
to see that again.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:31.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.740
BOB CORNWALL: And again?

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.156
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: I'm thinking
of the next production that

00:30:34.156 --> 00:30:36.000
takes place with
business suits and iPads

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.493
in the Google building.

00:30:37.493 --> 00:30:39.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:39.942 --> 00:30:41.400
Which will be
somewhere in Germany.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.275
BOB CORNWALL: You've
come to the right place.

00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:44.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.600
DANIEL MACIVOR: So it's a
very queer gang, isn't it?

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.980
We're a queer bunch, aren't we?

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.730
CORI ELLISON: Yes.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:51.310
BOB CORNWALL: For sure.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.600
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Totally.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.225
DANIEL MACIVOR: We're
quite queer here.

00:30:53.225 --> 00:30:54.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.530
We're as queer as you
can get, pretty much.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:58.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.002
Look at us all, queer as can be.

00:31:00.002 --> 00:31:02.994
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:04.795 --> 00:31:06.420
I mean, that's a big
part of it for me,

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.870
is that it's sort of
unapologetically that.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.910
And sort of shocking,
as Peter has

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:17.460
said, that in 2018 it's still
shocking, but there it is.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.380
There was a moment
at the beginning

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.740
of Act III, which is
after the intermission,

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.710
that Rufus had known about.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:28.105
I think you told me about it the
first time we sat down to talk,

00:31:28.105 --> 00:31:30.480
that there was this piece of
music you'd already written,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.479
and you knew what was
happening with this music,

00:31:32.479 --> 00:31:34.820
and it was the sex scene.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.760
And I spent quite a bit of
time trying to dissuade you

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.420
from going for the
incredible detail

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.150
that you wanted
in that sex scene.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:51.529
And when then people
started to come and react--

00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:52.570
they were shocked by it--

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:56.630
I realized how important
it was that that be there.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:01.360
Because I didn't realize that
you knew what would happen.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.820
Anyway, so I think
that for me, the fact

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.390
that the queerness of
it is very important.

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.080
CORI ELLISON: And
that's really--

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.380
when we're talking about
why tell this story now--

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.340
Rufus, I think
for you that was--

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.386
am I right-- one of the main--

00:32:17.386 --> 00:32:18.790
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Yeah, well,
one of the main things for me

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:19.300
was--

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.890
I've been an opera
fan since I was

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.620
a child, since I was about 13.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:28.270
And I very much fell
into the whole tradition

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:35.800
of gay men going to the opera
to get a sense of solace,

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:41.230
to get a sense of belonging,
to deal with this feeling

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:42.760
of rejection and tragedy.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.410
And especially for me, because
I was 13, and that was right--

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:50.380
it was 1987, so AIDS was
just decimating my community.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.300
And I really did
think I was going

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.000
to die for a solid 10 years.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.190
And I was probably not far off
the mark in thinking that way.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:05.830
Anyway, so opera created
that safe place for me.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:08.380
But the one thing
missing, of course,

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.210
was actual great
grand operas that

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:17.440
had fabulously larger than
life gay characters in them

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.970
on par with Tristan and
Isolde, or Don Carlos

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.330
and people like that.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:27.910
So I don't know if
it was purposefully

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:32.930
done to try to introduce
those personalities,

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:40.120
but I do feel like it's a
strange kind of destiny.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.740
It's meant to happen,
and I'm just you

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.240
know fulfilling that prophecy.

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:48.530
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah, it feels
very culturally relevant,

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:50.350
particularly in this moment.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:54.030
And it's nice to see the opera
take on this type of story line

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:57.850
and tell it so unapologetically,
I think, is what I've seen--

00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:59.100
DANIEL MACIVOR: Taken a while.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.050
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah, but it's
really, really nice to see.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:04.500
And I'm curious--
from any one of you--

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.780
what do you think it is
about the genre of opera that

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:12.189
can tell this story so uniquely
versus any other genre?

00:34:12.189 --> 00:34:13.480
Why is this such a great opera?

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.230
CORI ELLISON: Please.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.790
Well, I think it's a story
that just cries out to be sung.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:21.739
It's so larger than life.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.320
And even though it's
historic, it has so much

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.639
of the mythical about it.

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:28.670
And I think when you look
at the repertory of operas

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:33.080
historically, so many
of the great grand opera

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.270
certainly have exactly
this kind of story.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:41.929
I've always said it reminds
me of the great Verdi operas,

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:46.380
in the sense that it's
a very personal story.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.110
It's a love triangle.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.010
It's a very deeply
personal story,

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.929
but at the same time,
set against the backdrop

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:57.050
of an entire empire
and its fate.

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:00.020
And this is very like what
you find in a Verdi opera,

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:04.340
and a lot of grand operas
like "Les Troyens" by Berlioz.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:09.350
So I like to say it's a
21st century 19th century

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:10.670
grand opera.

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.520
DANIEL MACIVOR: It's
also about on some--

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.730
one of the first phrases that
I had received about this

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:20.330
was the phrase
inconsolable grief.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:25.250
And I'm not going to see a
play about inconsolable grief,

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:26.150
sorry.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:27.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.920
But if you can sing
inconsolable grief?

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.397
Yeah, I'll go.

00:35:32.397 --> 00:35:33.355
I'll be there.

00:35:33.355 --> 00:35:34.730
BOB CORNWALL: And
check that out.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:35.396
No, I love that.

00:35:35.396 --> 00:35:36.500
That makes a ton of sense.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.360
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: I
am curious, though,

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.350
how would you define it in terms
of your experience of seeing

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:44.875
other repertoire,
and where it fits in?

00:35:44.875 --> 00:35:48.572
And if it is--

00:35:48.572 --> 00:35:50.940
I'm not asking if it's a
great opera or not, but--

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.150
But in terms of--

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.300
BOB CORNWALL: We
know the answer.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.890
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: --in terms
of trying to be a great opera,

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.350
and going for what
great operas engender,

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:05.110
which is music that
lasts at least 100 years,

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.630
are you getting
that vibe at all?

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:08.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.420
As a singer?

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.212
I don't know.

00:36:11.212 --> 00:36:13.420
ISAIAH BELL: Well, one of
the really wonderful things

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:15.520
about this opera
is its connection

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.480
to the history of opera,
which in itself is

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.930
something that has become
part of what makes opera.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:26.320
Because opera is such
a historical tradition.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.980
And since the creation of opera,
even at the very beginning

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:30.700
of opera--

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.720
the first opera that we
know about that survives

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:39.550
is "Eurydice," by Peri, and
also "L'Orfeo" by Monteverdi.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.040
And these operas were
already calling back

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.680
to this grand tradition
of Greek theater

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.280
from thousands of years
before, hundreds and thousands.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:56.470
And so I think opera as an
art form is tied inextricably

00:36:56.470 --> 00:37:01.690
with the grander
elements of life,

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:06.940
of history, and of emotions
that are too big to just

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.120
be chatted about, you know?

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.820
And I think that that's
something that this opera

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.010
understands intrinsically--
and that you,

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.770
as a lifelong opera
lover, understand,

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.420
and it comes across
very clearly--

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:24.310
is that it's connected
to our human story.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:27.060
And what I really love about
"Hadrian" and about many

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.560
of the great operas that I love,
like "Gloriana" by Britten,

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.260
which is actually very similar
in a lot of ways, which

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:37.150
juxtaposes this idea of empire,
and of your responsibilities

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.790
as a public figure, and your
responsibilities as a ruler

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.206
and someone who
has responsibility

00:37:41.206 --> 00:37:43.660
for other people, with
your private needs

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.550
and your own desires.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:48.220
And what's really
great about "Hadrian"

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:52.000
is that it understands
that interplay.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.810
And it understands the
grandness of everything

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:59.710
that's out there,
like Toronto, Canada,

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.770
the world, Rome, everything.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:06.310
And the grandness of these
things that are only just

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.950
seen behind a
flicker in the eye,

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:10.760
but it means everything
to you as a person.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.600
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah, I
love that articulation.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.800
That's so true.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.600
When you have these
grand responsibilities

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.240
that are very public a
lot of the time, but then

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.670
you have these personal
grand responsibilities too.

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.170
The story does a
really great job

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:25.140
of demonstrating both of
those, and the tension in it.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.014
ISAIAH BELL: The
interesting thing about this

00:38:27.014 --> 00:38:30.490
is seeing in Hadrian's story
how all these things that

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.800
to almost everyone else in
the opera are everything.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.180
They can't understand
why Hadrian is swept away

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:41.050
by this thing that seems,
in the scope of history,

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.280
so inconsequential.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.420
And history hasn't had much
to say about Antinous in terms

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.590
of who he was as a person.

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.020
Hadrian made him
into something grand.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:51.970
Hadrian made him into a god.

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:53.920
Hadrian made him into
someone to be worshiped.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.660
But in terms of
what it was actually

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.334
like to be that person, or what
their relationship was like,

00:38:58.334 --> 00:38:59.500
we don't know much about it.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.360
DANIEL MACIVOR: Now we do.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.390
ISAIAH BELL: But now we do.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:02.848
BOB CORNWALL:
(LAUGHING) Now we do.

00:39:02.848 --> 00:39:05.050
ISAIAH BELL: But I think
that it's interesting

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.810
that there's so much
grandness, and everyone

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.310
sees the story of
Rome, and how we

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.226
must preserve the story
of Rome in this opera.

00:39:11.226 --> 00:39:13.610
And that's really what
most people's objective is.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.480
And then there's this
very intimate thing

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.842
that, if you saw it
from the outside,

00:39:20.842 --> 00:39:23.050
you wouldn't necessarily
understand what's important.

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:26.609
But to two people,
it's the only thing.

00:39:26.609 --> 00:39:27.775
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah, totally.

00:39:27.775 --> 00:39:29.580
Isaiah, I want to ask you too--

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.900
you talk about being
an artist in this role.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.540
And very much, as an opera
singer, you're a huge artist.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.220
I think you're also
an athlete as well.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.420
And I'm super
curious, what is it

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.429
like to train for an opera
that's going to go live?

00:39:43.429 --> 00:39:45.970
Like what does a day in the life
look like for you right now?

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.020
I have no idea.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.040
DANIEL MACIVOR: The diary online
if you really want to know.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.030
ISAIAH BELL: I do have
a diary that the COC has

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.490
asked me to write about
the process of this.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.460
BOB CORNWALL: Fabulous.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:57.751
ISAIAH BELL: But that training
that's spoken of in that

00:39:57.751 --> 00:40:00.429
is mostly emotional.

00:40:00.429 --> 00:40:02.470
First of all, I will
correct any misapprehensions

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.220
that I am an athlete.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.053
I am not an athlete.

00:40:04.053 --> 00:40:04.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.110
I mean, we always say-- and my
first voice teacher corrected

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.640
the idea right off the bat--

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.019
that it is an athletic
art form in terms

00:40:12.019 --> 00:40:13.060
of how you use your body.

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.950
You're engaging it with
it like an athlete,

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.408
and we do approach
it athletically.

00:40:16.408 --> 00:40:18.980
But you're not
necessarily going to see

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.980
the results of that outwardly.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.370
But the training for
something like this, for me--

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:26.950
I don't know if it is the same
for many all opera singers.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:28.850
I know that just
talking informally

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.420
with many of my
colleagues, this is true.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.300
But the training
is about, for me,

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.060
so much keeping an equilibrium
as you're going through,

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:42.010
especially a process like this,
which has so many needs, so

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.252
many personalities,
so many ups and downs

00:40:44.252 --> 00:40:46.210
when no one knows what
it's going to look like.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.740
And no one says--

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:48.790
if you're doing--

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:49.870
I don't know, I said
"The Elixir of Love,"

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:52.245
but if you're doing any opera--
or "Tristan and Isolde--"

00:40:52.245 --> 00:40:54.880
not that I sing that-- but
any of these great things,

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.170
you may be struggling.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:58.840
But you think well, this has
been done hundreds of times

00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.500
before.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.472
It's like the whole
idea of the first--

00:41:01.472 --> 00:41:02.680
what is it-- the minute mile?

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.139
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:05.430
BOB CORNWALL: Four-minute mile.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:06.940
ISAIAH BELL: Yeah,
four-minute mile.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.050
As I said, not an athlete.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:12.340
The first time someone
broke that, no one had ever

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.360
broken that record.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.890
And then suddenly, it's
like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.260
once we have it in our
head that it can be done.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:17.545
BOB CORNWALL: Totally.

00:41:17.545 --> 00:41:18.961
ISAIAH BELL: And
so with something

00:41:18.961 --> 00:41:21.910
like this, the training for me
is so much about, as I said,

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:25.210
staying inside myself,
staying with myself,

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:26.980
going moment to moment.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.800
Which I think is
exactly what someone

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:32.710
who was training for
the Olympics would do.

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:36.510
When you've done this
dive four million times,

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.430
but this is the one time that
matters, the only way that you

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.899
can do that is just by
keeping in contact with you

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:43.690
and what you do, and
not getting swept away

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:45.460
by all this other stuff
that happens outside.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.001
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:
I will say, though,

00:41:47.001 --> 00:41:48.840
that it's amazing in
this process how--

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:50.280
that's the way you do it.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.490
How Thomas Hampson does it
is completely different.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:53.490
ISAIAH BELL: Absolutely.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.180
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:
Karita Mattila they're

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.530
all-- opera singers
are real planets.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.460
I mean, I think there
are certain rules

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.130
that they have to follow
in order not to spin out

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:04.270
of the universe.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.600
But in essence,
every single singer,

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.170
like every single
voice, is so unique.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:15.070
And that's one of the
great things about opera,

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.869
is that you really--

00:42:16.869 --> 00:42:18.410
and it's great and
horrible, thanks--

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:20.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.310
--as I look at Peter
with that face.

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.520
BOB CORNWALL: Big wide eyes.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.186
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: But
yeah, but you just

00:42:26.186 --> 00:42:28.100
have this clash of
different methods,

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.765
very different methods,
that have to work together.

00:42:31.765 --> 00:42:33.890
ISAIAH BELL: Well, I will
say, you sort of jokingly

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:35.420
referred to this
idea of the diva.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.440
And I've actually been
thinking about this.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.100
We have this idea
of divas as being

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.400
these people who
just run roughshod

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.410
over everyone else's desires.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.990
And just being on
stage with Karita

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:51.800
and with Thomas, who are both
these world-famous celebrated

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.520
opera singers, I've
seen the good side

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.140
of this idea of the diva.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.720
I mean, the diva means goddess,
like that's what it means.

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:03.329
And it's someone who--

00:43:03.329 --> 00:43:05.120
I mean, the idea of
being a planet, someone

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.328
that has their own gravitational
pull, is incredible.

00:43:07.328 --> 00:43:10.310
Because when you're
out there on your own,

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:14.480
being sort of the figurehead
at the front of this ship that

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.210
is driven by so
many people, that

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:18.950
has so many needs
of its own, you

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:23.280
need a sense of
gravity in yourself.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.730
And I think that
the thing that's

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:28.070
great about it is that everyone
does do it differently,

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.085
but everyone has to
do it their own way.

00:43:30.085 --> 00:43:31.710
And they can't do it
anyone else's way.

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:33.950
And I think that the idea
of the diva, and why people

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:34.570
love opera.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:38.840
It's because you see someone
who has to do it their own way.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.050
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah, I love that.

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:45.170
I'm curious, Rufus--
you are a performer.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:46.230
You're on stage.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:49.070
And in this case, you
are also the composer.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:51.884
And I'm curious, what
does it feel like?

00:43:51.884 --> 00:43:53.300
How is the feeling
different being

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.673
a composer versus
performer and vice versa?

00:43:55.673 --> 00:43:56.990
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Oh boy.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:04.888
I mean, being a
performer is my day job.

00:44:04.888 --> 00:44:07.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:09.350
So I'm much more used to it.

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.865
But being the composer is--

00:44:10.865 --> 00:44:12.110
I don't know.

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:15.920
I think the one main
difference that I'll say

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.950
is that I think with
being a composer,

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:23.040
you are far more sensitive
than you are even aware of.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:27.710
I mean, you have to have so
much armor and so many weapons

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.480
to kind of defend
yourself and your work,

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:35.120
and not get affected by
all the asteroids coming

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.350
at your planet.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:41.270
But then sometimes, a
little notch will break off,

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:44.390
and you'll just be
weeping all of a sudden.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:47.960
Because you are
feeling incredibly

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.790
vulnerable at the same time.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.440
So it's pretty intense.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.170
But we have a question.

00:44:53.591 --> 00:44:55.340
BOB CORNWALL: Oh sorry,
I didn't even see.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.070
AUDIENCE: In terms
of your process,

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:01.750
there's always this words
or music, which came first?

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.160
And how did you collaborate?

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:06.390
Did you play some
music and then did

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:11.400
you decide what was
going to be sung in that?

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.770
And it's been that
way, I guess, over time

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:17.010
with opera composers
and librettists.

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:18.360
So how did it work with you two?

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.670
DANIEL MACIVOR: I
delivered a draft to Rufus,

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:23.700
and then that was the basis--

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:27.570
Alexander pointed out recently
that the draft that we have now

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.865
is exactly the same number
of pages as the first draft.

00:45:29.865 --> 00:45:31.740
It's just that everything
in it is different.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:34.950
But we did have a structure.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:37.260
We adhered to that
structure that I presented

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.310
as this idea of the story.

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:44.752
And then sometimes, he
would write to the words,

00:45:44.752 --> 00:45:46.210
and sometimes he
would write music,

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.250
and I would adapt the words.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:49.460
And sometimes, we would
just hammer it out together.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.330
We worked a lot.

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.250
And when Cori came
in, then we started

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:58.800
working at Opera America, which
is a place on 7th and New York.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.250
And we would sit in the
office and in the boardroom

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:04.290
there and kind of hammer it out.

00:46:04.290 --> 00:46:06.900
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: It's
kind of a lot like sex.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:07.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:08.760
In the sense that--

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.170
BOB CORNWALL: Go on.

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:11.336
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: --you try
a whole bunch of things.

00:46:11.336 --> 00:46:11.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.800
And you really know
when something works.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.035
And you kind of stick
with that for a while.

00:46:17.035 --> 00:46:19.940
Then that gets a little old, and
you got to try something else.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.390
And so it's very--

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:25.310
I mean, in a way--

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.060
DANIEL MACIVOR: And
then you fall in love.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.018
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Yeah.

00:46:28.018 --> 00:46:28.722
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:28.722 --> 00:46:29.930
BOB CORNWALL: That's amazing.

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:32.309
DANIEL MACIVOR: Isn't that
sort of what happens with sex?

00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.850
I don't know.

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:33.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.160
CORI ELLISON: Or you
could be in love first.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.160
DANIEL MACIVOR: Oh yeah.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:36.890
Oh well--

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:37.740
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: It
was not love first.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.823
DANIEL MACIVOR: We're gay.

00:46:38.823 --> 00:46:39.464
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:39.464 --> 00:46:40.810
It doesn't go that way.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:43.020
BOB CORNWALL: Thank
you for your question.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.520
Do we have a question
over here too?

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hi.

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.780
So like Bob said earlier, we're
across the street from the Four

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.659
Seasons Center, so
opera is very close.

00:46:51.659 --> 00:46:53.700
But it's not something
that I go to all the time,

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.490
and I'm really looking
forward to enjoying it

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.860
next week when I have tickets.

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:01.740
What is your thought
around opera in Canada?

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:05.579
How many people currently
are in that world?

00:47:05.579 --> 00:47:07.620
Do you have any ideas--
like, this part of a push

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.390
to kind of push into
broader audiences

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:10.620
or anything like that?

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.960
And just sort of comment on
opera in Canada in general,

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.010
and what that world looks like.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:15.385
DANIEL MACIVOR:
I don't know much

00:47:15.385 --> 00:47:18.090
about opera, period,
or opera in Canada.

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:19.710
But I do know
something about opera,

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.650
and I wonder what
this is maybe--

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:24.210
I notice that
people are really--

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:28.150
that we have some
excellent actors.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:31.380
And I think that that's
something that's newish.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:32.255
CORI ELLISON: Oh, oh.

00:47:32.255 --> 00:47:33.630
DANIEL MACIVOR:
Is that not true?

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:34.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.970
CORI ELLISON: That
hurts my heart.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:36.803
DANIEL MACIVOR: Why?

00:47:36.803 --> 00:47:38.400
CORI ELLISON: No, because--

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.250
that's a truism
that you hear a lot.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:43.320
But throughout the
history of opera,

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.380
there have been some very,
very great performers.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.330
Not all, but--

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:50.280
DANIEL MACIVOR: I think
we have a number--

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:56.330
I think more that are
not actors in our cast.

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:59.547
And I think it feels
like a more modern thing.

00:47:59.547 --> 00:48:00.380
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:02.796
DANIEL MACIVOR: That there's
an attention to that in a way

00:48:02.796 --> 00:48:05.240
that there wasn't an
attention to it before.

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:08.640
CORI ELLISON: Well, depends what
you mean by before, and where.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.180
I mean, that's a very big,
sweeping generalization

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:12.930
to make, I feel.

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:14.513
DANIEL MACIVOR: My
feeling, as someone

00:48:14.513 --> 00:48:19.140
who doesn't know much
about opera, as I said--

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:21.450
of the operas that I've
seen, my experience

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.730
has been that acting
was not really--

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:25.320
that didn't seem to
be that important.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.820
CORI ELLISON: Oh,
I'm sorry that you

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:28.754
happened to see those
particular performances.

00:48:28.754 --> 00:48:29.582
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:29.582 --> 00:48:31.040
DANIEL MACIVOR:
Yeah, so that was--

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.429
and I think there's a lot of it.

00:48:32.429 --> 00:48:33.720
I think there is a lot of that.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:34.020
CORI ELLISON:
Well, I don't know.

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.311
DANIEL MACIVOR: I think maybe
you've been really lucky.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:37.653
CORI ELLISON: Mm, I've
seen a lot of stuff.

00:48:37.653 --> 00:48:39.000
DANIEL MACIVOR: But
maybe you've seen

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.124
a lot of really good stuff.

00:48:40.124 --> 00:48:41.666
CORI ELLISON: Yes,
and bad stuff too.

00:48:41.666 --> 00:48:43.790
BOB CORNWALL: I think the
one thing we all agree on

00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:46.020
is "Hadrian" in particular
feels really different,

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.400
and it feels--

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.620
I got to check out a
little bit of it on Tuesday

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.120
night when you guys
were rehearsing.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.830
And it feels very
different, and it feels

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:54.730
like it resonates with me.

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:56.940
And it feels like it
resonates with the audience

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:58.356
that I know that's
here at Google.

00:48:58.356 --> 00:48:59.970
And I think I'm
really excited to see

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.610
what it does in the industry
of Toronto and Canada

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:03.575
and opera in this area.

00:49:03.575 --> 00:49:05.700
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Well, I
mean, just to sort of try

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:07.690
and mend this gap over
here a little bit--

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:08.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:09.064
BOB CORNWALL: Please.

00:49:09.064 --> 00:49:12.570
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: I would say,
though, that opera in Canada

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:17.040
actually has a very
distinguished history.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.740
Some of the greatest opera
singers that ever lived

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:22.830
were Canadian.

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:26.730
Back to Albani, right?

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:27.230
Alba--

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:28.230
CORI ELLISON: Emma Albani?

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:29.360
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:
Emma Albani, who was--

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.610
CORI ELLISON: You had Edward
Johnson, who ran the Met.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:36.420
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: And
arguably, from Toronto proper,

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:39.650
one of the greatest
singing actresses

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:43.620
is Teresa Stratus,
who I grew up with,

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:46.140
watching her do "La Traviata"
and stuff like that,

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.450
and "Dialogue of
the Carmelites."

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:49.950
And then when you
go to Jon Vickers,

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:52.020
and Maureen Forrester,
and people like that.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:56.610
I do feel that in Canada,
there has been a kind of--

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.920
how can I say--

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:13.950
more of attention paid to the
holistic of being an artist.

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:18.260
And it has translated well
in opera here particularly.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:23.780
I mean, because you don't have
some somewhere like the Met,

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.330
or somewhere like La Scala where
they just kind of like shoot

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:28.690
them out and it's
more of a machine,

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:32.990
here, I think opera is and
has been for many years,

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.920
really prized.

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.620
Because we're aware
of how special

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.441
it is because it's not
taken for granted as much.

00:50:39.441 --> 00:50:40.440
BOB CORNWALL: Thank you.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:40.890
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: So that's--

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:42.640
DANIEL MACIVOR: Holistic,
that's the word.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.236
More holistic.

00:50:44.236 --> 00:50:46.110
BOB CORNWALL: That's
what you're looking for.

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:47.094
Last audience question.

00:50:47.094 --> 00:50:49.010
AUDIENCE: Yes, I wanted
to go back to the idea

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.670
that you brought up,
Isaiah, this idea of history

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.770
and going back into history.

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:58.730
We're here in a new city in
a new country with an opera

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:00.980
company that is quite new
in the big scheme of things.

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:05.820
Rufus, you work primarily in
a relatively new art form.

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.240
But here with opera,
you're taking an art form

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.580
that has centuries
of history that

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.260
has changed, of
course, over time,

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:14.990
from a more popular art form to
something that's somewhat more

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:17.020
rarefied air these days.

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.120
And you're looking at a story
set in Roman times, which

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.517
goes back millennia now.

00:51:23.517 --> 00:51:25.100
Can you talk a little
bit about if you

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.820
feel any burden of taking
on this mantle of history,

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:33.100
in both the art form and the
story that you're telling?

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.100
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Yeah.

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:36.360
I mean, there's one--

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.760
it's funny, there hasn't
been much talk about it.

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:48.840
And perhaps my
safe side should be

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:54.220
more on par with the idea of
just not talking about it.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:59.160
But my Rufus side feels like,
let's just talk about it.

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.830
I mean, there is very dark
sides of this opera, which

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:05.970
is that Hadrian was responsible
for the first really

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:07.290
big Jewish massacre.

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.050
And it's addressed in the piece.

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:13.290
And he basically
created Palestine.

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:16.770
He kicked the Jews out of Judea.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:21.480
So this is a situation that
we're very much dealing

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.220
with still to this very day.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:31.180
And in our piece, we address
that, and we work with that.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:38.520
And so certainly,
embarking on this

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.910
with that question
in mind, I was

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:49.350
very worried about how it
would be read, and I still am.

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:52.440
But that being said,
I do feel that--

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.680
and I know that Daniel's
totally on board with me here--

00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:03.210
is that what we are trying
to put forth is that it's not

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:03.910
so much--

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:07.350
I mean, because within our
opera, we talk about the Jews,

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:08.950
but we also talk
about the Nazarenes,

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:10.440
so the early Christians.

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.710
And it's really this whole
concept of monotheism

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:17.010
that is about to
eclipse the pagan world,

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:24.660
and how that, even to this
day, me personally, I feel

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:26.515
was not the best move.

00:53:26.515 --> 00:53:27.305
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:27.305 --> 00:53:29.055
DANIEL MACIVOR:
On that we agree.

00:53:29.055 --> 00:53:30.680
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT:
And I'm happy and I'm

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:36.060
happy to stand
behind that theory.

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:39.680
So I don't agree
with the massacre.

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.060
I'm not condoning anything.

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:46.740
But I do feel that just on a
personal level, that later on,

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:50.700
when Constantine became
Christian and then turned

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:55.110
the entire empire into
a Christian empire,

00:53:55.110 --> 00:54:00.390
for me, that was not a great
day in history, frankly.

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:02.550
And that's an argument
that I'm willing to have.

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:08.040
And I think that this opera kind
of presents that conversation,

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.340
which I think is a
conversation that we're

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:14.145
very much engaged in right now.

00:54:14.145 --> 00:54:16.950
PETER HINTON: And I do think
it's important to state

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:24.630
that this identification of
Canada as a young country is

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:29.190
really, really dubious,
given the many nations

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:34.440
and cultures upon which
Canada was forged, claimed,

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:38.430
and colonized, civilizations
that have been here

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:40.450
for 10,000 years.

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:46.740
So we have our own empire
drama that we're living now.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:51.680
And I think it's very resonant
to Canadians in that regard.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.240
BOB CORNWALL: Yeah, thank you.

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.080
It's fascinating.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.996
I think it's a really
interesting conversation

00:54:56.996 --> 00:54:58.070
and debate.

00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:00.840
And you see that riddled
within the play, which I think

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.770
is fantastic.

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:04.270
DANIEL MACIVOR: Do we get the
wrestling mats and start--

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:05.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:05.050 --> 00:55:06.082
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:55:06.082 --> 00:55:07.790
BOB CORNWALL: I've
got one more question,

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:09.414
we can land on a bit
of a lighter note.

00:55:09.414 --> 00:55:11.460
But I'd love to hear
from each of you.

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.940
I'm super curious-- one,
how are you guys feeling

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:19.050
in this moment the day before
the grand opening tomorrow?

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:21.989
And then two, when the
curtains close tomorrow night,

00:55:21.989 --> 00:55:23.280
how are you going to celebrate?

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.244
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:26.244 --> 00:55:30.420
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: I'm Rufus
Wainwright, I am the composer,

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.665
and I'm shitting bricks.

00:55:31.665 --> 00:55:33.805
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:33.805 --> 00:55:34.980
No, I'm good.

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:37.110
I feel really confident.

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:41.280
And I'm kind of ready
to write the next one,

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.575
just from sheer fright.

00:55:43.575 --> 00:55:45.280
BOB CORNWALL:
Amazing, love that.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.920
And where will you be tomorrow
night when the curtains close?

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.330
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: Oh,
when the curtain closes?

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:48.720
BOB CORNWALL: How are
you going to celebrate?

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.845
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: I'll be
with my wonderful family,

00:55:50.845 --> 00:55:53.460
with my husband, Jorn Weisbrodt,
and my daughter, Viva,

00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:55.710
and my aunts and
uncles and cousins.

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:59.250
They've all come
in from Montreal.

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:01.291
BOB CORNWALL: Fabulous.

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:03.040
DANIEL MACIVOR: My
name is Daniel MacIvor,

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.355
and I'm the librettist.

00:56:04.355 --> 00:56:05.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:08.042
And I am giddy with dread.

00:56:08.042 --> 00:56:08.969
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:08.969 --> 00:56:10.510
Actually, no, I was
giddy with dread.

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:12.010
Actually, after the
dress rehearsal,

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:15.770
I'm feeling like
I'm in the canoe.

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:17.310
I'm just sitting in the canoe.

00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:19.330
I've put the paddles down.

00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:21.580
I'm going to let
the current take me.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.616
And I trust that
it's a good canoe.

00:56:24.616 --> 00:56:27.232
RUFUS WAINWRIGHT: We're not too
far from Niagara Falls, right?

00:56:27.232 --> 00:56:28.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:28.170 --> 00:56:29.670
BOB CORNWALL: Oh,
you're far enough.

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:31.530
DANIEL MACIVOR: We're really
far from Niagara Falls.

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:32.220
It's a lake.

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:34.320
It's just a lake, it'll be fine.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.070
BOB CORNWALL: Tomorrow night,
how are you going to celebrate?

00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:38.570
DANIEL MACIVOR: I'm going to
eat a bowl of popcorn, fuck it.

00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:39.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:42.325
BOB CORNWALL: Amazing.

00:56:42.325 --> 00:56:44.740
PETER HINTON: Well, I'm good.

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.890
A director's job is
different, because I'm

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:51.820
the guy who carries a lot
of it to the finish line.

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.910
And so my job is not over yet.

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:57.040
And we were at the
theater last night

00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.890
till well past midnight,
and had notes today.

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:02.540
And then tomorrow, I'll go
in and continue to work.

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:06.180
So I do feel good.

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.950
And today has been very
interesting for me,

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:12.850
because I got up this
morning exhausted.

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:16.600
And to come to events to
talk about what we're doing

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.330
has been healing for me.

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:24.040
It's been really good for my
spirit to be with my creators

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.840
and to talk about
what we've been doing.

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.240
Because it's so busy there.

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.060
Like, I had this moment
last night after the dress,

00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:33.910
where when it came down and
the curtain call was finished,

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:38.260
I saw Cori and Rufus embrace.

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:39.589
And I went, oh, that's so nice.

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:41.380
Because it was the
first time I'd seen them

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:43.390
after running something
that they didn't have

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:45.270
10 million notes that they--

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:46.160

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:47.030
--towards me.

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:50.500
And I went-- that you
could actually go--

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.730
we did something.

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:52.934
That was so gratifying.

00:57:52.934 --> 00:57:53.850
BOB CORNWALL: Totally.

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:56.030
PETER HINTON: So that's what I
hope to be doing tomorrow night

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:56.930
when it's over.

00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:57.435
BOB CORNWALL: Amazing.

00:57:57.435 --> 00:57:58.518
PETER HINTON: Is be in a--

00:57:58.518 --> 00:57:59.110
[SIGHING]

00:57:59.110 --> 00:57:59.590
BOB CORNWALL: Perfect.

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:00.360
AUDIENCE: In an embrace.

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:00.910
PETER HINTON: In an embrace.

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:02.330
BOB CORNWALL: In an
embrace, I love that.

00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:02.830
Cori?

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:05.370
CORI ELLISON: Well, I'm
Cori, the dramaturg.

00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:07.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:10.660
And the last couple
of weeks have

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.400
been sort of a roller coaster.

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:16.030
I mean, there have been
moments where all you can see

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:20.340
is how much there
still remains to do.

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:22.300
And then there are
moments where you just

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:28.300
sit back and feel like, wow,
the effect that this is creating

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.360
is tremendous.

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.660
And I do, at this
point, especially

00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.690
after last night's
final dress rehearsal,

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:38.590
I feel tremendous
confidence in the fact

00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:43.690
that the audience is going
to be really deeply moved.

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:47.050
Because that's certainly what
we experienced last night.

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:52.450
It was a beautiful
feeling to just feel

00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:55.000
the vibe in the place.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.080
And so afterwards, I
expect to feel relieved,

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:02.890
to feel celebratory, maybe
give Rufus another big hug.

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:04.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:06.160
BOB CORNWALL: That
sounds amazing.

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.350
And Isaiah?

00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:12.550
ISAIAH BELL: Well, every step
of this from when I first

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:15.480
cracked the score to when we had
the first rehearsal, and people

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.200
are first hearing it
that aren't just me

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:20.790
and my coaches, to the
first staging rehearsal,

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.649
to the first rehearsal
with orchestra,

00:59:22.649 --> 00:59:24.940
and then of course last night,
which was the first time

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:26.560
that a wider audience saw it--

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:31.870
every time you think,
OK, this is another step.

00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:36.730
And each time, you're aware
that it's a new hurdle

00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:41.440
to overcome, and also hopefully,
that it's a new sort of arrow

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.480
in your quiver of
telling yourself

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.620
that it's going to be fine.

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:46.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:49.510
But the thing
about performing it

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:52.194
is that so much of
your work, of course,

00:59:52.194 --> 00:59:54.610
is preparation, and all the
work that we've done together,

00:59:54.610 --> 00:59:57.520
and all the discussions we've
had, and all the workshopping.

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:02.200
But the bulk of the work,
really, at this point

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.880
is making sure that
your living energy

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.780
is ready to be the instrument
in the moment from show to show.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:15.832
As you know, as
performers, so you

01:00:15.832 --> 01:00:18.290
can never feel-- like you ask
about celebration afterwards.

01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:23.390
Like of course, if it's a
big success, which we all

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:26.690
expect and hope that it will
be, you're going to be relieved,

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:28.160
and you're going
to have a drink.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.190
My husband's here, and a whole
bunch of my friends are coming.

01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:34.340
But you'll also be looking
forward to the next show,

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.877
and you're not going to be going
out to the bar till 4:00 AM

01:00:36.877 --> 01:00:37.460
and screaming.

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.950
Because the whole process
has to start again

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.750
for me for every show.

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:44.921
Because really, no matter how
many hurdles you've overcome--

01:00:44.921 --> 01:00:46.670
and of course, at this
point in your life,

01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:50.960
to get to this you've done a lot
of work for every step that you

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.496
go past--

01:00:52.496 --> 01:00:53.870
every time you
step on stage, you

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:55.110
have to do it all over again.

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.901
And you have to make
it new all over again.

01:00:56.901 --> 01:01:02.105
And your aliveness is the
string that you're playing on.

01:01:02.105 --> 01:01:03.230
BOB CORNWALL: That's great.

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:06.280
Well, know that we
are all behind you.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.180
And we are sending
positive vibes

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.560
supporting you in this moment.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.040
And we all hope that
tomorrow, in that moment when

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.800
the curtain closes, that feeling
is exactly what you described

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.810
today, and it's
just as delicious

01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:20.930
as it can absolutely get.

01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:23.390
So thank you very much
for joining us today.

01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:24.590
We appreciate your time.

01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:27.640
[APPLAUSE]
