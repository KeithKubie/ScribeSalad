00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.180
DR. JAMES GRIME: Have you ever
heard of the time when they

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.900
tried to redefine pi,
to redefine pi

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.114
so that it was 3.2?

00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:10.080
BRADY HARAN: I'm about to.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.870
DR. JAMES GRIME: Yes, you are.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.540
This is absolutely insane.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.300
It's a true story, as well.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.040
And it's absolutely crazy.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.560
So this happened--

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.210
well, I don't think
that long ago.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.170
It was 1897.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.500
And there was a guy called Edwin
Goodwin, this amateur

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.880
mathematician who thought he had
solved one of the unsolved

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.049
problems of mathematics, a
problem that goes way back to

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.860
ancient Greece.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.640
It was called squaring
the circle.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.750
The problem is can you find a
square that has the same area

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.810
as a circle.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.480
So this problem goes
way, way back.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.670
And it's a favorite problem for
amateur mathematicians.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.170
And this guy thought he had
solved the problem.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.970
But implicitly in his proof,
he had assumed that pi was

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.690
exactly 3.2.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.670
Now, he was so pleased with
his proof, he wanted to

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.340
copyright the proof itself so
that anyone using the proof

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.950
from that point on would have
to pay him royalties.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.360
But he decided that the great
state of Indiana--

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.510
which is where he was from--
that the educational

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.220
establishments of Indiana
could use it for free.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.030
How kind of him.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.270
And so what he did was he
had a bill made up.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.340
And he tried to pass it into law
that would recognize the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.500
mathematical truth that
he had discovered.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.460
But it would allow Indiana
to use it for free.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.340
Though I think he had a friend,
someone he knew, who

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.010
was part of the House of
Representatives in Indiana.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.790
And he made up this bill
saying that the great

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.720
mathematical truth of
squaring the circle.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.920
Now, this bill went through
committees.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.980
It went through the Education
Committee in the House of

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.160
Representatives.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.360
And they obviously didn't know
what they were doing, because

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.350
they passed the bill.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.380
And the representatives
actually passed it

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.360
unanimously, 67 to 0.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.180
They passed it.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.670
Now, this is the weird bit.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.980
On the same day that they were
passing the bill, there was a

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.730
mathematician in the building.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.790
He was there for a completely
different reason.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.570
He was a guy called
Professor Waldo.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.010
But he decided to sit in on
what they were discussing,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.815
because it was about math.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.370
So he was interested.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.050
And he couldn't believe
what he was hearing.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.060
They invited him to meet
Edwin Goodwin.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.230
Oh, do you want to meet Edwin?

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.960
We're very proud of him.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.860
He said, no, I meet enough crazy
people as it is, thank

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.960
you very much.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.600
So this mathematical professor
then decided

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.680
to coach the Senate.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.130
The next thing that happens is
the bill goes from the House

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.140
of Representatives
to the Senate.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.170
So this professor coached the
senators so that they knew

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.410
what they were doing.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.040
By this time, the newspapers
had heard of it.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.670
They were mocking what
was going on.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.340
So when it reached the Senate,
they threw it out.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.860
They threw it out not before
having a bit of fun with it.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.840
They had about half an hour
of maths puns and

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.850
making jokes about it.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.640
Then they threw it out.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.660
But seriously, there
are solutions--

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.390
"solutions"--

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.690
to squaring the circle, where
you take really good

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.990
approximations to pi.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.410
More serious mathematicians--

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.050
for example, Ramanujan, who was
an Indian mathematician,

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.870
and a brilliant one at that--

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.120
he had a solution
to this as well.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.480
So Ramanujan came up with an
approximation which meant that

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.950
if you made a circle with an
area of 140,000 square miles,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.270
then you could have a square
with the same area.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.710
And the sides of the square
would be off just by an inch.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.130
So Edwin Goodwin had
done this in 1897.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.040
And you can see the documents.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.570
It's absolutely true,
this story.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.840
You can look at the documents
yourself.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.160
You can read it.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.450
And it's a strange thing
to happen, as well.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.279
Because the problem he was
trying to solve, squaring the

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.970
circle, was proved to
be impossible 15

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.240
years earlier, in 1882.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.510
So I think we should have a
video about squaring the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.900
circle and what it means.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.060
BRADY HARAN: Shall we do that?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.130
DR. JAMES GRIME: Shall
we do that?

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.250
BRADY HARAN: We'll film that.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.990
We're about to film it now.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.780
Tune in soon.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.380
And we'll show you about
squaring the circle.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.340
DR. JAMES GRIME: Let's have a
look at what you can do with

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.540
rules and compasses.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.570
You can add numbers.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.950
Look.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.970
Here's a line.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.810
And it has length a.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.820
Then I add another
line of length b.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.300
And the whole thing
is a plus b.
