WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.500
We interesting to see,
you know,

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.680
what the next group because they're obviously really different.

3
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:09.030
Like they don't want big giant houses and all that stuff that,
you know,

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:11.540
sort of my generation and your generation thought

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.180
<v 1>that's how you think the new generation is different in their values and what I</v>

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.690
do.

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.460
<v 0>Right.
They say that they,
they give more,
they volunteer more.</v>

8
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:24.390
I think the tricky thing for them is going to be connection and being able to be

9
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:28.980
connected and being able to have a real conversation and uh,

10
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.790
you know,
even be able to concentrate long enough to,

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.990
to be with somebody because of devices.
Yeah.
I mean I think it's far.

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.480
Could you imagine right now if you were 20,
you know,

13
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.980
and being like dating and swiping and trying to pay attention and

14
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.630
<v 1>10,
you know,
my daughter's,</v>

15
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.920
one of the few girls in our closet doesn't have a cell phone.
What's the age of,

16
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.670
did they get,
I'm like [inaudible] I've had them since they were like seven.
No,

17
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:56.390
I mean your kids like what's the rule in your house?
There's a debate.
All right,

18
00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:57.980
now let's figure it out.
Well.
Okay,

19
00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:00.110
so you have a 10 year old going to be an 11 yeah.

20
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:05.111
I think that they say there's like a movement wait til eighth yeah.

21
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:08.840
You heard that like 10 kids in the class.
All the parents agree.

22
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:11.360
So they're not the only person in the class that doesn't have it,

23
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.200
but it's not that way with my daughter's kids.
They're kids in her class.

24
00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:18.530
Most of them have phones.
Most parents just give the kid a phone.
Yeah.

25
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.600
And it's just,
um,
there's a,

26
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.330
have you read any Jonathan hates stuff?
Yeah.

27
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.450
The coddling of the American board of course.
And that,

28
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.000
that is just so disturbing when you see the amount of,

29
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.910
especially young girls that are growing up,
depressed,

30
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.410
cutting themselves self harm,
what does that

31
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.840
<v 0>400% he said like from 10 to 14 or something</v>

32
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.780
<v 1>crazy like that.
Like something insane.</v>

33
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:43.200
Massive spike that directly coincides with the invention of smartphones and

34
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:46.100
social media.
Yeah.
The slot machine.
Yeah.
It's this,

35
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.130
this thing where people were just trying to get likes and trying to leverage

36
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.110
their,
you know,
their social status and,

37
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.980
and try to pretend that they're living in a perfect world to everybody around

38
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:57.540
them and everyone else is doing it.

39
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:00.720
And people look at other people's lives being perfect and they reflect upon

40
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:01.800
their own,
they get depressed.

41
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:05.730
There's just so many factors that kids didn't have to deal with just to a decade

42
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:07.410
or so ago.
It's really,
really

43
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.530
<v 0>right.
Like at least if I had a hard time at school,</v>

44
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:14.820
I could go home and have a reprieve from it at least overnight.
I think for me,

45
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.830
that's been a thing with my kids is like,
especially daughters.

46
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:22.770
I do think,
I understand the gaming is different for boys and porn,

47
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.650
pornography and things like that and not hold trip of rewiring their brain.
And,

48
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.860
but I think with girls it's like,

49
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.990
how do you get them to underst,

50
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.600
like get hear their own voice.

51
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:39.930
I don't know how they're going to get to a place where they,
I mean,
cause every,

52
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.960
it's like this weird mishmash of like me too.

53
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.020
And then never before had people objectify themselves more because they get them

54
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:53.580
that positive affirmation.
Like I always say,
if I put out really smart ideas,
um,

55
00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:56.910
if I'm a young woman,
oh,
I have a thousand followers,

56
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.760
every shot is of my,
but I have 10 million followers.

57
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.700
So we have this mix message going on,

58
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:08.701
which is like I'm angry me to treat me equal simultaneously to,

59
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.520
I'm going to objectify myself in the most hardcore way more than in any time in

60
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:20.200
history.
The results.
And it's really it for me as a female who's,

61
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.370
who understands both those sides a little bit.
Um,
I,

62
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:29.290
it kind of trips me out because I don't think you like those girls,

63
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.860
you know,
playing that card and have no violence should be done to you.

64
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:35.380
And I agree with all of that and no is no and all of that.

65
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.360
But at a certain point,
you know,

66
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:39.520
like you've had Jordan Peterson on her many times.

67
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:41.920
It's like biological signaling.

68
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.890
It's like w w like play a side at least.

69
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.300
And also that,
oh,
that's that one side is super short lived.

70
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.930
That's what I tried to tell my girls.
I'm like,
Yo,
listen,
if you're,
you know,

71
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:56.710
you're pretty girls,
it's great,
but if that's the card you're playing,

72
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.080
your cards done,
but by the time you're 30,
35,
it's done.
It's over.
Um,

73
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.450
you know,
unless you're like 40 and you marry a seven year old,
I don't know,

74
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.020
whatever,
given the MILF porn,
is that such a thing?
Yeah.

75
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.330
Yeah.
But even that,

76
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.140
it's like they've got to put a filter on it and like all that stuff.
I mean,

77
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:18.790
come on.
You know what I mean?
It's like at a certain point,

78
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:23.470
how do you get these girls to go,
hey,
stand up for yourself.
Be Strong.
But like,

79
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.950
what are you doing?
But look at all these people that are not doing that,

80
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:28.810
that are benefiting.
I know,

81
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:31.600
but it's getting them to understand how do you get a 13 year old to talk about

82
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:34.960
the long game,
right?
Yeah.
I mean everything's immediate.

83
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.570
But for me it's like it's culturally,

84
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:41.680
I feel like I'm this weird mix of like the most I came through with the most

85
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:46.340
modern time.
Like women went to school and on scholarships and like we,

86
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.100
we,
there was no thought to being strong.
Not really.

87
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.570
And then,

88
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.040
but then weirdly it's like I feel so kind of old fashioned when I see kind of

89
00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:58.840
this next thing cause I'm like well strong.

90
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:02.980
For me it was something else strong was like you were really physically strong

91
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.860
trying to have a strong mind,
you know,

92
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.140
strong basis of a person and then okay then there was this other side like your

93
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:15.250
femininity,
your sexuality,
all this other stuff.
And now it's like,
I don't know,
I,

94
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:18.550
it's very interesting for a while there's certainly a bunch of different kinds

95
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:21.070
of people,
right?
And there's going to be people that gravitate towards

96
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.400
<v 1>objectifying themselves.
You know,</v>

97
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.640
people that gravitate in this day and age towards,
you know,

98
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.160
you see a lot of people's pages are just filled with motivational quotes and

99
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:32.140
inspirational things and you know,

100
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:36.100
and then stories about people that they meet and photos and you get a lot of

101
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.140
people that are attracted to that kind of stuff too.

102
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:41.050
It's just you're not going to get the immediate gratification of a picture of

103
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:45.220
your ass,
the,
that picture of your ass.
It gets 100,000 likes and like wow,

104
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:47.650
look at all those likes.
And then you know,

105
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.260
it's just a different vibe and you have to decide what do you,

106
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:52.720
after you have to quantity or quality or after.

107
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.890
We try to accurately express how you feel and,
and work it out,

108
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.530
communicating with people and figure out how they react to what you're saying

109
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:03.800
and how you feel about how other people say similar things and how it does good

110
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:04.431
things for you.

111
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:08.600
And you want to do good things for them or do you just want to have,
yeah,

112
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.830
it's a piece of dental floss at the crack of your ass sticking it in front of

113
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.030
the camera.
This,
you know.

114
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.940
<v 0>No,
and I,
I get that.
Like I get also,
like I always say when you're a young woman,</v>

115
00:06:17.941 --> 00:06:20.400
you sort of get this new car and you're like,
well,
what happens?

116
00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:23.880
Like what if I put my foot on the gas?
Like you're sort of checking it all out.

117
00:06:23.881 --> 00:06:27.570
Like they respond like this if I do that,
like that's completely natural.

118
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.520
But then at a certain point,
um,
I don't know that the input is like,

119
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.980
uh,
you know,

120
00:06:34.981 --> 00:06:39.630
like who do you want to be and not based on what everyone thinks about you.

121
00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:41.340
Like what actually turns you on.

122
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.370
And S and s makes you feel excited and stoked because you know,

123
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.660
it's great that you have a nice budget,

124
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.220
but there's a lot of Nice butts and in the end that's not probably gonna

125
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.210
bring you that other feeling.

126
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.330
<v 1>The problem is that there's a thrill to positive reactions.
Absolutely.</v>

127
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.760
And that thrills undeniable.
I would like it.

128
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.280
I'm just too old people.
And when people get that thrill and you tell them,

129
00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:11.590
hey,
that thrills bad for you.
You look fuck off mom.

130
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.890
<v 0>No,
no,
I mean a bolt onto that message.
How about that?
Like get the thrill,</v>

131
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:16.960
but simultaneously to doing the thrill.

132
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.280
Maybe have some other thoughts about where you,

133
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.990
where you like to continue to journey too.
But yeah,

134
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.560
I think when you tell that to a 13 year old,
the here at eventually,
yeah.

135
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.290
I think in the beginning like,
hey,
yeah,
I got this.

136
00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:32.320
And then later when it all goes sideways,
like God damn was to listen to mom.

137
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.370
Yeah.
I think you just got to be it too and have some like cool friends that hang

138
00:07:36.371 --> 00:07:39.520
around you because you're,
if you're the parent it's like,
okay,

139
00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:40.900
you're going to penetrate so much.

140
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:43.660
But if you've got some like you know in Hawaii they call them aunties.

141
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.860
If he got some Badass chicks around you and your daughters are looking,
they see,

142
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.010
they say,
but what if you don't have access to that?

143
00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:54.610
I have a lot of pretty strong,
cool women around me,
but

144
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.420
not that it concerns me.
I don't want to say that.

145
00:07:58.421 --> 00:08:03.150
It's just how do you help the next group,
you know,

146
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.800
try to be a good example,
love on them,

147
00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:10.120
but get them to teach them to love on themselves.
That's all.

148
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:15.310
And I don't mean with eyelash extensions and like perfect things.

149
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:17.270
I mean like love on yourself,
you know?

150
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.460
<v 1>Well that's the other thing too.</v>

151
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:24.410
This is a distortion distortion of natural beauty and you know,

152
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:28.520
make it so that everything has to be artificial.
The color of your lips,

153
00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:33.330
the color of your eye,
shadow,
fake lashes,
everything is just this,

154
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.060
that doesn't,
doesn't look better,
just looks different.

155
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.990
<v 0>Do you think I,
I'm always fascinated what men think.</v>

156
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.280
Like do they even like,
did they,
does it even register?

157
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.680
Do they know what's going on?
In what way?

158
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.030
Well,
I guess we'd have to ask men of that generation if,
let's say they had,

159
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.700
uh,

160
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.590
two groups of women and one that was like perfectly quaffed with the lip

161
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:04.840
injection and quaffed and uh,
is it,

162
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.840
I liked that I'm talking about like eyelash extensions with Joe,
but um,

163
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.080
like just sort of really done like ready for the club,
let's just say.

164
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.780
And then just like a girl,
like,
hi,
I'm a,
you know,

165
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.000
I'm a sweaty runner and now I'm going to go to the office and put my hair up in

166
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:25.080
a ponytail.
I don't know,
whatever.
If guys,
if they even,

167
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.760
can they tell the difference?

168
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.560
I mean it's all

169
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.260
<v 1>what your Auntie,
your Intel.
Yeah.</v>

170
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.660
Some guys just like them soft and made up some guys like I'm sweaty and

171
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.980
muscular.
Yeah.

172
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.990
<v 0>Snow and I get all that.
I love that.
I just mean,
again,</v>

173
00:09:46.991 --> 00:09:50.290
it's hardcore signaling and I guess that's,
maybe that's what it is.

174
00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:53.560
Maybe it's the new biology,
but it's also the,

175
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.640
<v 1>there's never been a time like that.</v>

176
00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.560
A bit on one of my Netflix specials were about this girl who's got just pictures

177
00:10:00.561 --> 00:10:03.320
of her ass shit,
like 9 million followers on Instagram.
I'm like,

178
00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:04.850
there's never been a person like this before.

179
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.220
This is a new kind of person like fuck,
fuck.

180
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.180
Looking at these frogs and the Amazon that no one's going to see there's a new

181
00:10:11.181 --> 00:10:12.080
kind of person.

182
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.770
This girl just has pictures of her butt and she's got a millions of people

183
00:10:15.771 --> 00:10:18.940
staring at her all day long and every day is just new pictures of her.
But

184
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.550
<v 0>it's a great point.
I always am intrigued how they decide like,
oh,</v>

185
00:10:22.551 --> 00:10:26.540
we're going to do the but on the beach now let's do the button next to the
puppy.

186
00:10:26.541 --> 00:10:28.970
It's like,
I'm so confused how they keep getting ideas.

187
00:10:28.971 --> 00:10:32.680
I can't even get ideas for different things.
And it's like,
I know we'll do it,

188
00:10:32.681 --> 00:10:37.550
but with the cotton candy,
it's like,
okay.
I don't know.
I think it becomes a,
uh,

189
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.950
an obsession.
I mean,
I think you have to stay fresh with new bud ideas.
Is that,

190
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.070
or do you have like a,
but that are envelope table editor.
Hey,

191
00:10:46.071 --> 00:10:47.390
let's go on the head.
Uh,

192
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:51.580
but editor here at [inaudible] at [inaudible] dot com I don't know,

193
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:52.730
but if you have a girl

194
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.510
<v 1>who has,</v>

195
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.480
let's say some of these girls have millions and millions of followers and

196
00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:57.420
they're making millions of

197
00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.920
<v 0>dinosaurs,
they're crushing it.
Yeah,</v>

198
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.770
maybe they're actually the smartest people in the room and I haven't caught on

199
00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:05.160
yet.
It's certainly an easy path to finances and I know,
right?

200
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.100
<v 1>If you have a great ass and you're like working out anyway and you just want to</v>

201
00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:11.310
take pictures of it and all of sudden you have 25 million followers,
like damn.

202
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.680
But

203
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.620
<v 0>this goes also,
okay,
what should she do?
Quit that job.</v>

204
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.540
Definitely not cause then when is she going to say,

205
00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:18.280
well I'll do the right thing and work at the library.

206
00:11:18.281 --> 00:11:22.980
I'm not suggesting that it's just,
I mean if it was my kid,
I'd be like,
you know,

207
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.530
sweetie,
you might want to weigh out the economics on this.
Right?

208
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.040
I think you said something really important.
It's a whole new thing.

209
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.590
And I think,
um,

210
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.980
however it's sort of like the communication you're always having,

211
00:11:35.981 --> 00:11:40.390
which is well what is success?
And for me it's,

212
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.810
that's all it's like getting people,
encouraging them,
whatever that is,

213
00:11:43.811 --> 00:11:47.500
whatever that looks like.
You know,
you said this like,
Oh,

214
00:11:47.501 --> 00:11:52.360
you do this show whether anyone was listening or not most likely,
right.
I mean,

215
00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:54.400
until you couldn't it anymore,
let's just say.

216
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:57.970
But obviously I would do it just to have the conversations or do it right.

217
00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.820
<v 1>Maybe I wouldn't do it as much,
but I would definitely do it if I had it.</v>

218
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.630
Like if someone said,
hey,
you know,

219
00:12:03.631 --> 00:12:06.870
every few months a physicist will come in here and sit down with you for three

220
00:12:06.871 --> 00:12:08.670
hours and be like,
yeah,
let's do it.

221
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.710
<v 0>Yeah.
Well you're bringing information to you and learning to you.
So for you,</v>

222
00:12:13.711 --> 00:12:15.740
part of your definition,
that success.
Yeah.

223
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.350
And so I guess that is the conversation,

224
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.740
cause we always have this thing that's obvious thing of like success is it

225
00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:26.100
either his notoriety,
it's power,
it's money.
Um,

226
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.660
and then we forget those other communications about like the pursuit of

227
00:12:30.661 --> 00:12:32.820
something that really genuinely turns you on.

228
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.230
<v 1>Well,
I think people get short sided and you definitely can get success.</v>

229
00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:41.430
We just have money and you just have objects and you have notoriety and people

230
00:12:41.431 --> 00:12:44.400
will view it as success.
But if you're not doing what you love,

231
00:12:44.401 --> 00:12:47.130
it's not pure success.
It's a different kind of success.

232
00:12:47.131 --> 00:12:51.300
Like if you really find something that you enjoy doing and then you take that

233
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.800
like layered has,

234
00:12:52.801 --> 00:12:56.460
was surfing or many people have with their passions and then you become

235
00:12:56.461 --> 00:12:59.300
successful through that.
It's a different existence because it's an,

236
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.320
it's a pure existence.
Like,
uh,
when I,
um,

237
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.360
do stand up comedy or if I do see like a commentary for the UFC,

238
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.620
it's a very,
it's a pure enthusiasm.
It's genuine.

239
00:13:13.621 --> 00:13:17.280
Comes across.
I don't have to fake it.
It's,
I enjoy doing it.

240
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.040
That's to me,
I don't,

241
00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:23.520
I know everybody can't do that or everybody feels like they can't do that or

242
00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:27.420
they haven't figured out a way to do that yet.
Right.
But if you can,
if you can,

243
00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:28.830
if there's a thing that you can do,

244
00:13:28.831 --> 00:13:31.620
like maybe I would have made more money if I went into the stock market,

245
00:13:31.621 --> 00:13:35.000
maybe I would have made more money if I was a banker.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Right.

246
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.800
But I definitely wouldn't be as happy.
There's no way.

247
00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:41.130
If I'm the same person I am now and I was in a fucking office all day,

248
00:13:41.131 --> 00:13:43.320
making a hundred times as much money,
I'd be miserable.

249
00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.750
<v 0>Right.
And I think that,</v>

250
00:13:44.751 --> 00:13:48.140
I guess for me that's maybe when I see the thing with the girls and like I said,

251
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.920
feeling sensitive to it because I have daughters or just young people in
general.

252
00:13:51.921 --> 00:13:55.280
It's that conversation of like,
you know,

253
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:59.000
just keeping that definition of success open.
And by the way,

254
00:13:59.001 --> 00:14:01.100
this other path that taking it,

255
00:14:01.101 --> 00:14:05.210
like following your own instincts or desires or passions,

256
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:09.140
there's elements to that that are,
our heart are harder for sure.

257
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.340
It's more unknown.
You can feel insecure.
Like is this the right thing to do?

258
00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.413
I mean,
we've gone,

259
00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.990
I mean in our house we've gone through that 50 different times.
You know?

260
00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:20.600
It's like,
I'm going to do this cause I really want to.

261
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.390
I don't know what's going to happen and I don't know if it's going to be

262
00:14:23.391 --> 00:14:25.550
successful.
I might even lose money.
Who knows?

263
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:30.800
But that once you start to do it or you do it once or twice,

264
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.610
then you go,
oh,
but it's so worth trying.
