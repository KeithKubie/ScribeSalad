00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.380
SPEAKER: As a news
publisher, you

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.420
know that many readers are using
their smartphones and tablets

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.820
to access news.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.700
To be successful
in this space, you

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.780
need a strong mobile
strategy, which

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.470
starts with building
a high quality app.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.460
We've gathered 10
tips to help you

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.460
with the design and
development of a good news app.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.136
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.280
1, develop a native app.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.700
The best apps in the
Android ecosystem all

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.350
have one thing in common.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.940
They're developed as native.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.860
They have great in-app
navigation and support native

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.830
gestures.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.880
They benefit from the potential
of full material design.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.710
And compared to web view,
the UX is really responsive.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.920
2, run your apps instantly
without installation.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.510
When you build a
native app, you'll

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.750
be able to extend
it to run instantly

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.080
without requiring
user installation,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.319
using Android Instant Apps.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.530
Android Instant
Apps will let users

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.230
access your app via an URL,
even if it isn't installed

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.200
on their device, bringing users
into your app more quickly.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.860
You modularize your
app, and Google Play

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.080
will download only the parts
that are needed on the fly.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.870
For users, it will be
a seamless experience,

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.200
from launching the
app to signing in,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.370
to making a payment.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.900
3, create a simple, yet
targeted, user experience.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.010
An easy to use
app brings readers

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.280
to news that interest
them quickly,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.570
with a clear and
straightforward navigation,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.530
users can easily discover
what they want in your app,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.150
and they'll return more often
to check the latest news

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.750
or explore stories.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.107
Let readers customize
categories and sections

00:01:50.107 --> 00:01:51.315
according to their interests.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.200
4, use material
design principles

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.770
to create a sense
of familiarity.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.310
It's important to support
the navigation structure

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.840
with simple material
design integrations

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.009
that the user will recognize
from other Android apps.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.240
Organize content
into a hierarchy that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.940
matches your reader's
expectations and place

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.125
content in a navigation drawer.

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:19.380
Use tabs so readers
can explore one section

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.770
and still see what's
available elsewhere,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.160
or use in-page lists to show
related articles or comments.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.550
Utilize a floating action
button to support key features

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.217
that matter in your app,
like a sharing action.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.260
5, make it easy for readers
to share your content.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.210
Shared personal
recommendations can

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.950
be a successful way of bringing
in new audiences to your app.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.330
Benefit from word of
mouth distribution

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.320
by adding an easy share action
to content so readers can share

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.430
with friends, family,
and colleagues,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.770
and set up deep linking so the
share directs the recipient

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.720
to the content within your app.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.960
The desire to find
content to share

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.100
drives readers to explore
more detailed content,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.345
increasing reader engagement.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.045
6, make some content
available offline.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.280
Newspapers are often
read on trains, subways,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.890
and airplanes, places with
little to no data connection.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.360
Implementing a cache
for offline reading

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.440
helps make content
available in these places.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.980
You can also provide
a read later option

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.910
to cache selected pages.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.660
If you want to reach
your readers whenever

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.620
they want to consume
your content,

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.478
then offering this
service is crucial.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.560
7, re-engage your readers
with rich notifications.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.130
Think of Android
notifications as extensions

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.050
of your apps interface.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.280
They're a way for
readers to navigate back

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.800
to your app, even when
they're not using it.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.960
Offer readers notifications
for breaking news, as well

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.650
as personalized notifications
for news that interests them.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.690
Take advantage of
rich notifications

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.630
to bring stories to
life with images.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.440
Give readers control
over the amount

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.510
of notifications they receive.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.060
Make it possible to turn them
off and use the topics feature,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.315
a Firebase Cloud Messaging to
send notifications in bulk.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.909
8, optimize your
app for tablets.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.020
Tablets now play a huge
part in news consumption.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.010
Users read longer articles
and view more videos

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.160
and image galleries on tablet.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.450
By optimizing for
tablet users, you're

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.340
likely to get more
engaged readers who

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.270
consume more content.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.370
Consider content that makes
use of a tablets' bigger screen

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.440
size, and ensure all
fonts are adjusted,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.390
and the text is legible.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.740
Use compound views and
multi-pane layout UIs

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.165
to organize content so it's
easier for readers to view.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.350
9, request readers
permissions at runtime.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.590
Avoid asking the
user for permissions

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.720
by designing your app so it
simply doesn't need them.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.790
If you can't avoid
using them, at least

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.080
make sure no unnecessary
permissions are requested.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.280
Beginning in Android 6.0,
users grab permissions to apps,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.070
while the app is running,
not when they install it.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.410
Help your readers understand
why your app needs a permission

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.190
by providing an
explanation when needed.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.170
For example, if you want to
provide local news to readers

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.130
in a specific area, ask
their location permission

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.600
in that context so they'll
understand the benefit.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.140
Keep in mind that you don't
want to overwhelm your users

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.694
with too many explanations.

00:05:37.694 --> 00:05:39.360
That might push them
to remove your app.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.490
10, onboard your
readers effectively.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.320
Implement an onboarding
flow for new readers

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.380
and for all readers when
you introduce a new feature.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.270
By providing a tutorial
when your app starts,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.020
readers can gain an appreciation
of its features faster.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.790
Keep the tutorial short.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.820
Once it's over, give
readers the option

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.480
to customize the app settings,
like notifications or home

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.920
screen options.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.540
Let the reader skip
the onboarding flow,

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.201
but give the option to watch the
tutorial on demand at any time.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.670
Head over to Google
Play Developer

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.960
Console to start taking
advantage of these features.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.720
If you want more tips on how
to improve your news apps
