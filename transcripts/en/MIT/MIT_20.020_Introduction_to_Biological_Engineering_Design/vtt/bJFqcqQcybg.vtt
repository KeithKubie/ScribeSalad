00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:11.226
&gt;&gt; Sally: Dude!

00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:12.756
No running in the laboratory.

00:00:12.756 --> 00:00:15.546
&gt;&gt; Dude: Sorry Sally, but have
you heard about this competition?

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:19.896
It's called iGEM and I think my bacterial
bubble could totally win this year.

00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:22.136
&gt;&gt; Sally: I thought you were
done with bacterial bubbles.

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:23.746
What do you know about iGEM?

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:28.646
&gt;&gt; Dude: Uh, not much, except that there's
going to be a bunch of losers and me.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.366
&gt;&gt; Sally: I don't think you understand
the nature of this competition.

00:00:31.696 --> 00:00:35.356
iGEM, the International Genetically
Engineered Machine Competition,

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:40.666
is a way to get young scientists and engineers
working together to engineer biological systems.

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:41.606
&gt;&gt; Dude: Working together?

00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:43.326
Where's the competitive spirit in that?

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.166
The Dude works alone.

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.906
That way, the Dude gets all the credit.

00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:52.006
&gt;&gt; Sally: You need to be a member of a team to
join iGEM, and you need a professor to lead it.

00:00:52.076 --> 00:00:53.976
&gt;&gt; Dude: But I heard it was
a student competition?

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:54.856
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well, yes.

00:00:54.856 --> 00:01:00.766
The competition started in 2004 based on an
undergraduate class developed at MIT in 2003

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:05.066
for their short winter session, and it
continues to be an undergraduate experience.

00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:07.186
But not without guidance and support.

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:11.056
Last year there were more than thirty teams
who competed, from all over the world.

00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:13.866
&gt;&gt; Dude: So that's my competition?

00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:15.246
That's a lot of people.

00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:17.936
&gt;&gt; Sally: A lot of people,
all asking the same question.

00:01:17.936 --> 00:01:21.316
"Can simple biological systems
be built from standard,

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:24.756
interchangeable parts and
operate in living cells?

00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:29.156
Or is biology simply too complicated
to be engineered in this way?"

00:01:29.446 --> 00:01:30.186
What do you think?

00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:33.086
&gt;&gt; Dude: Biology's not too complicated for me!

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:41.136
The goals of this competition are to enable
systematic engineering of biology, promote open

00:01:41.276 --> 00:01:44.476
and transparent development of
tools for engineering biology,

00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:50.586
and help construct a society that can
productively apply biological technology.

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:54.206
OK, I've got a lot of work ahead of me.

00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:58.286
If we're not going to use my
bubble idea, what else is possible?

00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:01.596
&gt;&gt; Sally: Maybe a better question
would be what isn't possible.

00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:05.536
&gt;&gt; Dude: Ok, so first off: What should
our standard, interchangeable part be?

00:02:05.536 --> 00:02:06.816
Actually, what parts exist?

00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:07.816
Do we have to make those?

00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:10.566
&gt;&gt; Sally: You'll probably need
more than one but the Registry

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:15.286
of Standard Biological Parts is a great
resource with lots of parts already designed.

00:02:15.286 --> 00:02:18.076
And if we make parts of our own,
we should add them to the Registry

00:02:18.126 --> 00:02:19.936
in case other teams can use them too.

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:22.026
&gt;&gt; Dude: And help the other teams?

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:23.716
What kind of competition is that?

00:02:24.356 --> 00:02:28.796
Or is that how so many teams got cool projects
going last year?: Pleasant smelling bacteria,

00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:31.586
a bacterial night-light, a
DNA drug delivery system.

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:34.746
I heard one team even made
up bacterial freeze tag!

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:37.366
To beat those, we should get started right now!

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:41.286
&gt;&gt; Sally: Alright well let's brainstorm for a
little while before I have to get back to work.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.176
How does that sound?

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:43.096
&gt;&gt; Dude: Great!

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:45.016
Can you show me this Registry?

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:47.666
Maybe we can find some good parts to use!

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:48.916
&gt;&gt; Sally: Good idea, Dude.

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:54.646
Let's start there.
