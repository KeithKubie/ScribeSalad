00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.240
How’s your summer going?

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.320
Did you spend a lot of time in the pool?

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.119
Have fond memories of the ol’ swimmin’
hole?

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:08.629
Well, let me retroactively ruin them.

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:09.870
Pools are gross.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.209
The thing about water is some pathogens absolutely
thrive in it.

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.590
Harmful viruses, bacteria, and protozoa can
be transmitted from one person to another

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.580
by way of pool water.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.779
Over 14 years, health officials from 46 states
and Puerto Rico reported almost 500 outbreaks

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.460
linked to treated recreational water, causing
more than 27,000 illnesses and eight deaths.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.600
Since many people don’t go to a doctor when
they’re sick, and it’s difficult to test

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.470
water for contaminants after an outbreak,
those numbers could be higher still.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.680
Now, you may be thinking that a lot of these
outbreaks were caused by pools that weren’t

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.450
treated properly, and it’s true that does
happen remarkably often.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.150
A 2016 CDC study found 80% of public pools
had health and safety violations.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.380
Eighty percent!

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.540
One in eight facilities failed their inspections
so badly they were closed immediately.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.829
Undertreated pools can lead to tragedy, like
in 1998 when seven swimmers who shared a pool

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.009
with a child with E. coli were hospitalized,
resulting in one death.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.890
E. coli outbreaks like that can be prevented
by properly treating pools with our dear old

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.079
friend, chlorine.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.030
The chlorine that’s added to pools, either
in the form of hypochlorous acid or hypochlorite

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.549
ions, reacts with the lipids in a microorganism’s
cell walls or enzymes inside the cells and

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.640
kills them (which is good).

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.460
But, chlorine also reacts with ammonia in
things like sweat and pee.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.380
This results in chloramines, which are responsible
for that pool smell.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.509
It also means there’s less free chlorine
available to kill friggin’ E. coli!

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.450
That’s right, that “chlorine smell”
and your red irritated eyes actually mean

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.840
a pool is under chlorinated, not over chlorinated!

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.100
A properly treated pool has no smell.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.100
Yeah.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.100
NONE.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.869
But even if a pool is chlorinated, some pathogens
can survive, like Cryptosporidium.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.759
This single-celled parasite has an outer shell
that makes it resistant to chlorine.

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.590
It’s the leading cause of waterborne disease
in the US, and symptoms include abdominal

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.960
pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.720
That last symptom is also bad for pool goers.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.270
Diarrhea is almost always caused by some infectious
microorganism, and people can spread it in

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.500
pools up to two weeks after the symptoms subside.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.060
Then all it takes is for another swimmer to
inadvertently swallow some infected pool water

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.280
and start the cycle anew.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.970
Even if people haven’t had diarrhea, they
can still shed poop and it’s associated

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.270
pathogens into the pool.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.090
One study found that the average person -- that
is, you and me -- has about 0.14 grams of

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.350
poop on our stinky bums.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.592
That’s about the weight of one pea.

00:02:50.592 --> 00:02:52.940
A pea’s worth of poop.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.430
I love that I get paid to say this stuff.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.090
Fortunately, it’s not hard to avoid becoming
a disease vector.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.041
How many people don’t shower before getting
in a pool because they figure the pool will

00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:06.080
wash them off?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.540
Well turns out we were wrong.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.460
Showering before swimming is a good way to
clean up our gross butts for everyone’s

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.460
benefit.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.780
It also washes away sweat, so the chlorine
won’t react with it.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.150
I can’t believe I have to say this, but
you should also avoid peeing the pools.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.740
One survey found that one out of five people
admit to peeing in pools while four out of

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.220
five people are liars, I’m assuming.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.660
Pee also has ammonia in it that will use up
free chlorine, making the pool smell bad and

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.200
be less safe.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.180
Avoid swallowing the water as best you can.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.980
And lastly if you’ve had diarrhea in the
last two weeks, do us all a favor and suntan

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.530
or read a book while the rest of us enjoy
Cryptosporidium-free water.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.870
Have a great summer!

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.630
Not all microbes are bad… for example your
gut is filled with them.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.580
They’re just controlling your mind, no big
deal.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.630
Watch Maren’s video to understand how!

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.810
And one last thing, I don’t have a cool
fun fact, but have you thought about how often

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.050
we empty pools and scrub them down?

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.050
How often.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:13.230
Yeah, maybe just try not to think about it.
