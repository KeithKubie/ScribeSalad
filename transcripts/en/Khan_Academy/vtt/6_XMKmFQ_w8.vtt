00:00:00.387 --> 00:00:02.717
- [Voiceover] When we look at
all of the living diversity

00:00:02.717 --> 00:00:03.913
around us,

00:00:03.913 --> 00:00:05.386
then a natural question is,

00:00:05.386 --> 00:00:10.283
well, how related are the
difference species to each other?

00:00:10.283 --> 00:00:12.996
And if you put that into
an evolutionary context,

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:15.536
relatedness should be tied to

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:20.494
how recent did two species
share a common ancestor.

00:00:20.494 --> 00:00:22.923
And what we're going to
try to do in this video

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:26.409
is construct a tree for
showing how different species

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.716
evolved from common ancestors,

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:29.556
and we're gonna do it

00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:32.423
based on some of these
observable traits that we see.

00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:34.772
But this is going to be a
huge oversimplification.

00:00:34.772 --> 00:00:36.301
I'm only doing it with five species

00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:38.379
and five very simple traits.

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.824
As we'll see, or as we'll
talk about in future videos,

00:00:41.824 --> 00:00:43.995
this can be done in a
much more complex way,

00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:45.406
and that's what biologists would do.

00:00:45.406 --> 00:00:47.517
They would look at much
more than five traits,

00:00:47.517 --> 00:00:51.186
and they would look at molecular evidence,

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:55.016
molecular evidence in terms
of protein differences,

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:57.323
in terms of DNA differences,

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.271
to really start to build out

00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:01.795
what we call a phylogenetic tree.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:02.664
So let me write this down.

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:04.623
That's what we're going to create.

00:01:04.623 --> 00:01:05.706
Phylogenetic,

00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:08.850
genetic,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.290
tree.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.457
Phylo comes from the Greek
for group or kind or tribe,

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:18.208
and then genetic comes, you know,

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:20.626
related to the word "genesis."

00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:21.827
How do these things come about?

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:23.180
How do the different groups or tribes,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.821
or in this case, how do the
different species come about?

00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:28.649
Well, when you're trying
to make one of these trees,

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.016
it's important to realize
that this is a hypothesis,

00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:32.400
but you're, like always,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.412
trying to come up with
the simplest hypothesis

00:01:34.412 --> 00:01:38.300
that can explain the observations
that you actually see.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.378
And when we look at these,

00:01:39.378 --> 00:01:41.817
at least the species
that we have listed here,

00:01:41.817 --> 00:01:43.968
it looks like there's one
that is more different

00:01:43.968 --> 00:01:45.474
than all the other ones.

00:01:45.474 --> 00:01:48.827
The lamprey here does not
have any of these five traits

00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:50.656
that we are observing.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:53.642
So this, we would call the out group.

00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:55.745
The lamprey is the outgroup.

00:01:55.745 --> 00:01:56.616
And a lot of times

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.934
when you need to construct
a phylogenetic tree,

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:00.253
they might provide you something,

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:02.106
with something that is
clearly an outgroup.

00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:04.331
Here it doesn't have any
of these observable traits.

00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:07.297
And sometimes, if we're
looking at genetic differences,

00:02:07.297 --> 00:02:11.157
it might have the largest
number of genetic differences

00:02:11.157 --> 00:02:12.845
relative to everything else.

00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:15.132
And so it makes sense,

00:02:15.132 --> 00:02:18.329
the simplest hypothesis
is its common ancestor

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.140
is most distant into the
past with everything else.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.251
And so let me start to draw this tree.

00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:28.501
So I'm going to put deep into the past,

00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:34.321
so deep into the past, there
is a branching out point

00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:38.569
where you have the common
ancestor of the lamprey

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.902
and everything else we see here.

00:02:40.902 --> 00:02:43.716
So eventually, you have
that common ancestor,

00:02:43.716 --> 00:02:46.553
and there's many, many
species along the way,

00:02:46.553 --> 00:02:48.687
and eventually, we get,

00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:51.437
we get a lamprey in present time.

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:54.569
In present time.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.933
And so the next thing to
think about is, alright,

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:59.676
well how did everything
else end up branching?

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:02.340
Well, what's common about everything else

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.022
that maybe wasn't common
about the lamprey?

00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:08.087
Well, one common thing is
we see that everything else,

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:11.391
at least that we have
listed here, have jaws.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.480
And so it's reasonable to say, alright,

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.279
we have this common ancestor,

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.321
between the lamprey and everything else

00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:20.809
at this branching point right over here,

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:24.300
and then it branched off
into multiple species,

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.793
and one of those species
must have evolved jaws.

00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:31.841
So let me put jaws right over here.

00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.462
So jaws right over there.

00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:36.108
And jaws, that's called,

00:03:36.108 --> 00:03:38.668
jaws are considered a derived trait.

00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:42.447
This ancestral species at
this root did not have jaws,

00:03:42.447 --> 00:03:43.348
we're assuming,

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:47.039
but at some point, they
evolved, and they stuck around

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.594
because they proved to be
favorable in certain environments.

00:03:50.594 --> 00:03:52.924
Or it could have even been
things like genetic drift,

00:03:52.924 --> 00:03:54.756
who knows, but I'm guessing
that it was favorable

00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:56.249
in certain environments.

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.989
So let's see, let's see if we
can classify everyone else.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.959
So now, out of the four, so we've,

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.679
let's actually cross out the lamprey

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:03.899
just for simplification

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:06.089
since we've already
classified that character.

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:07.571
Now of everyone else,

00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.192
we've already thought
about everyone's got jaws,

00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:13.345
so now let's go to the
next most common trait.

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:16.012
So, and actually, let me
cross out the jaws too,

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:18.545
just for, keep things simple.

00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:21.941
So we can do that a little bit cleaner.

00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:23.877
So I'm gonna cross out the jaws.

00:04:23.877 --> 00:04:25.243
And now, let's see,

00:04:25.243 --> 00:04:28.366
the next most common trait are the lungs,

00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:32.036
but not every species that
we have left has lungs.

00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:34.674
The sea bass does not have lungs.

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:37.549
It does not breathe air
the way that animals

00:04:37.549 --> 00:04:39.703
that live outside of
the water breathe air.

00:04:39.703 --> 00:04:42.620
And so the next point of divergence

00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:46.634
must be between the sea bass

00:04:46.634 --> 00:04:49.024
and everything that we have left over.

00:04:49.024 --> 00:04:50.792
So let me draw that.

00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:52.150
So,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.811
now once again, I said, "must be."

00:04:53.811 --> 00:04:54.935
This is a hypothesis.

00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:57.237
I think it's a reasonable hypothesis.

00:04:57.237 --> 00:04:59.203
So let me draw that.

00:04:59.203 --> 00:05:00.483
So

00:05:00.483 --> 00:05:01.816
this is the sea,

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:04.595
sea bass.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.400
And there's a common
ancestor between the sea bass

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.075
and everything else, and the antelope,

00:05:11.075 --> 00:05:12.808
the bald eagle, and the alligator.

00:05:12.808 --> 00:05:15.889
And at some point, that
common ancestor diverged

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.582
into multiple species,

00:05:17.582 --> 00:05:21.749
and one of those child species
must have evolved lungs.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.047
So lungs must have evolved at some point,

00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:31.540
but we're assuming that
that wasn't on this lineage

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.066
for the sea bass.

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:33.899
And once again,

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:35.476
I'm just trying to find
the simplest explanation.

00:05:35.476 --> 00:05:37.485
There might have been some situation where

00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:41.172
maybe lungs evolved and then
went away at some point.

00:05:41.172 --> 00:05:43.748
You reverted to an ancestral form.

00:05:43.748 --> 00:05:46.811
But we like to go with
the simplest explanation.

00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:50.452
This is a property that
biologists will also often call

00:05:50.452 --> 00:05:53.451
parsimony, and actually,
let me write this down.

00:05:53.451 --> 00:05:55.937
Parsimony, which in everyday
language, means cheap.

00:05:55.937 --> 00:05:57.735
When someone tells you
that you're parsimonious,

00:05:57.735 --> 00:06:00.230
it's a nice sounding word, but
it means that you are cheap.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.184
But parsimony, in this context,

00:06:02.184 --> 00:06:05.902
say hey, we're trying to
be cheap with complexity.

00:06:05.902 --> 00:06:08.201
We're trying to be as simple as possible

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.395
in our explanation of what's going on.

00:06:10.395 --> 00:06:12.590
But anyway, let's go back
to what we were doing.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.649
So we've already put into consideration,

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:17.893
we have already talked
about the sea bass here,

00:06:17.893 --> 00:06:21.232
and we have already talked about lungs.

00:06:21.232 --> 00:06:22.952
Alright, so what do we have left?

00:06:22.952 --> 00:06:24.771
So we have to talk about the antelope,

00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:29.477
the bald eagle, the alligator,
and gizzards and fur.

00:06:29.477 --> 00:06:31.763
Alright, it looks like the
bald eagle and alligator

00:06:31.763 --> 00:06:33.118
have a gizzard.

00:06:33.118 --> 00:06:35.054
The antelope has fur,

00:06:35.054 --> 00:06:36.243
oh and actually, we haven't talked about

00:06:36.243 --> 00:06:39.704
the bald eagle and
feathers as yet, either.

00:06:39.704 --> 00:06:42.613
Alright, so it is possible.

00:06:42.613 --> 00:06:45.660
So let's make the next thing between,

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.390
well, we could do it this way.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.153
And once again, I'm trying
to do this in real time,

00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:52.385
something that seems,

00:06:52.385 --> 00:06:54.718
so let's make a branch here.

00:06:56.621 --> 00:06:59.699
And let's say that that is the branch for,

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.564
now let's say that's the
branch for the bald eagle.

00:07:02.564 --> 00:07:03.897
Say, "B. Eagle."

00:07:05.155 --> 00:07:06.770
That's the branch for the bald eagle,

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.970
and let's see if I can construct one

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.465
that will explain the differences
between the bald eagle,

00:07:10.465 --> 00:07:13.132
the antelope, and the alligator.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.924
Well, the bald eagle and the alligator

00:07:15.924 --> 00:07:17.021
have something in common.

00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:18.589
They have a gizzard in common.

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:20.021
So let me make a branching point.

00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:21.667
Make them a little bit closer

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:25.158
than the bald eagle is to the antelope.

00:07:25.158 --> 00:07:26.658
So let me do that.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.389
So let me put the alligator there,

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:32.595
and then I'm gonna talk about

00:07:32.595 --> 00:07:35.229
when we get these derived traits.

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:36.062
So that is

00:07:37.148 --> 00:07:38.690
the alligator.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.891
And obviously, I could
have written the alligator

00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:41.341
on this side and the
bald eagle on that side,

00:07:41.341 --> 00:07:42.208
or I could've rotated,

00:07:42.208 --> 00:07:44.402
I could rotate at any one
of these branching points.

00:07:44.402 --> 00:07:47.206
And then what we would
have left is the antelope.

00:07:47.206 --> 00:07:48.181
Now let's see if I can account

00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:50.510
for all of these derived traits.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.343
Antelope.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.468
Alright.

00:07:53.468 --> 00:07:55.584
So we have the common
ancestor of the sea bass,

00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:58.164
the bald eagle, the alligator,
and antelope right over here.

00:07:58.164 --> 00:07:59.734
We have a branching point.

00:07:59.734 --> 00:08:01.318
At some point, the lungs,

00:08:01.318 --> 00:08:04.901
we're hypothesizing
evolved in this branch.

00:08:06.072 --> 00:08:07.140
And then this branch,

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.964
well let's say that this branch,

00:08:08.964 --> 00:08:10.654
this is the common ancestor

00:08:10.654 --> 00:08:13.140
between the antelope,
alligator, and bald eagle.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.108
And a common ancestor of the
bald eagle and alligator,

00:08:16.108 --> 00:08:18.321
they have to get the gizzard.

00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:21.976
So let's put the gizzard
down right over here.

00:08:21.976 --> 00:08:23.088
This is where the gizzard,

00:08:23.088 --> 00:08:25.099
this is our hypothesis.

00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:27.050
Doing the same color as,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.883
so that's the gizzard.

00:08:30.206 --> 00:08:31.039
Gizzard

00:08:32.065 --> 00:08:33.282
right over there.

00:08:33.282 --> 00:08:36.680
And so everything that
descended from that ancestor

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.100
that had the gizzard,

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.850
well, they're going to have gizzards.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:40.683
That's what we're assuming,

00:08:40.683 --> 00:08:42.360
but once again, that can be lost.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.110
This is a hypothesis.

00:08:45.225 --> 00:08:47.433
And so we have accounted for the gizzard.

00:08:47.433 --> 00:08:48.425
Let me,

00:08:48.425 --> 00:08:50.857
let me cross that out.

00:08:50.857 --> 00:08:52.715
So we have accounted for the gizzard.

00:08:52.715 --> 00:08:53.548
And so let's see,

00:08:53.548 --> 00:08:55.275
we have to account for the feathers,

00:08:55.275 --> 00:08:58.309
and the bald eagle is the
only one that has feathers.

00:08:58.309 --> 00:08:59.846
So let me put that here.

00:08:59.846 --> 00:09:01.796
So at some point, you
have a common ancestor

00:09:01.796 --> 00:09:03.563
of an alligator and a bald eagle.

00:09:03.563 --> 00:09:05.562
It branches off into multiple species,

00:09:05.562 --> 00:09:09.312
one of which gets a
feather or gets feathers.

00:09:10.835 --> 00:09:13.236
And once again, you know,
that could have branched off

00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:14.333
into many, many things,

00:09:14.333 --> 00:09:15.166
'cause we know that the bald eagle

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:16.753
isn't the only species with feathers.

00:09:16.753 --> 00:09:17.596
But the bald eagle, for sure,

00:09:17.596 --> 00:09:19.852
is a species that has feathers.

00:09:19.852 --> 00:09:23.913
And let's see, so we've
accounted for the feathers now.

00:09:23.913 --> 00:09:25.054
Feathers.

00:09:25.054 --> 00:09:27.174
And now, we just have
to account for the fur,

00:09:27.174 --> 00:09:28.555
the fur of the antelope.

00:09:28.555 --> 00:09:31.358
And so, we don't know where
this could have happened.

00:09:31.358 --> 00:09:33.052
We might wanna look for more evidence

00:09:33.052 --> 00:09:35.061
to come up with a good hypothesis.

00:09:35.061 --> 00:09:37.061
But some place along this right branch,

00:09:37.061 --> 00:09:38.231
we could put,

00:09:38.231 --> 00:09:40.116
we could put the fur.

00:09:40.116 --> 00:09:41.136
And so there you have it.

00:09:41.136 --> 00:09:43.919
This is actually a
reasonable phylogenetic tree.

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:47.002
I practiced the practice of parsimony

00:09:48.194 --> 00:09:50.006
to come up with the simplest explanation,

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.943
but there are more
complicated explanations.

00:09:51.943 --> 00:09:52.776
And we don't know,

00:09:52.776 --> 00:09:54.343
some of those more
complicated explanations

00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:56.343
could very well be true.

00:09:57.306 --> 00:09:58.413
But from this,

00:09:58.413 --> 00:10:01.535
we have a very quick and
easy graphical representation

00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:04.905
of how related different species could be

00:10:04.905 --> 00:10:07.556
and where they share common ancestors.

00:10:07.556 --> 00:10:09.212
So bald eagle and an alligator,

00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:10.725
based on this phylogenetic tree,

00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:12.229
we would say are more related

00:10:12.229 --> 00:10:14.487
than a bald eagle is to an antelope.

00:10:14.487 --> 00:10:17.870
They have a more, the bald
eagle and the alligator,

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.308
have a more common common ancestor,

00:10:20.308 --> 00:10:22.611
or more recent common ancestor right there

00:10:22.611 --> 00:10:26.756
than both of their common
ancestors with the antelope,

00:10:26.756 --> 00:10:28.312
and that would make them more related.

00:10:28.312 --> 00:10:29.795
And if we were doing this for real,

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:31.645
we would wanna look at genetic evidence

00:10:31.645 --> 00:10:34.020
and look at the various proteins

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.688
and say, okay, does that back this up?

00:10:36.688 --> 00:10:38.943
Are the bald eagle and alligator's DNA,

00:10:38.943 --> 00:10:40.745
do they have more in
common with each other

00:10:40.745 --> 00:10:44.832
than they do with the
DNA, say, of an antelope?

00:10:44.832 --> 00:10:47.992
And many, for especially
once you get complex,

00:10:47.992 --> 00:10:49.402
there could be many
different explanations,

00:10:49.402 --> 00:10:51.813
and we just wanna get more
and more and more evidence

00:10:51.813 --> 00:10:55.146
to keep refining our phylogenetic trees.
