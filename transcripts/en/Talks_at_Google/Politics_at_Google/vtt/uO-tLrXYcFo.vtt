[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.550
PETER BARRON: So great
to have Steve here.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.843
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Thank you.

00:00:07.843 --> 00:00:08.109
PETER BARRON: I
don't know if you've

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.650
had a chance to look
at the book yet,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.690
but it's a splendid
book, which we're

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.332
going to talk about for
the next 45 minutes or so.

00:00:15.332 --> 00:00:17.790
I was trying to sort of work
out what kind of a book it is.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.710
It's not quite a
coffee table book.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.092
I think it's more sort of
downstairs toilet book.

00:00:23.092 --> 00:00:24.800
If you're not from
Britain, you might not

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.008
understand the concept of
the downstairs toilet book.

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.550
But it's got some great
examples and some great pictures

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.020
of protests and mischievous
protests down the years.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.490
So that's the cover.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.410
Steve, tell us
what's going on there

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.540
and really what the idea
behind the book was.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.192
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
Yes, so the cover,

00:00:41.192 --> 00:00:43.650
which I was so happy because
it goes exactly with the title

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.470
that we'd already chosen
of "Street Spirit."

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.200
And that happens to be
from Germany, from Rostock

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.836
in Germany, a meeting of the
G8 governments coming together,

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:53.960
and people were protesting.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.970
And often the protesting is kind
of it's just it is what it is.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.550
But this element of mischief
and people dressing up as clowns

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.425
and here's something
really serious going on.

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:03.039
The people were looking very--

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.830
and the clowns are just
making a little bit

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.910
of a mischievous
element to that.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.630
And if you like, just
parodying as they go along.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.930
Now as it happens, that is
within functioning democracy

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.520
and there was nothing
really that bad

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.110
that was going on at that time.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.020
But exactly that kind of
mischief and creative mischief

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.170
is what we see in authoritarian
and repressive places

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.780
around the world, and with
incredible impact quite often.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.800
PETER BARRON: Yeah,
I mean, just reading

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.341
the book it kind of struck me
that what you're really talking

00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:30.450
about is postmodern protesting.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.920
In some cases, literally sort
of postmodern protesting.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.280
It's sort of looking into
the dynamics of a protest,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.097
how authorities
respond to the protest,

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.930
and then how people
respond to the response.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.567
And it's very
fascinating, I think.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.150
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: I
guess that's right.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.149
I mean, one of the things
that is so interesting

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.190
is that clearly
protests, if there's

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.730
lots of people, that's going
to be a more effective protest

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.804
than if fewer people.

00:01:50.804 --> 00:01:52.470
But one of the things
that interested me

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.250
so much over the years is that
little bit of the quirkiness

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.590
draws more people in
because they just feel

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.510
more engaged what's happening.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.060
And also, again and again
you notice that regimes

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.435
have zero sense of humor.

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:05.560
And that's always the case.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.690
And so when you're
mocking them, they're

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.452
always like on the
back foot, if you like.

00:02:09.452 --> 00:02:11.410
And that's been really
interesting to see also.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.480
PETER BARRON: Yeah.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.271
And we've got a few
pictures from the book.

00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:15.920
And Christina, our
human clicker back here,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.240
is going to click through.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.240
But you obviously kicked
off with "The Independent"

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.500
during the extraordinary period
of the fall of the Berlin Wall

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.210
and were a great
chronicler of that.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.380
And this is kind of a very early
example of what we are talking

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.880
about, which is from Poland.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.510
Talk us through
what happened here.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.210
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: So Poland
is a country very dear

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.939
to my own heart.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.730
And it's kind of what
I saw there and lived

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.470
through kind of shaped
my understanding

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.820
of the world in many ways.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.550
I happened to be
living there in 1980.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.720
I'd been studying theater and
was teaching English there

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.220
when the this incredible
organization Solidarity began.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.030
Mass strikes in the north and
across the country in Gdansk

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.880
and the ports and
across the country,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.480
which demanded new freedoms.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.110
And it was kind of for an
independent trade union.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.000
That's how it was billed.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.416
That's how they
billed themselves.

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:03.090
But actually, it kind of was
like an informal opposition.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.120
And it seemed impossible,
utterly unthinkable

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.830
that that could be achievable
in the context of the Cold War

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.590
at that time, divided Europe.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.700
This was Moscow
dominated Soviet Bloc.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.070
Nothing could happen.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.657
And all the Western
commentators said,

00:03:15.657 --> 00:03:16.740
this isn't going anywhere.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.800
You can't do this.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.290
The Russians won't allow it.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.690
And the courage and the
imagination of the Poles

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.790
actually they achieved
Solidarity's legalization.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.640
And I was living through that
time, watched the live TV

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.210
broadcast when it
happened, it was like, wow.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.340
Like how did that happen?

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.472
The following year,
Solidarity was banned.

00:03:34.472 --> 00:03:36.930
Tanks went to the streets, and
everyone said yeah, exactly.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.810
We told you that wasn't
going to go anywhere anyway.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.480
But actually, the real
story is how Poles said, no.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.230
Actually, it will.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.660
So the picture that
we're seeing there

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.900
is one of my favorite ones.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.100
Martial law was introduced.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.047
The tanks went on the streets.

00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:53.880
And as in so many places,
people, of course,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.490
were painting political
graffiti onto the wall

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.050
and were saying long live
Solidarity, that kind of stuff.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.610
And again, as happens so often,
the police or the authorities

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.405
come along and--

00:04:03.405 --> 00:04:04.195
PETER BARRON: They
painted over it.

00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:04.975
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Wipe it out.

00:04:04.975 --> 00:04:05.280
PETER BARRON: Yeah.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.010
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: So you had all
these blank spaces all around.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.301
And this wonderful group
called the Orange Alternative,

00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:13.500
a kind of surrealist protest
group if you like really,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.810
action group, well
they came along

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.200
and they painted
gnomes or dwarves.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.030
It's the same word in Polish for
like "Snow White and the Seven

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.530
Dwarfs."

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.350
It's that concept, people
wearing little red hats.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.260
And they would paint these
things onto the walls.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.932
And the gnomes became
like, we want the gnomes.

00:04:30.932 --> 00:04:31.890
Freedom for the gnomes.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.614
The authorities had no idea what
to do or how to confront this.

00:04:35.614 --> 00:04:37.030
PETER BARRON:
"Freedom for gnomes"

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.540
became the first slogan.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.710
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: "Freedom
for gnomes" became first.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.418
Instead of saying
freedom for Solidarity,

00:04:40.418 --> 00:04:42.600
"no freedom without
Solidarity" was the chant,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.670
they started saying "no
freedom without gnomes."

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.210
The authorities arrest people.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.168
There was one great thing
where the police were

00:04:48.168 --> 00:04:50.885
heard to be messaging each other
saying, arrest all the gnomes,

00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:54.630
arrest all the gnomes,
because everyone had turned up

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.580
with their red hats.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.040
And that, and you can say
OK, it's a little story,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.460
but the thing was lots and lots
of little stories like that

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.840
led to the fact that Poland
was the very first place that

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.669
broke open the Soviet
Bloc, if you like.

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.460
They got a non-communist
government already

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.630
in August 1989, which was before
the Berlin Wall had come down.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.850
And I always say it
was the gnomes who

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.036
helped make that happen.

00:05:18.036 --> 00:05:19.220
PETER BARRON: And did
they paint out the gnomes

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.200
or did they let the gnomes--

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.990
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
Yeah, yeah, of course.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.730
They then repainted
out the gnomes.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.242
But instead of having "we demand
Solidarity" painted back on,

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:27.950
the gnome that was
painted out would then

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.120
be repainted with a gnome.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.661
You know, the authorities knew,
they couldn't quite know why,

00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:35.580
but they knew that these gnomes
were not good in some way.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.080
PETER BARRON: This comes across
again and again in the book.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.560
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: It was
Red Riding Hood also

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.940
at one point became something.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.250
Like oh, Red Riding Hood.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.570
They found later
the secret police

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.300
files which said we're very
worried about this Red Riding

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.207
group.

00:05:48.207 --> 00:05:49.540
PETER BARRON: So it's very hard.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.000
It comes across again, the
authorities not quite knowing

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.594
what to do.

00:05:53.594 --> 00:05:55.010
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
And each time you

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.041
have the humor, the
authorities go like oh, we

00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:59.540
know this is mocking us, but
we don't know quite what to do.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.540
It's great.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.831
PETER BARRON: And actually,
some extraordinary examples

00:06:02.831 --> 00:06:06.624
of completely flipping it on
its head, so governments got--

00:06:06.624 --> 00:06:07.790
this was Belarus, wasn't it?

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.975
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yeah.

00:06:07.975 --> 00:06:09.260
PETER BARRON: Where the
government got annoyed

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.885
about people applauding,
because people

00:06:10.885 --> 00:06:12.189
started applauding in protest.

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:14.730
So actually doing something like
saying I love the authority.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.280
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: That's right.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.250
PETER BARRON: The authorities
go, we don't want their love,

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.160
because that's
embarrassing to us.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.090
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: They
knew it can't be true,

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.256
like when you were clapping.

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:23.340
So what happened, yes, you
have Alexander Lukashenko.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.610
Belarus is sometimes described
as the last dictatorship

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.110
in Europe.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.860
I mean, a very
authoritarian regime there,

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.270
which really doesn't permit
protest in any sense.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.460
Very, very difficult society
to give voice, if you like.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.860
And so as you say,
people started

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.060
doing it ironically like OK,
well we love our president.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.890
And people would
stand up every-- it

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.660
happened on a weekly basis.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.580
And they would start clapping.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.190
And it's like yeah, but
you're not really clapping,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.414
so we're going to
arrest you for clapping.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:56.330
That got to the ludicrousness
that one guy who

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.100
was actually one armed also got,
quote, "arrested for clapping."

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.332
And they forbade people
to do any of these things.

00:07:03.332 --> 00:07:04.790
And the people, of
course, normally

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.910
repressive leaders
adore to be applauded.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.100
You know, so Soviet papers
when I was living there

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.610
as a student in
the old, old days,

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.160
there would be a lot of
things, bracketed things

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.140
saying you know,
"stormy applause," "very

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.177
stormy applause,"
"stormy applause which

00:07:17.177 --> 00:07:18.010
becomes an ovation."

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.900
They adore this stuff, just
like in North Korea today,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.567
if you like.

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:23.150
But the fact that
people were doing it

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.312
and they knew it was
ironic, it was like, well,

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:27.020
if they want to do
it, then we definitely

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.990
don't want them to do it.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.875
That was the kind of
logic that came through.

00:07:29.875 --> 00:07:31.708
PETER BARRON: And the
next picture, and this

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:35.547
is again an early
example of thumbing

00:07:35.547 --> 00:07:36.630
the nose at the authority.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.870
But this is Leipzig, I
think early on in Germany.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.120
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: That's right.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.219
Yeah, I mean, yeah,
this was less--

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:43.760
there was less
mischief, if you like.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.420
But here there was just pure
courage and incredible--

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.970
we're talking about moments
that have formed my life.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.550
This evening, the evening
when this picture was taken,

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.220
the 9th of October
1989, one of the most

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.567
moving and extraordinary
evenings of my life.

00:07:57.567 --> 00:07:59.150
And the reason it
was so extraordinary

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.860
was because absolutely
nothing happened.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.310
And I'll describe
what that means.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.590
This was a few months
after Poland had already

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.822
broken through as described.

00:08:07.822 --> 00:08:09.530
They had an non-communist
prime minister.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.510
Again, kind of as unthinkable as
having one in North Korea today

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.010
would be.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.990
I mean, it just
changed everything.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.030
And it all started
before Mikhail Gorbachev

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.980
arrived, and then after.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.485
And in the meantime, in East
Germany still very repressed

00:08:22.485 --> 00:08:24.110
and people were
protesting, protesting.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.570
And in the city of
Leipzig there had been

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.610
protests every single Monday.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.170
And people were being beaten.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.400
They were being arrested.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.240
And the authorities
were getting very edgy.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.280
They were getting
edgy enough they

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.113
said, OK, if you come
out this coming Monday

00:08:36.113 --> 00:08:38.102
night we will shoot you.

00:08:38.102 --> 00:08:39.935
It was put in the form
of a reader's letter,

00:08:39.935 --> 00:08:41.424
but everyone understood it.

00:08:41.424 --> 00:08:42.799
Saying you know,
we've had enough

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.550
of these
counter-revolutionary actions,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.250
in other words,
peaceful protests.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.960
We will take action
quote, unquote,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.340
"if need be with
weapons in our hands."

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.460
Wow.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.860
The city was closed off to
journalists and any visitors.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.350
I was very lucky to get
through and even luckier

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.540
that I didn't get kicked
out when I arrived there.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.594
So I was there on
that Monday evening.

00:09:02.594 --> 00:09:04.760
Met with one guy who was
going to one of the protest

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.700
leaders who was
telling his daughter,

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.010
you must on no account
go on this protest.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.595
He was frightened that
she was going to die.

00:09:12.595 --> 00:09:14.720
It was OK for him to die,
but not for his daughter.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.130
So that was an
interesting confrontation.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.463
The hospital wards were cleared.

00:09:17.463 --> 00:09:19.120
Everyone knew there
would be shooting.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.880
And I kind of checked out
a place where I thought,

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.838
I'm going to be safe
here, you know, et cetera.

00:09:22.838 --> 00:09:25.460
But basically, that was
what people thought.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.460
And the authorities, of course,
thought, why wouldn't they,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.440
we have threatened
you so clearly you

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.230
will all stay at home.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.910
And actually as we see in this
image, many, many, many, many,

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.510
many more people came out
that night than ever before.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.730
And like more or
less minutes before,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.320
as the protests got underway,
it started in a church

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.090
and then outside, they went like
OK, there's kind of too many.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.520
We won't shoot tonight.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.190
PETER BARRON: And there
was literally no--

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.932
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: And they
didn't even beat people.

00:09:49.932 --> 00:09:50.870
PETER BARRON: There was
literally no violence at all.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.080
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
There was no violence.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.270
So there was this
surreal moment.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.710
You're all kind
of living in fear.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.810
You're waiting for the bullets.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.330
And I'd seen the trucks
full of armed men

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.129
before the protest began,
like 15 trucks or something.

00:10:02.129 --> 00:10:03.920
You absolutely knew it
was going to happen.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.530
Hospital wards cleared.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.270
And then you walk
out waiting for that,

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.770
and like that doesn't happen.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.439
And they don't do anything.

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:11.230
There's no beating.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.790
There's no arresting,
all of the things

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.373
that had happened
every week and which

00:10:14.373 --> 00:10:17.660
I'd seen in Berlin just a
couple of days before as well.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.470
And at that point, as one
woman said to me afterwards,

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.030
I felt as though I could fly.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.204
And there was a real--

00:10:23.204 --> 00:10:25.120
there was, I have to
say, an absolute chemical

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.440
adrenalin buzz.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.480
It flips from the fear to the
wow, look what's happened.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.770
And a month to the
very day after that

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:33.880
the Berlin Wall came down.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.230
And people always tell
the story of oh, it

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.000
happened because of
this and that and that

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.460
and it was so
surprising, they said.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.460
And it happened because
of a piece of paper that

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.770
went missing or other things.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.270
Really, if you look at the
courage of the Leipzigers,

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.870
that is kind of what brought it.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.480
It's called-- in Leipzig, it's
called the Miracle of Leipzig.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.310
And it kind of was.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.269
And it's about courage.

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:52.810
PETER BARRON: And
there's a big theme

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.075
in the book about the
importance of nonviolence.

00:10:55.075 --> 00:10:55.540
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yeah.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.370
PETER BARRON: And a
lot of these protests

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.054
have said we can do
all kinds of things.

00:10:59.054 --> 00:11:00.220
We do all kinds of mischief.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.165
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: That's right.

00:11:01.165 --> 00:11:02.560
PETER BARRON: We should
never resort to to violence.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.220
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
That's right, yeah.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.960
I mean, if you go
for violence, you're

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.217
playing to the regime's
strongest suit.

00:11:09.217 --> 00:11:10.300
They've got all the tanks.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.500
They've got all the guns.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.000
As we've also seen, of
course, in recent years,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.050
they've got all the planes
that can bomb people.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.550
You know, all of that stuff
they have got when using that.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.280
The one that always
unsettles them but is

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.379
incredibly difficult to do--

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:24.920
you know, in difficult
circumstances,

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.310
nonviolent protest is
not the easy option.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.920
It's actually the very,
very difficult option.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.960
And I think those
who keep that courage

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.290
and keep that nonviolence
achieve astonishing things.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.320
In neighboring
Czechoslovakia, in part of now

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.770
Czech Republic and Slovakia,
two countries, Vaclav Havel,

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.940
the dissident, playwright, then
later became the president,

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.550
he wrote this
magnificent essay called

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.440
"The Power of the Powerless."

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.780
And he kind of mused
in his writing saying,

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.450
well, what would happen if
everybody at the same time

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.550
said no.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.300
And he was mocked.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.799
He said afterwards they treated
me like a Czech Don Quixote.

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:03.410
You know like, oh
please, Vaclav, grow up.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.500
And actually, just 11 years
after that in his own country

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.000
it happened.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.050
So that power of the powerless
is something which from way

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.475
back but continuing to this
day I find so interesting.

00:12:13.475 --> 00:12:14.266
PETER BARRON: Yeah.

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:16.182
And actually it tees up
the next picture which

00:12:16.182 --> 00:12:20.230
is from Hong Kong, I think.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.070
There we go.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.620
And this is sort of these of--

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.720
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yes.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.320
PETER BARRON: --appearing
to be one thing but being

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.150
quite another.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.700
In this case it's Hong Kong.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.495
Sort of people going
shopping in there

00:12:29.495 --> 00:12:30.870
in the rain with
their umbrellas,

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.078
but clearly making a protest.

00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:34.067
And there are some
truly fantastic examples

00:12:34.067 --> 00:12:34.900
of this in the book.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.197
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yeah.

00:12:36.197 --> 00:12:37.210
PETER BARRON: Unfortunately,
the Hong Kong one

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.650
didn't end so
brilliantly did it?

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.900
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: That's right.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.820
I mean so it didn't, but
it's not an ended story.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.280
I think that's the
important thing to remember.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.879
So yes, the story that I
particularly focus on, I mean,

00:12:48.879 --> 00:12:50.920
these images and I'm sure
others will in a minute

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.850
will recognize these
incredibly emblematic protests

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.950
that happened in Hong
Kong a few years ago.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.850
And at one point when
people kind of said, well,

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.050
we're not actually protesting,
we're just going shopping.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.680
And it was difficult.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.170
And something similar happened
in Beijing and Shanghai,

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:08.800
actually.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.569
People would just
kind of go for a walk.

00:13:10.569 --> 00:13:12.110
And the authority
is never quite sure

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.495
if someone's going for
a walk, can I arrest you

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:15.370
for going for a walk?

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.453
Are you a protester or are
you actually just going

00:13:17.453 --> 00:13:19.030
for a coffee or something?

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.849
So all of those things are that.

00:13:22.849 --> 00:13:24.640
PETER BARRON: I was
familiar with this one,

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.590
but I wasn't familiar
with the one in Thailand

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.700
around sandwich eating.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:27.910
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yes.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.950
PETER BARRON: So sandwich
eating and book reading,

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.530
and kind of particular
kinds of books.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:32.780
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: That's right.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.400
Again, it's that turning of
the tables, which I love so.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.080
We had basically military
coup in Thailand.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.456
And you weren't allowed
to express opinions

00:13:41.456 --> 00:13:42.580
on a whole range of things.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.430
Still less were you allowed
to gather to protest.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.040
And what people did
was kind of make

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.920
taking such an innocent activity
like for example, book reading

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.990
or indeed having a picnic,
because that became

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.616
a soft way of having
a gathering was we

00:13:57.616 --> 00:14:00.156
are quote, "having a picnic,"
which has happened elsewhere as

00:14:00.156 --> 00:14:00.700
well.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.800
So what people did was
deliberately and very

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.824
demonstratively they would
sit there with a sandwich

00:14:06.824 --> 00:14:07.490
and with a book.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.590
And there would be
lots of people sitting

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:09.715
with a sandwich and a book.

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:11.450
So what kind of protest is that?

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.080
You're not chanting slogans,
you're not doing anything.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.875
But the people in
authority knew, again,

00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:19.830
that they were being
kind of mocked.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.446
And so it was a way
of doing something

00:14:21.446 --> 00:14:22.570
which was still courageous.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.450
You could still absolutely
get arrested for doing that.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.980
But in a way that was
a little bit sideways,

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.735
a little wrong for
the authorities.

00:14:31.735 --> 00:14:32.905
PETER BARRON: And the book
happened to be "1984,"

00:14:32.905 --> 00:14:33.406
didn't it?

00:14:33.406 --> 00:14:35.488
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: That's
right, some of the people.

00:14:35.488 --> 00:14:37.990
People chose different
books, but very popular one

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.670
for very obvious reasons
was George Orwell's "1984,"

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.390
exactly.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.223
PETER BARRON: Great.

00:14:42.223 --> 00:14:43.970
So next picture.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:48.360
So this is kind of coming
up to the more modern era.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.900
This is obviously
the famous picture

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.845
from Black Lives Matter.

00:14:51.845 --> 00:14:54.220
But what struck me that was
interesting about Black Lives

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:58.130
Matter was that although it
clearly became a campaign

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.349
and picked up from
organized campaigns,

00:15:00.349 --> 00:15:01.890
it was a kind of
accidental campaign.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.030
I mean, even the phrase
"Black Lives Matter"

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.170
was kind of stumbled upon.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.910
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yeah, people
often talk about organizing.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.368
And organizing is
really important,

00:15:08.368 --> 00:15:11.350
but actually organic growth
with the kind of serendipities

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:15.310
of little chance events often
lead to different things.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.532
The image itself I love is
obviously very well well-known.

00:15:18.532 --> 00:15:19.990
It's been described
as a Botticelli

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.114
image, which I rather love.

00:15:21.114 --> 00:15:22.660
It is that kind of
that graciousness.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.890
And it goes to what
you were describing,

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.265
the nonviolence
and the violence.

00:15:25.265 --> 00:15:28.750
It's like, I am more
powerful, says that woman,

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.660
by not responding with the force
that you're coming out with.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.999
I trump, I trump your
force with my non-force.

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:37.540
And it's a very,
very powerful image.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.940
And she herself spoke
powerfully about what

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.740
it meant to her afterwards.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.690
But as you say, it
didn't come from nowhere.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.980
It started-- it had the killing
of Trayvon Martin famously

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.650
a couple of years earlier.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.620
And the person who had killed
him was then acquitted.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.540
And then it was appealed again.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.840
And it started as a kind
of cry from the heart

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.115
of saying our lives matter.

00:16:00.115 --> 00:16:02.740
And the hashtag quickly changed
and it was just a Facebook post

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.321
changed to Black Lives Matter.

00:16:04.321 --> 00:16:06.070
But it didn't immediately
get much pickup.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.840
It was just kind of shared
between friends, shared

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.100
between friends
who were like yeah,

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.933
this does actually--
you know, we all matter

00:16:10.933 --> 00:16:12.970
and black lives
matter within that.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:14.990
And then it was then
another killing,

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.320
the killing of Michael
Brown the following year.

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.670
At a certain point it just
caught and people felt yes,

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.860
this matters so much.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.940
And so what had started
with three friends

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.690
basically in the Bay
Area and then became

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.600
this huge national
thing and indeed,

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.390
became global as
well of confronting

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.660
so much changes needed.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.384
Now as we all know, the
problems are still massive.

00:16:39.384 --> 00:16:41.800
But even within that, it's
been really interesting to see.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.720
There have already
been Black Lives Matter

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.880
victories, if you
like, of you know,

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.310
chiefs of police being
replaced, elected out

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.560
where they weren't expected
to where it was like we do

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.090
need to do something about that.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.350
Clearly it's a massive problem.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.490
And again, I do feel
this image is wonderfully

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.180
emblematic of that, Mike.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.400
All I'm doing is
asking for rights.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.079
I will stand here until
those basic rights are there

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.460
and basic justice, if you like.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.251
It's about justice.

00:17:09.251 --> 00:17:12.444
About people, put
at it crudest level,

00:17:12.444 --> 00:17:14.319
not being killed for
the color of their skin.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:16.900
And that's how bad it is in
what should be a functioning

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.221
democracy today.

00:17:18.221 --> 00:17:19.720
PETER BARRON: And
very similar image

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.746
to some of the famous
images of people

00:17:22.746 --> 00:17:24.579
putting flowers in the
rifles of the guards.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:25.599
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
Yeah, that's right.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:26.410
It goes back, it goes back.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.069
PETER BARRON: And
the one that I really

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:28.902
liked, which I hadn't
seen before, was the I

00:17:28.902 --> 00:17:31.420
think the Ukraine women
standing in a similar position

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.215
with a mirror holding the
mirror up to the soldiers.

00:17:35.215 --> 00:17:36.090
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yes.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:36.460
PETER BARRON: I think
you say in the book

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.896
that as a result
of soldiers looking

00:17:38.896 --> 00:17:40.270
in the mirror at
themselves, they

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.380
kind of changed their position
and moved to to the other side.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:42.910
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
I love that one.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.190
Mirrors have been used quite
often to kind of look yourself

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.690
in the face.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.587
What are you doing?

00:17:46.587 --> 00:17:47.420
And that was lovely.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:52.720
You had both young women
and much older, grandmothers

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.060
as well standing there.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.340
And you could see the riot
police were standing, really

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.872
muscly guys, very much like
the American image in a sense.

00:18:00.872 --> 00:18:02.080
You are ready to do anything.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.630
And they had killed people
and they would kill people

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:08.110
again during those protests in
the Ukraine a couple of years

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.640
ago, a few years ago.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:13.370
And the discomfort
of the people,

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:17.800
I don't want to look in
that mirror because you're

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.270
my sister, my girlfriend, my
mother, my grandmother like,

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.280
don't look at me.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.290
And that was really interesting
that when the president then

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:29.590
finally gave way at the
end of those protests,

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.360
the final trigger
a couple of weeks

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.270
after these particular
protests, the final trigger

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.920
was the fact that the police
had kind of moved away from him.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.590
And then at that point
it was game over.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.050
So again, you can
see the smallest

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:44.740
of connections between this
very peaceful but extremely

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.300
courageous image.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.369
Of course those women were
taking considerable risks.

00:18:49.369 --> 00:18:51.910
And a large number of people
had already been killed and more

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.390
would be, so it wasn't like oh,
let's go and carry a mirror.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.590
That was a really dangerous
and brave thing to do.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.798
PETER BARRON: Now that was
a sort of organic protest.

00:18:59.798 --> 00:19:05.380
But a lot images, a lot of
them are actually PR stunts.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.310
There's not a great deal
of difference between a PR

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:13.520
campaign or stunt and a bit of
street spirit mischief making.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.830
So I mean, your organization,
Amnesty International,

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.180
obviously had a hand in many
of these down the years.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.180
And there some good
examples in the book.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.040
The one I liked in
particular was Darth Vader

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.090
going to buy weapons.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.640
It was Darth Vader and
the Joker turned up

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.420
at a weapons manufacture
and said well, why can't I

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:31.930
have that?

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:32.510
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: That's right.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.040
PETER BARRON: You sell them to
other bad people, why not me?

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.680
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: So they
turn up in the limousine

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.730
with the darkened glass.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.920
And so the chauffeur gets out
and am I in the right place

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.430
to buy weapons?

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.240
Yeah, you're in the right place.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:40.870
Good, good.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.420
Because the (NON-ENGLISH)
the boss needs to come in.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.170
Then the boss gets out and
turns out to be Darth Vader.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.240
And then they denied it.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.490
And as you say, it's like
well, I don't understand.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.455
You sell weapons
to all the bad guys

00:19:53.455 --> 00:19:55.280
and I'm the ultimate bad guy.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.920
So like why wouldn't
I get the weapons?

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.529
Now that, of course, is
not taking risks at all,

00:19:59.529 --> 00:20:01.570
although the police did
come after the people who

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.580
were filming that for
Amnesty International.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.890
The arms manufacturers
called the police

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.024
about this unwarranted
infringement.

00:20:09.024 --> 00:20:11.440
And so the police came after
them, and that's in the video

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.040
also.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.800
But in a way, that was just
a way of engaging people

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.420
to think really?

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.760
So is my country and the arms
manufacturers of my country,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.640
they're selling
weapons over there?

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.690
We need to have international
law stopping that.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.820
And it all contributed to an
international arms trade treaty

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.740
that now exists and makes
it illegal basically

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.570
to sell weapons to
people who are going

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:32.920
to do bad things with them.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.172
It still goes on, of course.

00:20:34.172 --> 00:20:36.130
So I mean, we haven't
got the end of the story,

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:39.730
to put it mildly, as we're
seeing in Yemen and Syria

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:41.570
and so many other places.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.080
But the fact of those laws
being put in place, so you know,

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.747
Darth Vader helped
create a safer world.

00:20:46.747 --> 00:20:48.496
PETER BARRON: And can
you say a little bit

00:20:48.496 --> 00:20:50.930
about how Amnesty thinks
about that kind of campaign?

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.900
Where does a campaign
like that come from?

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.820
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Well, I
guess Amnesty International

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:04.540
is a movement of millions of
people around the world whose

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.990
members and supporters who have
that sense that human rights do

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.900
matter, and matter
for all of us.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.510
That's kind of what
keeps us safe, actually,

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.420
in the biggest sense.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.253
Either your own human
rights, but especially

00:21:16.253 --> 00:21:17.950
thinking about others as well.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.502
And we're always, I guess,
looking at the heart

00:21:21.502 --> 00:21:22.585
of what we do is document.

00:21:22.585 --> 00:21:24.280
We document violations.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.347
We produce these documents full
of facts about the bad things

00:21:27.347 --> 00:21:29.805
happening and what needs to
change and how it should change

00:21:29.805 --> 00:21:32.900
and why it's in violation
of these laws and that laws.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.430
But what you want
to do, of course,

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.134
is to engage people
at the same time.

00:21:37.134 --> 00:21:38.800
And so videos like
the one you described

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.780
with Darth Vader or many of the
other things that we're doing,

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.770
we're constantly
seeking like how can you

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.269
easily make people understand.

00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:49.810
And not just understand, because
that sounds too patronizing,

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.101
because they may understand it.

00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:55.970
But like emotionally want to
become engaged in something.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.400
Because if we just
kind of pile on

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.119
more and more and
more and more facts

00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:03.410
yes, people know it's important,
but at a certain point

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.076
they feel I've got a
life to get on with

00:22:05.076 --> 00:22:07.490
and it's all just
too depressing.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.380
And of course, some of
what we're describing

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.460
is very, very dark.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.680
But what inspires
me, and a way it's

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.870
part the stories that
we've been talking about,

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.990
is I've seen in my own
lifetime, let alone

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.300
working with Amnesty
International as well,

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.220
things that seemed
utterly insoluble,

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:23.570
this will never change.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.010
And then wow, it does.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.912
And either it changes
like really quickly.

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:28.370
Or with the Arms
Trade Treaty, that

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.790
was 20 years of campaigning
of people saying it

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:31.870
will never, never happen.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.980
You're so naive, they said
to the guy who launched

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:34.950
that campaign originally.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:35.825
It will never happen.

00:22:35.825 --> 00:22:37.123
And then, you know, it did.

00:22:37.123 --> 00:22:38.039
PETER BARRON: Amazing.

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:39.570
So the next picture
and this is--

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.030
oh no, this is my
favorite story.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.877
This is absolutely fantastic.

00:22:43.877 --> 00:22:44.960
I hadn't seen this before.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.160
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: And anybody
looking at this image

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.604
will say, what's this about?

00:22:47.604 --> 00:22:49.520
PETER BARRON: Anyone
familiar with this story?

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.686
This is an absolute cracker.

00:22:50.686 --> 00:22:52.059
OK, over to you, Steve.

00:22:52.059 --> 00:22:53.600
Tell us the story
from the beginning.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.390
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: OK, so
although you wouldn't get it

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.380
from the headline-- well if you
look at the small print someone

00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.160
might guess.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:05.030
So in Burma, in Myanmar, which
as all know military rule

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.140
for many, many years,
I was privileged enough

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.930
I met Aung San Suu Kyi, the
kind of the opposition leader

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.330
who was mostly under house
arrest for many years, partly

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.130
in jail under house arrest.

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.192
I met her when I was working as
a reporter for the Independent.

00:23:19.192 --> 00:23:21.650
And then promptly, of course,
got kicked out of the country

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.316
and I was fined.

00:23:22.316 --> 00:23:23.852
Got blacklisted for years.

00:23:23.852 --> 00:23:24.560
So there she was.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.770
It was a place where dark
things were happening.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:31.225
And there was this kind
of icon of resistance.

00:23:31.225 --> 00:23:32.600
Myanmar, as we
all know, actually

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.736
in a very dark place in
a different way today,

00:23:34.736 --> 00:23:36.235
but that's kind of
a separate story.

00:23:36.235 --> 00:23:36.540
PETER BARRON: I'm going
to ask you about that.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.400
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: But
that's a separate story.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.780
That's fine.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.690
But then genuinely enormous
courage shown by her

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:43.920
and many of the
Burmese around her.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.750
She was finally, as a result of
many of the protests by Burmese

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.430
of many different
kinds over the years

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.750
and it then finally led to the
release of Aung San Suu Kyi.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.007
And on the day that
she was allowed out,

00:23:57.007 --> 00:23:58.590
it still, of course,
wasn't democracy.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.830
So the authorities said
to newspaper editors,

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.260
on no account must you put this
news-- which was front page

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.062
news all around the
world-- on no account

00:24:06.062 --> 00:24:07.520
must you put it on
the front pages.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.561
You must kind of bury it.

00:24:08.561 --> 00:24:10.680
It's just yeah well, this
woman happens to be out.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.190
PETER BARRON: Page 17.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.950
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
Who cares about her.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.080
Bottom of page 17
kind of thing, yeah.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.200
So what we're looking at
here, this sports paper

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.820
called First 11 had quite
a bright idea of how

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:21.900
they would confront that.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.660
And so the censors have to
pass every single thing that

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.124
goes through.

00:24:26.124 --> 00:24:27.540
So they produced
their front page,

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.640
which as everyone can see
by looking at it deals

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.250
with the English football
games and everything

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.535
that's been happening with
Sunderland against Chelsea

00:24:34.535 --> 00:24:36.660
and Manchester United
against the Villa and Arsenal

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.160
and so on and so
on. it's all there.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.350
That gets sent off by
an old fashioned fax

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.180
as a black and white
copy to the censor.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.025
And the censor looks at it and
goes OK, it's a sports page.

00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:45.470
PETER BARRON: Sunderland
defeats Chelsea.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.261
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: What
do I care about that?

00:24:47.261 --> 00:24:51.690
But when it actually came out
on the kiosks the following day,

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.587
which obviously was
in the color version--

00:24:54.587 --> 00:24:55.920
PETER BARRON: The color version.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.710
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
There was the version

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:01.710
which did not make the
censors happy at all,

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.410
but did make readers think wow.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:08.430
So there we can see "Su,"
meaning Aung San Suu Kyi,

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.230
is now free.

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:16.680
And we must therefore "unite
and advance to grab the hope."

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.630
The paper instantly sold out.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.380
The authorities, of
course, were furious.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.090
They banned the paper.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.381
As far as I remember, they
locked up the editor briefly

00:25:23.381 --> 00:25:24.540
and the paper was banned.

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.680
But the paper didn't mind.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.010
They knew that act of
mischief and defiance

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.470
was bound to end up with
them being punished.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.690
But it was their way
of one in the eye.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.340
And that meant,
basically if you like,

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.320
the resistance was continuing.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.460
And that became a
collector's item,

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.070
getting a hold of that copy.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.440
And then many, many positive
changes came in the years

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.250
after that.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.860
Now bad things are
happening, but those positive

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.360
changes I think we
shouldn't forget.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:48.650
PETER BARRON: Yeah.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:49.500
Well, let me ask you about.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:49.990
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yeah.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.030
PETER BARRON: Where do you
stand now on Aung San Suu Kyi?

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.790
Because a lot of
people, Bob Geldof

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.690
is on handing back
their honors and so on.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:56.940
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: It's really--

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.140
PETER BARRON: Where do you
think we should stand on that?

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.510
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
Deeply conflicted.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.820
Having met her and
admired, I was then also

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.470
privileged to meet
her when she came

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.020
to Oslo to receive
her Nobel Peace Prize,

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.239
re-met her at that time.

00:26:08.239 --> 00:26:09.780
And she came to
Amnesty International

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.260
to receive the Ambassador of
Conscience award that we gave.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.480
So such an admirer.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.410
She was so-- her courage
was so important.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.415
And now we're seeing somebody
who is failing to speak out.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.190
"Sad" is too soft a word.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.200
I'm hesitating over
the word "criminal."

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.210
But it just-- it should
not be happening.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:36.640
She is the woman who
understands integrity.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.050
She is not showing
the integrity.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.360
So the crimes against
humanity that we

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.180
are seeing in Myanmar against
the Rohingya minority there,

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.909
truly, truly terrible.

00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:47.950
Amnesty International
recently published a report

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.490
which was going back two
years, been researching it

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:54.700
for two years, defining
it as apartheid the way

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.650
that Rohingya have
already been treated.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.177
We do not use that word lightly.

00:26:58.177 --> 00:27:00.010
I mean, that went through
many, many levels.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.093
That's what we are seeing.

00:27:01.093 --> 00:27:03.610
That was the kind of context.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.240
And she has such a powerful,
important voice and yet

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.155
won't do it.

00:27:08.155 --> 00:27:10.810
And you know, even if
the pope goes to Myanmar,

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.950
he has in effect told on no
account must you use this word.

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:17.620
The pope, who speaks
out on so many things,

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.350
but even using the
word "Rohingya,"

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.760
the Myanmar authorities say
we don't want it to happen.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.450
So that's a very sad place.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.830
And above all, it's
not good for Myanmar.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.860
It's not good for the
minority, and indeed there

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:32.590
are other minorities who've
been persecuted there also.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.350
But you know, that's
not good for the health

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.720
of the society in general.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.860
And it's saddening
and it's appalling.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.910
PETER BARRON: Yeah, yeah, OK.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.375
Couple more pictures
and stories to tell.

00:27:45.375 --> 00:27:47.500
And this is the sort of
role of art in all of this.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.680
And Ai Weiwei, of course, writes
the foreword for the book.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.480
He's one of the great
exponents of this.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.530
So this is Porcelain Crab.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:55.596
Tell us about that.

00:27:55.596 --> 00:27:56.470
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yes.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:57.332
The River Crab.

00:27:57.332 --> 00:27:58.790
So all of this
started-- it happens

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.480
in quite a lot of countries,
by actually the Chinese

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.500
are like masters at
this of the word play.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:13.240
Word plays are used constantly
by Chinese for that sense of I

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.270
seem to be saying one
word, but actually I'm

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.590
kind of meaning a different one.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.609
So Ai Weiwei, the artist,
I was so privileged

00:28:20.609 --> 00:28:22.150
that he agreed to
write the foreword,

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:24.220
because he has exactly
that spirit of kind

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:28.240
of courageous mischief
in so much of his work.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.000
And he was having difficulty
with the authorities

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.330
a few years ago, and they
were demolishing his studio.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:37.845
And he organized a banquet
to kind of celebrate

00:28:37.845 --> 00:28:38.470
the demolition.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.720
So again, he kind
of turned the tables

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.150
on the authorities a little bit.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:43.840
People gathered.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.465
And what did they
serve at the banquet?

00:28:45.465 --> 00:28:48.880
They served river crabs,
which is a Chinese delicacy.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.460
But the important point
of the river crabs

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.280
is the word sounds almost
identical to the Chinese word

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.570
for harmonization.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:59.636
And harmonization, in-turn, is
the official propaganda word,

00:28:59.636 --> 00:29:01.010
which basically
means censorship.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.530
You know, we will
all be harmonized.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.880
You know, none of this edgy
stuff, we will be harmonized.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.170
And so everyone knew
exactly what that meant,

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:09.754
and they loved eating
the river crabs.

00:29:09.754 --> 00:29:11.461
And somebody who was
there said, are they

00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:13.510
going to ban us eating
river crabs now, you know,

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.200
which is our tradition?

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:21.190
And so the art work by Ai
Weiwei, the porcelain river

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.770
crabs, I guess that
many people who

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.310
may have seen that exhibitions
in London and around the world

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:29.020
you know, if you might
walk past and just

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.060
think oh, that's
kind of interesting.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.720
But actually it contains
in it that defiance

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.280
of censorship in this
very oblique kind of way.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.140
But you know, instead of that
middle finger gesture, which

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.360
of course he's also
familiar with in different,

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.050
but this is a very oblique
way of saying the same thing.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.180
I will not be muzzled.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.250
And in fact, here are
thousands of river crabs.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:53.909
Because no, I and we are
not going to stay silent.

00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:54.700
PETER BARRON: Yeah.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.000
That was extremely impressive.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.274
And I think the next
picture is Ai Weiwei.

00:29:58.274 --> 00:29:59.190
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yeah.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.880
PETER BARRON: That was when
he was in the lift, wasn't it?

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.570
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: That's right.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.250
And again, you
know, there he is.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.520
He just doesn't stop.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.520
So he'd been arrested.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.770
He was speaking out
on behalf of people

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.860
who'd suffered very
badly and the authorities

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.080
had failed so
miserably in connection

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.050
with an earthquake
that had happened.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:18.550
The authorities were so unhappy
they drag him out of his bed

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:19.870
and they beat him at that time.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.430
And he actually after
this photo was taken

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:22.580
he had to be hospitalized.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.300
And there was some quite
serious, and very serious

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.720
head injury.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.990
But he, while he's
being arrested,

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.240
is in the elevator, hotel
elevator with the mirror,

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.870
takes a picture in the mirror
and then shares that globally.

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:39.250
So if you like, even though he's
in such a dangerous position,

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.940
he still continues to do that,
that familiar serious face

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:43.950
that we all know.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.851
And it's like OK, you're
doing this to me and boom,

00:30:46.851 --> 00:30:48.100
this is what I'm doing to you.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.808
PETER BARRON: And I
love the quote, which

00:30:49.808 --> 00:30:51.320
is "Never retreat, Retweet."

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.790
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
Isn't it glorious?

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.998
It's glorious, it's glorious.

00:30:53.998 --> 00:30:54.940
Yes, it's very nice.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.170
PETER BARRON: Good.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.314
And I think our final
picture is again from China.

00:30:57.314 --> 00:30:58.230
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yeah.

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:59.970
PETER BARRON: And
this is doctoring

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.060
the archive, which
is sort of hilarious

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.309
but serious at the same time.

00:31:03.309 --> 00:31:04.600
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.280
I mean, again it's
the kind of mischief.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.950
Of course, incredibly
serious the meaning of this.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.392
So everybody will
recognize the photograph

00:31:11.392 --> 00:31:12.850
that this is
originally taken from,

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.580
which is this unbelievable
courage of a man just

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.680
with some shopping
bags standing in front

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.150
of the tanks on Tiananmen Square
after the main massacre had

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.950
happened, but when killing was
still continuing at that time.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.010
It's the picture of
the Tiananmen Square

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:32.180
Massacre of 1989 that
everyone knows and remembers.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:35.440
And then on the anniversary
of that a couple of years ago,

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.460
the picture itself
is utterly banned.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.600
It can't be shared.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.910
And you know, and references
to it, all of those things.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:46.636
So people tweaked the photo
and put the yellow ducks in,

00:31:46.636 --> 00:31:48.260
which was in itself
a reference to some

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.450
of the stuff that was going on
with yellow ducks at that time.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.630
PETER BARRON: That
means something else?

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:51.750
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: No.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.800
Actually it was to do
with an art exhibition.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:56.560
There had been some
giant ones in Hong Kong.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.300
And so took these.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.160
And this went completely viral.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.530
And then the hashtag of "plastic
yellow ducks" also went viral.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.120
And so as one person
said, you know,

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.400
it's the kind of
the digital one,

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.310
the authorities nil,
basically, you know.

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:15.260
It was the victory in such
difficult circumstances.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:19.100
Because this is a theme which is
first, forbidden to talk about.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.700
So it requires real
courage to talk about it.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.855
And second, the
authorities say well,

00:32:24.855 --> 00:32:26.480
why would anyone want
to talk about it?

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.563
It's so long again and
it's utterly uninteresting.

00:32:28.563 --> 00:32:29.720
No one's interested.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.730
And this defied both of those.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:33.650
It kind of said yes,
we're talking about it.

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:37.520
And the way it went viral
reminded people that yeah,

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.030
it may have been a long time
ago, coming up 30 years ago,

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:45.510
but unless you go to the
heart of the truth telling,

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:48.480
you don't get the stability
that your country really needs.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.973
I think that's the kind of
powerfulness that comes out.

00:32:49.973 --> 00:32:51.380
PETER BARRON: And the
person who created that

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.000
would be in big
trouble if identified.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.166
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Absolutely.

00:32:54.166 --> 00:32:56.450
Yeah, no, that
would be for sure.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:00.230
So as so often, you know, you
appear to be doing mischief,

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.330
but mischief is not the easy.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.977
Mischief is a very,
very courageous version.

00:33:04.977 --> 00:33:05.810
PETER BARRON: Great.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.640
Well, we're going to come
to questions in a second.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.723
How long have we got left?

00:33:08.723 --> 00:33:09.980
I haven't got my watch on me.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.715
But how long?

00:33:11.715 --> 00:33:12.756
AUDIENCE: Twenty minutes.

00:33:12.756 --> 00:33:14.590
PETER BARRON: Twenty
minutes, excellent.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.215
So we'll come to
questions in a second.

00:33:16.215 --> 00:33:20.950
So for final thought is, you
and I grew up going on demos,

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:24.260
you know, sort of the
marching down the street.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.286
Is the kind of old
fashioned traditional demo,

00:33:28.286 --> 00:33:29.410
is that not enough anymore?

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.497
Is that over?

00:33:31.497 --> 00:33:33.830
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Obviously,
it remains really important.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:38.855
I mean, the funny thing is when
I was writing this book in 2016

00:33:38.855 --> 00:33:41.660
and I was thinking, oh,
does anyone except me really

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.740
care about protests?

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.260
At that point it felt as
though it was a slightly

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.310
esoteric thing I
cared about a lot

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:49.700
and I thought of lots
of nice stories to tell.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.090
And then you know, this
guy with the weird head

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.130
gets elected president
in the United States,

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.280
you know, overturning
all expectations.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.379
And as we all know, protests
became very, very big.

00:34:02.379 --> 00:34:03.920
And of course, with
mischief as well.

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.295
I mean, the women's
protests that

00:34:05.295 --> 00:34:07.250
kicked off the inauguration
of Donald Trump

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:11.690
back in January 2017,
but many other protests,

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:14.239
including in the United
Kingdom as well we've

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:17.480
seen vast protests
on a range of things,

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:21.659
partly against Trump, the Brexit
issue, but many other things.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.360
So I think those things
are definitely there.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:27.010
What's interesting,
and I think that sense

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.621
that we can make a difference
I would like to think people

00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:30.120
believe.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.810
Although I read an
interestingly large number

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:36.325
of pieces that say you know,
the age of protest is dead.

00:34:36.325 --> 00:34:37.699
PETER BARRON: And
so sometimes it

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:39.679
has an extraordinary
effect and then sometimes--

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:40.429
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Exactly.

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:41.830
PETER BARRON: --you see a huge
build up and nothing happens.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:42.830
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
And that's the point

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.158
is that often you can't tell.

00:34:44.158 --> 00:34:46.699
And what's really interesting
is often the things-- you know,

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.770
you could have said in
Burma a few years ago,

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.386
we didn't need to,
and people did.

00:34:50.386 --> 00:34:52.510
They say said, oh, they're
very brave and all that,

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.343
but none of that's going
to change anything,

00:34:54.343 --> 00:34:55.940
and it ended up
changing big things.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.594
We're in a democracy,
there's a kind of paradox.

00:34:58.594 --> 00:35:00.260
It's, of course, much
easier to protest.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.250
You're taking fewer risks.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:05.270
But in a sense, the people
you are protesting against

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.490
are more comfortable.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.950
So there's a Polish poem
I'm very fond of called

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.590
"Those Men So Powerful."

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.534
And whose punchline at the end--

00:35:13.534 --> 00:35:15.950
it's all about the people who
have all the power over you.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:20.750
"In the end, in the end, it is
they who are afraid the most."

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.030
That poem was
written before even

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:24.800
Solidarity that I was
describing existed.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.280
That was written
back in the 1970s.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.020
It was a declaration
of hope, not certainty.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:33.350
But he was proved exactly right
that the unelected leaders

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.350
fundamentally live in fear,
because they know they

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:37.730
kind of shouldn't be there.

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:41.346
Elected leaders, even if they're
doing really bad things--

00:35:41.346 --> 00:35:43.220
and that's not just the
United States, that's

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.830
in Turkey, that's in
Philippines, that's in Poland,

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.900
there's a whole
bunch of places--

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.340
they feel much more comfortable.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:53.960
So in those circumstances, it's
much harder to make the impact

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.830
because as we've seen from the
tweeter-in-chief in Washington

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:59.420
it just knocks back.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:03.050
But actually, I think it's
important to think because you

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.630
don't see an impact today,
tomorrow, the next day, that

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.730
doesn't mean that it
hasn't had any impact.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:11.045
At a certain point, there are
others who go, enough already.

00:36:11.045 --> 00:36:13.450
And at a certain point,
a leader, I think,

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.660
governments are
forced to make change.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.930
So we definitely, definitely
shouldn't sit at home

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:18.540
while a demo is happening.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:19.350
PETER BARRON: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:20.220
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
When things anger us,

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.740
we need to get out there.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.406
PETER BARRON: So the
message of the book

00:36:23.406 --> 00:36:25.036
really is even small
acts of subversion

00:36:25.036 --> 00:36:25.910
are well worth while.

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:26.830
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
Exactly, exactly.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:28.440
And don't believe
that the book is

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.694
littered with quotes from
people who said oh, grow up.

00:36:32.694 --> 00:36:35.110
It's very sweet that you think
this can make a difference.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.750
It totally won't
make a difference.

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:40.860
And in one case, the
Soviet coup in August 1991,

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.390
there was a columnist
who I quote,

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.098
"I don't know why
they're even bothering.

00:36:44.098 --> 00:36:46.277
This obviously is never
going to succeed."

00:36:46.277 --> 00:36:46.860
He wrote that.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.084
It appeared in print
on a Wednesday morning.

00:36:49.084 --> 00:36:51.000
By Wednesday afternoon,
because of the courage

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.333
of tens of thousands in Moscow
and hundreds of thousands

00:36:53.333 --> 00:36:55.482
around the country,
the coup had collapsed.

00:36:55.482 --> 00:36:56.940
He never, of course,
admitted that.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.190
But you know, that
sense of don't

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:01.570
listen to people who
say nothing will happen.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.740
It might not happen immediately,
but things do create change.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.740
PETER BARRON: Brilliant.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.450
Great.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:09.322
Questions for Steve?

00:37:09.322 --> 00:37:11.530
AUDIENCE: Can you perhaps
talk about the sort of work

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.730
that you're doing
around kind of refugees

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.365
and basically, you
know, getting society

00:37:17.365 --> 00:37:22.530
to kind of feel more charitable,
giving to people in need?

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:28.290
And you know, I guess in human
nature and natural politics

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:30.600
it's very easy to
go oh, you know,

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.020
English jobs so English
people or all that kind

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.400
of very nativism.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.280
How do you see us fighting that?

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.032
You know, what is the
message of inclusion

00:37:39.032 --> 00:37:39.990
that we should put out?

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:41.157
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:41.157 --> 00:37:41.906
Thank you so much.

00:37:41.906 --> 00:37:43.860
I always love Q&amp;A so
much because they always

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.510
ask you the questions that
you actually wanted to answer

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.150
but never quite fit in.

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:50.620
Refugees is something
I've been working on,

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.490
especially recently.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.820
But my organization, Amnesty
International, of course,

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.490
like many others, is
working very much on that.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.350
And you rightly
describe certainly

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.990
in Europe, but actually
around the world,

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.320
these kind of toxic narratives
that we want our country back.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.949
We don't want them.

00:38:05.949 --> 00:38:08.490
That, of course, echoes things
that we've seen over the years

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:08.989
as well.

00:38:08.989 --> 00:38:11.790
I mean again, just to take this
country and this continent,

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.750
looking at the 1930s, the
parallels of people trying

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.380
to flee Nazism and the
push back are kind of

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.150
staggering and depressing.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:25.260
And you know, describing Syrians
as the problem when they're

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.030
actually fleeing
these horrific things,

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:30.070
it's so offensive
on every level.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:33.900
But one of the things
is you can't just

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.440
preach at people because
people are feeling insecure.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.140
And if you've got people who
are feeding them narratives

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.780
about why this is
dangerous and you know bad

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.940
and if there's a danger
of being-- and of course,

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.891
the danger of terrorism
we all see is there.

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:48.390
You know, people
are being blown up.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:51.810
So you've got a climate
of fear potentially,

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.220
which can be stoked.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.360
So I don't think there is
any easy, quick solution,

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.110
but you addressed
something that all of us

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:02.490
are thinking about a lot,
which is how people just

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:07.080
get the empathy of being able
to think into the other person's

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.490
shoes.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:11.490
One video that I love, which
colleagues from Amnesty

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.100
International Poland did.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:15.600
It's an incredibly
simple one, which

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.980
is just two minutes of
silence of two people looking

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.440
at each other, one
person from here

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.210
and one person who has
arrived from there.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:30.600
And there's a series of I
can't remember 10, 20 people.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.340
And you see them.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.710
First, I've never met you
before and I'm looking.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:37.950
And then looking into
the person's eyes.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:41.040
The connections that are
made during that brief time,

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.400
and then the embrace that
often finishes that, including

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.977
tears coming to people's eyes.

00:39:45.977 --> 00:39:47.310
For me, it's really interesting.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:51.840
Because as I look and I
think what your story might

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.590
be and then reflect in
many countries in Europe,

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.450
certainly including,
for example, Poland,

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:00.150
what my own country
has gone through,

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:01.410
and you begin to feel that.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:05.040
And I think that none of
that is an easy answer

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.030
of what we must do.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.700
Because these toxic
narratives that we're hearing,

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:12.270
they're incredibly easy to play.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:16.380
And so there are just ways
that we can turn around,

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.240
not by saying you
mustn't, you mustn't, you

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.850
mustn't, which kind
of can sometimes work,

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:23.660
but people put up
their barriers.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.800
And it's right to say
this is against the law

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.680
and this is your obligation,
all of which is absolutely true.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.740
The UN Refugee Convention is
so clear in what the European

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.161
Union has failed to do.

00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:35.160
It puts up more barriers
instead of allowing in.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.500
All of that is
true, but we kind of

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:39.840
need people to
feel that empathy.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.720
And people are not bad,
as such, of course.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.940
You know, we know that
from our own neighbors

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.830
and friends and colleagues.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.756
But creating that empathy
I think is so important.

00:40:49.756 --> 00:40:50.922
PETER BARRON: Next question.

00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:55.140
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.640
That was really,
really interesting.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.080
I just wanted to sort
of ask your perspective

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.180
from Amnesty
International's perspective

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.730
on the events that have
taken place in Zimbabwe.

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.950
And it always
occurred to me that--

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:10.040
and this is probably naivete of
what kind of protest movement

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.660
was going on there--

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.500
and was there a
protest movement that

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:18.260
sort of led the
dethroning of Mugabe

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:21.130
and ushering in
potentially this new era.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.730
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
Yeah, Zimbabwe is

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.130
a very good example of
nothing will change,

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:26.030
nothing will change.

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.120
And the way that the
changes have happened

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.290
is a kind of
complex one as well.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:34.517
And to be blunt, I am expecting
without particular knowledge,

00:41:34.517 --> 00:41:36.350
but that Amnesty
International will probably

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:38.660
be publishing reports about
difficult things still going

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:39.160
on.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.580
You know, we haven't reached
the green sunny uplands

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.170
I don't think yet.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.560
But just to welcome
in the short sense

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.205
that one set of really
bad things has finished.

00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:49.580
So to answer your
question, yeah.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.880
I mean, civil society has
been really strong there.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.040
The danger of raising
your voice has been huge.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.480
People have suffered
very greatly.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.386
And I massively admire
the Zimbabweans,

00:42:00.386 --> 00:42:01.760
of whom there have
been many, who

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.059
have dared to put their
heads above the parapet.

00:42:04.059 --> 00:42:05.850
And indeed, I have
written before now there

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.240
have been some, again, some
quite nice mischievous things

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.590
with theater productions.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.131
I mean, there are
all sorts of things

00:42:11.131 --> 00:42:13.800
that they have done in different
ways and different connections.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.800
One of the things, I was
actually really honored

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.980
with this book with
"Street Spirit"

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.820
is a group before the fall
of Robert Mugabe, who'd

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.200
been there forever and ever.

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.910
But they got in touch
saying could they

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.260
do a graphic novel version.

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.509
They were already using the
stories of "Street Spirit"

00:42:29.509 --> 00:42:32.240
because they found them fun to
play with thinking oh, maybe we

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.524
could use some of those ideas.

00:42:33.524 --> 00:42:35.690
And they-- I don't know if
it's going to happen yet,

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.106
but there was discussion of
doing a graphic novel version,

00:42:38.106 --> 00:42:40.650
which I would be so happy for.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.430
In other words, the
stories seek to be

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.800
accessible in any
case with pictures.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.400
But graphic novel, obviously,
is an incredibly powerful way.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.220
And the thought
of the people who

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.400
in Zimbabwe who were thinking
about that was the more that we

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.420
can create a sense of belief
that we can achieve something,

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.991
I think that's
incredibly important.

00:43:00.991 --> 00:43:02.990
And in a way, it is the
theme of everything else

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.865
I've been discussing.

00:43:03.865 --> 00:43:07.180
The Russian opposition
leader Alexei Navalny

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.430
came out with an interesting
line at an election rally

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:14.300
or at a political rally some
time ago or earlier this year

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.030
where he said the
greatest problem

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:18.350
we face-- he asked the crowd.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:20.690
And they talked about
corruption and this and that.

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:23.120
And he said no, no, the
greatest problem we fear,

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:28.170
face, is lack of belief in the
possibility of creating change.

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:28.820
And it's true.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.600
It's really hard.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.470
And I think many Zimbabweans
probably did feel that.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:35.960
And that was why we saw
such incredible ecstasy

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.580
when the change came.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.030
But the people who continue
to fight for that change

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:42.300
definitely have contributed.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.825
I think there's no
question on that, yeah.

00:43:45.825 --> 00:43:47.244
PETER BARRON: Another question?

00:43:47.244 --> 00:43:49.089
Any?

00:43:49.089 --> 00:43:49.630
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:53.430
Can you talk a little bit
more about slacktivism

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:56.220
and clicktivism and
the kind of tension

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.800
between how easy it
is in the online world

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.489
to like something
and click and you

00:44:00.489 --> 00:44:01.780
feel like you've done your bit?

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.113
You don't need to put on your
boots and go out and walk.

00:44:04.113 --> 00:44:06.066
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:06.066 --> 00:44:07.440
Yeah, another
important question.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.630
And it gives me the excuse,
talking of newly coined words,

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:11.879
to mention laughtivism, which
is a different category,

00:44:11.879 --> 00:44:12.610
but which I love.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:14.870
Which is coined by a Serb
activist, Srdja Popovic,

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.995
who wrote a book called
"Blueprint for Revolution."

00:44:16.995 --> 00:44:19.110
And he talks about
laughtivism, which in a sense,

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.401
is the theme we've been
talking about today of mischief

00:44:21.401 --> 00:44:23.520
and activism put together.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:27.090
But your reference to
clicktivism and slacktivism

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:29.890
and the idea that you're not
really going out on the street,

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:31.394
you're just oh
yeah, I support you.

00:44:31.394 --> 00:44:32.310
And now I support you.

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:34.170
And now I support you,
and it doesn't really

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:36.030
involve any commitment.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:37.170
Massively mocked.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.830
And it's true that, of course,
just doing that and not

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.717
being engaged, if you
just kind of don't even

00:44:42.717 --> 00:44:44.300
think about it again,
oh, I've clicked

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.770
so I've been a good person,
that doesn't help much.

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:51.720
But I think we are wrong to
think that the online stuff is

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.815
somehow irrelevant.

00:44:54.815 --> 00:44:56.940
It plays-- I mean, Black
Lives Matter, for example,

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.670
is one example of things
just gaining an enormous

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.190
and the people who said yeah,
like Black Lives Matter.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.017
You say, well yeah,
OK, you've clicked.

00:45:04.017 --> 00:45:05.850
But then that went
together those people who

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:08.490
felt engaged actually
did go out on the street.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:14.301
And actually in the prologue
to Black Lives Matter happening

00:45:14.301 --> 00:45:16.050
when there was the
protest against Trayvon

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:20.100
Martin and the person who shot
him dead not being punished,

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.830
that was, again,
an online petition

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:26.590
which went so viral with so
many, many, many millions

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.040
that that kind of went from
being a story that wasn't even

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:32.864
on page 17 let alone on the
front page to being something

00:45:32.864 --> 00:45:35.280
that the President of the
United States was talking about.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.670
So that was without much
protest in the street.

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:43.290
So yes, clicking isn't
going to solve the problems

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.400
of the world, to put it mildly.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:49.486
But we are gravely
mistaken if we just think

00:45:49.486 --> 00:45:50.610
it's completely irrelevant.

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.620
Another example, which
is not clicking directly,

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:55.520
but that sense of online-ness.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:00.740
In Egypt in 2011
when Mubarak fell,

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:03.750
there was one
Facebook post there

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:08.370
which went so completely viral
saying, unless you go out,

00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:09.746
then you are part
of the problem.

00:46:09.746 --> 00:46:12.036
If you say, I'm not going
out because not enough people

00:46:12.036 --> 00:46:13.680
will go out, like
you've just made

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.750
it certain that it will fail.

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.180
And that post went so viral
that millions, as we know,

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.560
did go out and Mubarak fell.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.710
That all happened only a couple
of months after a mocking,

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:27.960
mocking piece had
appeared in one

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.030
of the world's most
respected magazines

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.780
explaining to us why all
this online stuff was

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.355
utterly, utterly irrelevant.

00:46:34.355 --> 00:46:36.730
And that was when that change
had already begun in Egypt.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:39.720
So yes, I think we
should definitely beware

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.820
of clicktivism in isolation.

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.529
But ways of making
people think about how

00:46:45.529 --> 00:46:47.070
they relate to the
rest of the world,

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.893
I think that's important
still definitely.

00:46:48.893 --> 00:46:49.859
AUDIENCE: We have
time for one more.

00:46:49.859 --> 00:46:51.192
PETER BARRON: One more question.

00:46:53.442 --> 00:46:54.525
AUDIENCE: I have one more.

00:46:54.525 --> 00:46:57.399
PETER BARRON: Oh,
one more, go on.

00:46:57.399 --> 00:46:59.690
AUDIENCE: Steve, which human
rights issues in the world

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:02.780
today are not gaining the
attention of the world's

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:04.130
media or most people?

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:05.747
What do we not have our eye on?

00:47:05.747 --> 00:47:07.830
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Wow,
that's such a good question.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:09.540
I ought to have
prepared for it better.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.332
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:47:10.332 --> 00:47:13.790
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: I'm kind
of thinking here, OK.

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:15.350
Yemen and what's
happening in Yemen,

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:19.460
I'm glad-- that which is vast
numbers of civilians dying.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.100
Saudi bombing,
Western governments

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:26.840
supporting, selling the
arms and making that happen.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.310
People are partly aware of
that, but too little aware,

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:34.012
I would say.

00:47:34.012 --> 00:47:34.970
Let me stick with that.

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:36.261
I mean, there are other things.

00:47:36.261 --> 00:47:39.320
Syria, that the danger is that
people kind of move on from it

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:39.999
somehow.

00:47:39.999 --> 00:47:42.290
You know, oh, I've been
reading about that for so long.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.930
The suffering is still enormous
and the suffering in Syria

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:46.790
continues.

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:48.734
Rohingya, Myanmar people
are talking about it.

00:47:48.734 --> 00:47:50.150
But again, the
danger is it's like

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:51.780
OK, let's move on from that.

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.030
But I guess if you were
to ask me one thing,

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.850
it astonishes me that
it's not something

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:58.845
that everybody's
thinking about it's

00:47:58.845 --> 00:48:00.970
probably what's
happening in Yemen.

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:02.970
PETER BARRON: Steve
Crawshaw, thank you so much.

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:03.390
STEVEN CRAWSHAW: Thank you.

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:05.670
PETER BARRON: Inspiring and
important and very entertaining

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:06.160
stuff, so thank you.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:06.940
STEVEN CRAWSHAW:
Thank you very much.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:07.980
And thank you to everyone here.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.180
Thank you very much, indeed.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.930
