simple if you don't think of the wall as
 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.619
simple if you don't think of the wall as
a brick wall but start to think of it as

a brick wall but start to think of it as
 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.670

design move and what I like about that
 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.169
design move and what I like about that
also it's not so much interested in the

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179
also it's not so much interested in the
 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.870
also it's not so much interested in the
design of a wall it's interested in the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880
design of a wall it's interested in the
 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.510
design of a wall it's interested in the
design of the parameters that gauge that

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520
design of the parameters that gauge that
 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.120

wall so that once you understand that I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130
wall so that once you understand that I

can give it to you as another person to

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469
can give it to you as another person to
 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.630
can give it to you as another person to
redesign it for me or

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640
redesign it for me or
 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.940
redesign it for me or
to cultivate a relationship with it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950
to cultivate a relationship with it
 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.030
to cultivate a relationship with it
which is much more intimate

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040
 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.740
you know our work is is constantly about

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750
you know our work is is constantly about
 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.450
you know our work is is constantly about
failures you test things so that they

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460
failures you test things so that they
 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.500
failures you test things so that they
fail that's the way engineers progress

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510
fail that's the way engineers progress
 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.640
fail that's the way engineers progress
they they build arches test them to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
they they build arches test them to
 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.730
they they build arches test them to
their yield point and I hope somehow to

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740
their yield point and I hope somehow to
 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.640
their yield point and I hope somehow to
be able to do that not in the technical

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650
be able to do that not in the technical
 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.640
be able to do that not in the technical
realm so much but rather in the in the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650
realm so much but rather in the in the
 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.670
realm so much but rather in the in the
realm of synthesis yes we have learned a

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
realm of synthesis yes we have learned a
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.140
realm of synthesis yes we have learned a
lot about those from those failures

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150
lot about those from those failures
 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.280
lot about those from those failures
maybe if I can say the biggest lesson

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290
maybe if I can say the biggest lesson
 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.620
maybe if I can say the biggest lesson
I've learned from ourselves is in the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630
I've learned from ourselves is in the
 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.440
I've learned from ourselves is in the
quest for determination and

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450
quest for determination and
 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.110
quest for determination and
specification we probably have focused

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120
specification we probably have focused
 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.090
specification we probably have focused
too much on the role of a single detail

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100
too much on the role of a single detail
 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.260
too much on the role of a single detail
in its ability to proliferate and

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270
in its ability to proliferate and
 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.250
in its ability to proliferate and
control an entire design and and the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260
control an entire design and and the
 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.580
control an entire design and and the
transition from let's say the design of

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590
transition from let's say the design of
 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.220
transition from let's say the design of
an object to the design of parameters

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230
an object to the design of parameters
 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.910
an object to the design of parameters
that engage objects has been our most

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920
that engage objects has been our most
 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.040
that engage objects has been our most
successful lesson now when I sit down to

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050
successful lesson now when I sit down to
 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.380
successful lesson now when I sit down to
design and I design much more

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390
design and I design much more
 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.840
design and I design much more
collectively now with other discipline

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850
collectively now with other discipline
 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.800
collectively now with other discipline
groups I am still invested in the

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810
groups I am still invested in the
 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.360

peculiarity in the specificity of an

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370
peculiarity in the specificity of an
 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.610
peculiarity in the specificity of an
architectural object but I'm much more

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620
architectural object but I'm much more
 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.400

interested in what the other discipline

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410
interested in what the other discipline
 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.920
interested in what the other discipline
groups can bring to it and the degree to

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930
groups can bring to it and the degree to
 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.770
groups can bring to it and the degree to
which my engagement with them can

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780
which my engagement with them can
 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.100
which my engagement with them can
specify the parameters that propel the

specify the parameters that propel the
 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.970
specify the parameters that propel the
design process and in turn the object

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980
design process and in turn the object
 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.370
design process and in turn the object
but it gives us more lateral freedom to

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380
but it gives us more lateral freedom to
 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.409
but it gives us more lateral freedom to
produce new forms of knowledge to

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419
produce new forms of knowledge to
 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.330
produce new forms of knowledge to
incorporate others in it and to make it

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340
incorporate others in it and to make it
 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.880
incorporate others in it and to make it
smarter
