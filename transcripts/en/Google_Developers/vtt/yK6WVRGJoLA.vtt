[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.600
OkHi is a start-up in Nairobi.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.550
And our mission is to
give a physical address

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.610
to the 4 billion people in
the world who don't have one.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.710
The problem is so
global and if there's

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.480
any two words that people know
in any language in the world,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.170
it's OK and hi.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.400
So, put them together, OkHi.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.950
No one had it-- OkHi.com--
no one was searching for it.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.690
There was no SEO.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.619
So OkHi it was.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.270
There's two developers--
one front end developer,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.160
one back end
engineer-- a designer,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.820
a sort of all around
hustler or he's kind

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.890
of like our lean process guru.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.680
He's the guy that runs the
processes day in, day out,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.500
of running these hypothesis
prints that we use.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.720
And we have a user
experience researcher

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.000
who spends, along with the
designer, a lot of time

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.860
out of the building trying to
understand what are the use

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.239
cases, are the products
or prototypes that we

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.770
built working, if not, why not?

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.320
It's just inspiring.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.650
There's such big problems
that technology can solve,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.460
and that technology is
about to be able to solve.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.530
For the first time,
with ubiquitous data

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.930
and cheap smartphones and access
to internet, for a business

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.680
or for an organization
to solve these problems,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.160
they can do that
in a scalable way

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.000
that I don't think has
ever been possible before.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.880
And so it's just very inspiring
to see other start-ups

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.520
and businesses solving
these problems.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.260
And I think for me,
personally, I've

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.970
got a much bigger chance to
solve a bigger problem here

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.160
than if I was doing something
in London or San Francisco.
