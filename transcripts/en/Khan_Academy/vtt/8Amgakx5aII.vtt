00:00:00.428 --> 00:00:01.795
- [Voiceover] Let's say that we have

00:00:01.795 --> 00:00:05.536
the differential equation
dy dx or the derivative

00:00:05.536 --> 00:00:10.536
of y with respect to x is
equal to negative x over y.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.844
Let's say we don't know how
to find the solutions to this,

00:00:14.844 --> 00:00:16.845
but we at least want to get a sense

00:00:16.944 --> 00:00:19.012
of what the solutions might look like.

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:22.337
And to do that what we
could do is we could look

00:00:22.337 --> 00:00:26.811
at a coordinate plane, so
let me draw some axes here.

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:31.171
So let me draw relatively
straight line alright.

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:36.288
So that's my y-axis and this is my x-axis.

00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:43.820
Let me mark this as one, that's
two, that's negative one,

00:00:43.082 --> 00:00:48.082
negative two, one, two,
negative one, and negative two.

00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:54.210
And what I could do is since
this differential equation

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:57.962
is just in terms of xs and
ys and first derivatives

00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:02.476
of y with respect to x, I
could sample points on the

00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:05.382
coordinate plane, I could look
at the x and y coordinates

00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:07.079
substitute them in here, figure out

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:08.686
what the slope is going to be.

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:11.323
And then I could visualize
the slope if a solution

00:01:11.323 --> 00:01:14.161
goes through that point what
the slope needs to be there

00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:16.176
and I can visualize that
with a line segment,

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.642
a little small line segment that has

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:20.364
the same slope as the slope in question.

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:22.745
So let's actually do that.

00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:24.926
So let me setup a little table here.

00:01:25.978 --> 00:01:27.083
I'm going to do a little table here

00:01:27.083 --> 00:01:29.110
to do a bunch of x and y values.

00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:30.455
Once again I'm just sampling some points

00:01:30.554 --> 00:01:32.647
on the coordinate plane
to be able to visualize.

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:38.133
So x, y and this is dy dx.

00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:43.983
So let's say when x is zero and y is one,

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.137
what is the derivative
of y with respect to x?

00:01:47.453 --> 00:01:49.017
It's going to be negative zero over one

00:01:49.017 --> 00:01:50.814
so it's just going to be zero.

00:01:51.387 --> 00:01:54.543
And so at the point zero one
if a solution goes through

00:01:54.543 --> 00:01:57.740
this point its slope is going to be zero.

00:01:57.977 --> 00:02:00.480
And so we can visualize
that by doing a little

00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:02.317
horizontal line segment right there.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.412
So let's keep going.

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:08.860
What about when x is one and y is one?

00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:12.138
Well then dy dx, the derivative
of y with respect to x

00:02:12.138 --> 00:02:15.390
is negative one over one, so
it's going to be negative one.

00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:19.377
So at the point one comma
one if a solution goes

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:24.377
through that point, it would
have a slope of negative one.

00:02:26.236 --> 00:02:27.558
And so I draw a little line segment

00:02:27.558 --> 00:02:29.436
that has a slope of negative one.

00:02:31.358 --> 00:02:33.071
Let me do this in a new color.

00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:36.693
What about when x is one and y is zero?

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:40.656
Well then it's negative one over zero,

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:44.726
so this is actually
undefined, but it's a clue

00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:49.501
that maybe the slope there
if you had a tangent line

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.472
at that point, maybe it's vertical.

00:02:51.472 --> 00:02:56.472
So I'll put that as a
question mark, vertical there.

00:02:56.887 --> 00:02:59.936
So maybe it's something
like that if you actually

00:03:00.377 --> 00:03:02.378
did have, I guess it
wouldn't be a function,

00:03:02.477 --> 00:03:05.208
if you had some kind of
relation that went through it,

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:08.419
but let's not draw that just yet.

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:09.815
But let's try some other points.

00:03:12.728 --> 00:03:16.434
Let's try the point
negative one negative one.

00:03:17.303 --> 00:03:20.325
So now we have negative negative one,

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:21.927
which is one, over negative one.

00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:24.245
Well you'd have a slope
of negative one here.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:25.970
So negative one negative one

00:03:25.097 --> 00:03:30.097
you'd have a slope of negative one.

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:35.620
What about if you had one negative one?

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:37.670
Well now it's negative one over

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:39.278
negative one, your slope is now one.

00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:43.418
So one negative one, if a
solution goes through this

00:03:43.418 --> 00:03:46.097
its slope would look like that.

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.024
And we could keep going, we
could even do two negative two.

00:03:49.465 --> 00:03:52.586
That's going to have a
slope of one as well.

00:03:52.978 --> 00:03:56.937
If you did positive two positive two,

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:58.262
that would be negative two over two.

00:03:58.262 --> 00:04:00.790
You'd have a slope of
negative one right over here.

00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:05.230
And so we could do a bunch
of points, just keep going.

00:04:05.023 --> 00:04:06.855
Now I'm just doing them in my head,

00:04:07.062 --> 00:04:08.284
I'm not going on the table.

00:04:08.284 --> 00:04:10.272
But you get a sense of
what's going on here.

00:04:10.272 --> 00:04:13.177
Here you're slope, what if
it was negative one one?

00:04:13.177 --> 00:04:16.161
It's going to have a slope of one.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:19.079
So at this point your
slope negative one one

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.236
so negative negative one is one over one,

00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:23.464
so you're going to have a slope like that.

00:04:23.464 --> 00:04:26.332
At negative two two same exact idea,

00:04:26.332 --> 00:04:27.505
it would look like that.

00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:30.268
And so when you keep
drawing these line segments

00:04:30.268 --> 00:04:33.351
over these kind of sample
points in the cartesian

00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:37.023
or in the x-y plane, you
start to get a sense of

00:04:37.023 --> 00:04:39.770
well what would a solution have to do.

00:04:40.127 --> 00:04:43.443
And you can start to visualize
that hey maybe a solution

00:04:44.464 --> 00:04:49.464
would have to do something like this.

00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:52.820
This would be a solution,
so maybe it would

00:04:52.082 --> 00:04:53.731
have to do something like this.

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:58.861
Or if we're looking only at
functions and not relations

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:02.276
I'll make it so it's very clear.

00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:04.562
So maybe it would have to
do something like this.

00:05:04.562 --> 00:05:09.006
Or if the function started
here based on what we've

00:05:09.006 --> 00:05:14.006
seen so far maybe it would
have to do something like this.

00:05:15.424 --> 00:05:20.212
Or if this were a point
on the function over here,

00:05:20.212 --> 00:05:23.524
it would have to do something like this.

00:05:23.524 --> 00:05:25.020
And once again I'm doing this based on

00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:27.336
what the slope field is telling me.

00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:31.430
So this field that I'm
creating where I'm sampling

00:05:31.043 --> 00:05:32.531
a bunch of points and I'm visualizing

00:05:32.918 --> 00:05:34.635
the slope with a line segement.

00:05:34.635 --> 00:05:39.635
Once again this is called a slope field.

00:05:42.805 --> 00:05:43.996
So hopefully that gives you kind of

00:05:43.996 --> 00:05:45.894
the basic idea of what a slope field is.

00:05:45.894 --> 00:05:50.127
And the next two videos we'll
explore this idea even deeper.
