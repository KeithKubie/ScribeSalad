00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.250
How Does an LED Work?

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:14.769
An LED or “Light Emitting Diode” is basically
as the name describes; it is a special type

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.200
of diode that is specifically optimized to
give off light, usually in the visual or infrared

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.880
spectrum, as electricity is passed through
it.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.110
A diode is a special type of semiconductor
that has many uses.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.670
One of the principle uses though is to control
the direction of the flow of electricity.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.149
The most common type of diode does this by
using something called “p-n junctions”.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.899
This is just a fancy way of saying “magic”.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:40.899
😉

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.059
Really though, in simple terms, think of a
Dr. Pepper can divided in the middle.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.519
On one half you have made a semiconductive
material that you’ve added impurities to

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.590
so that it contains negatively charged carriers;
basically an abundance of electrons.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.789
We then call this side an “n-type semiconductor”.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.570
On the other half you’ve done the same thing,
except you’ve introduced impurities that

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.540
contain positively charged carriers; basically
think of it like a bunch of holes that need

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.110
filled by electrons.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.220
We call this side a “p-type semiconductor”.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.620
So we have on one side an n-type semiconductor
and on the other side a p-type semiconductor.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.330
The boundary between these two is called the
“p-n junction”.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600
This is where all the magic happens.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.760
It turns out that conventional current will
travel from one side to the other, but doesn’t

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.780
like to go in the opposite direction.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.730
So you can use this to make sure electricity
only flows in the direction you want it to

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.110
in your circuit (among a lot of other things;
seriously diodes are crazy useful in a variety

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.920
of ways and various specialized diodes can
do some other interesting things, which I

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.550
won’t go into in this article, but will
probably revisit at some point.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.480
Generally speaking, these p-n junctions are
at the heart of almost all semiconductor electronic

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.480
devices).

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.920
So how are these diodes modified to produce
light?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.020
Well it turns out they don’t really need
to be modified at all to produce a form of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.020
light radiation.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.340
However, standard diodes tend to be made of
materials that absorb most of the light radiation

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.450
given off and more importantly tend not to
give off the light in human-visible form anyways.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.409
What’s going on here is, as the electricity
jumps across the p-n junction, the electrons

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.849
from the “n-type” side “fill holes”
in the “p-type” side.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.990
During this process, the electrons end up
changing their state.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.189
During this state change, a photon is emitted.

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:35.349
More specifically what is going on is, as
electrons move around orbiting a nucleus of

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:43.190
an atom, electrons with different orbits have
different amounts of energy.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.859
Electrons with orbits farther away from the
nucleus have greater energy and ones closer

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:48.859
have less energy.

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:49.859
P-N Junction

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.530
So in order for an electron to change its
orbit, it needs to either lose energy or gain

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.530
energy.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.279
What we are interested in with LEDs are the
electrons going from a higher orbit to a lower

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:03.209
orbit, thus losing energy in the form of a
photon of light.

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.010
When the electrons from the n-type side “fill
the holes” in the p-type side, they then

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.120
lose energy in the form of these light photons.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.359
The greater the energy release, the higher
the frequency the light photon given off,

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.430
thus changing the color.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.170
If the frequency ends up being in the human
visible spectrum (the range your eyes can

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.390
see), then you’ll see the light being given
off by the LED.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.501
If not, such as when given off in the infrared
spectrum, then you won’t see it.

00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:33.489
But it can still be useful, such as in allowing
you to change the channel on your TV (infrared

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.769
LEDs are typically used in your TV remote
control among many other places).

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.919
When you press a button on your remote, you
don’t see the light, but the receiver on

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:46.879
your TV can see it and can interpret what
it’s seeing from the infrared LED.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.060
In LEDs, the light that ends up being created
depends then on the material being used and

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.010
the current that is run through it.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.829
The light in a standard diode has the atoms
arranged so that the electron drop in energy

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.749
is very short and thus the frequency of light
given off isn’t visible to our eyes, rather

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:04.939
is in the infrared.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:10.529
So simply put, LEDs where you can see the
light are made of semiconductor materials

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:15.730
that create a bigger drop in the electron’s
orbit so that the frequency of the photon

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.180
packet comes out in the human visual spectrum.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.960
They can even be designed so that the amount
of electricity flowing through them will actually

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:39.050
change the drop and so you can have a multi-color
LED.
