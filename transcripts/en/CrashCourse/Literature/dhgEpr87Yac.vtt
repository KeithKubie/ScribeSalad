00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.330
Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.150
And today we’ll continue our discussion
of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, a

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.510
book that reads like it was written by your
funny and mean best friend, who also happens

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.750
to be a brilliant novelist and a pretty interesting
moral philosopher.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.299
/
I mean, I love my best friend, but I REALLY

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.480
wish Jane Austen was my best friend.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.340
But let’s face it, she wouldn’t have been
that into me.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.890
Last time we talked about the political context
of the novel, and how to choose between your

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.769
personal fulfillment and the good of your
family.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.480
Today we’ll look at whether it’s an endorsement
of materialism or a rejection of it.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.590
We’ll also consider the novel’s politics--whether
it’s liberal or conservative in its outlook.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.760
And we’ll enjoy some sexy, sexy landscape
description.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.750
But first let’s consider the epistemological
problems of the novel.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.180
Because here at Crash Course we know how to
party.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.870
And also we just learned the meaning of the
word epistemological.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.140
Let’s go.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.069
INTRO
So, epistomology is the study of knowledge--it’s

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:10.450
knowing how we know, and what it means to
know.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.609
And knowledge is a real problem in Pride and
Prejudice--much of the plot hinges on what

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:19.950
people know and when they know it, and how
they can be sure of knowledge.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.700
Remember this is Regency England.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.130
If you like someone you can’t immediately
Google them or snapchat them or, I don’t

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.130
know.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.279
Compared to today’s young people, I basically
grew up in Regency England.

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:37.109
At the beginning of the novel, Jane and Mr.
Bingley meet, but Jane has no way to let him

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:38.939
know that she likes him.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.090
She can’t just swipe right, or left--I really,
I don’t know.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.719
I don’t know any of this stuff..

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.499
I’m trying to sound young, and hip, and
relatable, and I should just give up because

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:51.060
I’m one year younger than Jane Austen was
when she DIED.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.640
I’m sorry, what were we talking about?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.869
Right.

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.779
Jane has no way of discovering just how available
he is.

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:01.399
/
Characters have to rely on gossip, subtle

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.049
inquiries sometimes in the form of letters,
and what they can see with their own eyes.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.769
But Austen is skeptical about whether or not
you can trust the evidence of your own eyes.

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.530
When Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy see each other
they hate each other.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.340
/
And months go by before they learn enough

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.610
about each other to readjust those initial
impressions.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.459
Mr. Darcy’s pride flourishes because he
doesn’t know or understand the people around

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.459
him.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.470
The same goes for Elizabeth’s prejudice.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.260
In addition to constantly reminding us how
little we know about other people, Austen

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.379
also questions how little we know of ourselves.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.290
Elizabeth is the character that most of us
will identify with.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.569
Austen wrote in a letter, “I think her as
delightful a character as ever appeared in

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.700
print, and how I shall be able to tolerate
those who do not like her at least, I do not

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.700
know.”

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.700
/
Well, she was good, and she knew it.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.519
But even clever Elizabeth has to admit that
she has been mistaken in most of her beliefs,

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.430
particularly ones about herself.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.099
/
Once she learns the truth of the bad feelings

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.379
between Darcy and Wickham, she has to acknowledge
her own prejudices and even says, “Till

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.180
this moment, I never knew myself.”

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.799
One of the most fascinating things Austen
does in this book is to put the reader into

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.430
the place of not knowing.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.569
Take the scene in which Elizabeth watches
Wickham, whom she likes, and Mr. Darcy, whom

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.810
she hates, run into each other.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.379
/
At this point, she believes that Mr. Darcy

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.469
has cheated Wickham of his inheritance, but
when she sees them, she doesn’t know what

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.290
to believe:
“Elizabeth happening to see the countenance

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.299
of both as they looked at each other, was
all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.720
Both changed colour, one looked white, the
other red.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.900
Mr. Wickham after a few moments, touched his
hat -- a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.159
to return.

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.860
What could be the meaning of it?”

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.090
Not only do we not know why one turned white
and one turned red, we don’t even know who

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.390
turned which color.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.180
Elizabeth presumably knows that, of course,
but by calling attention to what we as readers

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.430
don’t know, Austen is also reminding us
of all that Elizabeth doesn’t know--just

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.069
how often she has to wonder, What could be
the meaning of it?.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.760
Speaking of meaning, Pride and Prejudice spends
a lot of time examining the meaning of money.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.049
Austen lets us know how much everyone has,
where it comes from, how much they stand to

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.049
inherit, and so on.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.370
Let’s check everyone’s accounts in the
Thoughtbubble.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.819
Mr. Bennet has 2,000 pounds per year, which
just about puts him into the upper middle

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:17.819
class.

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.340
But because his estate is entailed and will
be inherited by the nearest male relative

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.460
when he and his wife die, his daughters will
only have a share of what their mother brought

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.460
into the marriage.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.630
/
Each daughter will get about forty pounds

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.630
a year.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.660
It’s hard to estimate how much this is in
today’s money; it could mean as little as

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.820
a few thousand dollars though, so definitely
not enough to live comfortably.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.870
Mr. Bingley has at least 5,000 pounds per
year, which is very nice.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.280
But Darcy has at least double that every year
from rents on his land.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.199
He might make even more on the interest from
his investments, so it’s safe to think of

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.870
him as kind of a multimillionaire.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.949
His sister Georgiana has an inheritance of
30,000, so even assuming a conservative investment,

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.080
she’ll be fine.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.361
Wickham inherited 1,000 pounds from Mr. Darcy’s
father and then Mr. Darcy gave him 3,000 more

00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:04.550
when Wickham decided to quit the clergy.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.270
But he spent it all, so he’ll need to marry
rich.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.360
Obviously Lydia isn’t rich, but between
paying his debts and buying his commission,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.300
Mr. Darcy gives Wickham another 1,500 pounds.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.449
Plus, he may even have given him 10,000 more
in order to convince him to marry Lydia and

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:20.449
avoid scandal.

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.720
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:31.390
So how much money everyone has is obviously
very important and indicates moral worth,

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.789
right?

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.199
Maybe.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.550
Darcy is certainly richer than Wickham, and
morally superior.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.940
But in a couple of places the novel seems
to make the point that money isn’t everything.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.759
Mr. Darcy’s aunt, Lady Catherine has plenty
of money, but that doesn’t stop her from

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.240
being portrayed as a killjoy and a snob.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.180
Austen satirizes her materialism, like the
way Lady Catherine pays attention to how nice

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.710
people’s carriages are or how Mr. Collins
fawns over Lady Catherine and her daughter

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.949
just because they’re rich.

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.470
/
But Austen satirizes materialism in people

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.000
who have less money, too, like Wickham with
his debts.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.830
The book is also pretty hard on Lydia who
can’t afford to buy lunch for her sisters

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.460
because she’s spent all her money on a disgusting
hat, saying, “Look here, I have bought this

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.460
bonnet.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.740
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought
I might as well buy it as not.”

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.639
/
Here, Austen seems to be suggesting that how

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:23.389
you spend money probably matters as much or
more than how much of it you have.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.229
/ / /
Quick side note: The growing industrialization

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.789
of England meant that more artifacts were
available to the average person.

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:34.419
And when I say artifacts, I mean everything
from, you know, pots and pans to clothing.

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.140
Even a generation or two before, the middle
class had been vastly smaller, and there weren’t

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.639
as many, like, materials to be materialistic
about.

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.819
So almost all people, almost all of the time
would have been buying lunch, rather than

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:46.819
buying bonnets.

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:52.039
Maybe, then money can actually chip away at
personal happiness and moral character?

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.310
Again, not exactly.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.810
Austen doesn’t come out and say that you
should marry for money, but the novel does

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.069
seem to endorse the idea that the characters
who acquire the most money will be the happiest.

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:09.800
Clearly Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy will live
happily ever after and so will Jane and Mr.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800
Bingley.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.370
Charlotte and Mr. Collins are only a little
happy, because Mr. Collins is almost as horrible

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.260
as Mary, but they’ll probably be happier
once Mr. Collins inherits.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.240
And it doesn’t seem like Lydia and Wickham,
who have the least, won’t be happy at all.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.310
They don’t even like each other by the time
the book ends.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.729
And it’s only Mr. Darcy’s money that saved
Lydia from total disgrace.

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:32.870
And also, we need to remember how and why
Elizabeth falls in love with Mr. Darcy.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.900
Part of it is the letter he sends and part
of it has to do with how he rescues her sister,

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.970
but a lot of it has to do with his estate,
Pemberley.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.340
When Elizabeth first sees Pemberley, we get
a rare passage of description in the book:

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.740
“It was a large, handsome, stone building,
standing well on rising ground, and backed

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:56.380
by a ridge of high woody hills;—and in front,
a stream of some natural importance was swelled

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.550
into greater, but without any artificial appearance…
and at that moment she felt that to be mistress

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.659
of Pemberley might be something!”

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:07.990
Now, obviously this is a stand-in for Mr.
Darcy himself, who is also large and handsome

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.169
and not artificial.

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:13.819
But it’s the revelation of his beautiful
estate that really wins Elizabeth’s heart,

00:08:13.819 --> 00:08:18.960
which suggests that even Pemberley isn’t
just a metaphor for Darcy; Darcy is also a

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.960
metaphor for Pemberley.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.919
Now, it’s easy to argue that this is a conservative
book.

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.080
Everyone gets married in the end.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.580
Elizabeth gets to be both happy and rich.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:31.020
Mr. Darcy, an authoritarian figure who holds
power over a lot of people, turns out to be

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.020
the hero.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.270
And Wickham, the upstart who comes from the
servant class, is the villain.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:40.890
So the established social hierarchy gets reaffirmed
in terms of class, and also in terms of gender.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:46.260
Elizabeth seemed so free-thinking and independent-minded,
but her reward is to subjugate herself to

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.630
the wealthy aristocrat who said that her looks
were tolerable.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.630
So much for the rights of women.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.920
On the other hand, you could argue that the
book is a lot more radical than that.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:58.640
Yes, Mr. Darcy makes Elizabeth happy, but
arguing for her own individual happiness is

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.860
really progressive stance.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.660
Like, when Lady Catherine tries to get Elizabeth
to say that she will never marry Mr. Darcy,

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:08.790
Elizabeth replies, “I am only resolved to
act in that manner, which will, in my own

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.350
opinion, constitute my happiness.''

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.440
My own opinion.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.670
My happiness.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.830
Maybe that doesn’t sound revolutionary,
but it is.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.460
This book was written in a time when individual
happiness was not privileged over family status

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.080
and security,
And that was especially true for the individual

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.480
happiness of women.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.100
So Elizabeth saying that she would only act
in a manner that would constitute her happiness

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:43.070
is a claiming of full personhood, who has
the right to make her own decisions independent

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:48.480
of what her family wants for her--another
radical idea for women in Regency England

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.700
The novel also suggests that Elizabeth’s
vivacity will have a beneficial effect on

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:58.060
Mr. Darcy, hinting that it might be possible
to work from within to change some of the

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.320
older, more authoritarian systems.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:06.030
She’s not wild or flighty or always buying
terrible bonnets like Lydia, but she is independent-minded.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:12.030
The fact that Mr. Darcy falls for her suggests
that maybe he, and men like him, are capable

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.030
of change.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.060
Now this would be a darker novel or a more
radical one if it actually made Elizabeth

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:21.510
choose between happiness and financial security,
instead of presenting all of that—and Pemberley,

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.510
too—courtesy of Mr. Darcy.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:27.100
But it is no sin for a book to have a happy
ending, and Pride and Prejudice is still a

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.530
vindication of Elizabeth’s character and
temperament and it makes a really persuasive

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.660
argument for personal happiness as a moral
category worth celebrating.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:42.870
So go forth and pursue some happiness yourself.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:11:04.060
And thanks for watching.
