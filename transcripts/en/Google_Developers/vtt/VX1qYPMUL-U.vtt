JASON TITUS: Thank you, Paul.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.110
So we have a couple minutes
while we get the chairs set up.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.730
I did want to take a quick poll.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.480
After seeing all of
this great information

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.470
about the things you can
do on the mobile web,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.680
I wanted to see how many
people are actually going

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.870
to give to build out a
progressive mobile web app,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.430
going forward, based
on what you just saw?

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.900
All right.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.990
Very glad to hear it.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.700
We're certainly very excited
about all the things that

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.450
are now possible and
the improvements that

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.480
have been made to start to
make the mobile web much closer

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.860
to what the app experience is.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.070
Let's bring the
panel members out.

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:46.180
So I hope you guys
have been enjoying

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.770
the content this evening.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.983
I know we had--

00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:51.881
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.545
So I'm really happy
to bring together

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:03.670
a set of folks who have
experience both in building

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.360
apps and investing
in their ecosystem

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.480
here, as well as
building products

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.380
for consumers across India.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.020
So very quickly, we have
Anand, who's the Chief Product

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.240
Officer from Snapdeal.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.530
Nishant is here.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.610
He's CEO and co-founder
of CultureAlley,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.030
who makes Hello English.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.720
We have Sudhir, who is the
Managing Director IDG Ventures.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.115
And we have Jay Kota, who
is from Google and managing

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:38.440
the engineering in
the Hyderabod office.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.300
So as a first
question, I was going

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.880
to ask an easy one
to get started.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.720
So what is some
of the advice you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.700
would give someone who's just
getting started in this market?

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.510
Like if they're early,
early stage, what

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.510
are the things from what
you've learned that you

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.343
think would be the most
useful bit of advice

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:55.115
to get them going?

00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:00.910
Right here.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.700
NISHANT PATNI: So
from my perspective--

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.420
I think Scott talked about
this earlier as well--

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.520
I think what's most
critical is to stay focused

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.460
on a particular pain point and
keep talking to the customer,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.770
again and again, while
you're reiterating.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.710
So in my sense, it's
just about designing it

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.960
correctly for this one,
target customer that you have.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.043
It's understand his pain
point and talking to them

00:02:22.043 --> 00:02:22.734
again and again.

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:24.900
And really, it's designing
it to solve that problem.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.970
Oftentimes, as
engineers, we start out

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.577
from what we can do versus
what is it that's really needed

00:02:30.577 --> 00:02:31.660
to solve that point point.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.557
And I think that's where we
need to continue to be focused.

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:39.015
JASON TITUS: Sudhir, how about
for companies you invest in?

00:02:39.015 --> 00:02:39.806
SUDHIR SETHI: Yeah.

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:42.880
I think what we've seen is
what succeeds at the seed

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.300
and early stage is
solve a problem.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.830
I think that's a very
fundamental issue.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.059
You're not building the
best technology, or the best

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:52.600
product, or the best
service-- you're

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.011
solving a real, real problem.

00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:55.510
And that, obviously,
has corollaries

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.580
of better technology
and a better product.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.390
I think the second issue
is execute, execute,

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.776
execute to perfection.

00:03:04.776 --> 00:03:06.150
And I would just
leave it at that

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.930
because there's nothing like
capital efficient execution.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.670
There's nothing like
timely execution.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.310
There's nothing like execution.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.670
And those firms which have done
this right from the beginning

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.694
develop a DNA which is
unsurpassable by anybody else.

00:03:25.694 --> 00:03:26.562
JASON TITUS: Yeah.

00:03:26.562 --> 00:03:28.300
Exactly.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.860
JAY KOTA: So first of
all, if you're actually

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.570
working on start ups and
[INAUDIBLE], probably

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.350
congratulations.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.724
This is the right
time, in India,

00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:38.590
to actually try out your idea.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.760
Certainly.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.840
One of the things that we have
noticed over a period of time

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.450
is that India is a
very diverse market.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.410
So start making
some early insights

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.320
and building early
insights around what

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.170
you're trying to solve.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.090
And be ready to be proven wrong.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.400
So a lot of times, you don't
actually get the market

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.840
or you may not get the market
exactly at the first time.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.290
It needs lot of iteration.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.220
So that's one thing.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.310
Be open.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.960
Be ready to be proven wrong.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.850
Build feedback loops, whether
it's the user testing,

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.740
A/B testing, data analysis.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.970
It's really important to
learn, and tune, and pivot

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.720
your strategy.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.670
A few other things we
heard in the past sessions

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.800
around fit for India.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.500
So these are important.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.960
Most of the issues are
really, really relevant

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.200
to the end users.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.700
I think those are
some of the things

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.330
that you really
have to worry about.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.000
JASON TITUS: So actually,
one of the points

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.430
you raised is, I believe, really
relevant for a couple of you.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.450
With the diversity of India--
I've only been here a few days,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:57.680
but just seeing the wide range
of experiences, and language,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.142
and sort of the
urban, rural split--

00:05:01.142 --> 00:05:02.850
when you're building
out a product that's

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.100
supposed to go
across all of India,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.900
how do you balance these things?

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.174
Anand, do you--

00:05:09.174 --> 00:05:10.840
ANAND CHANDRASEKARAN:
I had a nice story

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.180
planned for the last question.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.124
[LAUGHING]

00:05:13.124 --> 00:05:14.540
JASON TITUS: Well, feel free.

00:05:16.755 --> 00:05:19.130
ANAND CHANDRASEKARAN: This is
actually very fresh for us.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.120
I think one of the
things that struck me

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.090
when I started building
products in India

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.860
was that it's
really like building

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.960
for 22 different countries.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.510
And I think to try to
build for one persona can

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.930
be very frustrating.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.630
And I would say,
more than anything,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.620
just embrace the fact that
there is 22 different personas.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.350
It means that if you
succeed with, let's say,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.520
five, or six, or seven
of them, you probably

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.350
are going to have quite
a sizable user base.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.160
And so it's actually
an opportunity.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.145
And so I think there
are so many examples.

00:05:57.145 --> 00:05:58.520
There is an entire
company that I

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.290
met when I was at Airtel,
which had built a $100 million

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.190
business and didn't have
a single smartphone user.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.120
It was a start up called Vuclip,
whose entire user base was only

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.705
on 2G phones.

00:06:09.705 --> 00:06:11.080
And actually, they
were wondering

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.910
how they were going to
go after smartphone users

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.820
because, at that time, they
didn't have a single smartphone

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.150
user.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.710
And it actually blew
my mind that you

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.665
could build $100 million video
business in India with very

00:06:25.665 --> 00:06:28.400
little smartphone user base.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.050
And so I think it's actually
more of an opportunity

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.630
that you might think.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.170
The other thing I
would say is, in a way,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.860
tying it to the last question.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.080
I think it's very important
to come in every so often

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.440
and take a fresh look
at your own business.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.134
I think things are changing
incredibly fast in India.

00:06:49.134 --> 00:06:51.550
And I think just because you
assume something three months

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.219
ago, it may not be valid today.

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:56.260
And so I would almost go
to the extent of saying,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.710
assume that you got
fired, and new people came

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.880
into the business, and
they had no baggage,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.470
and they were just looking
at everything a fresh.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.300
What decisions would they
make about the business today?

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.520
And sometimes that cycle
might be even once every

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.910
three months because there are
just so many smartphone users.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.300
The number one
smartphone vendor seems

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.460
to be evolving every three
months in India as well.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.920
So I think it's actually more
of an opportunity than probably

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.787
any other part of the world.

00:07:25.787 --> 00:07:27.620
JASON TITUS: Are there
things that, with you

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.380
trying to go after
non-English speakers,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.296
you had to go through?

00:07:30.296 --> 00:07:31.970
NISHANT PATNI: Absolutely.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.570
And just to give you a
context, I'm actually that one.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.920
I'm just sitting wrong.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.280
But we are actually
behind this app

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.560
called the Hello English
app, which is actually

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.360
helping about 85
[INAUDIBLE] learners

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.540
speak basic, conversational
English every day.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.300
So we are, currently, the number
one educational app in India.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.950
But what that does is it
takes 15 different vernacular

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.640
language speakers and helps them
learn basic English that they

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.115
can use if they are a
driver, or if they are

00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:02.360
a delivery boy, or something.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.640
And it allows them to use it
offline, on their smart phones.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.610
So now, the question that you
mentioned about how do you

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.750
deal with the diversity,
in terms of cultures.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.320
It's very interesting for
us because we don't see this

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.660
as one behemoth, when we're
dealing with this customer

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.250
base.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.720
We actually cut each of
these linguistic communities

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.530
differently.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.810
And we actually design for
each of them independently.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.049
Because what happens
is when somebody's

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.030
starting to think
in Tamil and he's

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.064
trying to converse
in English, it's

00:08:36.064 --> 00:08:37.480
completely different
from somebody

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.960
who's starting out from
Hindi, or Urdu, or Bengali,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.940
for that matter.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.270
So we treat each of these
linguistic communities pretty

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.420
much independent.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.530
And then all the
content that we design

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.570
for them are really keeping
these subtleties in mind.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.380
That's one.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.550
The other thing is that
reaching to such a large user

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.830
base in India required
us to really re-think

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.830
the tech behind the app.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.600
And as the session before
really pointed out,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.810
we've design the app
such that it works

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.640
offline in most scenarios.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.390
So what we see is people
will download our app,

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.560
and take them to their
villages, and distribute them

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.106
to their near and dear ones.

00:09:18.106 --> 00:09:19.480
And the way it's
been designed is

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.870
that it will continue
to work offline

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.162
perfectly well, for most cases.

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.828
Only if you have to
update your content,

00:09:24.828 --> 00:09:26.640
do you need to come
online to do it.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.104
And that sort of helped
us a lot in gaining

00:09:29.104 --> 00:09:31.312
this sort of traction and
reaching out to the masses.

00:09:31.312 --> 00:09:33.460
JASON TITUS: Yeah.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.620
One of unique things about
this kind of user base,

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.411
where you have so many
people coming online

00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:39.580
for the first time, is
that they don't necessarily

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.479
have an expectation for
how things should work.

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:44.020
And you really have
the opportunity--

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.311
you have both the challenge
and the opportunity of they

00:09:46.311 --> 00:09:48.920
don't necessarily have the
experience that you can just

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.110
guide them how you've
got other users,

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.762
but you also have
somewhat of a clean slate.

00:09:53.762 --> 00:09:55.220
You get to come up
with new things.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.550
How do you guys deal
with both of those?

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.470
ANAND CHANDRASEKARAN: So
I'll take a crack at that.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.700
Just speaking from
our perspective,

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.240
we started an e-commerce a
little over three years ago

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.370
and there have been
established players

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.075
who've had probably 10,000
people, $500 million

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.720
in funding.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.290
And yet we're roughly neck
and neck in e-commerce today.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.310
And we actually had an internal
conversation about that.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.150
And we were saying, actually,
we should be really paranoid.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.830
We really worried about
that because if someone

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:37.030
like us could start a
business in that same space

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.375
and just use really
good execution

00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:42.500
to get neck and neck with
someone who's been around

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.850
for five more years,
then maybe there's

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.840
someone there today who
could do that tomorrow.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.420
I think, from the perspective
of the question you're asking,

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.096
there are so many people coming
online with just no baggage

00:10:56.096 --> 00:10:57.470
and the smartphone
is pretty much

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.630
the only device they've seen.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.160
And so the fact that you might
have had a great PC experience

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.270
means nothing to them.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:06.860
They're just consuming
from their phone.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.680
The fact that you
had a great iOS app

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.440
might mean nothing to them.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.300
And so I think that context
is extremely important.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.070
And as previous speakers
were saying, a lot of them

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.280
could only consume
you from mobile web.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.990
And they might not even
know that you have an app

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.190
or that you have a
desktop experience.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.030
So I think it's
extremely important

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.110
to have a great experience
across all form factors

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.740
because you never know what that
journey is going to look like.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.304
And also, one of
the things that's

00:11:36.304 --> 00:11:38.970
been shocking for me is that you
might think that someone coming

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.080
online for the first time might
have very modest aspirations

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.060
for what they want to do online.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.430
In fact, the opposite is true.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.630
They want everything.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.630
And they want everything
with the same intensity

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.090
that any of us would want it.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.620
And so the adoption
that we see-- sometimes

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.640
you think, maybe they
need a crash course

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.090
in how to do e-commerce.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.640
And actually, they don't.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.260
They understand what
cash on delivery is.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.450
They understand what
delivery promises.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.530
So very complex,
e-commerce concepts

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.070
that we try to
explain internally

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.740
are very obvious
to people coming

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.120
online for the first time.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.950
So actually, the learning
curve is incredibly fast.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:19.230
And so, in a very timely
sense, we launched our service

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.450
in 12 languages yesterday.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.130
And we feel like
the people who will

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.770
consume it are not the
same people who consumed us

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.640
in English.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.990
And so to Nishant's
point, I think

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.740
the context is very different
for someone who's only

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.780
going to use us in Gujarati.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.150
They don't care that we have
a great English experience.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.720
So I think that's a bit
of scary thing, actually.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.260
The fact that someone
could start today,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.790
and have a great
language experience,

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.525
and could become
as big as someone

00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:51.816
who's been around for eight
years, or nine years, or 10

00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:51.930
years.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.230
JASON TITUS: So you're
starting over, again and again,

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.178
in each of these
different languages.

00:12:55.178 --> 00:12:56.970
SUDHIR SETHI: I'll
just add to that.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.510
I think the onboarding
experience of a new consumer--

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.530
technology baseline
today is such,

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:08.230
whether it's a four year old
child or an 80 year old adult,

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.790
that I haven't seen much
of a time difference

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.010
except for just
because of the age.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.460
And I'll give you an
example, which is last week,

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.600
we had to go to Ajanta and
Ellora to see the caves.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.440
And my driver had actually
never used Google Maps earlier.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.110
So I just told him, how come
you're not using Google Maps?

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.970
He took two trips, within
the city of Bangalore,

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.910
from maybe eight
to 10 kilometers,

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.010
to onboard himself
onto Google Maps.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.100
He downloaded it
himself, by the way,

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.210
because he knows how to
download [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.910
And to that extent, for
him, Google Map download

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.590
was no difference.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:48.590
And we drove down from
Bangalor to Aurangabad

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.030
using Google Maps.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.836
So the onboarding process,
because of baseline technology,

00:13:53.836 --> 00:13:54.460
is very simple.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.320
So I don't think that's a
big issue in today's market.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.929
Whether it is product discovery,
e-commerce, service discovery,

00:14:00.929 --> 00:14:02.220
I don't think it's a big issue.

00:14:04.866 --> 00:14:06.970
JAY KOTA: I'm not
sure if my mic--

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.580
I would like to borrow
one of the quotes

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.800
from Nandan Nilekani.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.180
He keeps talking
about, how do you

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.420
take advantage of no legacy,
when it comes to India?

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.500
I really feel like
starting from a clean state

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.750
really empowers
in some use cases.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.060
There's a chance to
leapfrog, like what

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.959
you see happening probably
in the payments right now.

00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:32.000
Like India maybe leapfrogs
and create [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.850
all together.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.550
Maybe India goes
directly into phone

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.470
as a Wallet mobile payments.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.760
So there's some
interesting experiences

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.970
that you can think of without
worrying about legacy.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.750
So that's one point to
really take advantage of.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.460
From a user experience
point of view,

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:54.880
I see a lot of Indian apps
trying different gamifications.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.350
Normally, it's
kind of violating,

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.990
let's say, established standards
of apps in the Western world,

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.940
but it's very
successful in India.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.630
So it kind of gives us
a chance to challenge,

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.890
and start fresh, and start
from first principles,

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:12.730
and do things right.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.300
JASON TITUS: So what
kinds of technology

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.550
do you feel are really missing?

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.320
One of things that seemed clear
from what others are saying

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.240
is with all of these different
scripts and things like that,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.680
it sounds like a lot of
folks are having to come up

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.080
with their own solutions.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.490
What do you see as the
pieces that are missing

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:36.327
and that hold folks back for
making great experiences?

00:15:36.327 --> 00:15:37.160
NISHANT PATNI: Yeah.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.790
So I think, in our
case, one of the things

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:44.290
that poses challenges
is just the access bit.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.920
So one is, obviously, the
availability of infrastructure.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.600
And secondly, it's
just how affordability

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.500
is that infrastructure
to these users.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.870
And we really need to keep
these constraints in mind

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.540
when you have to
design a product which

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.480
can scale massively.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.090
So in our case,
what's interesting

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:08.200
is that every fourth user who
downloads our app, actually

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.870
downloads it from a
non-Play store source, which

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:16.196
means that he's getting it
from a Bluetooth channel,

00:16:16.196 --> 00:16:17.820
from somebody who's
sitting next to him

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.720
in his office, or a
friend, et cetera.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.750
But he's not wanting to
spend that 10 MB or 11 MB,

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.360
downloading it from
the Play store.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.834
So these are sort
of nuances that you

00:16:31.834 --> 00:16:33.750
need to sort of understand
when you're getting

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:36.360
into the shoes of the customer.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.240
And really, when you have
to design an experience,

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.800
you have to design it
under these limitations,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.010
so that it can benefit the
largest number of people.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.990
So in our case, it's this
access and the infrastructure,

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.000
which we keep in mind.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.255
And obviously, if this
was taken care of,

00:16:56.255 --> 00:16:58.130
we would have designed
a completely different

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:58.790
experience.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:04.000
It would be really a complete
voice recognition and image

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.650
recognition sort of experience.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.250
But now, given
these constraints,

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:12.869
we have to design for
whatever can sell the most.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:15.099
SUDHIR SETHI: This is
an interesting question.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.430
300 odd million internet users.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.819
Sometime in the future,
it's hopefully one billion.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.980
How do these one billion
people onboard themselves

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.980
for product discovery
and service discovery?

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.720
I think our viewpoint is that
interim solutions-- and this is

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.080
the investor
viewpoint-- are possibly

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.250
going to be keyboard
oriented, whether it

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:44.110
is a English to Hindi
transliteration or a keyboard.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:49.400
I think the natural
phenomena of voice

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.280
enabled transactions
is going to take over.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.850
And that's the only way, to my
mind, a large volume of people

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.300
will enable onboarding.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.340
To give an example, if
somebody in Tamil Nadu

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.660
wants to book a ticket,
they can go to Yatra

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.390
and try to key in all the stuff.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.020
If he doesn't know English and
if Tamil is not so efficient,

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.680
he actually can't
book that ticket.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.230
But if you just
says, in Tamil, I

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.310
want to book a ticket
from Delhi, to Chennai,

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.550
to Bangalore, then
is that transaction

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.440
possible to be completed?

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.120
So I think I agree
with what you said,

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.790
in terms of India skipping.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.310
India is a country
which skips many things.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.942
It skipped the phone.

00:18:34.942 --> 00:18:36.150
It skipped many other things.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.608
It's going to skip
the credit card.

00:18:37.608 --> 00:18:40.720
I think India's going to
skip the whole keyboard

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.730
orientation of
onboarding of a consumer

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.160
and literally look at
voice down the line.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.800
Let's see what happens.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.150
JASON TITUS: Interesting.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.566
JAY KOTA: I'm
probably going to be

00:18:51.566 --> 00:18:54.020
echoing some of the
feedback I've been

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.650
getting from the developers.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.910
One of the first things to
really proliferate in view

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.132
of India based other
apps is I keep hearing

00:19:03.132 --> 00:19:06.830
about mostly input
and output methods.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.300
Vernacular speech
recognition is a technology

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.920
I would totally want.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.920
Maybe handwriting
recognition as well.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.280
I feel like, if we can actually
support technology pieces that

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.940
helps apps deal with
slow connections

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.555
and shaky connections in
the network libraries, that

00:19:28.555 --> 00:19:31.820
could be a really
interesting infrastructure

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.690
to be used within the apps.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.590
In a way, [INAUDIBLE] offline
is a great tool to maybe use

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.130
and maybe we should
do more of that.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:45.872
That's pretty much it.

00:19:45.872 --> 00:19:47.330
ANAND CHANDRASEKARAN:
I think, just

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.310
building on the
conversation so far,

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.230
I would say there's probably a
ton of opportunity on the user

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.540
experience itself.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.290
It's just such a
fundamental part

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.360
of what people are consuming.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.360
Whether you take into
account what kind

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.740
of network connectivity
the person is on,

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:07.190
what kind of past experience
the person has had,

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.000
what the device
is capable of, you

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.340
know what people
like this person

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.420
have done in the past--
there's so much context

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.150
around a mobile experience.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.470
And I feel like, even today,
mobile experience is really

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.240
built as if they're desktop
experiences with only the IP

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.070
address available.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.950
You know what the
weather is like outside.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.380
You know where they user is.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.260
And you know if it's raining
around the user or not.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.660
You can probably detect if
the user's listening to music

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:37.540
while they're shopping or not.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.940
So I think all that
context has really not

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.960
been taken into account
and into the experience.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.180
And my sense is also what shows
up in the experience could

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.260
evolve a lot, based on context.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.790
And I feel like today,
at best, we probably

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.580
remember the last
item that was not

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.920
purchased in the shopping cart.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.190
And I think it feels,
to me, like it's still,

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.290
for lack of a better
way of saying it,

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:09.070
what worked for American
e-commerce has been imported

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.060
into India.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.840
Over the next few years,
I think e-commerce

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.740
will be built for the next 100
million people who come online.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.300
And as a result of it, there
will be an incredible amount

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:26.250
of disruption that happens both
for existing types of companies

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.845
that get built as well as
existing modes of consumption,

00:21:28.845 --> 00:21:30.340
et cetera.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.490
And I think a lot of
what we've discussed here

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.210
will sort of go in
as input material.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:39.000
Like for instance, if you take
slow connections as an example,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.470
one could say, look,
that's a temporary problem.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:42.680
It's going to go away.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.820
The fact is that
no telco in India

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.720
has more than five megahertz
of contiguous spectrum anywhere

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.000
in India.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.110
So it literally is
the laws of physics.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.340
They're never going to
have more than that amount

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.420
of bandwidth reliably available.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.490
And so slow connections
are a reality in India.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:01.760
But if I'm connected to
Wi-Fi at home, backed by a 4G

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.270
connection, the fact that I'm
otherwise on a slow connection

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:06.510
doesn't matter now.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.510
And so the experiences
have to be very different

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.302
when I'm on those two
different contexts.

00:22:10.302 --> 00:22:12.010
So I think that will
evolve considerably.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.500
JASON TITUS: So do
you all feel that some

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.000
of these solutions
that might be really

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.760
evolved here, in India, as
sort of unique experiences,

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.360
that you might actually be able
to be successful in bringing

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.800
them outside of India and
to other parts of the world?

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.347
And if so, what do you think
those opportunities are?

00:22:31.347 --> 00:22:32.222
Do you want to start?

00:22:32.222 --> 00:22:33.640
NISHANT PATNI: Yeah.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:33.808
SUDHIR SETHI: Sorry.

00:22:33.808 --> 00:22:33.920
Go ahead.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.172
NISHANT PATNI: No.

00:22:34.172 --> 00:22:34.340
Go ahead.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:35.540
SUDHIR SETHI: So absolutely.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.550
I think, based on some of the
companies which we have seen,

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:46.840
India has given tremendous scale
in a very short period of time.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.476
And I'll give you maybe
one or two examples.

00:22:49.476 --> 00:22:52.970
We have communicologists
in information security.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:58.980
And within the first three or
four years of their existence,

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.810
they enabled
information security

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.995
for the [INAUDIBLE] program.

00:23:01.995 --> 00:23:04.210
So in the fourth year
of their existence,

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:08.850
they had 350 million people
in India where information

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.000
security was enabled.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.650
Now for a company to
achieve 350 million people

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.640
was unheard of
anywhere in the world.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.130
That enabled them to go
into North America, the UK

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.030
and get large clients because
the platform capability

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.670
on scale was not questioned.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:28.789
So that's another example.

00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:30.330
We have another
company called NewGen

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.190
in traditional transformation.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:35.100
One of their first
customers was LIC in India.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.730
Then LIC has over 100
million insurance consumers.

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.750
So their additional
transformational platform

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.820
worked with 100
million consumers.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.757
For them to go
outside, there were not

00:23:46.757 --> 00:23:48.590
questioned on the
scalability of technology.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.590
So that's an example of how
not just the technology being

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:57.370
innovative, but the scale
of global corporations

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.590
or consumers from India works.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.600
NISHANT PATNI: Actually,
to your point, Sudhir,

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.060
even in our case, what
we did was we actually

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.870
just looked at India
and tried to design

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:11.570
a product for the
typical Indian consumer.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.150
But then, what we realized
was that very similar market

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.760
conditions exist as we look
outside of India as well.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.190
So what we did was we tried
using the same technology

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.640
and adapted the content
for Pakistan, for example.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.670
And it worked.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.350
We did the same thing
for Bangladesh, Nepal,

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.190
and the Middle East.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:37.020
And I'm proud to say that in
seven off all these markets,

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.080
we are the number
one educational app.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.940
And because what we
did was we really

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.090
learned from what
India was telling us.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.170
We really learned
what technology

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.800
was finding most used.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.250
What use cases, what content
was finding most relevant.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.300
And then we adapted
them to these markets

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.850
to sort of fit their needs.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.370
And yes, in that
context, India did

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:01.580
help us leapfrog a lot of the
local incumbents who were there

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.706
in those markets.

00:25:03.706 --> 00:25:06.050
JASON TITUS: We'll ask
one last question, which

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.730
is, just looking at all of the
opportunities for technology

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.870
to help people in a
country like India,

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.520
how do you think of social
entrepreneurship for good?

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.830
What do you think of the
opportunities for technology

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:25.848
and technology companies to make
Indian people's lives better?

00:25:25.848 --> 00:25:29.990
ANAND CHANDRASEKARAN: I think
probably the two biggest

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.670
opportunities are
education and health

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:39.830
care that could use the most
disruption through technology.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.540
And it'll actually be
in very unlikely ways.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:45.250
So I'll give you a
very simple example.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:46.930
In a lot of tier-2
and tier-3 cities,

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:50.560
one of the most popular
products that sell on Snapdeal

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:57.050
is actually glucose monitors and
just blood testing equipment.

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.730
And today, the way
it happens is someone

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:03.400
takes a bunch of suit cases
and goes over to a big city

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:07.670
because they have to go to a
proper medical health equipment

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:08.310
store.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.870
And they buy this testing
equipment because most of them

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.250
don't work well, or they're
not accurate, et cetera.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.740
And literally, it has the
ability to save lives.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.625
And the fact that it could be
delivered in 5,000 in a day

00:26:19.625 --> 00:26:23.850
or over two-- I think it's
a very small example of how

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.530
technology, plus access,
plus a level playing

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.880
field kind of really changes
the game for what's possible,

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.920
from a health care perspective.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.860
I think the same for education.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.180
I think we have a great
example right here.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:39.350
I think a lot of
people sometimes

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.680
don't go to school because
the walk every day to school

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.530
is just so far.

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.310
And the opportunity for
access plus technology

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.550
to bring education
to where they are,

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.970
and allow them get
educated at their own pace,

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.330
and their own appetite--
I think are probably

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.745
two of the most interesting.

00:26:54.745 --> 00:26:56.620
SUDHIR SETHI: I would
mention one area, which

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.430
is, to me, a bridge
between social--

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:03.680
and I'll bracket that
with financial inclusion--

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.740
and pure commerce.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.550
India-- the legal
India, if I may add--

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:15.090
is a cashless society.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:18.420
If you look at e-commerce,
about half of e-commerce

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.560
is cash on delivery
today, in the country.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.800
It may be a little bit lower,
depending on the company.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.060
But we are talking about
something like 7 to 8 billion

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.770
in a year.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.580
About 45% of railway
tickets in the country

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.670
are bought by cash, which
is about $40 billion.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:39.060
About 80&amp;% off petrol and diesel
consumer is bought by cash.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.270
I don't have the number
in my head for that.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:46.170
And about 80% of LPG by
consumers are bought by cash.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.080
If I just add up
these numbers, they

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.660
add up to you a humungous--
close to the $80 odd billion

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.480
today.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.390
And if you add up the SME
sector and the kirana shops,

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:02.090
India is transacting commerce,
even by the government,

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.150
in cash.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.920
Now which also means that
many of these consumers

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.670
and businesses are not in
the financial inclusion

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.670
definition in some sense.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.580
I think there's a
huge opportunity

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:21.300
for cash-full transaction
in electronic form

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.510
to happen amongst all these.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.270
And there is a very
strong social element,

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.220
but there's an extremely
strong commerce element here.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.700
That, to me, is going
to be a game changer

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.640
as far as technology
is concerned,

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.062
as far as India's concern
in the next 10 to 15 years.

00:28:39.062 --> 00:28:40.020
JASON TITUS: All right.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.330
Well, we've actually
used up all of our time.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.520
And I entirely
appreciate that we are

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.470
sitting between you and dinner.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.790
So I want to thank
all of our panelists

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:51.826
for their great insights.

00:28:51.826 --> 00:28:54.724
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.940
And generally, I hope
you all appreciated

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.240
all of the presentations today.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.990
We're really glad that
you could come out.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.350
We, at Google, are very
committed to making

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.522
developers successful.

00:29:06.522 --> 00:29:07.980
And if you ever
feel that there are

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.313
things that we could be doing
better, please, reach out.

00:29:10.313 --> 00:29:11.740
We love to hear feedback.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.740
Thank you.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.790
[APPLAUSE]
