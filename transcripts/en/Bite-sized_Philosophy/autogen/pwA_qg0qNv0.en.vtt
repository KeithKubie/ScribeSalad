00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.039
I started telling you last week about

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049
I started telling you last week about
 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.900
I started telling you last week about
this idea of the voyage to the

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910
this idea of the voyage to the
 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.310
this idea of the voyage to the
underworld and I want to tell you a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
underworld and I want to tell you a
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.509
underworld and I want to tell you a
little bit more about that young in

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
little bit more about that young in
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.790
little bit more about that young in
particular conceptualized the voyage to

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800
particular conceptualized the voyage to
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.490
particular conceptualized the voyage to
the underworld as a journey into the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
the underworld as a journey into the
 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.390
the underworld as a journey into the
unconscious and the unconscious for the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400
unconscious and the unconscious for the
 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.330
unconscious and the unconscious for the
psychoanalyst is a place of fantasy and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
psychoanalyst is a place of fantasy and
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.279
psychoanalyst is a place of fantasy and
dreams and implicit presupposition and

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289
dreams and implicit presupposition and
 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.420
dreams and implicit presupposition and
habit and that's all correct

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
habit and that's all correct
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.950
habit and that's all correct
you know we there is an unconscious and

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960
you know we there is an unconscious and
 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.910
you know we there is an unconscious and
it's perfectly reasonable to

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
it's perfectly reasonable to
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.560
it's perfectly reasonable to
conceptualize it that way that the big

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
conceptualize it that way that the big
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.729
conceptualize it that way that the big
difference I think between the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
difference I think between the
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.369
difference I think between the
psychoanalyst and the later more

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
psychoanalyst and the later more
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.360
psychoanalyst and the later more
empirical scientists is that the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
empirical scientists is that the
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.139
empirical scientists is that the
psychoanalyst sort of envisioned your

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149
psychoanalyst sort of envisioned your
 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.389
psychoanalyst sort of envisioned your
psyche as a place of living partial

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
psyche as a place of living partial
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.760
psyche as a place of living partial
personalities instead of cognitive

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770
personalities instead of cognitive
 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.460
personalities instead of cognitive
computational systems you know that they

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
computational systems you know that they
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.469
computational systems you know that they
took into account the fact that you're

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
took into account the fact that you're
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.380
took into account the fact that you're
alive and that the parts of you are

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
alive and that the parts of you are
 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390
alive and that the parts of you are
alive and you know there's a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
alive and you know there's a
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340
alive and you know there's a
neuroscientist named gives at Gaza Nick

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
neuroscientist named gives at Gaza Nick
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.120
neuroscientist named gives at Gaza Nick
I don't know how to say his name

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
I don't know how to say his name
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.330
I don't know how to say his name
Gaza nigga that's wrong is that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
Gaza nigga that's wrong is that
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.030
Gaza nigga that's wrong is that
Gazzaniga yeah I think that's it anyways

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
Gazzaniga yeah I think that's it anyways
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.130
Gazzaniga yeah I think that's it anyways
he did some of the earliest experiments

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
he did some of the earliest experiments
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.010
he did some of the earliest experiments
on split brains and so sometimes if you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
on split brains and so sometimes if you
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.749
on split brains and so sometimes if you
have intractable epilepsy which I

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
have intractable epilepsy which I
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.440

wouldn't recommend by the way one of the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
wouldn't recommend by the way one of the
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.950
wouldn't recommend by the way one of the
surgical procedures for mediating its

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
surgical procedures for mediating its
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.780
surgical procedures for mediating its
negative effects is something called a

you cut the corpus callosum and it's a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
you cut the corpus callosum and it's a
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.880
you cut the corpus callosum and it's a
very large number large structure in the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
very large number large structure in the
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.510
very large number large structure in the
brain that connects the two separate

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
brain that connects the two separate
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.889
brain that connects the two separate
hemispheres and you know it's not

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
hemispheres and you know it's not
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.330
hemispheres and you know it's not
obvious why we have two separate

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
obvious why we have two separate
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.830
obvious why we have two separate
hemispheres although I'll tell you a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
hemispheres although I'll tell you a
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.960
hemispheres although I'll tell you a
little bit about why I think it is but

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970
little bit about why I think it is but
 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.530
little bit about why I think it is but
anyways they do communicate and what

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
anyways they do communicate and what
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.840
anyways they do communicate and what
Gazzaniga demonstrated was that you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850
Gazzaniga demonstrated was that you
 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.690
Gazzaniga demonstrated was that you
could tell one hemisphere or something

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700
could tell one hemisphere or something
 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.510
could tell one hemisphere or something
without the other one knowing that both

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
without the other one knowing that both
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.760
without the other one knowing that both
hemispheres were conscious and that the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
hemispheres were conscious and that the
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.650
hemispheres were conscious and that the
consciousness was somewhat independent

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660
consciousness was somewhat independent
 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.790
consciousness was somewhat independent
that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
that
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470
that
really strange it's very interesting

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
really strange it's very interesting
 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.470
really strange it's very interesting
very interesting readings reading you

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480
very interesting readings reading you
 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.710
very interesting readings reading you
know because it suggests that fragments

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
know because it suggests that fragments
 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.630
know because it suggests that fragments
of ourselves you can think of you have

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640
of ourselves you can think of you have
 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.400
of ourselves you can think of you have
fragments of yourself within you that

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410
fragments of yourself within you that
 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500
fragments of yourself within you that
are like low resolution representations

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510
are like low resolution representations
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.300
are like low resolution representations
of you you know and that and the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310
of you you know and that and the
 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.950
of you you know and that and the
psychoanalyst would think of those more

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960
psychoanalyst would think of those more
 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.630
psychoanalyst would think of those more
as they're kind of like they're kind of

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640
as they're kind of like they're kind of
 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.550
as they're kind of like they're kind of
like one-eyed Giants that might be a way

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
like one-eyed Giants that might be a way
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.630
like one-eyed Giants that might be a way
of thinking about it if you were

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640
of thinking about it if you were
 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.310
of thinking about it if you were
thinking about it in a fantastical way

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320
thinking about it in a fantastical way
 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.370
thinking about it in a fantastical way
so there's the angry you and you know

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380
so there's the angry you and you know
 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.610
so there's the angry you and you know
you all come in contact with the angry

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
you all come in contact with the angry
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.180
you all come in contact with the angry
you it's a rather rigid that's the first

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190
you it's a rather rigid that's the first
 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.560
you it's a rather rigid that's the first
thing you might say about it it's

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570
thing you might say about it it's
 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.960
thing you might say about it it's
impulsive and short-term it doesn't

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970
impulsive and short-term it doesn't
 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.690
impulsive and short-term it doesn't
think much about the past unless it's

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
think much about the past unless it's
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.030
think much about the past unless it's
bad things about whoever you're angry at

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040
bad things about whoever you're angry at
 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.040
bad things about whoever you're angry at
in which case it thinks about them a lot

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050
in which case it thinks about them a lot
 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.620
in which case it thinks about them a lot
it's not too concerned with long-term

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630
it's not too concerned with long-term
 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.560
it's not too concerned with long-term
future consequences and mostly it wants

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570
future consequences and mostly it wants
 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.240
future consequences and mostly it wants
to be right and you know when angry you

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250
to be right and you know when angry you
 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.260
to be right and you know when angry you
disappears and normal you assuming such

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270
disappears and normal you assuming such
 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.350
disappears and normal you assuming such
a thing exists reappears you can be

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360
a thing exists reappears you can be
 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.780
a thing exists reappears you can be
perfectly shocked about how angry you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790
perfectly shocked about how angry you
 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.640
perfectly shocked about how angry you
behaved and in fact sometimes if angry

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
behaved and in fact sometimes if angry
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.680
behaved and in fact sometimes if angry
you really gets out of hand like it

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690
you really gets out of hand like it
 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.640
you really gets out of hand like it
might in a battle and the war it might

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650
might in a battle and the war it might
 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.960
might in a battle and the war it might
do things that you just can't imagine

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970
do things that you just can't imagine
 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.479
do things that you just can't imagine
that you would do and under those

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489
that you would do and under those
 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.870
that you would do and under those
circumstances you can reveal parts of

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880
circumstances you can reveal parts of
 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.810
circumstances you can reveal parts of
yourself to yourself that are so foreign

yourself to yourself that are so foreign
 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.870
yourself to yourself that are so foreign
and so horrifying that it will leave you

and so horrifying that it will leave you

and so horrifying that it will leave you

with post-traumatic stress disorder
 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.620
with post-traumatic stress disorder
because it is the case that many but not

because it is the case that many but not

especially if it's battlefield related

get it because of something they did
 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.050
get it because of something they did
rather than something they saw or

know I mean there's a lot of weird
potential nested inside people and you

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310
potential nested inside people and you
 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.770
potential nested inside people and you
know you don't see it under normal

know you don't see it under normal
 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.240
know you don't see it under normal
circumstances because the circumstances

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250
circumstances because the circumstances
 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.449
circumstances because the circumstances
are normal and part of the reason that

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459
are normal and part of the reason that
 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.800
are normal and part of the reason that
we like the circumstances to be normal

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810
we like the circumstances to be normal
 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.659

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.630
it's precisely so that we don't see
those parts of people we don't want to

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640
those parts of people we don't want to
 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.910
those parts of people we don't want to
see
