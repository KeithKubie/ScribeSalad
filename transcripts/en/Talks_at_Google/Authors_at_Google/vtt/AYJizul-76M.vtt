RACHEL O'MEARA: Thanks for
coming today to our talk

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.740
at Google.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.190
I'm Rachel O'Meara,
and I'm based

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.440
in San Francisco at Google.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.120
I'm really excited today to
bring in Karen Henson Jones.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.420
Karen is here to talk today
about her spiritual experience

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.674
and journey with a
near-death experience.

00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:21.840
And I'm really interested
to hear some of the things

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.870
that she's going to
share with us today.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.260
She has a lot of, in her
book, "Heart of Miracles,"

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.500
data and scientific
evidence that she provides

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.120
as well from the community and
doctors and others who have now

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.430
supporting evidence that
there's a lot more information

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.460
about near-death experiences
that many people now

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.100
have come forward to share.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.370
So Karen is here from Virginia.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.500
And she is a graduate of Cornell
in the London Business School.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.600
So I'm very excited
to host Karen today.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.976
And we'll host and
have her speak.

00:00:56.976 --> 00:00:58.600
We have a short video
in the beginning.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.428
And also, we'll have
question time at the end.

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:03.094

[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.100
KAREN HENSON JONES:
Good afternoon.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.308
Thank you so much for coming.

00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:26.700
I'm really happy to be here.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.450
OK, so you just saw that
the trailer for the book.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.670
And all those places
that you saw in the film,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.800
they're all venues of the book.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.600
So after I had this
very unexpected

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.290
near-death experience, then I
really had some huge questions.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.900
Is there life after death?

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.470
If there is, which they're
definitely seems to be,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.854
where do we go?

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:49.020
And so I found that there
are certain countries that

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.340
have a lot of
information about this.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.770
I went to India, to
the kingdom of Bhutan,

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.272
to Israel, and to Italy.

00:02:55.272 --> 00:02:56.980
And these are all the
venues in the book,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.870
and I just investigated
these spiritual traditions

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.450
in these places.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.950
So I'll just get started at kind
of the beginning of the story.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.210
It's kind of surprising.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.240
Seven years ago, I was
a 30-year-old woman

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.660
living and working
in London in finance.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.540
I was living my parents' dream,
having graduated from Cornell

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.180
and gotten an MBA from
London Business School.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.540
My life was full.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.840
I had work, friends, great
clothes, great restaurants,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.030
and travel.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.360
I had no spiritual life at
all, and I was totally fine

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.070
with that, until
one day at lunch,

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.250
back in the States
for a vacation,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.380
I suddenly blacked out
and slid onto the floor.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.040
The next thing I remember,
I was strapped to a gurney

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.010
in the back of an ambulance.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.240
At the hospital, I was
hooked up to EKG machine.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.090
10 minutes later, a
doctor that looked

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.740
like Ben Kingsley's evil twin
entered the room and asked me,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.500
has anyone in your family
ever died of sudden death?

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.800
Well, actually,
funny you should say

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.300
that, because just
a few days ago,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.840
my cousin had died at
27 of unknown causes.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.290
And I had another cousin who
laid down for a nap at 24

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.030
and never woke up.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.600
Ben Kingsley did
not crack a smile.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.670
With zero charm and compassion,
he informed me that I have

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.269
what's known as Long
QT syndrome, which

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.050
is a type of sudden
arrhythmia death syndrome.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.370
That doesn't sound like good
news, I thought to myself.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.010
I was then told I had to have
an ICD implanted into my heart--

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.260
or in layman's terms, an
Implantable Cardioverter

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.580
Defibrillator, which may
sound super and sexy and fun,

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.220
but I can assure
you that it is not.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.790
An ICD is the size of
a pack of Winstons,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.390
and it would
regulate my heartbeat

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.540
and shock my heart
back to life if it ever

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.020
just decided to stop.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.980
In an instant, my
whole life changed.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.422
Obviously, going back to work
in London was not an option.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.130
And since, at that
point, I was forbidden

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.040
from even getting
on a plane, I had

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.390
to immediately resign
my job in London

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.870
and have all my stuff shipped
back to my parents' house

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.450
in northern Virginia.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.530
I didn't know which
was worse-- being

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.790
told I had sudden death
syndrome or having to live

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.150
at home with my parents.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.680
Luckily, the actual
procedure was

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.780
supposed to be low risk--
well, as low risk as implanting

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.670
a box inside your chest can be.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.670
In fact, after the
operation, the doctors

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.690
told me that it
had gone perfectly.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.960
Two hours later,
however, I woke up

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.680
with a searing, stabbing pain
in the center of my chest,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.820
like a hook scratching
the inside of my heart.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.120
The nurses and the
doctors brushed it off,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.450
saying that it was normal, and
I was discharged and went home

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.210
to my parents' house to recover.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.340
The next day, I injected
myself with a blood thinner

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.660
that the doctors had prescribed.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.060
Immediately, I felt like venom
was rushing through my veins.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.330
None of this felt normal, even
for having a pack of Winstons

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.890
in your chest.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.030
I literally staggered
into my parents' bedroom,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.600
and I said to my mother,
mom, I'm going to die now.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.200
And I collapsed.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.930
By the time the paramedics
arrived, I was not breathing

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.740
and I had no pulse.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.270
I was taken to the
nearest hospital

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.420
by ambulance, where I was
cared for by the emergency room

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.880
staff, who are amazing but had
no expertise in ICD devices.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.140
Nobody could figure out
what was wrong with me,

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.890
which is always comforting
when you're clinically dead.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.540
And then a miracle happened.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.210
A cardiologist by the
name of Dr. Khurana,

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.520
whose office was a
few buildings away,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.300
had spontaneously
decided to take a walk.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.700
Dr. Khurana was walking
through the emergency room

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.430
when one of the ER
staff recognized him

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.600
as a cardiologist,
a cardiologist who

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.490
had a specialty in ICDs.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.050
And what was so
amazing about this

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.180
is-- I didn't write
it into the speech,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.070
but it was actually a weekend.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.260
So he had come in on a weekend
to catch up on some paperwork.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.357
And he said that he
was in his office.

00:07:02.357 --> 00:07:03.940
He had been doing
paperwork for hours.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.140
He wanted a break.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.530
So he got up to take a walk
and he met with his colleague

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.460
in the hallway.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.940
And his colleague said,
what are you doing?

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.606
And he said, oh, I'm
just taking a walk.

00:07:12.606 --> 00:07:15.350
And the colleague said,
oh, if you want to walk,

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:16.720
I'm just on my way out.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.265
I'm leaving.

00:07:17.265 --> 00:07:20.060
But I parked my car
near the emergency room.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.730
Why don't you accompany me?

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.310
So they walked across
four buildings.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.390
And Dr. Khurana was
walking through the ER

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.290
when one of the ER physicians
who had been working on me

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.200
recognized him as
a cardiologist.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.560
And he saw him from
across the room.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.674
And I'll never forget
this, because Dr. Khurana

00:07:39.674 --> 00:07:41.590
is of the Sikh religion,
so he wears a turban.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.430
And he said he saw his
turban, and he goes, oh,

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.730
that's the guy.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.380
And he grabbed him.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.450
And so Dr. Khurana was
walking through the ER.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.700
The ER doctor recognized him,
and then he was called in.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.830
And it was Dr. Khurana who began
the process of intervention

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.840
that ultimately saved my life.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.820
And I don't think that I would
be here if Dr. Khurana wasn't

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.350
there at that moment.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.030
So a few days later, I
open my eyes from a coma.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.140
I later found out that I
had undergone two heart

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.860
surgeries and a lung operation.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.380
It was also discovered
that the wire

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.970
from the lifesaving
defibrillator

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.130
had pierced my heart
and almost killed me.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.830
Let me tell you,
there is nothing

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.290
like a medically-induced
coma to raise

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.880
existential questions--
you know, the standard what

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.990
heck happened to me?

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.090
Why are we here?

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.740
What is the purpose of my life?

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.500
Unfortunately,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.220
I didn't have the answer
to any of those questions.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.220
And for the moment, they had
to go into the back of my mind

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.790
as I had to tackle
a whole new reality.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.440
The pain I experienced
was unbearable.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.180
Before I left the
hospital, the doctor

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.930
had cut off my morphine drip.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.920
And I begged him for more.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.700
You don't know what that stuff
does to your brain, he told me.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.020
And so I was discharged from
the hospital with nothing

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.000
more than a bottle of Tylenol 3.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.850
My pain increased
tenfold when I realized

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.850
that I was going to have
to stay with my parents

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.770
for the foreseeable future.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.730
They actually had to hire
assistants to help with my care

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.950
since I couldn't dress myself,
bath myself, walk unassisted,

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.300
or even write my own
name on a piece of paper.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.340
I was completely debilitated.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.580
And any thoughts
of a former life

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.700
had vanished, as had my hot
figure since at this point,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.580
I had become permanently
hunched over in a C shape.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.810
I needed calories for
my body to repair,

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.410
and I literally
couldn't stop eating.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.180
There's so many
details in surgery

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.670
that I never knew about before.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.740
I remember somebody
came to the hospital

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.070
and they brought healthy food.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.310
They brought like a vegan and
kale soup, everything organic.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.290
And the nurse shook her
head, and she said, no, she

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.600
needs burgers and fries.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.000
She needs to eat
3,000 calories a day,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.260
because the body is
repairing itself.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.642
So I would just eat and
eat and eat and eat.

00:10:02.642 --> 00:10:04.350
It was like you're
almost like an infant.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.933
Like, I'd be sleeping
for a few hours.

00:10:05.933 --> 00:10:08.790
Then I had to wait up and eat,
sleep for a few hours, wake

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.470
up and eat.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.210
And my mom kind of had
to get on this schedule.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.020
And she'd wake up at 1
o'clock in the morning

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:13.811
to make hamburgers.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.406
So my mom would get up at
all hours to make me food.

00:10:19.406 --> 00:10:20.780
And she always
said she was fine,

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.750
but I knew that the exhaustion
and stress were wearing on her.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.520
As I detoxed from the
drugs, my legs shook,

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.596
and I suffered from
severe migraines.

00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:29.970
I turned the lights
off to bathe,

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.720
because I couldn't bear to
see my long, extensive scars.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.700
Needless to say,
I was emotionally

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.010
starting to lose it.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.480
Under all this pain and
mess, however, I somehow

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.915
knew I was saved
by a miracle, be it

00:10:42.915 --> 00:10:46.710
an angel, God, Jesus,
some divine presence.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.480
The coincidence of Dr.
Khurana being in the ER

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.370
at the right moment
indicated to me

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.920
that there is something greater,
an organizing intelligence,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.530
looking out for me.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.050
I had started to believe that
my survival was too miraculous,

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.690
that I had lived for a
reason, even if I didn't

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.060
know what that reason was.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.762
I'll spare you the details of
the next two years of my life,

00:11:09.762 --> 00:11:11.220
and I'll just say
that they evolved

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.870
a lot of gut-wrenching physical
therapy, a lot of lying down,

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.580
and depression.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.970
I was constantly
anxious over the future,

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.400
and angry over the unluckiness
of my circumstances.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.820
I watched as all of my friends
hit the classic milestones--

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.357
promotions, engagements,
and getting jobs at Google.

00:11:29.357 --> 00:11:30.190
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.440
KAREN HENSON JONES: It's true.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.740
It was really true.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.640
And I felt that I
was being left behind

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.930
for the first time in my life.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.610
Anything that my ego
had been attached

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:43.240
to-- my career, my looks,
my salary, my athleticism--

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.750
was either all gone
or disappearing fast.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.730
I had to face my true self.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.860
And without all of
those other things,

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.920
I wasn't sure who
that person was.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.330
My whole family
was also struggling

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.820
on my behalf for solutions.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.850
My father's constant
suggestion was to get a job.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:02.810
As what, I wondered.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.660
I was a C-shaped invalid.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.090
And then one day, my
sister called and suggested

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.781
that I go to yoga and meditation
school in Los Angeles.

00:12:11.781 --> 00:12:14.280
She had been learning it herself
to cope with the situation,

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.730
and she found it very helpful.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.454
Yoga, I had practiced before;
but medication, never.

00:12:20.454 --> 00:12:22.620
My sister told me that I
needed to go to this school

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.340
40 days in a row to create
a shift in my psyche.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.410
I was desperate so I tried it.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.350
I flew to LA and signed up.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:37.970
At the center, I still felt
so much pain in my body,

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.740
even sitting down
was so painful,

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.730
let alone do the yoga positions.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:47.000
But I just did my best, and I
just kept on going every day.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.120
Our teacher was a woman named
Taje, and Taje means radiance.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.670
She really emphasized
how important

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.060
our thoughts are in shaping
the kind of human being

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.690
that we become.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.020
Every single thought
was imperative in terms

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:05.080
of maintaining a positive and
graceful personal projection.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.910
She was teaching us to focus
on the best parts of ourselves

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.060
and to send those parts
out into the world.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.750
She spoke about the power of
words and their importance.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.980
Words are the
expressions of our soul.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.130
And when we use them, we
can decide to elevate others

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.800
or to put them down.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.200
Her point was to make
it a conscious choice

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.320
and to always stay
based in love,

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.660
both for ourselves
and for others.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.607
This kind of vocabulary
was totally new to me.

00:13:32.607 --> 00:13:34.940
And I realized that with all
the formal schooling that I

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.990
had had, nobody had ever
taught me how to think

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.120
or how to speak deliberately,
with positive intention,

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.990
self-love, and love for others.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.910
That's what I was
learning in these classes.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.900
And meditation, the art
of mastering our thoughts,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.130
was, for me at
least, a missing key

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:56.000
to a greater level of happiness.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.620
After a few days of
attending classes,

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.360
strange things
started to happen.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.150
I actually felt
like I was healing.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.430
I cried before going to sleep,
but they were tears of joy.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.340
And no joke-- within 40
days, the color of my scars

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.580
had faded significantly.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.180
I was becoming more mobile.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.880
Those mysterious illnesses
that I'd been suffering from

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.930
were failing to appear.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.015
Toward the end of my 40
days, the studio owner,

00:14:20.015 --> 00:14:24.090
a yogi named Gurmukh, who's a
traveling diplomat and legend

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.580
in yoga world, taught a class
and spoke about the importance

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.701
of service.

00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:31.450
If you were ever feeling
bad or depressed,

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:36.360
she said, you just serve or
uplift someone around you.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.390
She said to find someone who
has that same problem you have,

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.950
and help them with it.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.140
She said often, you
have two hands-- serve.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.260
You have a heart-- love.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.770
If you are lonely, pick up the
phone and call a lonely person.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.510
If you are
heartbroken from love,

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.080
buy flowers for someone who
is also heartbroken from love.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.440
And then by your
action and intention,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.200
you're both uplifted.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.990
It seemed to make sense to me.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.570
After the class, Gurmukh was
always swarmed with students,

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.080
so I decided that the
best way to speak to her

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.590
was to a her in the bathroom.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.640
I hovered by the sink quietly.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.420
And when she emerged
from the stall,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.170
I quickly told her
about my surgeries.

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.240
She put her hand on
my arm and asked me,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.130
did you ever consider that
you chose this for yourself,

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.750
that your soul chose these
experiences before you

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.230
came to earth so
that you could grow?

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.240
Could you ever believe that?

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.920
My initial reaction
was, are you kidding me?

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.730
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.190
Why would I ever choose this?

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.030
But somehow, the
seed of what she

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.740
had said-- that I, my
higher self or my soul,

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.950
may have set this all up for
my own growth and learning--

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.822
felt like it could
possibly be true.

00:15:50.822 --> 00:15:53.030
The day before I left Los
Angeles to my parents' home

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.240
in Virginia, I saw a brochure
at the yoga studio for a teacher

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.620
training course in India.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.100
Needless to say, I was
terrified of presenting the idea

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.350
to my parents.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.680
They had barely
accepted my jaunt to LA.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.500
And my father was
extremely anxious

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.300
about me returning
to normal life.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.790
Swim back to the mainstream,
he kept on telling me,

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.910
demonstrating a freestyle
stroke with his arms.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.729
Listen-- [LAUGHS] he would.

00:16:17.729 --> 00:16:19.020
At breakfast, he would do this.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.186
Swim back to the mainstream.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.950
So listening to me
pray and meditate

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.990
for hours in my
childhood bedroom

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.465
was not his idea of me
getting my life back together.

00:16:30.465 --> 00:16:32.800
He would complain constantly
about my meditating

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.540
and praying to my
mother and my sister.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.340
Don't worry about it,
my sister told him.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.960
It's like she's a nun.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.390
She said, in another time
and place, she'd be revered.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.134
And then my dad
said to her, well,

00:16:44.134 --> 00:16:45.800
is that supposed to
make me feel better?

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.360
Because it's 2009.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.861
So despite his resistance, I
knew that I had to go to India,

00:16:52.861 --> 00:16:54.360
and my father was
just going to have

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.100
to deal with the situation.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.700
Now, most of you have
probably never been to India.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.746
Oh wait, I'm at Google.

00:17:01.746 --> 00:17:03.245
How many of you are
actually Indian?

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:08.609
Well, I guess if you wanted
a break from your family,

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.275
the last place you
would go to is India.

00:17:10.275 --> 00:17:13.940
Virginia, however, might
be an exotic option.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.910
Once in India, I
arrived in a town

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.911
called Rishikesh, which
most people know about

00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:19.369
because it's where
the Beatles went

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:22.417
to write the "White Album."

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.250
The ashram where they
stayed is now defunct,

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.000
but I was staying in a place
that was very close by.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.580
It was a huge place-- totally,
totally different than what

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.970
I had expected.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.050
I arrived at my destination
very late at night,

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.690
and to reach my
ashram, I had to walk

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.490
across a long, tall bridge over
what appeared to be blackwater.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.790
As I walked by, scores of
beggars held out their hands.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:49.600
Many were coughing, spitting,
limping, and heckling me.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.120
I eagerly waited to arrive at
the sanctuary of the ashram.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.450
When I was led to
my room, however, it

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.250
was not relief, but horror,
that washed over me.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.320
The room resembled a
toilet in "Trainspotting,"

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.450
plus some bonus blood
splatters on the walls.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.950
There is a large
window in the room,

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:10.680
but there were no glass
panes, and it was biting cold.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.510
I asked to change
rooms, but I was denied.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.380
I was a Beatle, so
what did I expect?

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.280
I sat on a green
plastic lawn chair

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.970
in the center of the room,
and I started to see it.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.500
What was I thinking?

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.330
Did I really have a death wish?

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.390
And as I sat there,
bewildered at my circumstances

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.820
and imagining that Ewan
McGregor just might actually

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.470
come crawling out of
the loo at any moment,

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.260
I thought about the things
that I had been studying.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.190
The voice of Gurmukh
came through.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.020
What's the lesson here?

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.450
What am I being taught?

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:45.330
Had my soul chosen this
trip so that I could grow?

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.920
And so I began to repeat
to myself, I am lucky.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.730
I am lucky.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.840
I am lucky.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.360
I'm lucky to be alive.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.030
I'm lucky to be walking.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.540
I'm lucky to be breathing.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.040
I'm lucky to have
a beating heart.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.090
It was a tough sell for my
senses, but it was a start.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.830
Daily meditations
at the ashram began

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:09.440
at 3:50 AM, which I didn't
know about before I got there.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.830
There is no coffee, which
I also didn't know about

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.190
before I got there.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:16.450
And the food was suitable for
an anorexic pleasure center.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:19.560
But all of this deprivation and
my forced-change in attitude

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.390
had begun to take hold.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.140
Without the comforts or material
pleasures that had been used to

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.520
and I was so attached
to, I had the energy

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.720
to focus on what was really
important there, which

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.660
was my spiritual growth, and
ultimately, the realization

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.450
that I didn't need
much to be happy.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.690
And slowly, slowly, I
began to love everything

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.470
about my experience.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.000
I was no longer consumed
by my circumstances,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.820
and I decided to
focus on the gifts

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.145
that I was receiving instead of
the gifts that I was wanting.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:53.790
One day, we had a lecture by
a teacher whose name is Siti.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.230
Siti is a name that
means perfection.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.500
These yogis all have
adopted, fantastic names,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.260
and I suggest that you pick
one for yourself, as it will do

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.600
wonders for your dating life.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.010
Siti spoke a lot about
the children of Rishikesh.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.610
We encountered many
every day, and most

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.150
of whom begged for money.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.210
She spoke specifically
of a boy that she

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.645
had met on the street
several years before.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.260
He was born so contorted
that he could only

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.530
crawl on his hands and knees.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.030
When she started
to tell this story,

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.120
I knew who he was right away,
because he actually was very

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.280
often right outside the ashram.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.980
And he would walk on
his knees and his hands,

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.760
and he would wear
flip-flops on his hands

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.880
to protect them from the road.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.620
So I knew who he was right away.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.270
So when she saw him, she
started talking to him,

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.580
and she expressed concern
about his situation.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.350
And she said, are you OK?

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.370
Who do you live with?

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.970
And he said he didn't
have any family

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.680
and that he didn't
live with anyone.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.600
And so she said to him, oh, do
you mean that you are alone?

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.590
And he told her, I'm not alone.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:03.590
I'm never alone.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.480
I am always with God.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.050
God is always with me.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.500
Her heart went
out to this child,

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.370
and Siti arranged to
transfer him money

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.530
and to arrange shelter for him.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.790
Thanks to her, he now sleeps
in a mattress in a room

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.450
that she rents for him.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.190
She recently had taken
to buy him new clothes.

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.670
After he picked one sweater,
he seemed to be done.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.020
When she prodded him to
get a second sweater,

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.330
he was completely puzzled.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.590
Why, he asked?

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.530
I already have one.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.064
The story moved me instantly.

00:21:33.064 --> 00:21:34.980
Here, I have traveled
halfway around the world

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.740
and spent a mass of
money to try and find

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.610
what this homeless boy already
had-- the knowingness that we

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.770
are never truly alone,
and satisfaction

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:50.800
and gratitude for what
we already have in life.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.850
Upon returning to
Virginia, I realized

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.070
that as much as I had
learned about gratitude,

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.030
there were still some things
that I was yearning for.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.840
And so much to my
parents' delight,

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.960
I told them that I was
leaving, yet again, this time

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.380
for the Kingdom of Bhutan.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.940
Why Bhutan, you might be asking.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.800
Well, first let me ask--
any Bhutanese in the house?

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.640
OK, so for those of you
who are not familiar,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.540
Bhutan is an
independent monarchy

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.950
between India and China.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:21.730
And it's unlike any
other place on the planet

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:26.390
in that its government measures
the happiness of its citizens.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:29.860
So it's hard to explain.

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:36.050
It's a monarchy, but it's
a very advanced monarchy.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:40.830
So the people in the
government there, they go out.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.190
They get a lot of
international education.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.990
They go to the best schools
in the US and in England.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.770
And they come back and they take
the best of this information,

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:54.810
and they combine it with their
culture, which is very deeply

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.700
ingrained in Buddhism.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.260
So from farming to education,
all government policies

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.810
are based in Buddhist
spirituality.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.800
Children meditate
from a young age,

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.130
and they repeat positive
affirmations in school,

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.450
like "I am happy."

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.050
Spiritual well-being
is essential

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.890
to the national identity.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.630
Every two years, the government
distributes a happiness survey

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.760
to its citizens.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.670
Questions like, "How many hours
a week do you spend in nature?"

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.790
point to a larger culture
of reflection and awareness.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.570
Bhutan's social
concept of happiness

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.150
is not material
acquisition or competition,

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.850
but one of contemplation,
community, and connection

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.540
with nature.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.130
It's more of a focus
on "we" as opposed

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.960
to a strong sense of "me."

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.200
It's no surprise that
I believed that Bhutan

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.520
would have some answers
as to how to be happy.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.900
In Bhutan, I spent my days
meditating, and contrary

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.530
to all medical advice,
embarked on a hike,

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.940
high up into the mountains
to one of the oldest

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.750
nunneries in the kingdom.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.240
The nuns ranged in age 13
to 84, so I was definitely

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.990
a prime candidate for them.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.210
As I was leaving the nunnery,
one of the younger nuns

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.810
asked me if I had
any prayer request.

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.300
Oh, yes, I told her.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.490
Please pray for the
right husband for me,

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:13.400
I said in all earnest.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.985
She was flabbergasted.

00:24:14.985 --> 00:24:15.960
A husband?

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.830
A husband?

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.410
Why would you want a husband?

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.890
And I looked at her, confused.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.380
She stretched out
her arms and she

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:29.560
said, do you think all of this
is possible with a husband?

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.490
Her reaction was a revelation.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.630
I had begun to understand
that what really mattered

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:38.100
was my happiness in here and
now, in the present moment,

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.620
and not what any future
happiness may be.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.670
For whatever reason, I had to
walk part of this path alone.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.320
I had to find
happiness in myself

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.130
first before it could be
found in someone else.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:53.810
And I think that's a
really good lesson.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:58.230
OK, so after Bhutan, I decided
to go to another place known

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.540
for its peacefulness, quietude,
and the calm and patient

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.340
temperament of its
people-- Israel.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.340
All joking aside,
Israel is known

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.800
for its deep, spiritual history.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.430
And I had very much
wanted to go there.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.030
Sadly, I don't have time
to go into great detail

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.930
on my many adventures there--
from the borderline cavity

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.140
search conducted by
suspicious Israeli airline

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.870
officer to a hot Israeli
actor who sat next to me

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.730
on the airplane-- but
you can read about it

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.550
my next book, "50 Shades
of the Middle East Heat

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.590
and Procreation."

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:38.550
I would like to share with you,
however, the journey of my trip

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.960
to a place in Israel
called Mount Meron.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.420
So upon arriving in Israel,
I headed straight north

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.160
to the region of Galilee,
where I was going

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.780
to a place-- it's a mountain.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.570
It's a synagogue,
actually-- which

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.910
is the burial site of
the founders of Kabbalah.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:00.620
So the founders, it was really
this one particular rabbi

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.660
with his son.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:05.540
And in the first century,
after criticizing Roman rule,

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.220
Rabbi Simeon and
his son, Eleazar,

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.010
were driven to hide
in a cave near Meron.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.840
They lived in this
cave for a dozen years,

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.810
surviving only with a carob
tree and an underground spring

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.400
for water.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.400
The deprivation is said
to have produced a bounty.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.320
Rabbi Simeon was inspired to
write a sacred mystical text

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.010
called the Zohar.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.380
Zohar means radiance.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.800
It's also my new
name, by the way.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.860
The text of the
Zohar illuminates

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.700
the nature of reality
and the path of the soul.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.050
It discusses angels and
the parallel inner worlds,

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:41.160
all the things I never
believed in before my journey.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.930
But now, they were becoming
as real to me as the ground

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:46.910
that I walked on.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.670
Not everybody shared my
enthusiasm for Meron.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:53.800
When I told the hotel manager of
my itinerary, he laughed at me.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.670
He said, why do you
want to go there?

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:59.030
That place is for religious nut
jobs who pray for a marriage.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.820
And perfect, I
thought to myself.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.780
And so with this hope in mind,
I hopped in my rental car

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.290
and I headed to Meron.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:09.340
But getting there was not
as easy as I had expected.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:13.090
But rest assured, Google
Maps did not let me down.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:16.340
And after a few random turns
into some military bases,

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.660
I was led to Simeon
and Eleazar's tombs.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.790
The tombs were
surprisingly sunny.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.770
A wall divided the women's
praying room from the men's.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.510
Bookcases lined the walls.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.680
Birds flew in and out.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.880
Rabbi Simeon's tomb had
all the single ladies,

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.870
so I headed there first,
as kind of a joke.

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:36.260
Because these tombs,
they're really interesting.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.980
So there's two tombs
that are in one room.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.730
So it's the father and the son.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.900
But the women and the
men pray separately,

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:50.330
so the room is
divided by a wall.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.600
So you kind of get half a tomb.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.950
Does that make sense?

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:58.360
OK, so Rabbi Simeon's tomb
had all the single ladies,

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.800
so I headed there first.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.930
I put my hands on the
tomb, and I started

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.920
breathing deep and slow.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.350
I didn't quite know
what to expect.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.420
As I put my hands on
the tomb, the words

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.360
of the great Indian
prophet, Pantanjali,

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:18.330
came to mind-- "three aspects
of God-- creator, protector,

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.800
destroyer.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.810
That is ecstasy."

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.630
I understood.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.820
We are living the cycle of
creation and destruction

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.820
constantly.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.850
The ecstasy is in the
renewal, the rebirth.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:34.620
If all things were to
remain the same always,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.840
if fantasies or the
material never dissolved,

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.910
we would never have the
joy in creating the new.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.230
As I connected to the
energy from Eleazar's tomb,

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.460
I sent that mental images--
more time with my friends,

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.906
a wedding, a child, a home.

00:28:51.906 --> 00:28:53.280
It perplexed me
that as much as I

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.696
had given to my
spiritual journey,

00:28:54.696 --> 00:28:57.870
my desires hadn't really
changed that much.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.910
But I realized that my attitude
toward attaining these things

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.950
had shifted dramatically.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.180
I used to think that they
would bring me peace,

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:09.430
but now I realize that peace
can only come from within.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.170
Suddenly, a blistered, old crone
with bleeding sores on her face

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.880
approached me.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.260
She placed her hands on
both sides of my body

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.300
and forcefully spun me
around so that my forehead

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.350
was resting on the tomb.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:26.210
I could feel the vibration
on my forehead, like energy

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:27.740
and a dizziness.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:31.190
I felt energy, and I had visions
of myself dying over and over

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.220
again at different ages.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.740
Somehow it was my
old self, my ego,

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.710
that was being laid to rest,
here, on this mountain.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.120
After all I've experienced,
I'm convinced now

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.140
that death is not the end.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:49.260
The journey I am on now,
however, is about life.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.700
I no longer work in finance.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.650
I've taken a different path
as an author and a meditation

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.070
teacher.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:30:00.080
This life is a gift, and it is
up to us to embrace it fully.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.310
Bring light to the
places in your life

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.990
where there are ashes.

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:06.630
We are all born
with the capacity.

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:08.650
When you find yourself
at a crossroads,

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:12.290
follow the path that
makes your heart sing,

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:15.140
because that is where the
true riches will be found.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.690
That is my message to you.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:20.387
For all of you here that are
not happy at Google, quit now.

00:30:20.387 --> 00:30:22.720
Go be that masseuse that
you've always dreamed of being.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.200
Go be that mountain
ranger at Yosemite.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.160
Just kidding.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.230
Whatever your situation
is, embrace it fully,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:33.780
and realize that you are
here, now, for a reason.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.320
And most importantly,
don't listen to your dad

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.640
when he tells you to swim
back to the mainstream.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.280
Thanks.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.196
RACHEL O'MEARA: Great.

00:30:41.196 --> 00:30:42.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.250
So any regrets from
your prior life,

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.390
working in business to
what you're doing now?

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.505
Do you do miss it more
than you thought you would?

00:30:55.505 --> 00:30:57.130
KAREN HENSON JONES:
I'm trying to think

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.940
about that, any regrets.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.320
Ah, no, no regrets.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.690
But I don't think
it's a terrible job.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:06.720
I mean, I enjoyed my previous
job and enjoyed socializing.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.330
I think when you're a
writer, it's very solitary.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.040
And now, it's getting
a little bit better

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.290
for me, because I'm working
with people and my company

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.290
and my agency and
stuff like that.

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.120
But for a long time,
it was just me.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.900
And so I definitely missed
the idea of going to work

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.395
and going with your friends.

00:31:22.395 --> 00:31:23.960
AUDIENCE: You kind
of got a feeling

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:29.390
that your soul had taken you on
this path because of something

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.040
that you need to learn.

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.930
Have you, in your
meditation, got any clues

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:42.120
on why you needed
to go to this route?

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.560
Like, have you had any
clues of your previous lives

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.070
that didn't teach you this?

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.330
I'm getting deeper,
but I'm curious.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.780
Like, in your medications, can
you go back to, for example,

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.150
your previous lives or why
you're on this journey?

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:02.979
Do you get any
pictures in your mind?

00:32:02.979 --> 00:32:04.020
KAREN HENSON JONES: I do.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.430
The information comes through.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:10.030
There is a chapter in
the book on reincarnation

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.490
that's really fascinating.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.210
So before jumping
to that, to what you

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:17.990
might see in a
previous life, let's

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.660
talk about the idea
of previous lives.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.750
Because sound like you accept
it totally and everything.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.910
So this is a really
interesting, because I

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.860
was born in a
Catholic household,

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.160
and I never heard about
reincarnation before.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.810
And it was only
until I went to India

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:38.570
that I started hearing the word
reincarnation, here and there.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.340
We would have lectures
from different teachers

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.640
and they'd kind of mention it.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.060
But my interest in it, it
wasn't specifically profound.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.140
And when I went
to Bhutan, they're

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.350
really focused on happiness,
but it's a little bit punitive

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:55.200
because one of their
focuses on happiness

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.860
is because they believe
that you will reincarnate

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.230
and that you have to be good so
that you will not have a lower

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.040
reincarnation, if
that makes sense.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:08.880
So they're very much this
idea that be a good person

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.100
because you should be
a good person, but also

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.014
because of option B, that
if you're not a good person

00:33:15.014 --> 00:33:16.930
and you come back, you
won't have a good life.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:22.080
And I was on the airplane,
flying to the Bhutan,

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:26.180
and I was reading
the airline magazine.

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.900
They had a whole article
about reincarnation.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.660
And there's another story,
which is when I was talking

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.300
to this nun in the nunnery.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.370
When I said, please
pray for husband,

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.810
and she was flabbergasted.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:42.040
And it kind of just
left the anecdote there.

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.405
But the conversation
actually continued.

00:33:44.405 --> 00:33:46.930
And she was flabbergasted
because she said,

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:50.760
in my previous life, I prayed
so hard to be a monk because I

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:53.460
didn't want to be a wife
again, because I wanted

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.580
to have this time so
that I could explore

00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:00.990
what it means to be human in
this world, is what she said.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.990
So when I came up on
this trip from Bhutan,

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.470
I had a deeper interest
in reincarnation.

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:07.570
And I was already doing
research for the book.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:11.219
And what I really wanted to find
out, after I had my experience,

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:14.480
I was so close to the other side
of the veil, I wanted to know,

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.080
is this my imagination, or
is there life after death?

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.929
Where's the evidence for this?

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.940
And so there's one
chapter in the book that

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:27.290
involves looking at what medical
science has to say about this.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:31.800
And the University of Virginia
Medical School has a division,

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.719
and they study and they
document this kind of stuff.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:38.409
So I called this guy, who is a
near-death experience expert.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.130
He's a physician.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.789
And I said, hi, blah, blah,
blah, I'm working on this book.

00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:44.080
Do you think you could help me?

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.320
And he said-- all my research is
online-- he goes, but why don't

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.090
you talk to my colleague
who studies intersection

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.860
of reincarnation and biology?

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.320
It's something
really interesting.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.630
And so he was literally
dropped into my lap.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:04.355
So there is a chapter in the
book about the intersection

00:35:04.355 --> 00:35:07.240
of reincarnation and biology,
and it's based on my interview

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.650
with this physician at the
University of Virginia Medical

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:11.430
School.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:14.310
And it's just really,
really, really fascinating

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:19.750
because what they're doing is
they interview children who

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.410
are born with birth
defects that are

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.360
unexplained from
a medical basis.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.590
But somehow, the children can
remember, in their past life,

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.120
where this defect came from.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:31.509
So for example, there's
a girl with no legs.

00:35:31.509 --> 00:35:33.550
And she'll say, oh yeah,
I got ran over by train.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.162
And they'll just say it
totally matter-of-factly, oh,

00:35:35.162 --> 00:35:36.750
in all my previous
life, just before I

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.440
died, ran over by train.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.340
Or somebody who
had a deformed ear

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:46.020
said that he was shot by
somebody that he knew.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:49.810
So they started going out-- team
of doctors would go to Asia,

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:51.767
and they would
record these stories,

00:35:51.767 --> 00:35:53.350
and they would
interview the children.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:57.055
And then they would
take the factoids

00:35:57.055 --> 00:35:58.930
that the children were
offering and then they

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.697
would go compare
them against history,

00:36:00.697 --> 00:36:02.280
and they find out
that they were true.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.420
So children who were
born in one town

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.390
would give you extremely
detailed descriptions

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.390
of something that was
hours away to a place

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:15.470
that they had never been-- super
fascinating, super fascinating

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.000
stuff.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.560
But your original
question was, what

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.220
was missing in my
previous incarnations

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.991
that I have to do this now?

00:36:25.991 --> 00:36:27.240
That's a really good question.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.330
I'll have to meditate on that.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.050
But you know, it's
a lot of challenges.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.716
It's a lot of challenges
that I've never

00:36:33.716 --> 00:36:37.760
had before-- the challenge
of how to use the mind

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.710
to heal the body.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:41.280
That was a huge learning.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.160
The challenge of just living--

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.197
It's kind of like you're
in this paradox of,

00:36:46.197 --> 00:36:48.030
you want to live in
here and now because you

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.727
want to really embrace
life so fully as a gift

00:36:51.727 --> 00:36:53.560
and you just want to
stay extremely present.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.130
But when you have
this experience,

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.390
you are reminded
that you will die.

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.210
And you just want
to ask yourself,

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:02.090
how did I live my life?

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:04.540
So it's living in
between those two places,

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.490
of living in the here and
now with a constant reminder

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:17.360
that we're all temporal, and
that you really want to not

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.370
regret and use the time wisely.

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:23.490
AUDIENCE: Is there a particular
religion, sect, ideology,

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.620
or anything that you
relate to the most

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.180
or that you stick
to the most now,

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.830
after all you've been through?

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.550
And then, is there a
religion, sect, ideology

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.065
that you completely dismissed--

00:37:33.065 --> 00:37:34.530
KAREN HENSON JONES: Oh,
that's a really good question.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:35.830
AUDIENCE: --as not going
to stick by you at all?

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.913
KAREN HENSON JONES: That's
a really good question.

00:37:37.913 --> 00:37:40.580
I did study a lot of
different religions and sects,

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.220
going through the
different places.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.240
And I think that before
all of this happened,

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.480
I wasn't a religious person.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.646
I wasn't a spiritual person.

00:37:46.646 --> 00:37:47.670
I had no interest.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:51.400
And I think what surprised me is
how much good information there

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.300
is in every one.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.600
So there are kind of like these
really great and really special

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.230
information in a lot
of different ones.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:03.339
Right now, I'm studying Tibetan
Buddhism and meditation.

00:38:03.339 --> 00:38:05.130
And I really love this
one, because I think

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:09.750
it's applicable to all humans.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.610
The baseline is that we should
live our lives with compassion.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:16.809
But that is also the main thread
of many religions and sects.

00:38:16.809 --> 00:38:19.100
So more than anything, I
would say that's the takeaway,

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.852
is compassion.

00:38:20.852 --> 00:38:22.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:23.960
KAREN HENSON JONES:
Totally dismiss?

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.720
No, I don't think so, no.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.360
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
about before you went to LA,

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.930
you didn't have much
experience about meditation.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:37.240
And what's the biggest
takeaway for yourself,

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.354
knowing about meditation?

00:38:39.354 --> 00:38:41.020
And then the second
part of the question

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.710
is, when you're
comparing meditation

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:47.134
in different countries, do you
find any major differences?

00:38:47.134 --> 00:38:48.550
KAREN HENSON JONES:
OK, all right,

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:50.091
let me see if-- I'll
go through this.

00:38:50.091 --> 00:38:52.790
OK, what's the biggest
takeaway from meditation?

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:55.490
OK, so specifically,
in my personal case,

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.750
I use medication
to heal my body.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:00.540
So I think for me, that was
the biggest takeaway, that you

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.140
can accomplish a lot with
meditation, which is just

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.860
a constant vigilance of
visualization and self-loving

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.220
thoughts.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.190
But as it progressed
and as my body healed,

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.800
then I found meditation
was the most amazing tool

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.950
ever for happiness.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:21.530
So it almost equals happiness.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:23.690
And it's just because
you just keep yourself

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:26.800
in a really neutral state of
mind, a positive state of mind.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.280
You connect to a higher source.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.210
And it's something
that's really hard

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:36.050
to describe unless you begin
the process of experiencing it.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:40.510
So the greatest takeaway for
meditation, peace in your life,

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:43.220
happiness in your
life, good health.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.500
And is meditation
different across countries?

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.350
Yeah, I found it very different.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:50.080
They all have their
different techniques.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.820
And the different
techniques work

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.944
in different parts of the
brain, different vibrations,

00:39:55.944 --> 00:39:57.110
different parts of the body.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:58.465
They have different effects.

00:39:58.465 --> 00:40:00.340
I mean, all of them
ultimately will bring you

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:05.070
to a state of deeper
connection, a deeper calm.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.580
Even for those countries
that are very close together,

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.125
it's very different.

00:40:09.125 --> 00:40:10.500
RACHEL O'MEARA:
I have a comment.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.250
So at Google, we
have a practice here

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.400
to help people learn how
to be mindful and meditate.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.790
And it's really, in effect,
to help manage stress levels

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:24.300
and just connect to,
internally, your own system

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.860
and feel compassion as well as
just have some time and space

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.640
that your mind can
rest or be quiet.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.600
So for those that are here,
it's an opt-in process,

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.670
so it doesn't need to
be something that you

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.280
have to do it, by any means.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.130
But what would you
recommend for people

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:46.130
who were interested in
this, curious about it,

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:49.730
but may not be able to know
how to start or do anything?

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.980
And they don't know if their--
maybe their body is OK.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.729
They have no idea.

00:40:52.729 --> 00:40:56.025
They just know that this is
something that is intriguing.

00:40:56.025 --> 00:40:57.147
What would you recommend?

00:40:57.147 --> 00:40:59.480
KAREN HENSON JONES: Ah, those
are really good questions.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.430
It's very personal.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:04.550
It's very personal to what
you might be attracted to.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:06.380
Chade-Mang Tan, who
works here at Google,

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.370
has a book called
"Search Inside Yourself,"

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.100
and I think it's
perfect for this

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.480
because it's a very good
introduction to these concepts

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.830
and to these ideas.

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:18.040
So get "Search Inside Yourself."

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.250
And then I think a
great recommendation is,

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.420
for anybody who wants
to begin meditation,

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.751
is to try meditating in
short periods of time.

00:41:26.751 --> 00:41:28.250
Like, it could be
quite challenging.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:30.124
Some of you can start
with five minutes a day

00:41:30.124 --> 00:41:32.420
or 10 minutes a day,
but make it regular.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.070
Or to work with
guided meditation.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.580
So there are a lot of really
good meditation teachers

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.960
that offer podcasts
and things on iTunes.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.442
And that's a great way for
beginners to start, too.

00:41:43.442 --> 00:41:45.400
Or you could just throw
yourself into the fire.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.430
You could just go to Bhutan.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:47.285
RACHEL O'MEARA: Go to Bhutan.

00:41:47.285 --> 00:41:47.780
KAREN HENSON JONES:
Go to a monastery.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.730
RACHEL O'MEARA: Or a mountain.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.310
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:56.280
AUDIENCE: I was curious if you
have any thoughts on why there

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:02.560
are many people who can become
aware of habits that are not

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:05.760
serving what they may
see as a greater purpose

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.850
and who feel like, if I don't
change this I will probably

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:11.320
regret it-- it might
be very clear mentally,

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.850
but still are not able
to change their habit

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.540
and still get caught.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.880
And then other people
will have something happen

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.922
where they are forced to.

00:42:20.922 --> 00:42:22.296
KAREN HENSON JONES:
That's right.

00:42:22.296 --> 00:42:22.920
That's right.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.350
AUDIENCE: Do you believe that
there is actually a reason,

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.920
that there's actually fate,
where some people are forced

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.300
by fate to face something
and take a different step,

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.769
and other people, it could
happen or it could not happen?

00:42:35.769 --> 00:42:37.060
KAREN HENSON JONES: Yeah, I do.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.180
This is so fascinating, because
this is sort of actually

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.721
the topic of my next
book because I'm

00:42:40.721 --> 00:42:46.450
really interested in this
idea of fate versus choice.

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:47.471
I do think so.

00:42:47.471 --> 00:42:49.720
And I think that maybe these
people, where fate really

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.820
reroutes them, are the people
who are never going to do it,

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:54.520
who are never going to change.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.720
Does that make sense?

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.090
So yeah, I think there are
things that are very deeply

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.844
ingrained at the subconscious.

00:43:02.844 --> 00:43:04.260
Everybody knows,
like, I shouldn't

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.840
eat five chocolate bars, but
maybe still do it anyway.

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:17.150
But why some people
and why not others

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.814
might go back to this question,
is it really the higher self?

00:43:19.814 --> 00:43:20.730
Is it really the soul?

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:25.080
Is it something that they
want so badly that their ego

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.452
self just won't let them
do it that they get forced?

00:43:29.452 --> 00:43:31.375
It's a great question.

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:33.830
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for coming.

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:37.880
I guess this is less of a
question but more of a comment,

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:44.760
because I'm really intrigued by
when you mentioned that you had

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:48.335
felt that your soul had picked
the lessons that you're going

00:43:48.335 --> 00:43:49.960
to learn or the
experiences that you're

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.480
going to have in this lifetime,
to learn certain lessons.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:58.790
And I was just curious if you've
ever heard of Sylvia Browne?

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.930
Yeah, so she's a psychic medium.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.820
And I read it years
and years ago.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.960
She has a book called
"The Other Side and Back."

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.450
And she's usually on the
"Montel Williams" show,

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:08.150
back in the day.

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.215
And she's a psychic medium
who finds people who are dead

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:12.090
and things like that.

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:14.298
So she wrote a book called
"The Other Side and Back."

00:44:14.298 --> 00:44:17.497
And this was the first time I
actually heard about this topic

00:44:17.497 --> 00:44:18.580
that you're talking about.

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.451
So it's crazy that several years
later, you're talking about it.

00:44:21.451 --> 00:44:23.700
I'm like, wow, I hadn't
thought about that in a while.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:27.130
But she, basically in her book,
was talking about the fact

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:31.680
that we have souls or spirits.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.910
And before we actually
come to this plane,

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:36.940
we map out our entire life.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:37.940
So we choose the family.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:38.856
We choose the friends.

00:44:38.856 --> 00:44:41.420
We choose the
experiences that we have,

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.490
because it's for certain
lessons to learn.

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:47.350
And she even said that the
reason why we experience

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.680
deja vu is because our
souls put checkpoints

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.022
in our life to make sure
that we are reminded

00:44:53.022 --> 00:44:54.230
that we're on the right path.

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:57.169
So deja vu is just
your soul telling you,

00:44:57.169 --> 00:44:58.210
you're on the right path.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:00.220
You're exactly where
you're supposed to be

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.037
and where you are.

00:45:01.037 --> 00:45:02.870
So I thought it was
just really interesting.

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.460
So I guess in
saying all of that,

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.918
I wanted to know if you've ever
heard of her and that book.

00:45:06.918 --> 00:45:08.794
And then the other
part was-- I guess

00:45:08.794 --> 00:45:10.710
that's similar to some
of the other questions.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:15.314
Do you feel like you have a soul
that chose all the experiences

00:45:15.314 --> 00:45:17.730
that you are having in your
life to learn certain lessons,

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.330
and you fundamentally
believe that?

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:23.020
KAREN HENSON JONES: You know,
I'm still working on it.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.270
I have heard of Sylvia Browne.

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.478
There's a very, very funny
article in "The Guardian."

00:45:26.478 --> 00:45:27.930
It's a UK newspaper.

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:30.170
You can look it up-- about
a guy who was a reporter.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.190
So he wanted to see if
she was valid or not.

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:35.300
And so he signed up for
a Sylvia Browne cruise.

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:36.160
It was very funny.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:40.100
You can check it out, so
Sylvia Browne and the Guardian.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.830
Yeah, do I think that
the soul chooses things?

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:45.400
More and more, I'm
believing that it does.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.220
Sometimes, there
are coincidences

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:54.490
that are just so powerful
that I can ignore it.

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:59.040
So yeah, yeah, I do think that.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.890
AUDIENCE: So I think
I'm just really confused

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:06.260
by the idea of having a soul
that chooses what you're

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:11.970
about to do and stuff, because
why would the soul choose to be

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:16.070
that poor little boy who's
on the streets in India

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:18.820
and permanently hunched over
and just begging for money?

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.350
I don't understand what
kind of lesson that is.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:25.340
And if we say that, oh, it's
because in his previous life,

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:27.025
he did something wrong.

00:46:27.025 --> 00:46:32.940
And then I'm like, well, does
everyone have reincarnation?

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.280
Because the
population growth, we

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.910
started with a much,
much smaller population.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:42.830
So some souls will have to be
just like-- come up somewhere,

00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:45.450
right, be created
somehow, because we

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:49.160
have a much larger population
in the world now than before.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.470
And then when those
souls get created,

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:56.370
they're just like, OK, I'm
going to choose to be poor.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:59.849
I just don't understand
how that works.

00:46:59.849 --> 00:47:01.140
KAREN HENSON JONES: Me neither.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.950
It was interesting because
when I went to University

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:07.250
of Virginia and I spoke to
this guy, Dr. Jim Tucker,

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:10.170
and he had written two
books about past lives,

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.454
I had assumed that he'd be
categorically like, yeah,

00:47:13.454 --> 00:47:15.620
past lives, right, because
he's the one interviewing

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.340
all these kids.

00:47:20.024 --> 00:47:22.190
So I said, so do you think
this is what's happening?

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:23.231
Are we all reincarnating?

00:47:23.231 --> 00:47:24.990
And he said, not necessarily.

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:27.560
He says, I think for
these particular children

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.180
that I interviewed, it might
be a very good explanation

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:32.060
for what's going on.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.730
And he said, but
is reincarnation

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:36.080
totally universal?

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.590
He's like, I don't know.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.875
And it was really
mind-blowing to me,

00:47:40.875 --> 00:47:43.000
because I was either
thinking, we are reincarnating

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:43.970
or we're not.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:47.880
But it might not
necessarily be the case.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.320
I mean, I think it's just
all such a huge mystery,

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.440
and we get more glimpses
of possibilities.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.690
But it's always a mystery.

00:47:56.690 --> 00:48:00.104
And something that he said at
the end of our conversation

00:48:00.104 --> 00:48:01.770
together that I didn't
put in the book--

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.089
and when you talked
about deja vu-- he said,

00:48:04.089 --> 00:48:06.130
would you ever believe
that you could reincarnate

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:07.790
and be the same identity?

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:10.376
So could you ever come
back and be yourself again

00:48:10.376 --> 00:48:11.500
and make different choices?

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.260
Too much?

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:15.950
Yeah.

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:18.680
Too much, yeah.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.110
Still stuck on past lives, yeah.

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:23.970
But if you look at the
contribution of this boy who

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:28.160
is India, would you ever have
thought that he's made it here

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:35.420
to Palo Alto on a video
that's going to be broadcast

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:39.100
potentially around the planet
with the lessons and the beauty

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.720
that he has to share?

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.991
So maybe that could
be his purpose?

00:48:42.991 --> 00:48:44.240
RACHEL O'MEARA: Great, thanks.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.185
And I know we could probably
sit here for a while

00:48:46.185 --> 00:48:48.340
and keep asking questions,
but we do have to wrap up.

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:50.070
But if people have
more questions for you

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:52.050
out there or at
Google, where they go

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:53.741
to continue the conversation?

00:48:53.741 --> 00:48:55.240
KAREN HENSON JONES:
I have a website

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.120
that has a lot of questions and
answers, a lot of information,

00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.920
a lot of links to
more information.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:06.570
It's www.karenhensonjones.com--
K-A-R-E-N. So check it out.

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:07.320
Thank you so much.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:07.620
RACHEL O'MEARA: Great.

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.220
Thanks, Karen.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.470
KAREN HENSON JONES: All right.

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:11.270
