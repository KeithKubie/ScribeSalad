00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, it can't be the normal force on the rock, the rock is in the air.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The ground isn't pushing up on it and there is normal force.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I say the best answer was the pulling force. This person is pulling down on the rope.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Depending on how hard they pull, they can control the tension in this rope.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So we know that the tension is equal to this pulling force.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And it's always going to be true no matter how many pulls to that,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and if this tension force is balancing the weight, which it is,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
well then, these forces are also equal to the weight (mg).

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And (mg) is about 1000 N because the (m) is 100 kg and (g) is 10 m/sÂ²,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
actually 9.8 but we're using 10.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This doesn't seem like a great improvement.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We're still using a force equal to the weight to lift this object.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Why not just pick it up? Well, that's why this is called the simple pulley.
