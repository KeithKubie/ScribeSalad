00:02:33.327 --> 00:02:34.321
Thank you.

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:43.970
ANDY KARL: Next.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.862
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.380
I love that song, by the way--

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.588

couldn't tell by the title.

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.700
SPEAKER: That was fantastic.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.780
Please, have a seat.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.360
And I'd love to also invite
up Paula Wagner, the show's

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.540
producer.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.230
Where's Paula?

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.192
Excellent.

00:06:42.192 --> 00:06:44.964
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.510
So that was fantastic.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.010
It brought back--
just this weekend,

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.470
I saw the show, which
was equally amazing.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.970
And I thought, maybe
to kick us off,

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.040
what we could do, just by way
of introduction to this crowd,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.998
is that each of you could
just share a tiny bit

00:06:57.998 --> 00:07:00.330
about your background
and, really,

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.400
what attracted you to want
to be part of this project.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.060
PAULA WAGNER: Well, sitting
next to these two people,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.140
how could I not?

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.780
SPEAKER: I get that.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.480
PAULA WAGNER: I actually got
involved earlier than they did.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.090
But I'd known
Garry Marshall, who

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.750
was the real spirit
and inspiration.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.750
And who doesn't love this movie?

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.830
It is really one of the
great movies of all times.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.070
It's more watched and
re-watched all over the world

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.630
than almost any film.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.580
Everywhere in the
world, they know it.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.200
So it was exciting.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.080
And of course, working
with Samantha and Andy

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.730
is just a dream--

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.680
really a dream--
and our whole cast.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.295
And to be able to work with
Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:46.820
and Jerry Mitchell, JF Lawton--

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.270
our entire cast--

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.615
Orfeh, who's fantastic.

00:07:49.615 --> 00:07:49.890
SPEAKER: What a team.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.098
PAULA WAGNER: Eric Anderson--

00:07:51.098 --> 00:07:52.660
I could just go on and on.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.390
I have done just
about everything

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.770
you can do in this business.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.530
I started as an actress.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.220
I was one of those
summer stock kids.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.120
I've done everything.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.100
I've hung lights.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.700
I've done props.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.640
I've done it all.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.600
And I was an agent in Hollywood.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.760
And I had a production company.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.590
I've produced many, many
movies, a lot of action films.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.860
And it was time to--

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.470
ANDY KARL: There's a little one
we should know about, right?

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.037
It's just a little
independent film--

00:08:18.037 --> 00:08:19.620
"Mission Impossible"
films, I believe.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.200
PAULA WAGNER: Yeah.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.070
The first three.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.940
"Mission I, II"--

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.080
ANDY KARL: Just the first three.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.670
PAULA WAGNER: The
origin story, really.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.110
But there's something magical
about musicals on Broadway.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.380
And it's my favorite thing.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.630
And I love every minute of it.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.360
And everything I've ever
done has organically

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.664
led to the next thing.

00:08:37.664 --> 00:08:39.539
SPEAKER: Well, we're
grateful it led to this.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.039
Andy?

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.130
PAULA WAGNER: Thank you.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:41.963
ANDY KARL: Oh, yeah.

00:08:41.963 --> 00:08:44.970
Becoming involved with
"Pretty Woman," my story,

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.830
it basically starts at Broadway.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.350
I wasn't involved in the
out-of-town runs with Chicago

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.420
and doing the workshops,
but I had seen them all,

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.020
because my wife, Orfeh,
who was mentioned before,

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.730
plays Kit De Luca in the show.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.867
So I was a fan of
the show already,

00:08:58.867 --> 00:09:00.200
and certainly a fan of Samantha.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.727
I was like, star right here.

00:09:01.727 --> 00:09:02.560
It's pretty amazing.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.370
And I was like,
oh, this is great.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.720
Honey, have a great
time doing the show.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.700
I'll see you later.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.390
And then the role of Edward
Lewis opened up for Broadway.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.739
And Jerry Mitchell, who I knew
from doing "Legally Blonde,"

00:09:16.739 --> 00:09:17.280
called me up.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.920
And he's like, would
you like to do it?

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:21.230
And I was like, what?

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:22.360
Are you kidding?

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.229
I wasn't sure.

00:09:24.229 --> 00:09:25.770
I had to think about
it for a second.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.862
Because I was like,
[STUTTERING] I'm not sure--

00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:29.820
should I be doing this?

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.530
Is this the right role?

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.450
But then I realized,
my wife's doing it.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.280
I know Jerry Mitchell very well.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.070
I know the show very
well from seeing it.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.920
Samantha's a star.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.095
This is amazing.

00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:41.970
And Garry Marshall and
I had worked together,

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.790
where I played the
Fonz in "Happy Days--

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.420
The Musical" at the Falcon
Theater, in his theater,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.350
many years ago.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.390
And so I was friends
already with the family.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.056
I was, basically,
friends with everybody

00:09:53.056 --> 00:09:55.260
that was already
part of the show.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.410
And then, a few hours later,
I sang through the music

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.510
just to see if I could.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.120
Because it's Bryan Adams,
and all respect to him--

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.030
he's amazing and can write
incredible pop tunes,

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.345
but also has a voice that
no man can actually sing.

00:10:08.345 --> 00:10:09.720
SAMANTHA BARKS:
Higher than mine.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.400
ANDY KARL: It's
higher than yours.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.200
So I was, like, I don't
think I can sing that high.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.660
But they lowered
the keys for me.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.800
No.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.870
Eight shows a week,
singing these tunes,

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.690
you know, it's got
to be in the pocket.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.760
And then the role just sort of--

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.870
I examined it.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.424
And Edward Lewis, in
the film, does a lot--

00:10:28.424 --> 00:10:30.840
Richard Gere does a lot of
this-- like takes to the camera

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.650
like.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.150
So I'm like, what's
behind all that?

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.834
Where's all the internal
monologue stuff?

00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:37.750
Who is this character?

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.290
And then you realize
how complex he is.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.380
And we talked about
the dialogue and maybe

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.390
adding a few lines here
that really hone in

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.140
on this character.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.390
And the songs open up a whole
thing for the character.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.500
And then I was fully in.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.520
I was like, oh, wait.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.780
I have to do Edward Lewis.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:51.960
This is great.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.100
PAULA WAGNER: We
had to have him.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:53.780
ANDY KARL: Thank you.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.030
PAULA WAGNER: From the
beginning-- from the beginning.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.650
But you were doing another show.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.270
ANDY KARL: I'm glad
I was in the mix.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.000
PAULA WAGNER: More than
in-- you were-- you were it.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.208
ANDY KARL: It was just great.

00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:04.560
It was great to come on board.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.600
And we've just been
having a blast since.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.559
And that's been my journey
with "Pretty Woman."

00:11:08.559 --> 00:11:10.891
SPEAKER: And I feel like you
do see a few of those looks

00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:12.250
in the show, just like that.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:12.958
ANDY KARL: Yeah--

00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:14.620
[LAUGHING]

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.695
--I would have paid for.

00:11:15.695 --> 00:11:16.600
SAMANTHA BARKS:
Smolder-- the smolder.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.200
ANDY KARL: Yeah, I gave
you a few smolders.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.449
SPEAKER: Yes, that's the word.

00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:20.810
SAMANTHA BARKS: Well, yeah.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:21.910
I'm not even from here.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.540
I'm from England.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.960
And so, yeah.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.176
Yeah, did you-- did you?

00:11:26.176 --> 00:11:26.620
ANDY KARL: Didn't know.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.619
SAMANTHA BARKS: No clue.

00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:28.640
OK.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.870
And honestly, for
me, the moment--

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.800
I was flicking through,
and I saw "Pretty Woman--

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.860
The Musical."

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.190
And the moment I saw
that, I was like, well,

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.570
I'm desperate to do that role.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.460
There wasn't even
a question mark.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.230
It was just like, that role--

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.290
what a gift of a role.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.090
And I saw Jerry was
directing it, who

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.250
I'd always wanted to work with.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.120
And I'd seen all of his shows
and been such a fan of his.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.475
So honestly, for me, the
minute I got the music--

00:11:58.475 --> 00:12:00.410
it said "Bryan Adams."

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.390
Because I'd just received
all the information,

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.110
and I hadn't even
read anything before.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.070
I was like, let
me see the music.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:05.730
Let me see.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.980
And I was like, Bryan Adams.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.550
That's a weird name
for a songwriter

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.750
if it's not Bryan Adams.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.944
I was like, hang on.

00:12:13.944 --> 00:12:16.110
You can't be called Bryan
Adams and be a songwriter.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.682
And I was like, not Bryan Adams.

00:12:18.682 --> 00:12:19.390
He was like, yes.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.515
Did you not read the email?

00:12:20.515 --> 00:12:21.841
I was like, I was so excited.

00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:22.340
So yeah.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.780
So all the elements--

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.950
it was just a no-brainer.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.990
I was just like, get me
into that room to audition.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.207
PAULA WAGNER: Samantha
was a no-brainer for us,

00:12:31.207 --> 00:12:32.089
I can tell you.

00:12:32.089 --> 00:12:34.380
SAMANTHA BARKS: Well, honestly,
it's just been amazing.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.300
And it's been really, for me--

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.670
I was thinking around
my last birthday

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.450
was when I first
started with the show.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.080
It was this time last
year when we did the lab,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.790
and we started to workshop.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.840
And then I went out of town
with it, in Chicago, and now

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.560
to Broadway.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.970
And this is my Broadway debut.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.080
And it's just been magic.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.799
I can't believe
that I get to do it.

00:12:58.799 --> 00:12:59.590
I can't believe it.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.590
And we have so much fun.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.250
And that, for us, was--

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.869
the minute we met-- and
we met just socially.

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.410
I went to see him
in "Groundhog Day,"

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.660
and then he came
to see the show.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.330
And it is like an
amazing family.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.810
And just all the elements.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.140
Paula is absolutely a hero.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.280
We just are so, so
lucky to have her.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.610
And it's an amazing
group of people.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.532
And that makes it all
just even more special.

00:13:23.532 --> 00:13:24.990
SPEAKER: I mean,
that's incredible.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.347
And what a transition
from London to New York.

00:13:28.347 --> 00:13:29.680
SAMANTHA BARKS: A bit of a jump.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.055
SPEAKER: Well, and with that,
I guess I'm curious, right,

00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:34.535
because you've got this
iconic story with all

00:13:34.535 --> 00:13:36.060
of the legends
that surround that.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.550
Then, you've got this
incredible dream team

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.679
surrounding the entire
show, and sitting here.

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:42.720
And I guess, just starting
with you a little bit,

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.300
what was it like to
bring that to life?

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.530
Were you anxious
about expectations?

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.130
Were you just beyond
with all the talent?

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.690
How did you experience it?

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.222
SAMANTHA BARKS: I think,
with a project like this,

00:13:54.222 --> 00:13:59.322
it's so loved to start--
this movie is so loved.

00:13:59.322 --> 00:14:00.780
These characters
are so well loved.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.630
And Julia Roberts is so loved.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.410
And Richard Gere-- it's magic.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:05.280
They're all magic.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:11.130
And so I feel like, I guess,
for me, starting it, I just,

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:14.100
I don't feel that you can
walk in carrying all that

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.407
and being scared of
all that, and fearful.

00:14:17.407 --> 00:14:18.990
I was just excited
about the challenge

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.750
of getting to get stuck in
and get to know this character

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.360
and translate this
character for a musical.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.600
We get to sing songs
by Bryan Adams.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.390
That, already,
means that you get

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.040
to create something different.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.740
And it's been really
fascinating trying

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.560
to work these characters
into a musical world

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.390
and see how they communicate.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.480
PAULA WAGNER: Garry Marshall,
from actually the moment

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.550
that the film came out, saw
this as a musical for Broadway.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.170
That was his dream.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.860
And we're very happy
that his dream came true.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.640
But he worked on it
until he passed away.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.320
We did the first act--

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.630
actually, Orfeh was with us.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.280
We worked on the first act.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.730
And then he passed away.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.030
But we carried on.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.090
And it was his dream.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.010
He always felt the
musicality of the show.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.010
SPEAKER: That's amazing.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.892
PAULA WAGNER: And
with these people.

00:15:12.892 --> 00:15:14.600
SPEAKER: Well, it's
an incredible vision.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.470
And I was saying
to them backstage

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.970
that I wasn't sure
what to expect,

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.190
having loved the movie so much.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.610
A take on that is
always a challenge.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.800
But the freshness and
retaining everything

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.677
that was important
about the film, but also

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:29.760
bringing a fresh take with
all of this creativity,

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.832
was really incredible.

00:15:30.832 --> 00:15:32.290
And I'm curious--
and maybe, Paula,

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.170
this is a question for you--

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.770
the film came out in 1990.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.250
This is opening in 2018.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.700
How did you think
about making it fresh

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.900
and yet keeping the heart?

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:43.890
Was there a strategy?

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.750
Did it just happen?

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.970
PAULA WAGNER: It
took a long time.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:52.950
And I have to credit
my creative team--

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.620
Jerry Mitchell, JF
Lawton, who wrote

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.410
the original, original
script, obviously

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.500
Garry Marshall's
spirit and vision,

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:06.450
it infuses every moment.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:14.190
And Bryan Adams, of course, who
brought this incredible sound

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.590
and passion and depth.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.730
And it was the right
thing at the right time--

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.250
Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:24.990
Jim is a very gifted songwriter,
and the two people together.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:30.510
And we work with our musicians--

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:33.120
Will Van Dyke, whom you
saw up here, who's amazing.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.650
We just have this great team.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:42.010
And what it is, is
how do you translate--

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.240
as Andy said-- how do you
translate a look to stage?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.330
How do you translate
passion to stage?

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.640
And it's the musicality
of those moments.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.230
And when you have a
superb cast, as we do,

00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.450
and they bring to life the inner
workings of that character--

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.880
and particularly in the
character Vivian and Edward--

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.280
you stay true to the movie
that everybody knows and loves

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.839
and all those great moments.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:16.330
But you also bring something
that has a contemporary feel.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:21.339
Our young woman is
more independent.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.550
She knows how to handle
herself, but she's

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.260
searching for something.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:33.250
But she doesn't take any kind
of inappropriate behavior

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.570
from anybody else,
and that's different.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.090
She maybe has made a mistake
with what she's doing.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.720
But she's going to
figure it all out.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.240
And that's her journey.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:48.340
And in the process,
she saves him.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.450
SPEAKER: How much were
you watching the movie

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:51.700
over and over and studying it?

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.700
How much of it was trying to
just independently put yourself

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.770
in today's version of
that character, the way

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:57.699
Paula's describing?

00:17:57.699 --> 00:17:58.615
What was your process?

00:18:00.965 --> 00:18:02.590
ANDY KARL: It was
interesting because I

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:08.900
did go back and watch the film
when I was being considered.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.870
And I wanted to see,
what is the core?

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.660
Where's all the stuff land?

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.000
And it lands in the
chemistry between the two

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.930
lead characters.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.460
Richard Gere and Julia Roberts
have this incredible chemistry.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.690
And you're just sucked in.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.800
And you want to go
along for the ride.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.100
Julia Roberts is just amazing.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.712
And so when I saw Samantha do
it, I was like, she's got it.

00:18:30.712 --> 00:18:31.420
You're sucked in.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.060
I'm totally with her story.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.820
Samantha's handling this
character amazingly.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.730
I was like, when I
join, I want there

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:46.930
to be this immediate friendship,
interesting, romantic thing

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.200
that needs to start weaving
from the very get-go of the show

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.470
and end up with the
audience just wanting them

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.220
to be together so
badly that there's

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:01.635
such joy in it at the end,
which I think we found.

00:19:01.635 --> 00:19:03.760
I feel like we have, because
they're all applauding

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.440
at the end when we kiss--

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.970
and when she rescues him
right back is just incredible.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.660
And I feel like we win that way.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.090
That was my main objective
is just to make sure

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:21.730
that the two of us, onstage,
find what the element is

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.480
in saving each other and
becoming the evolved characters

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.200
at the end.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.790
She finds strength.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.780
Edward finds he can let
go of all of his chambers

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.430
around his heart, let go
of his father passing away.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.990
There's all this stuff that we
don't hone in on in the show.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.880
It's not a depressing
piece about my father

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.080
dying or anything.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.730
But it's about being able
to love even when you think

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.340
you're at the top of your game.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.360
It's when you have
all this stuff,

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.440
and you're looking
around, and you've got

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.731
the silver spoon in your mouth.

00:19:51.731 --> 00:19:54.570
You've been given everything,
every opportunity in the world.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.050
And what are you missing?

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.340
Really, it's just the
heart and the compassion.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.690
That was my journey and
making sure that that worked.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:02.639
SPEAKER: I love that.

00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:04.180
And Samantha, would
you add anything?

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.555
SAMANTHA BARKS:
Do you know what?

00:20:05.555 --> 00:20:07.550
For me, I did not
watch the movie.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.870
So the minute I first found out
that I was going to audition,

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:15.410
I didn't watch the movie, and I
haven't watched it since before

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:15.910
then.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.535
I don't know when
the last time it was.

00:20:17.535 --> 00:20:20.050
I watched it, probably, not
long before that because who

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.840
hasn't watched "Pretty
Woman" at least once a year

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.140
every year of their life?

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.990
But no, I haven't watched it.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.530
Because it's hard
because they're

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.930
such iconic performances.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:37.870
And we have so many elements
of the movie in our show, which

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.640
we want to make
sure that we deliver

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.960
that nostalgia, for sure, but
also telling our own version

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.020
of these characters.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:47.980
So yeah, I don't know.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:54.340
Because for me, it would
be hard to re-watch it now.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:21:01.270
Because I'm doing my own thing--
still, absolutely, with respect

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.070
to the amazing performance
that Julia Roberts gave,

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.490
which is just so
iconic, but also

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.900
trying to do my own version.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.950
So for me, I haven't watched it.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.044
I don't dare to watch it.

00:21:12.044 --> 00:21:13.210
SPEAKER: I totally get that.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.800
Well, and I heard that
Julia Roberts actually

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.770
came and watched you.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.630
So how was that?

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.629
SAMANTHA BARKS: Oh, yes.

00:21:17.629 --> 00:21:19.900
Well, I didn't know
she was watching.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.610
So it was a tribute
night to Garry Marshall,

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.820
and it was amazing--

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:25.990
what an amazing night.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.270
And then at the end,
there was a speech,

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.300
and it was, hi to Julia
Roberts in the audience.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.175
I was like, what do you
mean Julia Roberts is

00:21:32.175 --> 00:21:33.070
in the audience?

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.770
She came backstage, and
I was like, oh, wow.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.120
And she just hugged me.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.320
And we just stayed hugging.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.050
And I was like, this
is just so amazing.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.050
SPEAKER: That's amazing.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.870
SAMANTHA BARKS:
And it was just--

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.950
it was so special
to have her in.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.750
And she was so lovely and
encouraging and supportive

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.030
of what we were
doing, and of me,

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.420
which just made my heart burst.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.250
It was really a dream.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:01.479
And she's so beautiful.

00:22:01.479 --> 00:22:03.520
I don't even mean just to
look at-- because she's

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.070
stunning to look at-- but
she's got this amazing,

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.300
almost like this
light around her.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:12.440
And she just-- her smile is--
oh, I could go on for days.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.777
It was an amazing moment.

00:22:15.777 --> 00:22:16.360
It really was.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.720
SPEAKER: Oh, god,
I can only imagine.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.220
I wanted to turn
back to you, Paula,

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.240
and say it's a hot topic
now, women in Hollywood,

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.200
et cetera, et cetera.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.550
How, if at all, did you
feel like the leadership

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.049
of this show--

00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:31.090
did you experience it any
differently as a woman?

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.548
Did you think being
a woman brought

00:22:32.548 --> 00:22:35.057
a different touch or not?

00:22:35.057 --> 00:22:38.090
PAULA WAGNER: Well, I have--

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.550
how do I say it?--

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:44.750
been in a leadership position
for a long time in my career.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:48.010
And so I have
looked at it as what

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:52.300
are the skills of leadership
and really working

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.920
toward the qualities that
a good leader should have,

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.200
which is compassion
and understanding.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.420
And I guess I've done
about every job you

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:06.410
can do in the theater
and film and television.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.680
So it's understanding
what everybody

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.190
is doing and being
collaborative, and working

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.400
with the very best people and
supporting them and encouraging

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.230
them to do their very best work.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.770
And we have this
great group of people.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:24.090
And then, of course,
there's Jerry Mitchell,

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.960
who is so phenomenal and so
exceptional as a director

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:31.990
and brought his energy
and passion and desire.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:36.580
And the director, really,
is the creative leader.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.590
They're the ones that take
and put everything together.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:44.140
And so what I watch on stage
is a beautiful collaboration.

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:50.470
So it makes being the lead
producer easy and fun.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.570
SPEAKER: That's the
best part of a job.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.420
Well, and one other thing that's
an interesting commonality

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.820
is there's actually a lot of
married couples at Google.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:00.080
I don't know if that's
a little-known fact.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.750
But I'm just curious, you're
in the show with your wife,

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.269
and you've worked
with her before.

00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:07.310
How does that translate
in a theater environment?

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.230
How does that work for you guys?

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.420
ANDY KARL: We worked together
on a couple of different shows.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.530
One was the Jerry Mitchell show.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:12.490
We did "Legally
Blonde" together,

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.140
where she played Paulette,
and I was Kyle, the UPS guy.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.530
We wound up being
onstage together.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.080
That was our first
Broadway turn.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:20.580
Oh, no.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.329
It was our second.

00:24:21.329 --> 00:24:24.790
We had done "Saturday Night
Fever" before that, years ago.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:29.140
And we've since done concerts
together and other productions.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.610
So this is our
third Broadway show.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:35.020
And actually, just based
on scheduling alone,

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.500
that's the dream, if
you can work together.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:43.480
Now we can both walk the dogs at
the same time and/or feed them.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.270
We can schedule our
lives, as opposed to,

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:49.480
I'm coming in for six hours,
you're going out for six hours.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.970
I have to fly off here,
you're flying off there.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:56.080
So right now, it's a
little wonderful thing,

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.750
being together just
outside of the show.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.690
Inside of the show, we actually
never see each other onstage--

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.550
ever, except for the bows.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.310
Because she's just on her
own journey of her character,

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.270
and I'm on mine.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.765
I just have such respect
for my wife's talent,

00:25:13.765 --> 00:25:15.940
and I've always had it.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.670
I saw her onstage before
I actually met her, once.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.610
I was like, oh, my god.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.800
Chick's amazing.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.140
And then, I got to meet her
and be in a show with her.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.620
And we were dating
six weeks later.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.320
And I was like, I took
advantage of a situation.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.940
So 18 years later, we're
still doing what we do.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:39.970
And we're different
performers, and we're

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.000
different people, and full
respect for that, as well.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.090
So if we were, I
guess, too identical,

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.749
I don't know if maybe we might
rub each other the wrong way.

00:25:49.749 --> 00:25:50.290
I'm not sure.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.740
But I just let her do her
thing, which is amazing.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.860
If you see the show, you're
not going to miss her.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.151
SAMANTHA BARKS: Oh, if you
haven't heard Orfeh's voice,

00:25:58.151 --> 00:25:58.856
it's like--

00:25:58.856 --> 00:26:03.143
if I heard that, I would
be like, marry me, please.

00:26:03.143 --> 00:26:05.740
Honestly, a voice that you've
never heard anything like it.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:06.010
It's like, OK.

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:07.290
PAULA WAGNER: She's fantastic.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.420
SAMANTHA BARKS: Huge voice.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.310
And she's just-- oh,
my, gosh, amazing.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.810
Wow.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.320
I love her character, too.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.950
ANDY KARL: I think that's
it-- just respect and also

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.167
good scheduling.

00:26:16.167 --> 00:26:17.500
SPEAKER: Practical and romantic.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.940
I like it.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.939
PAULA WAGNER: We have a
great "Pretty Woman" family.

00:26:21.939 --> 00:26:23.480
SAMANTHA BARKS:
Yeah, I can see that.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.813
All right, let's go to the mics.

00:26:24.813 --> 00:26:25.990
AUDIENCE: Question for Andy.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.167
So I loved seeing you--

00:26:28.167 --> 00:26:29.000
I'm a fan of yours--

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.130
I loved seeing you
in "Legally Blonde,"

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:32.230
"Rocky," "Groundhog Day."

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.446
I haven't seen this yet.

00:26:33.446 --> 00:26:35.320
The question is, is
there a particular reason

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.830
you do so many shows
that are based on movies?

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.620
ANDY KARL: They just
come around, man.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.860
There's a lot of them
that come into town.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.450
It was really interesting
because my first show

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:51.070
that I ever did that was
like that was "Saturday Night

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.770
Fever," where I met my wife.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:57.400
And I went on as Tony Manero
because almost every matinee,

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.930
I was going on as the lead.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:04.240
And it was my first going into a
show that was based on a movie,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.220
based on a character,
and kind of

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.890
went for, (WITH ACCENT)
would you watch the hair?

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:09.490
You know.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.260
I work on the hair a long time.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.470
And I was sort of mimicking
the style and the dance

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:20.460
and nostalgia pieces putting in.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.790
So I've kind of been
skilled at it now.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.150
It's finding the right
amount of nostalgia

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:31.000
in order to bring
the audience in

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.370
to know what they're watching,
and then bring as much honesty

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:38.290
to the character as possible.

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:43.780
I think there's something
in doing that many that I've

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.190
found the spot.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.735
It all depends,
also, on the show.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:54.260
"Groundhog Day," I thought,
found its own world--

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:59.271
bananas, spinning stage,
world of trying to--

00:27:59.271 --> 00:28:04.610
it was trying to find
its own idea of a show.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:08.530
And it was terrific and
such a incredible journey

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.610
of a character.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.660
And we ran for six months.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.230
So we closed.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.310
And I was like, man.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:15.602
PAULA WAGNER: But you won
the Olivier Award in London--

00:28:15.602 --> 00:28:16.601
ANDY KARL: There's that.

00:28:16.601 --> 00:28:19.480
PAULA WAGNER: --I have to say,
and was nominated for a Tony.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:26.760
ANDY KARL: So it's about
where's the line of nostalgia

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.210
and then also bringing
something joyous.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.340
It's catching the
right amount of what

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.590
the movie was, but
then also bringing

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:36.950
a joy you've never seen before.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:41.320
I think "Pretty Woman"
balances that line so well.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.170
And the audiences
are just coming in

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.680
and going nuts for it.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.890
But basically, there's
just so many people

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.842
who want to make-- it's these
good pieces that people want

00:28:50.842 --> 00:28:52.300
to make into
musicals-- because you

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.620
want to hear these people sing.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.990
I think "Pretty Woman"
was one of those things

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.792
like, that would
make a great musical.

00:28:58.792 --> 00:29:00.250
"Legally Blonde,"
it was like, that

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:03.550
would make a great-- you think
about it and how would it be?

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.020
And then you find
people like me,

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.820
who are stupid enough to do it.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.570
PAULA WAGNER: We're the
recipient of his genius.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.880
ANDY KARL: But it's
definitely a fun skill

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:20.200
to know where the line lies
and tiptoe around it and show

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.757
the audience, come on.

00:29:21.757 --> 00:29:22.840
I'm about to say the line.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.298
You know what's
going to come here.

00:29:24.298 --> 00:29:26.180
But I'm giving you
something else.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.794
Because you want to search
for what makes it special.

00:29:29.794 --> 00:29:31.210
SPEAKER: By the
way, when you talk

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:33.880
about the audience coming
in and being crazy for it,

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.570
who are they?

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:37.070
Are the early-goers
nostalgic Gen Xers?

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.039
Are they kids who are excited?

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:39.705
Is it everybody?

00:29:39.705 --> 00:29:41.290
PAULA WAGNER: Everybody.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.350
People from all over the world--

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:48.670
young people, people who were
young when the movie was on,

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.180
who now are nostalgic.

00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:53.860
But really interesting
young people--

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:58.420
18, people 13 plus, I would say.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.370
It really is that
amazing array--

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.220
women, men, couples.

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.970
They leave the theater
kind of embracing.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.130
A group of women
together-- they'll come

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.760
sometimes dressed
in red dresses.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.430
There's something about it.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.390
I talked to a
group of women that

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.810
had all come from Illinois,
the heartland of Illinois.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.880
They come to the
theater once a year

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.220
and have a women's reunion.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.470
And this is the show they came
to, and they just loved it.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:31.630
SPEAKER: I just got chills.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.220
OK, I think we have
another question.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.053
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:30:34.053 --> 00:30:35.740
Thanks for coming.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.480
When I think of
Broadway shows, there

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.210
are a lot of names that
come along with that.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:44.090
Bryan Adams, until recently,
was not one of them.

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:47.020
Paula, maybe you could
talk to who had the idea

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.580
to get Bryan involved?

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.066
How did that happen?

00:30:50.066 --> 00:30:51.190
How did he write the music?

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:56.290
PAULA WAGNER: Great ideas come
from many different places.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:00.580
Both of these
phenomenal actors--

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.590
there were so many
different people who said,

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.485
they have to do this.

00:31:03.485 --> 00:31:04.360
They have to do this.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:09.220
And Bryan had seen the show--

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.450
knew the movie years ago.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:13.340
And he himself had wanted
to do this for a long time,

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:16.870
as did Jerry Mitchell want
to do this for a long time.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.840
But somehow, he knew
someone who knew someone,

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.460
and somebody called me
and said, Bryan Adams.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.100
And it was like a
light bulb went off.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.730
It was kind of like,
yeah, Bryan Adams.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:31.540
You've got it.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.590
That sounds great.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.110
Jerry was like, absolutely.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.980
Our whole team--

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.810
Garry Marshall, JF Lawton--

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:42.440
everybody was like,
we have to do this.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.220
And Bryan and Jim
Vallance came in.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.310
They wrote two songs.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:51.840
I think both or one of
them are still in the show.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.090
They were so good.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:57.830
They did it quickly,
and it was like, yes.

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.955
How could it be anybody else?

00:31:59.955 --> 00:32:00.580
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.160
Thank you

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.121
SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:32:03.121 --> 00:32:03.620
All right.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.090
I'm going to give the
audience one more chance

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:05.798
to ask questions.

00:32:05.798 --> 00:32:10.130
But in the meantime, one
question I have for each of you

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.800
is, hopefully, this is going to
be-- and I'm sure it will be--

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.330
a long and amazing run.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:17.070
But the show also talks a lot
about dreams and the importance

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.990
of always having a dream
of where you're going

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:21.140
and what are you doing.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.550
Beyond this project, what's the
dream project for each of you?

00:32:27.194 --> 00:32:29.610
SAMANTHA BARKS: Well, this is
like a dream project for me.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:34.450
Truly, I've always wanted to
originate a Broadway show.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:37.420
That's always been a
huge dream of mine.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:41.800
And I started doing musicals--

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.450
did "Les Mis-- The
Musical, and that's

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:44.740
what brought me into film.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.210
Did the "Les Mis"
film, and then I

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.560
was doing movies, pretty
much, for the next few years.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.100
But always, in the
back of my mind,

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.900
I just thought, I really want
to do a proper run of a show

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:59.020
and really get in early
and create the character

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.720
and have that creative process.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.320
And truly, this
has been a dream.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.790
This was the big
one that I really

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.121
wanted to get to try and do.

00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:11.870
And I've loved it.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.639
And so I don't know
about the future.

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:16.430
I've never been very
sure about the future.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.130
SPEAKER: How do you think about
the difference between theater

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:18.672
and film?

00:33:18.672 --> 00:33:20.380
Does that affect
anything in terms of how

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.504
you think about the future?

00:33:21.504 --> 00:33:24.520
SAMANTHA BARKS: Well,
I do love them both.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.090
But they're such
different disciplines.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.680
They really are.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.490
And the pros and cons
are equal for both,

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.720
because there's so many pros.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.990
But I'd say that film
is like a sprint,

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.442
and theater is like a marathon.

00:33:40.442 --> 00:33:42.400
And so with theater, it's
definitely different,

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.990
and it's about sustaining
high energy for a long period

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:48.390
of time-- eight shows a week--

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.330
SPEAKER: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.121
SAMANTHA BARKS: --whereas
a film can almost

00:33:51.121 --> 00:33:54.080
feel like for two
or three months,

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.810
you don't speak to
anyone or see anyone.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.640
And you're just in the
film, doing a film,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.690
on location somewhere.

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:00.648
And it's almost like
three months of your life,

00:34:00.648 --> 00:34:02.230
but then that's it.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.110
So I don't know.

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:08.389
I love having the
opportunity to do both.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.889
Yeah.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:11.020
I feel very lucky that
I've got to do both.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.929
And I'd love to continue
just interesting roles.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.179
SPEAKER: I think we'll be
excited for whatever you do.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:17.330
SAMANTHA BARKS: Thank you.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:18.264
SPEAKER: Andy?

00:34:18.264 --> 00:34:21.006
ANDY KARL: Yeah,
interesting roles.

00:34:21.006 --> 00:34:22.880
I had those dreams once
of being on Broadway,

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.755
and then it happened.

00:34:23.755 --> 00:34:24.345
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:24.345 --> 00:34:26.871
I was like, what's next?

00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:28.779
Um, no.

00:34:28.779 --> 00:34:31.710
It all just comes down
now to, luckily, I've

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:35.530
had some opportunities to be in
Broadway shows in great roles,

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:36.800
this included.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.179
And so when something
comes around,

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:44.440
it's either like, that
sounds really great,

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.270
what are they going
to do with it?

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:47.170
Let me see.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:47.989
Open the pages.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:50.560
And then, if it looks
really like there's

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.199
a journey happening that
could be really fun,

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:54.790
or something that I
could bring to it,

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:58.060
man, that's the
next thing to do.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.430
That, and be a Marvel superhero.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:01.542
That's kind of where I'm--

00:35:01.542 --> 00:35:03.000
PAULA WAGNER: You're
our superhero.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.690
SPEAKER: That dream
never dies for boys, huh?

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:05.350
ANDY KARL: Yeah, it never does.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:06.370
Never does.

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.080
Always returns.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.970
PAULA WAGNER: You know, we're
in an era right now-- two things

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:16.540
interesting is that
live entertainment is

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.460
more popular than ever.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:24.410
The theater, the Broadway
revenues and attendance--

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:27.970
the revenues are up
15% from last year.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:29.410
SPEAKER: That's amazing.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.470
PAULA WAGNER: And what's
fabulous, what's going on now,

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:33.790
is crossover.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:39.070
So actors like Andy and
Samantha and Orfeh and Eric--

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.500
all of our fabulous actors--

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.940
can go from theater
to film to television.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.490
And it's all OK.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:51.700
It used to be much more
segmented where, as an actor,

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.540
you were either a film star
or you were a television star

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.040
or you did Broadway.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.570
And you didn't really
cross over with fluidity.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:02.800
But now, you can.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:08.080
And I think both of these
two amazing talents,

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.110
you will see them
on film, television.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:13.950
They'll do more Broadway.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.030
There's a wonderful
opportunity now,

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:20.560
I think, for actors who have
their talent, who sing, dance,

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.802
act.

00:36:21.802 --> 00:36:23.260
SPEAKER: I think
that's phenomenal.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.960
Were there any
behind-the-scenes sneak

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.700
peeks you can give
us from this one,

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.610
in terms of anything funny
that happened on set,

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.670
or your absolute favorite scene?

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.896
You actually do look nervous
climbing that trellis.

00:36:35.896 --> 00:36:37.270
Is there anything
we should know?

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.080
ANDY KARL: Oh, that's acting.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.246
SPEAKER: Just genius acting.

00:36:39.246 --> 00:36:40.300
OK.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.330
ANDY KARL: (THROATY)
I'm that good.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.150
Live theater is
wonderful because there's

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.950
little imperfections
almost every show.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.270
There's always like,
oh, that's new.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.280
Oh, let's try that.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.290
Or we bring things to scenes.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:54.430
We're like, oh, all right.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:55.304
She's going in today.

00:36:55.304 --> 00:36:56.080
Let's go.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.070
You can adjust, which is part of
the fun of doing live theater.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.760
But there's certainly-- I
think someone belched right

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.980
before we were about
to kiss at the most

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.514
romantic possible point.

00:37:07.514 --> 00:37:08.930
And it was silent
in the audience.

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:10.655
And somebody was
like [FAKE BELCHING]..

00:37:10.655 --> 00:37:13.000
And we both looked
at each other's eyes.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.080
We're like, don't go.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:14.930
Don't you laugh.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:15.655
Don't you laugh.

00:37:15.655 --> 00:37:16.675
Let's just kiss.

00:37:16.675 --> 00:37:19.560
And we're laughing into
each other's faces.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.860
So that happens every
once in a while.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.640
And that's part of the
process of live theater.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.540
It's like, you either
totally avoid it or even give

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:36.610
a little beat, like
when she comes out in--

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.001
surprise-- the red
dress that's everywhere.

00:37:39.001 --> 00:37:40.750
It's gorgeous, and
it's a gorgeous moment.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.480
It's lit very well, and
the audience applauds.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.651
And sometimes, they're
really like, they love it,

00:37:46.651 --> 00:37:49.150
and they're in it, and they let
themselves go and just enjoy

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:50.100
the dress.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.661
And so I just hold, and I'm
just like, yeah, watch, people.

00:37:53.661 --> 00:37:54.160
Please.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.300
Go.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.070
And you make it live.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.140
PAULA WAGNER: Well,
you have a line that--

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.740
don't you say, you look lovely?

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.290
I happened to be
in the audience,

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:05.695
and everything was dead silent.

00:38:05.695 --> 00:38:07.030
And everybody was like, oh.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:10.328
Some guy goes, yeah,
out in the audience.

00:38:10.328 --> 00:38:12.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.006
Remember that?

00:38:15.006 --> 00:38:15.880
SPEAKER: Oh, my gosh.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.750
That's hilarious.

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:19.064
Well, listen, I think-- oh,
we have another question.

00:38:19.064 --> 00:38:21.230
AUDIENCE: Drawing parallels
and lessons a little bit

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:24.590
to business and what we do
here at Google, Samantha,

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:28.450
you mentioned sustained high
energy and coming in day

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.997
in, day out, eight shows a week.

00:38:31.997 --> 00:38:33.580
Has there been a
time when you come in

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.350
and you're like, oh, I don't
want to do this, I'm tired?

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.304
And how do you get over that?

00:38:38.304 --> 00:38:39.470
So maybe little tips about--

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.303
SPEAKER: What parallel
are you referring to?

00:38:41.303 --> 00:38:42.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.190
AUDIENCE: We're doing
some crazy things here.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.832
And then, maybe just a tip on
how you deal with stage fright,

00:38:47.832 --> 00:38:48.540
if you have them.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.930
SAMANTHA BARKS: Yeah.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:56.480
Well, I think, when going into
a theater contract, for me,

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.360
I know that I need to
get into that mindset.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:04.540
And so I'll start eating
healthily and going to the gym

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.100
and making sure
my stamina levels

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.010
are as high as they
can possibly be.

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.870
Because it doesn't stop.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:12.530
It's eight shows a week.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:13.700
It never stops.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.390
And so, for me, I
find I have to make

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:20.800
a lot of lifestyle adjustments
when I'm going into a contract.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:27.940
So in my spare time,
it's so relaxing.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.830
And I don't really go
out particularly drinking

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:34.190
and things like that.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:39.010
I don't do a lot of things to
try and give my body the best

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.270
break that I possibly can.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:43.900
And so sometimes that
means that you might not

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.920
be able to go out for
drinks with your friends

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.960
and a birthday thing.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.470
And hopefully, your
friends understand

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.230
that your schedule is so busy,
and you try to make it up

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.930
in other ways and not
going to silly things--

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:03.460
like not going to a bar that
has loud music because you

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.910
can't use your voice.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.330
So it's things that you would
never really think about

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:10.450
until you go, how can
I give my body the best

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:15.950
break so that tomorrow my voice
is 100% or I have 100% energy?

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:17.620
But it's a process.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.610
You learn.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.700
You go, oh, that
didn't feel very good.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.257
Or some people like
to go to the gym.

00:40:23.257 --> 00:40:24.340
You like to go to the gym.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.350
You work out before a show,
and that gives you energy.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:31.444
It's a trial and error, I think.

00:40:31.444 --> 00:40:32.360
SPEAKER: Well, listen.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.060
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.977
I really wasn't sure
what I was going to think

00:40:35.977 --> 00:40:37.143
when I went to see the show.

00:40:37.143 --> 00:40:39.014
And I kind of knew I'd
have to say something

00:40:39.014 --> 00:40:40.180
nice, no matter what, right?

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.630
Because, obviously.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.655
But I honestly can say--

00:40:43.655 --> 00:40:44.155
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:44.155 --> 00:40:46.840
--no, really-- the
way you articulate it

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.340
is what I felt in the
audience, right-- that joy,

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.457
that love, that hope, that
uniqueness of the moment.

00:40:52.457 --> 00:40:54.040
And so I just really
want to thank you

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.932
for putting it all
together and for what

00:40:55.932 --> 00:40:56.890
you bring to the stage.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.864
And I think it creates
an amazing moment that

00:40:58.864 --> 00:41:01.030
will last for me, and I
know for all the other folks

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:02.592
who see it, too.

00:41:02.592 --> 00:41:03.550
And if you're willing--

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.010
and I sense that you are--

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.680
we would love to have you
close us out with one more

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.700
live performance.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.194
SAMANTHA BARKS: Yes.

00:41:10.194 --> 00:41:11.194
PAULA WAGNER: Thank you.

00:41:11.194 --> 00:41:12.170
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:16.122
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:23.532 --> 00:41:27.484

you all very much.

SAMANTHA BARKS: Yes.
