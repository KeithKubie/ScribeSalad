00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.450
PROFESSOR: One of
the things that's

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.490
different about a
recitation like this

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.210
is that you're really
coaching students as opposed

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.570
to talking at them.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.580
So it takes a little bit
of a different mindset.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.450
In a normal recitation, you
prepare 50 minutes of material.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.250
And you would go in,
and you'd be prepared

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.290
to lecture for 50 minutes.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.120
In a recitation like this, you
have to be much more flexible.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.670
You have to think about, how
far do I let the students go?

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.540
Do I need to go intervene or let
them work it out a little bit?

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.100
Sometimes it's
important for students

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.040
to really struggle
a little bit to see

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.090
what the central issue is, but
letting them struggle too long

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.960
is not productive.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.730
So it's very useful,
at that point,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.090
to step in and try to help.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.420
I like to think of it as
coaching rather than telling.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.200
If you were teaching
students or athletes

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.020
how to play soccer or
baseball, you wouldn't just

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.010
tell them about it.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.750
You would go out and show them.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.880
You would watch how they do it.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.230
You would correct big mistakes.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.634
As that got better, you'd
correct small mistakes.

00:01:22.634 --> 00:01:24.050
And that's really
the way to think

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.383
about a recitation like this,
that you're coaching them,

00:01:26.383 --> 00:01:29.870
you're helping shape the
students' understanding

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.306
so that they can become,
hopefully, as expert

00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:33.430
as you are in the material.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.790
So most of us are
used to knowing

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.580
what's going to happen in the
50 minutes in the classroom.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.890
So you prepare a certain
amount of material.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.594
You expect to go in and
present that material.

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:53.510
You might run a little
short or a little long,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.290
but there aren't
any big surprises.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.020
When you run an active
recitation like this, well,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.040
what I typically do is
I prepare more problems

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550
than I think I'll need,
because I don't know

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.490
how many I will actually use.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.900
And sometimes I
use three or four,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.420
and sometimes we
may only use one.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.380
And so one of the things
you have to be prepared for

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.620
is to adapt on the fly.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.460
You've got to be willing to be
flexible and work a little bit

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.700
without a net, because you're
just not quite sure what's

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.150
going to happen.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.140
And I've seen this in
classroom instruction using

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.980
active techniques as well, where
I've asked a concept question

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.130
and discovered, through
this immediate feedback,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.560
that students have no idea
what I'm talking about.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.800
Well, it would just be
foolish at that point

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.700
to plow ahead and keep
talking about this thing they

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.560
don't know about.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.540
You really have to
adapt and figure out,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.220
what have I done wrong?

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.010
How can I make this
concept clearer,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.419
because I haven't
really done a good job.

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.960
This certainly is
a lead compensator,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.690
but I almost always write it
in-- a really good problem

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.100
in recitation is one
that's not tricky

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.490
but that is likely to expose
a misconception that students

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.510
commonly have.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.220
So if you've taught
a class for a while,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.920
you may discover
that students often

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.570
make the same kind of error
when looking at a problem.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.750
And if that's the case,
then a very good thing to do

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.870
is to present a problem where
they have the opportunity

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.860
to make that mistake.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.606
You don't want them
to make the mistake,

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:39.980
but if they do
make that mistake,

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.700
it's then an opportunity
for teaching, right?

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.360
It's a teaching
moment where you can

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.260
explain why that might
seem like the right answer,

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.206
and why it's, in fact, not,
and correct that misconception.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.150
One of the things I really
like about this approach

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.000
is that it's just fun.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.090
It's much more fun
to spend 50 minutes

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.730
coaching students, talking
with them, chatting with them,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.000
getting to know
them a little bit,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.930
understanding what they don't
understand than it is to just

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.870
talk at them for 50 minutes.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.090
So all other things
being equal, I'd

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.090
much prefer to do the
stand up recitation

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.044
than a conventional recitation.

00:04:29.044 --> 00:04:30.960
Of course, what really
matters is the outcome,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.160
but I do think the
outcomes are better.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.890
So in this case, it's
a win-win situation.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.520
I really enjoy
it, and I actually

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.690
wouldn't do it any
other way in the future.
