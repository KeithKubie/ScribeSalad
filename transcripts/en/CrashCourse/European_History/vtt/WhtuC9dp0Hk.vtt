Hello and welcome to Crash Course History.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.430
I’m John Green; you may know me because
I once hosted a series of Crash Course videos

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.710
on world history, which depending on your
perspective was either far too Eurocentric

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.019
or not nearly Eurocentric enough.

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.500
Well, we’re about to get rather Eurocentric,
because over th...

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.710
Mr. Green Mr. Green!

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.190
Yeah, you’re retired, Me from the Past.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.240
I can’t play seventeen anymore.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.890
Anyway, starting today, we’re going to explore
the history of Europe, beginning with the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.050
closing years of the so-called Middle Ages
and ending with Europe’s recent, and possibly

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.750
temporary, great turn toward political and
economic unity.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.010
But here at the start, I want to note two
things.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.270
First, that Europe is a made-up idea--like,
in parts of eastern Europe, students learn

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.850
there are six continents, not seven, because
Eurasia is treated as a single landmass, on

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.200
account of it being, you know, a single landmass.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.079
But then, Eurasia is both physically and geopolitically
inseparable from Africa, just as North America

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.480
is from South America.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.559
And Australia is more an island than a continent,
and don’t even get me started on Antarctica,

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.659
so in some ways there are two continents.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.719
We don’t even completely agree what constitutes
Europe--the dividing line is often constructed

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.530
as the Ural Mountains, which would mean that
half of Russia is European and the other half

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.590
Asian.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.530
And is western Kazakhstan Europe?

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.390
The Southeastern border of Europe is also
problematic--is Turkey Europe?

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.009
And if not, was the Roman Empire a European
Empire only when its capital was Rome and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.079
not for the many centuries in which its capital
was Constantinople?

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:38.169
But of course, like many made up ideas, Europe
is also real, and in these videos, we’ll

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:43.380
attempt to introduce you to the big political,
economic, and military, and cultural developments

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.200
in recent European history.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.060
The second thing I want to say is that one
cannot look at the history of Europe in isolation,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.679
because as part of the Afroeurasian landmass,
Europe has long been in contact and conversation

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.340
with other parts of the world, and so it’s
impossible to examine its history in isolation,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.060
because it was never isolated.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.500
In early human history, when bands of hunter-gatherers
rarely reached populations of larger than

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.920
a few dozen, people were relatively independent
from those who lived far away from them.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.281
But the story of humans is in some ways a
story of growing connection--like, three thousand

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:26.769
years ago, everything most humans used had
been made within their community--from clothing

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.790
to tools to weapons to jewelry to ideas.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.129
Over time, though, our trade networks and
cultural connections expanded.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.260
More of us began to live in cities, and to
travel between communities.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.490
By around a thousand years ago for instance,
Christianity--which was born in the Middle

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.700
East-- had become the dominant religion in
Europe,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.290
and the Catholic Church was extremely powerful,
but there were also other religions being

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.290
practiced.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.799
Like, most of the Iberian peninsula, for instance,
was controlled by Islamic Caliphate of Cordoba,

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.620
which had arrived from northern Africa.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.959
Gunpowder, which was first developed in China,
began being utilized in Europe around 1300.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.930
And the great disease pandemics that reshaped
early modern Europe also came from Asia.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.069
What I’m saying is that even Europe isn’t
really Eurocentric.

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.469
We’re going to try to emphasize the world’s
interconnectedness in this series, but any

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.849
regional history risks isolating itself.

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.470
So throughout, I hope you’ll remember that
Europe is a made-up idea, and that it is nonetheless

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.140
real, and that the lives of humans in Europe
have long been shaped by the lives of humans

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.140
elsewhere.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.000
Our history will begin around the year 1300,
with central Europe a tangle of kingdoms and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.620
city-states, and the continent in a purportedly
Dark Age.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.290
Big changes are coming--the absolute devastation
of the Black Death, a reimagining of the relationship

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.400
between peasant and lord, and questions about
the role of the Catholic Church in political

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400
life.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.749
But before we get there, I want to flash forwards
and backwards.

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:03.760
In September of 1940, with Europe roiled by
the second world war, an 18-year-old car mechanic

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.579
named Marcel Ravidat was walking his dog Robot
in the countryside of southwestern France

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.469
when the dog disappeared down a hole.

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:16.500
The next day, Marcel went to the spot with
three friends to explore the hole, and after

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.340
digging for a while, they found a cave with
walls covered with paintings--paintings of

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.270
handprints and horses and bison.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:32.120
It would eventually be established that some
of these artworks were at least 17,000 years

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.120
old.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.490
Two of the boys who found the cave were so
profoundly moved by the artwork they saw that

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.419
they camped outside the cave to protect it
for over a year.

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.000
Now, there’s nothing unique to Europe about
very old cave paintings--they’ve been found

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.919
in the Americas, in Indonesia, in Africa,
in Australia.

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.360
They have not been found in Antarctica, another
argument against its continenthood.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.250
And don’t tell me that continents are about
geology not humans.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.990
Who do you think invented continents?

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.990
Rocks?

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.830
I will confess to being a little human-centric
when it comes to history.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.480
Right, but cave paintings aren’t unique
to Europe.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.370
But what I find fascinating about ancient
cave paintings is that they were often made

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.449
over the course of many thousands of years,
as hundreds of generations of humans lived

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:18.940
in the same caves.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.199
Like, the paintings at Lascaux, for instance,
were likely created over a span of around

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.090
two thousand years.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.190
For two thousand years, a community of humans
lived in this cave.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.860
Two thousand years.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.940
Two thousand years ago, Tiberius was the Emperor
of the Roman Empire.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.530
Our history of Europe will span around 700
years, which is a long time, but it also isn’t

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.460
a long time, as it represents less than one
half of one percent of human history.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.310
History, like so much else, changes as our
perspective changes.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.389
And so as we zoom into the history of Europe,
let us not forget that we are zooming in.

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:02.389
Thanks for watching.

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:03.389
I’ll see you next time.

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:04.389
P.S.

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:05.810
Have you ever wondered what’s at the center
of the Earth?

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.289
Well, it turns out, it changes every week
but this week, it’s yet another Earth.

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:11.719
It’s Earths all the way down, you see.
