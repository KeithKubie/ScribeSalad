00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.080
To illustrate the difference between case-based reasoning and learning by

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.836
recording cases, or instance-based learning, let's revisit our micro-world

00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:14.760
of blocks. Once again, you can see all of these blocks in this micro-world. So

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.170
you can see the colors, you can see the shapes, and you could even touch them,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.720
so you have some idea about their approximate sizes. Now let us suppose I give

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.330
you a new block. Note that this new block, the size, is very different from

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.600
the size of any of the other blocks. What color do you think this block will be?
