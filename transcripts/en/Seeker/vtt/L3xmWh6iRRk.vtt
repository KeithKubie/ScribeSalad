00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.110
Turns out, people lie every ten minutes.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.480
But, I don't.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.860
Hello everyone, I'm Trace and you're not watching
DNews.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.150
I swear everything from here going forward
will be true.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.150
No lies.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.320
Lying comes naturally to many types of animals.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.651
If you were designing a species, you might
not make it possible for them to lie, but

00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:23.480
since we weren't designed, we evolved… it's
all about competitive advantage.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.640
For example, if I'm a female nursery web spider,
I want the best mate, and so do the males.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.230
But in nursery web spider society, the males
have to bring a gift to mate.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.300
A study in BMC Evolutionary Biology found
that the males wrap the gift -- usually a

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.310
dead insect -- in silk so the female doesn't
know what's inside, then while the female

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.820
checks out the gift, the male gets it on with
her!

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.600
Bow chicka -- WOAH WOAH.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.610
This gift is FAKE.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.610
That's right.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.270
Some male spiders will bring fake gifts!

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.500
And it works!

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.750
Of the spiders studies 92-percent of the "fake
gift" group still got to mate (though admittedly

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.850
not for as long, since as soon as the female
spider knew what was up she scuttled away).

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.680
A 2013 study in Proceedings of the Royal Society
B, says we humans lie for competitive advantage,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.680
too.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.370
If I successfully deceive you, and thus you
think we're working together, I have a competitive

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.370
advantage.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.150
Think about it this way, if you lie about
cheating on your partner, you're still getting

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.480
cooperation from him or her.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.480
Competitive Advantage.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.900
If you get a gift from grandma and hate it,
but pretend to like it you protect your relationship

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.330
and may get a better gift later.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.330
Competitive Advantage!

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.150
This ain't just humans either, in primate
populations with high levels of cooperation,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.670
the researchers also found high levels of
tactical deception.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.299
Basically, we could have evolved to lie simply
to trick other people into cooperating.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.280
And, this happens All.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.280
The.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.280
Time.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.840
According to a 2002 study in Basic and Applied
Social Psychology people may lie as often

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.729
as two or three times in a ten minute conversation.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.960
Considering Americans spend an hour and 45
minutes per day every day just talking, that

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.170
means we could be telling 30-some lies per
day!

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.020
Now these aren't all HUGE lies -- some are
just little ones, I'm sure.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.170
Though the researchers were moot on that.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.239
But one thing still holds this together: lies
can still give us an advantage.

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.120
But even though lying is encouraged by evolution,
there are consequences.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.029
According to a study in BJ Psychiatry people
who have more "deceitful personalities" tend

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.489
to have more white matter and less grey matter
in their prefrontal cortex7, the part of the

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.019
brain associated with personality, and moderation
of social behavior.

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.939
White matter connects parts of the brain together,
so more white matter means more brain connections…

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.040
But does that mean they’re better at deception?

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.489
Or that they have some advantage?

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.989
A disadvantage in other areas?

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.340
More research is needed.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.310
But lying as part of evolution is definitely
a thing.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.510
By age four, 90 percent of children have learned
to lie.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.190
Which might give you the sads, but it's actually
a milestone of healthy development!

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.249
In Child Psychology, there's something called
the "theory of mind," which is the idea that

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.340
you are independent from others, you each
have your own beliefs, desires, understanding,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.340
et cetera.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.439
A study in Psychological Science trained three-year-olds
on this Theory of Mind concept, and found

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.719
they were then more likely to lie than kids
who hadn't been trained!

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:15.140
Walking that social tightrope of lying just
enough, but not too much is tough.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.829
Lying all the time can work, but never lying
ever not at all not even once is also a great

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:21.829
idea.

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.669
And if you believe that, I am Iron Man.

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.650
Are you worried that we're lying to you?

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.709
That EVERYONE is lying to you?!

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.709
Maybe you should be!

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:51.420
Tara has some tips for you 
on how to spot a liar… here.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.779
I lied to a cop once…

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.589
I ran over a sign on the school property when
I slid off the road.

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:56.799
I told him I didn't do it.

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.120
I got in big trouble with my parents and was
grounded from the car for two weeks….

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.979
But i was testing my evolutionary competitive
advantage, right?

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:08.629
What was the biggest lie you ever told?
