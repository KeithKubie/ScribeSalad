00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.020
 We already had a video with an overview of DNA, 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.910
 I recommend you look at him first. 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.220
 And in this clip 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 we will deepen a little more 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.650
 in the molecular structure of DNA. 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.690
 This is the starting point. 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.250
 Let's first remember what DNA means. 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.890
 I will write the different parts of the word 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.320
 in different colors. 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.030
 DNA means deoxy, 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.459
 deoxyribonucleic acid, 

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:27.859
 ribonucleic, 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.109
 ribonucleic acid. 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.189
 Ribonucleic acid. 

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:36.619
 We will leave this aside 

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.219
 and we will look at the molecular structure of DNA 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.219
 and how it is related to the name, 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.079
 deoxyribonucleic acid. 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.119
 The DNA consists of bound nucleic acids, 

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:48.659
 and the term nucleus comes from the fact, 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.859
 that these acids are found in the nucleus. 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.789
 They are in the nucleus of eukaryotes. 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.189
 Here comes "nucleic". 

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:57.489
 In a second we'll explain 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.389
 why is acid called. 

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:04.519
 Each DNA molecule consists of a chain 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.109
 of nucleotides. 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.419
 From the so-called nucleotides. 

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:13.459
 It is composed of a nucleus - 

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.019
 nucleotides. 

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:17.089
 What does a nucleotide look like? 

00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:18.389
 That's it 

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:21.519
 two DNA strands that are increased. 

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:24.429
 I've increased the two DNA strands. 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.889
 You can see the right one here, 

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:29.789
 as well 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.519
 the backbone of one half of the double chain. 

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:34.259
 This is the other half of the double chain, 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.189
 and here we have bridges, 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.659
 I will talk about what molecules they are. 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.219
 They are like the steps of the ladder. 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.419
 I will now separate one nucleotide. 

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:48.119
 Nucleotide is ... 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.419
 that part, which 

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:53.909
 I outline here, 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.589
 she is 

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:57.819
 nucleotide. 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.189
 This is a nucleotide, 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.189
 which is connected to another. 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.632
 It is linked to another nucleotide. 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:09.709
 Another nucleotide here. 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.419
 On the right side we have a nucleotide, 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.459
 we have a nucleotide here. 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.919
 Actually, I'll do it 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.659
 slightly different. 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:27.459
 We have a nucleotide here on the right 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.019
 and we have another one at the bottom right. 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.719
 We have another nucleotide. 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.659
 We have another nucleotide. 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.559
 Here are four nucleotides. 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.489
 These two are on the left side of the ladder, 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.759
 and these two are on the right side of the ladder. 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:42.919
 Now let's think about 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.559
 different parts of the nucleotide. 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.289
 One thing that can make an impression on you 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.189
 are these phosphate groups. 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.789
 This is a phosphate group here. 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.919
 This is a phosphate group. 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:57.789
 Each of these nucleotides has a phosphate group. 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:59.659
 This is a phosphate group here 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.619
 and this is a phosphate group. 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.919
 Phosphate groups are what makes DNA - 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.689
 or what makes nucleic acids, acids. 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:09.549
 You can say, "Wait, wait." 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.779
 "Sal, you have your drawing" 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.159
 "negative charge." 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.019
 "Something with a negative charge will attract protons," 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.519
 "will accept protons." 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.759
 "How can it be acid?" 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.319
 "It looks like a foundation." 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.519
 The reason why DNA is depicted 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.959
 with these negative charges, 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.139
 that it is so acidic that if put in 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.689
 in a neutral solution, 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.889
 will lose its hydrogen atoms. 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.619
 In fact, if we want to be fully correct, 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.119
 DNA molecules will have, 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.849
 protonated phosphate groups such as this. 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.679
 But they so much want to release these hydrogen protons, 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:45.579
 that usually - 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.379
 Will get rid of the negative charge here. 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.189
 Woops. 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.189
 Only this phosphate group here. 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.519
 If we get rid of the negative charge, 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.259
 and if it was connected 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.859
 with hydrogen. 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.359
 That's what you want to take these electrons so much. 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.209
 This oxygen atom can take these electrons 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.719
 and then this hydrogen will be attached 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.709
 to a water molecule for example. 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.719
 Thus the proton will be released. 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.869
 That's why we call DNA acid. 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:14.159
 If it was not in solution, there would be attached hydrogen atoms, 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.199
 but it would be very acidic and as soon as it was put in 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.589
 neutral solution will lose those hydrogen atoms. 

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.719
 Phosphate groups make DNA 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.049
 acid, 

00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:24.319
 but sometimes it can be confusing, 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.889
 when you see it, depicted 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.419
 with these negative charges. 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.719
 They are there because the DNA has already lost its hydrogen protons. 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:34.819
 In addition, here we depict a related basis, 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.019
 but from the phosphate group comes the acid name. 

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:38.319
 In the beginning it was protonated, 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:41.979
 but easily loses its hydrogen atoms. 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.419
 From here 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.259
 the acid name comes. 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.249
 Each of these nucleotides has a phosphate group. 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.689
 The next thing you might notice - 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.319
 The next thing you can see is 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:56.859
 The next thing you can see is 

00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:58.419
 this group here. 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.089
 She is cyclic, has a ring 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:02.889
 and terribly much like sugar, 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.459
 this is because it is sugar. 

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:09.119
 This sugar has a five-carbon ring. 

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:12.779
 What I've pictured here, this sugar, is ribose. 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.459
 This sugar is ribose. 

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:19.489
 Ribose in its linear form. 

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:22.159
 It, like many sugars, can also take a cyclical form. 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.079
 In fact, it can take many different cyclic forms, 

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:26.159
 but this is most often described. 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.579
 I will number the carbon atoms, 

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:30.089
 because that's important, 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:31.379
 when we talk about DNA. 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.679
 If we start with the carbonyl group here, 

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:36.659
 we call this carbon atom number one or one primacy. 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.489
 One prim, two prim, three priam, 

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:43.589
 four prim and five prim. 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.219
 This is a carbon atom of five primes. 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.279
 We can form the cyclic form of ribose 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:52.009
 with the oxygen atom - 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.319
 this one here is connected 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.019
 with a carbon atom four. 

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:58.219
 He uses one of his free electronic pairs, 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.189
 uses one of his free electronic pairs, 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:02.319
 to form a bond. 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:07.319
 To make a connection with 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:08.519
 carbon atom a prim. 

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:09.219
 I drew it so, 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:10.619
 because the molecule bends. 

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:12.519
 The whole molecule will bend this way, 

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:13.859
 to form a cyclic structure. 

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:15.359
 When this relationship is formed, 

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:17.989
 the carbon can release one of these double bonds, 

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:20.319
 which then can be 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.459
 used from oxygen. 

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:24.859
 The oxygen atom can use these electrons, 

00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:28.279
 to attract hydrogen proton, 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.049
 to capture a hydrogen proton. 

00:06:31.049 --> 00:06:32.919
 When this happens, we get this form. 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.589
 In this form, for the sake of clarity, 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:38.019
 this is a carbon atom a primacy. 

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:42.519
 One prim, two prim, three priam, 

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:47.869
 four prim and five prim. 

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:49.319
 Where we see this relationship, 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.489
 at a carbon atom a preference, 

00:06:50.489 --> 00:06:51.959
 which was part of a carbonyl group. 

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:55.019
 Now he has freed himself from one of these double bonds. 

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:56.419
 This oxygen can form a bond 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:57.889
 with a hydrogen proton. 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.189
 He releases one double link here, 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:04.889
 so it can form a hydrogen bonding proton. 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.989
 This hydrogen proton is 

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:08.889
 this hydrogen proton here. 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.189
 This green link, 

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:14.149
 between four carbon and 

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:15.989
 and the oxygen bound 

00:07:15.989 --> 00:07:19.579
 with carbon atoms four and one, 

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:20.759
 this is here. 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:22.389
 Here's the link here. 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:25.289
 This oxygen is that oxygen. 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:27.859
 Note that this oxygen is associated with four carbons, 

00:07:27.859 --> 00:07:30.419
 and now with a carbon atom a primacy. 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:32.759
 It is also linked to hydrogen. 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:34.109
 It is linked to hydrogen, 

00:07:34.109 --> 00:07:35.289
 with this hydrogen atom. 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:37.159
 But it can be attracted by 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:39.159
 molecule of water, to convert a hydroxone cation 

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:40.959
 and be lost. 

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:44.789
 Takes a hydrogen proton from here 

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:46.919
 and can thus lose a hydrogen proton. 

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:50.119
 Overall, this is not a profit or a loss. 

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:52.349
 We form a cyclical form 

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:53.689
 and the cyclic form here 

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:56.419
 is very close to what we see in the DNA molecule. 

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:59.389
 In fact, what we see in the RNA molecule, 

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:01.119
 in ribonucleic acid. 

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:02.249
 What do you think it is about, 

00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:05.659
 when we talk about deoxyribonucleic acid. 

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:07.919
 We can start with ribose here, 

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:10.259
 but if we get rid of one of the oxygen groups 

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:11.589
 and in particular from - 

00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:13.509
 In fact, if we just get rid of one of the oxygen atoms, 

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:16.749
 and substitutes the hydroxyl group only with hydrogen, 

00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:18.819
 we will get deoxyribose 

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:20.226
 right here. 

00:08:20.226 --> 00:08:22.189
 This is a five-membered ring, 

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:23.919
 with four carbon atoms, 

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:25.719
 it looks like that. 

00:08:25.719 --> 00:08:28.489
 Carbon-related hydrogen atoms are understood to mean, 

00:08:28.489 --> 00:08:29.589
 we have seen this many times. 

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:33.458
 Carbon atoms are at the intersections of these lines 

00:08:33.458 --> 00:08:35.318
 or on the corners, or perhaps 

00:08:35.318 --> 00:08:39.649
 at the end of the lines. 

00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:41.619
 We can see - 

00:08:41.619 --> 00:08:44.889
 If we compare these two molecules, 

00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:47.389
 if we compare these two molecules here, 

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:50.319
 we see that this atom has -OH, 

00:08:53.119 --> 00:08:54.749
 This atom has -OH and -H. 

00:08:54.749 --> 00:08:58.189
 By default, this carbon atom is linked to two hydrogen atoms. 

00:08:58.189 --> 00:08:59.819
 It has no connection with oxygen. 

00:08:59.819 --> 00:09:02.249
 This is deoxyribose. 

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:04.359
 Deoxyribose. 

00:09:04.359 --> 00:09:06.889
 Deoxyribose has no oxygen, 

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:08.859
 it does not have oxygen 

00:09:08.859 --> 00:09:10.679
 at carbon atom two moiety. 

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:14.119
 So if we remove this oxygen atom, we get deoxyribose. 

00:09:14.119 --> 00:09:16.049
 Let me surround it. 

00:09:17.589 --> 00:09:19.389
 This here 

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:22.600
 is deoxyribose. 

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:26.289
 Deoxy - deoxyribose, 

00:09:26.289 --> 00:09:28.819
 before we connect it to these other monomers. 

00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:32.289
 This is deoxyribose. 

00:09:32.289 --> 00:09:35.519
 Here comes a deoxyrib 

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.189
 and then the last part, 

00:09:37.189 --> 00:09:42.459
 the last part of this piece - is here. 

00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:45.589
 This is called the nitrogen base. 

00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:47.559
 Nitrogen. 

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:49.789
 Nitrogen. 

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:51.889
 Nitrogen bases. 

00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:53.859
 We have different types of nitrogen bases. 

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.419
 This is a nitrogen base. 

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:59.359
 This is another nitrogen base here. 

00:09:59.359 --> 00:10:02.089
 This is another different nitrogen base here. 

00:10:02.089 --> 00:10:04.549
 Note that this one has only one ring, this one has a ring, 

00:10:04.549 --> 00:10:05.859
 but this one has two. 

00:10:05.859 --> 00:10:09.489
 This one here has two rings. 

00:10:09.489 --> 00:10:10.619
 Accordingly, we have different names 

00:10:10.619 --> 00:10:11.859
 for these nitrogen bases. 

00:10:11.859 --> 00:10:14.789
 Those with two rings in total 

00:10:14.789 --> 00:10:17.189
 are called purine bases (purines). 

00:10:17.189 --> 00:10:20.319
 Two-ring nitrogenous bases, 

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:23.540
 are called purines. 

00:10:24.359 --> 00:10:26.189
 This is a common classification term. 

00:10:26.189 --> 00:10:28.059
 I'll write it - purrins. 

00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:29.519
 If we have one ring. 

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:30.389
 I'll write it like that. 

00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:31.889
 One ring. 

00:10:31.889 --> 00:10:34.189
 Bases with a ring are called pyrimidines (pyrimidines). 

00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:35.840
 Pyrimidine. 

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:38.119
 Pyrimidines. 

00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:39.589
 We call them pyrimidine bases. 

00:10:39.589 --> 00:10:41.459
 Especially these two, on the right, 

00:10:41.459 --> 00:10:42.759
 these two purine bases, 

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:44.689
 this is adenine, 

00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:46.089
 we talked about how they connect 

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:47.919
 in the general DNA clip. 

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:50.559
 Here is adenine, 

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:52.019
 this nitrogen base. 

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:54.989
 This is guanine here. 

00:10:54.989 --> 00:10:57.289
 This is guanine. 

00:10:57.289 --> 00:11:01.789
 And then here, 

00:11:01.789 --> 00:11:05.619
 this nitrogen base has a single ring, 

00:11:05.619 --> 00:11:08.919
 which makes it pyrimidine, and is thymine. 

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:12.119
 This is a thymin here. 

00:11:12.119 --> 00:11:14.659
 This is thymine. Last but not least, 

00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:15.619
 if we are not talking about DNA, 

00:11:15.619 --> 00:11:18.119
 and for RNA, we have uracil. 

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:19.319
 But when we talk about DNA, 

00:11:19.319 --> 00:11:21.689
 this is cytosine here. 

00:11:21.689 --> 00:11:24.059
 Cytosine. 

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:25.519
 You can see his structure. 

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:28.259
 Timmin is attracted to adenine. 

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:29.789
 It is associated with adenine, 

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:32.689
 and cytosine binds to guanine. 

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:34.119
 How do they connect? 

00:11:34.119 --> 00:11:37.319
 The way these nitrogen bases 

00:11:37.319 --> 00:11:38.709
 form the stairs of the ladder 

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.589
 is through our good old friends, hydrogen bonds. 

00:11:44.589 --> 00:11:45.959
 All this happens because 

00:11:45.959 --> 00:11:48.079
 nitrogen is very electronegative. 

00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:50.689
 When nitrogen is bonded to hydrogen, 

00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:52.159
 is obtained in part 

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:54.819
 negative charge on nitrogen. 

00:11:54.819 --> 00:11:56.919
 I will mark it in green. 

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:57.919
 There will be partial 

00:11:57.919 --> 00:11:59.459
 negative charge on nitrogen 

00:11:59.459 --> 00:12:02.559
 and a partial positive charge for hydrogen. 

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:04.189
 Oxygen, as we have always said 

00:12:04.189 --> 00:12:05.259
 is electronegative, 

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:07.689
 therefore there is a partial negative charge. 

00:12:07.689 --> 00:12:09.619
 The partial negative charge of this oxygen atom 

00:12:09.619 --> 00:12:11.289
 will be attracted to the partial 

00:12:11.289 --> 00:12:13.619
 positive charge of this hydrogen atom 

00:12:13.619 --> 00:12:17.589
 and thus a hydrogen bond will be obtained. 

00:12:17.589 --> 00:12:19.519
 The same will happen with this hydrogen, 

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:23.419
 the electrons are attracted to this nitrogen atom, 

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:26.499
 this nitrogen, which 

00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:28.389
 attracts the electrons 

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:31.789
 and forms a hydrogen bond. 

00:12:31.789 --> 00:12:34.089
 And here we have hydrogen 

00:12:34.089 --> 00:12:35.819
 with a partial positive charge, 

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:37.979
 because his electrons are attracted to the nitrogen atom. 

00:12:37.979 --> 00:12:39.419
 Here we have oxygen 

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:40.919
 with a partial negative charge. 

00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:42.409
 They will be attracted to each other. 

00:12:42.409 --> 00:12:43.859
 It's a hydrogen bond. 

00:12:43.859 --> 00:12:46.219
 The same happens between this nitrogen atom and this hydrogen atom, 

00:12:46.219 --> 00:12:48.849
 also - between this oxygen atom and this hydrogen. 

00:12:48.849 --> 00:12:51.719
 Here's how cytosine and guanine bind 

00:12:51.719 --> 00:12:54.159
 and tymine and adenine are linked. 

00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:55.789
 We talk about it 

00:12:55.789 --> 00:12:59.069
 in the general video about DNA.
