00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.080
 I made a square hole in this sheet of paper, 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.200
 And a coaster, a round coaster. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.600
 I fold the paper in a mysterious way, 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.440
 And I can get the coaster through the hole. 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.960
 It really goes both ways 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.480
 And I didn't start cheating. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.700
 It really goes through the hole. 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.380
 And yet, when I turn it off, 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.500
 the diameter of the coaster is larger than the diagonal of the square hole. 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.080
 What is going on? I have not stretched it and I have not torn it. 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.380
 And yet when I fold the sheet back, 

00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:45.105
 in a sensible way, 

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.575
 does the coaster go through, 

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:50.795
 The coaster that is larger than the hole. 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.160
 How is this possible? 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.300
 I am willing to give away the secret for free during this special occasion 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.440
 It has to do with the interaction between, 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.280
 the intrinsic, or inner dimension, of the sheet of paper that is 2 dimensions. 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.040
 And the fact that the skin evolves and flourishes in the surrounding three-dimensional space. 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.780
 There is an elbow room, there is some ambient space. 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.160
 So dimension 2 and dimension 3. 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.260
 In the following sense. 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.100
 First, I can fold the paper in a naive way as follows, 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.960
 in which case the largest opening I can try to let the disk through is this space. 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.460
 That was previously, as you can see, 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.620
 the diagonal of the square hole 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.620
 And that was too small to let the disk through. 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.420
 But that's not the only thing we do. 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.680
 Now I take this sheet of paper and start turning it 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.660
 until those two sides are aligned in a straight line 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.620
 And while I do this, while turning the ends 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.040
 you can see that the part of the paper is starting to rise above the floor. 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.240
 That is escape to the 3rd dimension, 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.740
 take advantage of the fact that there is extra space there. 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.035
 And when those two sides fully align 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.980
 Then I can crush and fold. 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.795
 And by the way, if I do, I have to exchange one 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.120
 to create this space. 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.980
 The space that we created then is this space, 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.680
 which is larger than the previous space, 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.160
 because this hole was not the diagonal, but the sum of those two sides. 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.760
 And if you still remember Pythagoras, 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.400
 you have received an extra square root factor of 2, which is slightly more than 40%. 

00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:32.255
 So the secret to success when you make this toy 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.080
 is to make the hole, 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.720
 so that the diagonal is slightly shorter than the diameter of the disc for the surprise, 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.920
 but the sum of the two sides is slightly longer than this diameter. 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.540
 And that is possible, because there is 40% extra space. 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 And this is all possible, because if we perform this maneuver 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.460
 allow the whole thing to come out in 3D and then come back down. 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.840
 This fact that you can escape to the surrounding 3rd dimension and come back, 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.920
 this extra step that you take towards the extra degree of freedom 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.835
 gives you this beautiful magic.
