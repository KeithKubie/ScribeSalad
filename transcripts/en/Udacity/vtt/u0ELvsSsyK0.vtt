00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.440
Recall that a Turing machine always
starts in the initial state and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.540
with its head over the first
position on the tape.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.260
As it computes, its internal state,
the tape contents, and

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.080
the head position will change.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.180
But everything else will stay the same.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.885
We call this triple of state
tape content and head position,

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:22.370
a configuration.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.870
And any given computation can be thought
of as a sequence of configurations.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.460
It starts with the initial state,
the input string, and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.920
with the head on the first location,
and it proceeds from there.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.250
Now it isn't very practical to
always draw a picture like this

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.920
every time that we want to refer to
a computation of a Turing machine, so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.020
we've developed some notation
that captures the idea.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.310
Actually, we'll rewind
the computation we just did, and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.020
do it again, this time writing down
the configuration using this notation.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.248
We write the start
configuration as q01011.

00:00:59.248 --> 00:01:03.834
The part to the left of this state
represents the tape contents to the left

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:05.370
of the head.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.770
It's just the empty string,
in this case.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.875
Then we have the state of the machine.

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:12.430
And then the rest of the tape contents.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.820
After the first step,
a 1 is to the left of the head.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.985
We're still in state q0, and

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:25.008
this is the rest of the string,
011, 011.

00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:29.450
In the next configuration, 1,
0 is to the left of the head.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.410
We're still in state q0 and 1,
1 is the rest of the tape content.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.400
And so on and so forth.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.340
This notation is a little awkward,
but it's convenient for type settings.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.000
It's also very much in
the spirit of Turing machines,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.230
where all structured data must
ultimately be represented as strings.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.540
If a Turing machine can handle working
with data like this, then so can we.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.480
At a slightly higher level, a whole
sequence of configurations like this

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.932
captures everything that a Turing
machine did on a particular input.

00:02:00.932 --> 00:02:05.663
And so we will sometimes call
such a sequence a computation.

00:02:05.663 --> 00:02:08.996
And actually this representation
of a computation will be central

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:12.460
as we discuss the Cool-Levin theorem
in the section on complexity.
