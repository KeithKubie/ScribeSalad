00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.026
Now we just said that points B and D, are special because they represent a

00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:08.640
switch in the direction of the slope of the function. Now speaking of general

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.680
behavior of the function, I'd like you to tell me, what its domain is and what

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.289
its range is. Now please note that even though I've written y equals this time

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.551
instead of F of x equals. This is to remind you that the reason an equation is a

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:27.070
function is not because of what we choose to call the dependent variable. It's

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.680
because of the way that this expression over here involving x's maps the inputs

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.118
to the output. This is in fact a function, and we can write that in a more

00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:41.951
technical way by saying y equals f of x. In other words the real function of x

00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:46.767
is this expression over here. The one that's taking all the inputs of x and

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:50.953
modifying them to create the output which is y. Just on the side to make sure

00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:54.115
you understand the notation here, what purpose it serves and how all these

00:00:54.115 --> 00:00:58.456
different things are connected. So back to the function itself, please write the

00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:02.363
domain and the range using interval notation in these two boxes.
