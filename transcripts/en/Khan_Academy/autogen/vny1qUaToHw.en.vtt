00:00:00.078 --> 00:00:02.111
 Now we will look 

00:00:02.111 --> 00:00:04.094
 the first law on thermodynamics. 

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:06.291
 But before we start with it, 

00:00:06.291 --> 00:00:08.312
 you might be wondering, 

00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:09.961
 "What is thermodynamics?". 

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:12.331
 You can think of the roots of the word. 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.680
 We have "thermo" associated with thermal, connected with temperature. 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.400
 And the dynamics - the properties of temperature, 

00:00:18.403 --> 00:00:20.838
 how atoms are moving, what is the temperature behavior. 

00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:22.781
 This is thermodynamics, 

00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:25.138
 she studies the heat and temperature 

00:00:25.138 --> 00:00:27.695
 and how they relate to energy and work. 

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:29.284
 How different types of energy 

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:31.226
 they move from one form to another. 

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:32.725
 That's what it's all about 

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:35.061
 the first law of thermodynamics we mentioned 

00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:37.770
 in the introductory video on energy. 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.920
 The first law of thermodynamics tells us that energy ... 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.592
 this is important, I will write it: 

00:00:44.592 --> 00:00:47.140
 the energy can not be created or destroyed. 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.861
 Can not be created 

00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:53.090
 or destroy. 

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:59.786
 It can only be transformed from one form into another. 

00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:04.140
 Only, 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.976
 only to become, 

00:01:06.976 --> 00:01:09.956
 just to become ... 

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:11.735
 today I find it hard to write. 

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:15.110
 Energy can only turn 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.900
 from one species to another. 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.220
 Can be transmitted or converted from one species to another, 

00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:25.669
 but it can not be created or destroyed. 

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.600
 The rest of the video 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.211
 I want to give some examples to understand this law 

00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:32.420
 and think about it 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.980
 what is the energy that we observe in a system. 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.551
 Then we will think of where this energy comes from, 

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:39.578
 to understand that he is not coming from anywhere 

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:41.749
 and that it does not disappear, 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:43.988
 that it is not destroyed. 

00:01:43.988 --> 00:01:47.263
 I'll start with an example of an electric bulb. 

00:01:47.263 --> 00:01:49.144
 You can leave the video paused, 

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:52.061
 to think about the types of energy we see here. 

00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:56.040
 And then - about where this energy comes from and where it goes. 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.380
 The most obvious form of energy here, 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.580
 the purpose of the bulb is the radiant energy. 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.519
 You see electromagnetic waves and light, 

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:08.200
 which radiates. 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.040
 This is radiant energy. 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.104
 Radiant energy. 

00:02:14.104 --> 00:02:18.300
 Radiant energy is produced 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.197
 from the heated wire here. 

00:02:22.197 --> 00:02:25.272
 When the electrons pass through it, they create heat, 

00:02:25.272 --> 00:02:27.274
 we have heat. 

00:02:27.274 --> 00:02:30.050
 We also have heat. 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.935
 Heat energy. 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.220
 But where does the radiant and thermal energy come from? 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.496
 To repeat, the first law of thermodynamics tells us, 

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:40.363
 that energy is not created by nothing, 

00:02:40.363 --> 00:02:43.731
 but is transformed from one species to another or transmitted from somewhere. 

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:46.856
 I told you this heat 

00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:50.008
 comes from the movement of electrons through the wire. 

00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:52.346
 They move through the wire that it has 

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:54.980
 resistance, it generates heat. 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.323
 The electrons are moving through the wire like through 

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:01.473
 resistor and create heat. 

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:04.258
 So we have the kinetic energy of the electrons. 

00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:07.032
 I will write KE (EC) to reduce kinetic energy. 

00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:09.445
 The kinetic energy of electrons. 

00:03:09.445 --> 00:03:11.894
 Where does it come from? 

00:03:11.894 --> 00:03:14.382
 It comes from the potential energy. 

00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:16.737
 It may be included in a contact. 

00:03:19.731 --> 00:03:21.646
 I will draw an electrical outlet 

00:03:21.646 --> 00:03:23.050
 right here. 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.552
 If this one 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.580
 an electrical outlet was in your home, 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.240
 there would be an electrical potential between these two ends. 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.100
 When making a connection, 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.599
 the electrons can move. 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.863
 We will go into details about the direct current 

00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:46.195
 in the next videos. There is an electrical potential 

00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:48.427
 between this and that point. Assuming this is the direction, 

00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:50.236
 in which the electrons move. 

00:03:50.236 --> 00:03:53.169
 So here the potential energy has turned 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.992
 in the kinetic energy of electrons, 

00:03:55.992 --> 00:03:57.752
 which takes the form of electric current, 

00:03:57.752 --> 00:04:00.349
 which turns into heat 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.010
 and radiant energy. 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.811
 What happens next? Let's say we exclude the bulb from the socket, 

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.407
 the light goes out. What happens to all the energy? 

00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:09.091
 Is he still there? 

00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:11.252
 Yes, the thermal energy will continue 

00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:13.633
 to distract the system. 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.560
 Here is an open system, 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.700
 The gas in the bulb - not fully visible, 

00:04:19.701 --> 00:04:22.335
 but it looks like this. 

00:04:22.335 --> 00:04:25.052
 The air will also warm up 

00:04:25.052 --> 00:04:26.993
 will warm the bulb's glass, 

00:04:26.993 --> 00:04:28.971
 and it will warm the outside air. 

00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:30.976
 So the heat is turning 

00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:33.622
 in the radiant energy that moves out. 

00:04:33.622 --> 00:04:35.805
 It can become other forms 

00:04:35.805 --> 00:04:38.148
 of energy, most often thermal, 

00:04:38.148 --> 00:04:40.861
 so it will warm up other things. 

00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:42.835
 What about this billiard table? 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.800
 When I hit a ball, this one, for example. 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.860
 Where will the energy go? 

00:04:49.868 --> 00:04:52.058
 Part of the energy will hit the next 

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:55.156
 a ball that will hit the next. 

00:04:55.156 --> 00:04:58.176
 But as we all know, if we played billiards, 

00:04:58.176 --> 00:05:00.108
 at some point they will stop. 

00:05:00.108 --> 00:05:01.925
 What has happened to their energy? 

00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:03.805
 As they rolled, 

00:05:03.805 --> 00:05:06.552
 there was air resistance. 

00:05:06.552 --> 00:05:11.096
 Balls have struck in air molecules, 

00:05:11.096 --> 00:05:13.121
 there was friction. 

00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:16.215
 This energy will turn into heat. 

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:21.565
 A trend that you will see often in systems is, 

00:05:21.565 --> 00:05:25.756
 that much more energy is converted into heat, 

00:05:25.756 --> 00:05:28.441
 instead of useful work. 

00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:30.888
 When the billiard balls move, 

00:05:30.888 --> 00:05:36.050
 friction with the air will turn some of their kinetic energy 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.102
 in thermal energy. 

00:05:38.102 --> 00:05:42.168
 There will also be friction with the soft surface of the table. 

00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:45.236
 In doing so, we will have molecules that rub off each other, 

00:05:45.236 --> 00:05:48.332
 friction will turn into heat. 

00:05:48.332 --> 00:05:55.770
 Since kinetic energy is reduced by friction, 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.960
 we have the conversion of kinetic energy into heat. 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.794
 Finally, we will not have more kinetic energy. 

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.269
 What about this weightlift here? 

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:05.032
 He uses chemical energy 

00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:08.052
 in ATP molecules in your muscles that turns into 

00:06:08.052 --> 00:06:10.619
 kinetic energy that drives his muscles. 

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.581
 This energy moves the burden. But when he reaches this position, 

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.541
 what happens to the energy? 

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.700
 A lot of it is now becoming 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.724
 in potential energy. This enormous burden 

00:06:20.724 --> 00:06:25.954
 is over his head and if he let go, 

00:06:25.954 --> 00:06:27.596
 which I do not advise him to do, 

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:29.568
 this thing will fall very quickly. 

00:06:29.568 --> 00:06:33.274
 Now much of the energy is stored as a potential energy. 

00:06:33.274 --> 00:06:34.722
 But we also created warmth. 

00:06:34.722 --> 00:06:36.304
 His muscles have generated heat. 

00:06:36.304 --> 00:06:38.467
 Even if it's just in the air 

00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:40.729
 creates heat in the air and friction with it. 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:42.804
 I want you to remember that energy 

00:06:42.804 --> 00:06:46.037
 does not come from nothing, it is becoming 

00:06:46.037 --> 00:06:48.476
 from one form to another or carried 

00:06:48.476 --> 00:06:50.845
 from one part of the system to another. 

00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:53.314
 We can now look at these examples. 

00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:55.615
 The same happens with our runner here. 

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:58.371
 Its chemical energy 

00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:01.258
 allows his muscles to move, turns 

00:07:01.258 --> 00:07:05.076
 in kinetic energy for his whole body, his whole body moves. 

00:07:05.076 --> 00:07:08.392
 But at some point he stops. Where does the energy go? 

00:07:08.392 --> 00:07:11.327
 Part of it will become warmth in his body, 

00:07:11.327 --> 00:07:13.947
 which will dissipate in the whole system, in the air. 

00:07:13.947 --> 00:07:19.500
 Besides, when it runs, it has contact with the ground. 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.160
 This makes the molecules in the ground glare lightly. 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.640
 Part of these vibrations will become a sound. 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.980
 Part of the energy of the air particles, 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.140
 who are on the move will turn into heat. 

00:07:29.142 --> 00:07:31.282
 We will see this situation over and over again. 

00:07:31.282 --> 00:07:34.203
 The diver above here has mostly potential energy. 

00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:36.498
 Then it becomes kinetic energy, 

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:38.190
 when it almost reaches the water. 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.028
 But what happens when it falls into the water? 

00:07:40.028 --> 00:07:41.629
 Energy will surrender 

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:44.462
 of the receding water waves. 

00:07:44.462 --> 00:07:47.136
 Also friction will increase. 

00:07:47.136 --> 00:07:50.780
 We had friction and as it fell, which would produce heat. 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.835
 Heat will also be generated when friction with water. 

00:07:53.835 --> 00:07:55.922
 We usually do not think about friction with water, but there is one. 

00:07:55.922 --> 00:08:00.193
 There are also waves that have greater kinetic energy 

00:08:00.193 --> 00:08:02.811
 from the water itself, this energy is transmitted out 

00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:05.172
 from the point of falling. 

00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:07.061
 I can continue with the examples. 

00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:10.320
 We have chemical potential energy in the fuel. 

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:16.264
 When ignited, it becomes heat 

00:08:16.264 --> 00:08:20.103
 and radiant energy associated with fire. 

00:08:20.103 --> 00:08:23.631
 It does not disappear, it radiates out. 

00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:25.234
 The rays of energy radiate outward, 

00:08:25.234 --> 00:08:26.674
 maybe to warm up something. 

00:08:26.674 --> 00:08:29.319
 And the heat will be radiated out 

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:32.428
 or it will be distracting outside, 

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:35.311
 to warm the environment. 

00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:37.125
 The same happens in the example of the flash. 

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:41.049
 We start with electrical potential, 

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.159
 the bottom of the clouds is more negative, 

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.537
 but the earth is positive. 

00:08:46.537 --> 00:08:49.312
 At some point this potential energy turns 

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:53.387
 in kinetic energy as the electrons move through the air. 

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:57.099
 Then much of it 

00:08:57.099 --> 00:09:00.109
 turns into heat and radiant energy. 

00:09:00.109 --> 00:09:03.276
 The purpose of this video, regardless of the example, 

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:06.443
 was to show that if we think carefully, 

00:09:06.443 --> 00:09:08.240
 I encourage you to do it every day, 

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.204
 we see that energy does not come from nothing, 

00:09:10.204 --> 00:09:16.339
 does not appear with a magic wand, but simply turns from one species to another.
