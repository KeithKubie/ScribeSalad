00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.421
- Oh man, that amount of chilies,

00:00:01.421 --> 00:00:03.272
that amount of curry paste,

00:00:03.272 --> 00:00:04.965
the holy basil in there,

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:07.573
the garlic which just
smells unbelievably good!

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:10.156
(upbeat music)

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.402
Hey everyone, it's Mark
Wiens with migrationology.com

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:20.451
in Nakhon Sawan, Thailand

00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:22.590
which is right in central Thailand.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.036
I'm hangin' out with my buddy, Micah.

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:28.188
Micah, can you say hello?

00:00:28.188 --> 00:00:30.716
Oh, I guess you can only
see the top of his head.

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:34.271
Oh wait, maybe you can see his eyes here.

00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:36.008
Micah, say hello.

00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:37.269
Oh, there he is.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:38.936
Micah is hangin' out

00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:43.523
but we came to visit Ying's grandmother.

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:44.535
Ying is my wife.

00:00:44.535 --> 00:00:47.368
And she's, Ying was born in Krabi.

00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:51.603
She spent most of her life
in the south of Thailand.

00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:52.717
That's where her father is from

00:00:52.717 --> 00:00:54.426
but her mother is from Nakhon Sawan

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:55.835
which is right in central Thailand.

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:58.592
I really enjoy coming to
visit Ying's grandmother's

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:00.842
especially because it's in the countryside

00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:03.536
and it's relaxing and quiet and peaceful.

00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:04.574
And the last time,

00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:05.760
this is my second time to visit.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.793
The last time we came here,

00:01:07.793 --> 00:01:11.327
they have a farm and they
caught some field rats

00:01:11.327 --> 00:01:13.508
which were incredibly delicious

00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:15.546
and we ate them the last time I was here.

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:20.193
This time Ying's aunt said
that they couldn't get any rats

00:01:20.193 --> 00:01:22.558
that just depends on the,

00:01:22.558 --> 00:01:24.384
if they can catch any in the field or not.

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.714
But they did get some birds

00:01:25.714 --> 00:01:27.042
and I think they're quails.

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:29.466
So we're definitely gonna
have some quails for dinner.

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.801
I'm not sure what else

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:32.623
but this is just gonna be a quick vlog

00:01:32.623 --> 00:01:35.574
about what we're gonna
eat tonight for dinner.

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:37.461
There's a big patch of bananas here.

00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:39.536
And there are some stalks of bananas

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:41.448
that are getting pretty
close to being ripe.

00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:44.516
Oh and that is a gigantic banana blossom.

00:01:44.516 --> 00:01:46.849
Look at that banana blossom.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.166
Micah, how are you doing down there?

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:02.849
Oh, you're hangin' out.

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:06.162
Ying's mom is getting
ready to chop up the quails

00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:09.079
and I think she's gonna mince them.

00:02:29.738 --> 00:02:32.405
(loud pounding)

00:02:36.794 --> 00:02:40.711
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:47.337 --> 00:02:49.399
With the quail, you can
eat the entire thing

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.753
with all the bones as long
as you mince it up finely

00:02:52.753 --> 00:02:54.632
then you just have a
little bit of a crunch

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:55.800
when you're eating it

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.186
but you can eat all the bones.

00:02:57.186 --> 00:02:59.853
It's a little bit muddy in here.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:08.092
But as much as I love exploring Bangkok,

00:03:08.092 --> 00:03:09.968
what I love so much about Thailand

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:12.288
is getting out into the countryside

00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:14.621
and ah yeah, I love it here.

00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.490
There, these are bananas.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.092
I'm gonna go check out
what else she's growing,

00:03:19.092 --> 00:03:22.602
what else Ying's aunt
is growing over here.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:25.019
Oh, it looks like it's basil.

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:28.066
Is it holy basil?

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.107
What I love so much about
the countryside of Thailand

00:03:36.107 --> 00:03:39.107
is the culture, the food, the farms,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.225
the growth, the fruit, the vegetables.

00:03:43.225 --> 00:03:47.493
Yeah, I just love the
countryside of Thailand

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.480
and I love the peacefulness as well.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.225
When you're in the city it's so loud

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:53.728
and so, the pollution and the smog.

00:03:53.728 --> 00:03:55.431
There's so much of it.

00:03:55.431 --> 00:03:58.835
But in the countryside, it's
just so peaceful and relaxed.

00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:01.848
This type of banana, in Thai
it's called kluay nam wa.

00:04:01.848 --> 00:04:05.396
And I think, I believe in
English that it's a burro banana.

00:04:05.396 --> 00:04:09.095
But there are little, a
couple of bite sized bananas,

00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:10.688
they taste delicious.

00:04:10.688 --> 00:04:12.426
And normally quite sweet

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:14.736
and maybe a little bit chalky sometimes.

00:04:14.736 --> 00:04:16.550
And this type of banana
is really good as is

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.769
but it's also really
good grilled, roasted.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.102
(whistling)

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:37.802
Ying, look at this crock.

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.526
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:44.879
This is an awesome crock.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.212
This probably has been used for decades.

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:52.069
Yeah, I'm loving this.

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:53.849
This is really nice.

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.985
And mom has just finished
mincing up all of the quail

00:04:56.985 --> 00:05:00.150
and now I'm gonna pound up the chilies

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.686
and also wash, I guess
rinse off the holy basil

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:06.212
which is coming straight
from the garden there.

00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:09.707
Got a bag of chilies here from the market.

00:05:09.707 --> 00:05:12.957
(plastic bag rustling)

00:05:23.612 --> 00:05:26.512
Oh, I can smell those
immediately as I opened that bag.

00:05:26.512 --> 00:05:30.679
I know we're gonna need a lot
of these chilies for sure.

00:05:32.608 --> 00:05:34.858
Quickly take off the stems.

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:39.708
And then drop 'em into the mortar.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.842
You can just smell how spicy these are.

00:05:45.842 --> 00:05:47.283
That aroma, that chili,

00:05:47.283 --> 00:05:49.360
those chili fumes coming off of them

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.549
when they're green like this.

00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:55.716
Okay, I think that's good
on the chilies right now.

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:59.916
(loud pounding)

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:11.419
For the garlic,

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.937
I often like to just toss
them in as the whole clove

00:06:13.937 --> 00:06:16.652
give them a pound and then
the skin just peels right off

00:06:16.652 --> 00:06:18.149
and then you can keep pounding it

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:20.940
to get to the minced texture that you want

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.023
with all those oils, the
chilies, and the garlic.

00:06:25.957 --> 00:06:28.857
(loud sizzling)

00:06:28.857 --> 00:06:30.693
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:30.693 --> 00:06:31.573
Hello, Micah.

00:06:31.573 --> 00:06:32.713
- [Ying] Hello, hello.

00:06:32.713 --> 00:06:35.849
- I'm not the only one
loving this country weather.

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:38.516
Micah is hanging out to the max.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.225
We're getting ready to cook up the quail

00:06:51.225 --> 00:06:53.109
and I think it's Ying's cousin.

00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:55.942
I think he's gonna do the cooking.

00:07:01.574 --> 00:07:05.324
(loud scraping and sizzling)

00:07:11.002 --> 00:07:13.919
He just said that he is
stir frying it rat style.

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:17.809
So it's like a same, similar
recipe to stir frying rat.

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:19.685
And you wanna make it really dry

00:07:19.685 --> 00:07:21.924
so he's just stir frying all of that,

00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:24.307
all the moisture out of that quail.

00:07:24.307 --> 00:07:28.057
(loud scraping and sizzling)

00:07:33.092 --> 00:07:35.759
Finished dry roasting the quail.

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:50.694
I think it's coriander seeds.

00:07:50.694 --> 00:07:53.011
Coriander seeds and
there's a siamese cardamom

00:07:53.011 --> 00:07:54.311
caught in there too.

00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:56.894
Oh that smoke smells delicious.

00:07:57.785 --> 00:08:01.452
(speaking foreign language)

00:08:12.313 --> 00:08:15.500
(loud pounding)

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.551
And right now after dry
roasting that coriander seed

00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:21.371
he's just pounding it up into a powder.

00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:25.288
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:34.384 --> 00:08:36.269
We're gonna first add in some,

00:08:36.269 --> 00:08:39.571
I think it's just red curry paste.

00:08:39.571 --> 00:08:42.238
(loud sizzling)

00:08:50.658 --> 00:08:53.825
And now he's adding in that coriander.

00:08:56.246 --> 00:08:59.996
(loud scraping and sizzling)

00:09:11.423 --> 00:09:14.590
And then in go the garlic and chilies.

00:09:17.166 --> 00:09:19.583
Oh that aroma smells so good.

00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:26.316
(coughing)

00:09:31.473 --> 00:09:33.713
One of the greatest joys
of stir frying chilies

00:09:33.713 --> 00:09:36.210
is that everybody around
you starts coughing.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.149
(laughing)

00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:39.258
Okay, so then he added in the quail.

00:09:39.258 --> 00:09:41.401
Oh that is just smelling incredibly good.

00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:44.052
Oh that is just smelling incredibly good.

00:09:44.052 --> 00:09:47.135
Oh I just took a whiff of that chili.

00:09:48.224 --> 00:09:51.974
(loud scraping and sizzling)

00:10:10.357 --> 00:10:14.274
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:17.614 --> 00:10:21.924
And then the final step is
adding in that holy basil.

00:10:21.924 --> 00:10:24.674
Oh that just smells unbelievable.

00:10:35.564 --> 00:10:39.731
(loud scraping and sizzling)
(coughing)

00:10:45.956 --> 00:10:48.577
That was a masterful demonstration.

00:10:48.577 --> 00:10:52.784
It's kind of a twist on the
normal holy basil Thai stir fry

00:10:52.784 --> 00:10:54.980
which well includes some extra spices

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.888
and also the curry paste

00:10:56.888 --> 00:10:59.566
and yeah, and also you really emphasize

00:10:59.566 --> 00:11:01.379
that you really wanted it dry.

00:11:01.379 --> 00:11:02.744
So even when he was
cooking that quail first,

00:11:02.744 --> 00:11:06.385
he stir fried it dry and
then he took out the moisture

00:11:06.385 --> 00:11:08.434
the water that came out of the quail.

00:11:08.434 --> 00:11:11.317
Oh man, that amount of chilies,
that amount of curry paste,

00:11:11.317 --> 00:11:13.587
the holy basil in there, the garlic,

00:11:13.587 --> 00:11:16.587
which just smells unbelievably good.

00:11:22.262 --> 00:11:23.095
Oh man.

00:11:27.123 --> 00:11:28.206
It's so good!

00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.131
It's so insanely good!

00:11:31.131 --> 00:11:33.798
It's so spicy, it's so garlicky.

00:11:35.282 --> 00:11:38.731
The quail actually, it kinda
tastes like minced beef

00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:42.209
but with a little bit of
a tougher texture to it.

00:11:42.209 --> 00:11:44.605
And then you also get
those little bone crunches.

00:11:44.605 --> 00:11:45.955
Oh, it's kinda like duck.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.731
I can compare it to duck, I think.

00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:50.910
But yeah, you eat through all of the bones

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.067
so you don't waste anything on a quail.

00:11:54.067 --> 00:11:57.320
Oh man, you can taste that
curry paste coming in there too.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.189
And then that fresh holy basil, peppery,

00:12:01.189 --> 00:12:03.272
very aromatic holy basil.

00:12:04.494 --> 00:12:06.315
That is, that's an award-winning
countryside Thai dish.

00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:09.512
That is, that's an award-winning
countryside Thai dish.

00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:11.756
And also, I would just also say that,

00:12:11.756 --> 00:12:12.978
I'm not actually like,

00:12:12.978 --> 00:12:15.002
eating from the serving bowl.

00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:16.831
But because this is Ying's family,

00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:18.685
they all told me to just take the bowl

00:12:18.685 --> 00:12:20.352
and start eating it.

00:12:23.609 --> 00:12:24.442
Okay!

00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:26.921
That's so good!

00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:28.143
And what I really love

00:12:28.143 --> 00:12:29.337
is you can really taste the
fragrance of the coriander seeds

00:12:29.337 --> 00:12:33.206
is you can really taste the
fragrance of the coriander seeds

00:12:33.206 --> 00:12:34.501
that he added in here.

00:12:34.501 --> 00:12:37.418
That is a touch that I'm gonna use

00:12:37.418 --> 00:12:39.272
next time I make pad ga prao.

00:12:39.272 --> 00:12:40.582
I thought we were all gonna have dinner

00:12:40.582 --> 00:12:44.053
but I guess Ying's entire
family is still full from lunch

00:12:44.053 --> 00:12:47.845
which we had probably only
about two and a half hours ago.

00:12:47.845 --> 00:12:50.209
But I guess I'm the only one that's hungry

00:12:50.209 --> 00:12:52.291
so they told me I need to eat now.

00:12:52.291 --> 00:12:53.880
I'm gonna eat.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.863
But that's why I'm the only one eating.

00:12:55.863 --> 00:12:57.876
I'm gonna start with
some more of the quail

00:12:57.876 --> 00:12:59.633
and this time with rice.

00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:01.347
Oh and I forgot to say he even threw in

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:05.014
some more whole chilies
for a surprise bite.

00:13:07.674 --> 00:13:10.341
This is just so incredibly good.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.869
It's so much flavor per
like square millimeter,

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:26.264
It's so much flavor per
like square millimeter,

00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:27.633
per square millimeter.

00:13:27.633 --> 00:13:29.599
That's like powerful flavor

00:13:29.599 --> 00:13:32.309
and that is so good with the rice.

00:13:32.309 --> 00:13:34.622
And there are a lot of
random cats and dogs

00:13:34.622 --> 00:13:36.539
running around as well.

00:13:40.201 --> 00:13:43.800
What I'm loving so much
is that coriander seed,

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.055
that really gives it a,

00:13:45.055 --> 00:13:46.324
that really gives it a,

00:13:46.324 --> 00:13:49.030
an edge of extra spice flavor.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.511
And then this is a curry
that Ying's mom made.

00:13:51.511 --> 00:13:55.011
This is nam ya with coconut milk and fish.

00:13:56.685 --> 00:14:00.268
And this goes so well,
so good on the rice.

00:14:11.654 --> 00:14:13.124
Oh, the naturally sweet coconut milk

00:14:13.124 --> 00:14:15.740
Oh, the naturally sweet coconut milk

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.656
and then it's just enriched and thickened

00:14:18.656 --> 00:14:20.807
by the minced up fish in there.

00:14:20.807 --> 00:14:22.509
And another thing that I'm really loving,

00:14:22.509 --> 00:14:24.672
and I had a couple of
these for lunch already.

00:14:24.672 --> 00:14:26.756
This is pla duk dad diaw.

00:14:26.756 --> 00:14:27.737
And in Thai,

00:14:27.737 --> 00:14:28.570
And in Thai,

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.403
okay, pla duk is catfish

00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:30.911
okay, pla duk is catfish

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:32.868
and then dad diaw is one sun.

00:14:32.868 --> 00:14:37.497
So it's one day dried
catfish and then deep fried.

00:14:37.497 --> 00:14:39.482
You do kinda gotta be
careful of the bones,

00:14:39.482 --> 00:14:41.982
the bones are still kinda hard

00:14:43.118 --> 00:14:44.695
but you can rip off,

00:14:44.695 --> 00:14:47.362
tear off the catfish meat there.

00:14:49.623 --> 00:14:53.198
And if you look at it really closely,

00:14:53.198 --> 00:14:55.001
can you see that real close?

00:14:55.001 --> 00:14:57.619
You can see that it has a

00:14:57.619 --> 00:14:59.686
more of a creamy color

00:14:59.686 --> 00:15:02.494
and also it's more, it's more like,

00:15:02.494 --> 00:15:05.931
it's not flaky like a regular fish

00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:09.014
or a fish that's not dried for a day.

00:15:13.775 --> 00:15:16.046
Yeah, it's a little bit salty

00:15:16.046 --> 00:15:17.068
Yeah, it's a little bit salty

00:15:17.068 --> 00:15:19.579
and you can taste that
it's been dried in the sun

00:15:19.579 --> 00:15:21.582
so it's a little bit dehydrated.

00:15:21.582 --> 00:15:23.583
But then what's interesting is that

00:15:23.583 --> 00:15:25.997
it completely changes its texture

00:15:25.997 --> 00:15:27.760
it completely changes its texture

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.996
from a fresh catfish.

00:15:29.996 --> 00:15:32.798
'Cause it's more of like a creamy kind of,

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.868
almost like cheesy texture

00:15:34.868 --> 00:15:36.291
but really good.

00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:37.847
And it doesn't have, it
doesn't actually have

00:15:37.847 --> 00:15:41.171
any kind of a foul preserved taste to it.

00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:44.169
It's actually just delicious with rice.

00:15:44.169 --> 00:15:45.844
I think I'm gonna end this video right now

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:47.447
and just finish dinner

00:15:47.447 --> 00:15:49.610
and then hang out with
Ying and her family.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.158
But I just wanted to share with you

00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:53.681
this quick video about hanging out

00:15:53.681 --> 00:15:55.321
at Ying's grandmother's house

00:15:55.321 --> 00:15:59.321
and delicious awesomely
good country style food.

00:16:00.423 --> 00:16:01.901
Oh man, I love it all

00:16:01.901 --> 00:16:04.283
but that quail or if you substitute rat

00:16:04.283 --> 00:16:06.018
but that quail or if you substitute rat

00:16:06.018 --> 00:16:08.578
field rat for that same recipe,

00:16:08.578 --> 00:16:09.636
it is sensational.

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:10.650
it is sensational.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:12.600
