00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.510
Hanging from the back edge of your soft palate,
the palatine uvula seems to serve several

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.271
functions, none of which are particularly
necessary for most people, which is why it

00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:25.230
can generally be removed with few, if any,
noticeable side effects.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:52.680
In fact, in the West, the “uvula” (name
deriving from the Latin “uvola,” meaning

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:03.629
“small bunch of grapes”) is often cut
out as part

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:17.650
of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty to help patients
who suffer from sleep apnea.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.350
Other cultures have long removed the uvula,
sometimes as part of a ritual, to treat all

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.620
manner of “throat conditions,” as well
as cure everything from vomiting and diarrhea

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.690
to rejecting breast feeding, growth retardation
and even anorexia.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.300
Today the surgery is still occasionally practiced
among various ethnic groups in Eritrea, Ethiopia,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.280
Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Zarma.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.640
So if you probably wouldn’t notice anything
particularly different when it’s removed,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.490
what does the uvula actually do and why do
we still have one?

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.590
Beyond that it is necessary for producing
important sounds, sometimes called uvular

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.280
consonants, in several languages, including
French and Arabic, perhaps the most noticeable

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.930
role of the uvula is helping to keep the throat
moist.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.840
You see, the uvula is packed with serous and
seromucous glands.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.050
When muscle fibers in the uvula (musculus
uvulae) contract, it results in these glands

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.580
excreting significant amounts of a thin form
of saliva that gets splattered and dripped

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.709
around the throat as we speak and swallow.

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.130
In fact, one of the potential side effects
of having your uvula removed is occasional

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.250
problems with a dry throat.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.270
With the help of its internal muscular fibers,
the uvula also aids the soft palate in sealing

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.600
off the passageway between your throat and
your nose (called the nasopharynx) when you

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.870
swallow and speak, helping to make sure bits
of food or liquid don’t go up your nose

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.480
and that the air and vocal vibrations are
directed out of your mouth and not your nasal

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.480
cavity.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.310
The partial role the uvula has in this has
led some to speculate that it assists with

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.250
keeping the tone of our voices in a pleasing
range, as it could help control both resonance

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.970
and subdue the nasal tone of the voice.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.550
However, the soft palate alone is usually
perfectly capable of sealing the nasopharynx,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.200
and thus, in most cases the uvula is not necessary
to put an end to a nasally sounding voice.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.970
In rare cases, some individuals do have a
problem with this, a condition called velopharyngeal

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.440
insufficiency, which, beyond potential issues
like nasal regurgitation (bits of food and

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.690
the like going up your nose when swallowing),
results in the individual having difficulty

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.050
saying consonants like “b”.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.420
Given these primary functions of the uvula,
it has been proposed that the reason humans

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.819
have a uvula is because it aids somewhat in
speech, making it an accessory speech organ.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.370
This theory is loosely supported by the fact
that, outside of humans, only a few animals,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.819
and this is individual animals, not species,
have been found to even have one:

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.780
In 1992, researchers searched the mouth cavities
in a number of animals . . . [including] dogs

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.270
and horses and cows and apes and sheep . . . . Of
all animals in the study, a small underdeveloped

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.459
uvula was found only in two baboons.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.019
Another function of the uvula relates to its
role in the gag reflex, as it is one of only

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.180
five parts of the body that will potentially
trigger it (the others being the roof of the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.630
mouth, the backs of the tongue and throat,
and the tonsils).

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.370
Having something the dangles down over the
throat opening that can trigger this is obviously

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.739
beneficial over just the tissue around said
opening performing this function.

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.240
However, as with the other stuff the uvula
does for you, it isn’t really necessary

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.249
in this case either and, for most people,
its removal would not likely inconvenience

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:36.919
them in the slightest, or even necessarily
be noticed at all other than potentially visually.

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.900
Despite the uvula playing a role in the gag
reflex, and despite other drawbacks, uvula

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.860
piercing is a thing.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.530
A fascinating vestigial trait in humans is
the palmar grasp reflex that newborn infants

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.089
(and even pre-born fetuses) display: studies
of this reflex have revealed that newborn

00:04:55.089 --> 00:05:00.630
humans can support their own weight by hanging
from their hands for at least 10 seconds.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.259
This activity mimics that of newborn monkeys,
who must be able to grasp and hang onto their

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.150
mothers for significantly longer periods of
time.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.819
Human infants start to lose this reflex at
about three months.

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:17.520
Of course, most have seen ultrasound pictures
of human embryos with tails (this happens

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.629
in the sixth week).

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.460
Within a few weeks of development, however,
for most the tail’s vertebrae fuse together

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.740
to form the coccyx and the tail, itself, disappears
long before birth (although occasionally a

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.659
baby is born with a bit of the structure,
see: Are Some People Really Born with Tails?).

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:39.699
Interestingly, not everyone is born with wisdom
teeth anymore, as the evolution of the human

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.520
diet has led to their obsolescence.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.339
Likewise, a thin strip of muscle thought to
be important for hanging, the palmaris longus,

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:49.469
is believed to be missing in about 10% of
the population.

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:55.039
If you’ve ever known someone who can wiggle
their ears, this is due to auricular muscles

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:56.870
around the outside of the human ear.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.529
Although most of us never use them, it is
said that “through repeated effort . . . humans

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:17.020
can recover some ability to wiggle their ears.”
