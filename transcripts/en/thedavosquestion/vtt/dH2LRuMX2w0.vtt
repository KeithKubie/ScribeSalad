00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.799
&gt;&gt; I think India has a very good chance of
becoming a superpower simply

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:13.500
by the fact that its diverse population, its
diverse knowledge base,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.750
the education levels, peoples' IT skills that
have been shown around

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.660
the world, the medical facilities that are
available and the medical

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.500
field that has reached around the world has,
has taken India to already

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.210
what it is today.
And I think if that has -- that skill -- those

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.610
skills are honed in
education and by educating as many of its

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.510
population as possible, I
think India can easily become a superpower.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:57.469
It has the financial means and it has the
educational -- the base that

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:05.400
requires.
I think India in the next 15 years is aligned

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.920
to reach that level.
Easily.
