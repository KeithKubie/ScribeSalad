1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,380
Do you consider shooting a martial art
and how has your firearms training been

2
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:09,830
like or unlike martial arts training?
Well,

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,010
shooting is absolutely a martial art.
Yeah.

4
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,220
I mean maybe not the way people pictures
of martial arts nowadays be. Oh,

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,520
because when you picture a
martial art people picture,

6
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:26,870
you know a guy with a Guiana. Yeah,
doing karate. That's, that's right.

7
00:00:26,871 --> 00:00:29,750
That's the generic picture. To me
that's not, that's not martial arts.

8
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:34,520
Actually to me martial
arts is the art of war.

9
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:39,521
The Art of the individual
warrior skills that it takes.

10
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,780
And firearms are absolutely a martial art
because it's something that you train.

11
00:00:44,781 --> 00:00:46,430
It's something that you get good at.

12
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:48,830
It's something that you need
to maintain your skill at.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,620
And it is absolutely a martial art.
And to me

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,190
it's another piece of the puzzle.
It's another thing that you should,

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,110
you need to know how to do.

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,440
And just like tactics that go along with
shooting are an important part of being

17
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:13,080
a warrior.
You need know how to shoot in.

18
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,590
The training is very similar in my mind
to martial arts training in that it

19
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,650
takes, you know, repetition.

20
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,880
You have to know what the basics are
and you have to repeat those basics and

21
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:31,510
then you get more advanced and it's,

22
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,550
it's about movement and getting
efficient with your movement.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And then you want to train it very
similar to the way that you train mixed

24
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,860
martial arts or martial arts in
general. And that is, you know,

25
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:49,380
you're going to have different frat levels
and how you get to deal with them and

26
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:51,930
you want to deal with your
weak side, you know, you can,

27
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:56,790
you shoot with your off hand in
various environments in the low light,

28
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,780
in the dark, in the rain, in
the, you want to mix it up.

29
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,020
So you're used to all of it. You want
to be used to people at close range,

30
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:06,390
you want to be used to
people at a further range.

31
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,450
And then once you get all
those mechanical skills down,

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,930
then you want to train your
mind around this thing.

33
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,290
You want to train your mind around this
skill so that your mind knows how to

34
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,290
utilize this skill when things are
unexpected and when there's chaos and when

35
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:32,460
there's mayhem going on.
And that's,

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,050
that's one of the things that I really
like about simunition training or paint

37
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:39,810
ball training or laser tag
training is it allows you,

38
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,210
it allows you to have somebody
else shoot back at you,

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,970
which is just like,
you know,

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
just like rolling in Jujitsu or sparring
more Thai or sparring MMA is you have

41
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:56,640
to react to the person. It's
no longer just a Kata, right?

42
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,640
It's no longer just shooting paper targets
that don't shoot back and don't move.

43
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,200
So you, so I love to take it. Once you've
got the skills down and then you learn,

44
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,180
you've got the fundamentals down,

45
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:15,181
then you take the advanced fundamentals
and then you begin to train to simulate

46
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,310
combat. And this is oc
tell Ya, I had these, um,

47
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,420
I got these laser tag guns for my son
and I just got two of them at first.

48
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,260
But that escalated very quickly
because they were awesome.

49
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:37,261
There are these little nerf laser tag
guns and you could shoot each other at,

50
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:43,180
I dunno, maybe a hundred meters,
which is a pretty good shot,

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,830
is like a pistol.
And so when I got these,

52
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,530
and as soon as I got two of them
and I realized how good they were,

53
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,950
I bought two more so I could go against
my son and his friends and they could go

54
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:54,784
against each other.

55
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,260
And I taught my son like all the basic
military maneuvers that he would need to

56
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:03,730
know. And this is when he
was maybe eight years old and

57
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,830
he would play this game
all the time, you know, in.

58
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,690
So I taught him out of covering move,

59
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:12,340
I taught them how to
get elevated positions.

60
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:17,140
I taught him how to do individual movement
techniques where you don't show your

61
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:19,330
face at the same spot,
like twice in a row.

62
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:23,200
Every time you get up you
move a little bit. And he,

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,310
he realized that that's how you win in
these little games and they're real.

64
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:31,390
Those are the real tactics.
And so I had a speaking,

65
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:36,340
speaking of speaking of the Marine Corps,
I had a friend that,

66
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,600
uh,
was,

67
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,670
was came over to the
house one time and he was,

68
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,940
you know,
a marine and

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,020
we got in the conversation
and all of a sudden, you know,

70
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:54,700
my son comes out with the laser tag
guns and my son's like, oh, you know,

71
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:58,960
do you want to go? And the guy's like,
you know, yeah, of course, let's do it.

72
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,280
So my son looks at him
and says, indoor, outdoor.

73
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,300
And you all of a sudden you could see
there was something going on and the guy

74
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:08,380
goes outdoor,
outdoor.

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,330
So my son that you press the button
on the thing and it counts down for 10

76
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:18,040
seconds and then it's on.
So, so you go find cover or
something like that. So yeah,

77
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,010
so 10 seconds, my son hits the
thing, my son takes off out the door.

78
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,810
So I'm watching the guy to guy,
this guy is doomed because you know,

79
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,320
you're going against the training.

80
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,150
So the guy comes out and,
and it's dark, right?

81
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:36,820
But the guy comes out of the door and I'm
watching him and he's kind of crouched

82
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:40,390
a little bit and all of a sudden his gun,
because it all is in this one system,

83
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:43,390
it's all takes place inside the gun.
You don't wear a helmet,

84
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:46,620
you don't wear anything. You actually
are shooting the other person's gun. Oh.

85
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,600
And when it shot, when you,
when he gets shot, he goes,

86
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,730
existed does and shakes
and a red light flashes.

87
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,820
So he walks out and sure enough,

88
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,060
my son had run around the block at an
elevated position and as soon as he came

89
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:04,070
walking out, my son sort of drilling
him and the guy's like, he freezes.

90
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,100
It's interesting that he freezes.
He doesn't even think to myself, oh,

91
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:07,911
I'll take cover.
No,

92
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:12,640
he just froze and got drilled and then
as soon as it's easy standing there,

93
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,690
he's kind of looking around,
looking around, looking around.

94
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,230
Finally he sees my son, he starts to
point the weapon up towards my son.

95
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:22,310
My son just disappears.
And then the guys,

96
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,900
the guy starts kind of walking over in
that direction. And then 15 seconds later,

97
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:31,310
my son pops up on his flank and drills
them again from behind another fence in a

98
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:35,390
hole in the wall. And anyways, he ends
up killing them. And then the guys, okay,

99
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:37,760
let's go again. And my son beat
him like three times in a row.

100
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,340
And it's because he had the basic,
the basic skills,

101
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,110
basic infantry men skills is what it was,
you know, he would shoot and then move.

102
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,820
And that's what it boils down to.
So that kind of thing is,

103
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,880
is very important in as
far as being a martial art.

104
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,550
And you should train, you know,
that's another thing, you know,

105
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:06,500
I said this to Sam Harris when I
was on his podcast, you know? Yeah.

106
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:09,200
Maybe there's no chance
because you live in, uh,

107
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,670
in the bubble and you live in a great
neighborhood and you're well protected.

108
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:15,320
You have alarm system in
your house and all that.

109
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,400
And maybe you're never gonna have a
problem. And that's great. I mean,

110
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,070
there's always a chance.
I would never believe that.

111
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:22,904
You're never gonna have a problem,

112
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,760
but there's always a chance that
somebody is going to crunch,

113
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:29,630
that's evil's going to enter your world
and you want to be ready for that.

114
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,500
Now, if that makes me
sound paranoid, okay,

115
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:38,170
let's just say you're not paranoid
and you don't think it's ever going to

116
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:39,004
happen,

117
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,650
but it is still highly valuable to train
in these situations because they make

118
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:49,250
you a better person. They make you
sharper, they make you smarter,

119
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,950
they make you more prepared.
If something does happen,

120
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,900
it's just good to know this stuff
and it makes you a better person,

121
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,350
more reliable. It's a
real skill set. You know,

122
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,360
I always was kind of bummed out about
basketball or football or baseball because

123
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,440
those are the, there. There are
life skills involved in Amman.

124
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:14,300
I don't wanna say that, but the
skill itself of throwing a baseball,

125
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:15,480
of shooting a basketball,

126
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:20,481
of throwing a football is not as
valuable as a skill as number one.

127
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:27,320
A martial artist, you know, moy,
Thai boxing, wrestling, Jujitsu,

128
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,300
because those are real applicable,
applicable to life. 100%

129
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,590
and this is the same thing
with shooting a gun. I mean,

130
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:40,400
that is a real applicable skill that
you may need at some point in your life,

131
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:41,840
and you should have it,
you know?
