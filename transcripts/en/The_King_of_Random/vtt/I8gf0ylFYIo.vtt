00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.670
I finally jumped on the band-wagon and got
a pair of solar panels. So, now that we’ve

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.549
got access to free, and virtually unlimited
amounts of electricity, let’s hook them

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.269
up and experiment, with some of the things
they can do.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.680
To start this project, I got a couple of 100-watt
solar panels from verengosolar.com. Here’s

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.660
a closeup of the panel so you can see just
how intricate the silicone wafers, and contact

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.220
grids really are. This panel converts sunlight
into about 100 watts of electricity, which

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.069
is about 2.5 times more power then I get from
the hand-crank charger I made in a previous

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:40.600
project. Not only do the panels make far more
electricity, they’re a lot less work to

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.229
operate. Now I spliced the cables and added
red and black alligator clips for convenience,

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.600
then tried hooking it up to my hydrogen generator.
You might remember this awesome piece of equipment

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.979
from another project video, which can turn
ordinary tap water, into a powerful,

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.539
Oxy-Hydrogen gas. When this fuel is burned,
it turns right back into water. So this could

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.449
be used as an environmentally friendly fuel,
but I mainly just use it for shooting bottle

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.850
rockets. Now this solar powered gas production
is a little bit slower than if we hooked it

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.049
straight to a car battery, but in a way that’s
kind of good. Because with lower amperage,

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.859
the generator, can seemingly run forever,
without overheating. And because we’re using

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:19.869
solar panels to generate the gas, the system
is completely off the grid. Electricity is

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.579
free, and virtually unlimited … as long
as the sun keeps shining. Just for fun let’s

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.200
try adding another panel, in parallel, to
double up the amperage. Which you can see,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.189
kicks the production up significantly. Now
to capture the gas, all we need to do, is

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.789
unscrew the cap of a full water bottle, and
dip it upside down in another bowl of water.

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.409
The bottle stays full, as long as it doesn’t
get pulled out, and if we bubble the gas up

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.359
from the bottom, it’ll eventually force
all the water out, and leave the bottle completely

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.270
full, of hydrogen and oxygen gas. Now to test
the power of hydroxy gas, let’s touch a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.399
flame to the mouth of the bottle and see what
happens. Incredible power. Alright, let’s

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.299
disconnect the hydrogen generator and see
what we can try next. I stopped by a local

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.969
hardware store and picked up this 500 watt
power inverter for only $33.00. So why don’t

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.880
we try hooking it directly to one of the panels.
You can see the inverter has a USB port built

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.319
right into it, which means we’ve got the
ability to charge any USB powered device,

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.310
including our smartphones. One panel is enough
to charge a car battery as well. So if there’s

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.989
ever an emergency, all we need to do is hook
the inverter to the battery, and now we can

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.670
do all kinds of neat things. Like power a
small radio to listen for emergency broadcasts.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.340
This will also charge batteries for electronics,
and power tools, so we can still build, just

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.769
about anything we need. For this next experiment,
I found an old piece of steel wire from the

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.790
back of a picture frame, and if we try connecting
the leads to a piece of that, you can see

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.370
that in an instant, the wire gets so hot it
melts. Now if we’ve got that kind of power,

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.760
let’s take it one step further by touching
the electrified wire, to a pile of leaves.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.110
Not surprisingly, it starts smoking, and bursts
into flames in just a matter of seconds. Well,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.760
it’s always good to know different ways,
of getting a fire started without matches.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.549
Especially if means, you can avoid rubbing
sticks together. Now to finish up, let me

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.829
show you one interesting thing I noticed during
the hydrogen generator experiment. This lead

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.480
makes an unusually juicy spark every time
I touch the terminal. So for one final experiment,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.250
let’s try drawing the arc out. Impressively,
it looks like we can stretch this arc at least

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.560
a couple of millimeters, and even hold it
for a few seconds. Now this stream of electrified

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.459
plasma is dangerously hot. Which you may
have figured out already, because of the molten

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.890
copper metal that seems to be sparking out
everywhere. What really blows my mind is that

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.000
all this incredible electrical energy is coming
from the sun, absolutely free of charge. Well

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.790
now you know how to use solar energy, to make
earth-friendly fuels, power household devices,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.340
charge batteries, and even start a fire. So
if there ever is a so-called “zombie apocalypse”,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.129
you’ll be one step closer to prospering,
as a survivor. Well that’s it for now. If

Hey, it’s nice to see you.
Hey guys, this is the first time I’ve tried

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.299
playing around with solar power, and to tell
you the truth I’m really quite impressed

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.870
at how much power there really is. And what’s
really cool is that in the next few days I

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.159
get to give away 3 of these 100 watt panels
to 3 of you. So keep an eye out for my next

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.989
contest video where I’m giving those away,
and if you get one, hopefully you’ll experience

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.189
the same thrill of discovery that I just did.
I have many more projects and experiments

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.140
coming up, so please subscribe if you haven’t.
And let me know if you liked this video by

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.750
giving it a thumbs up.
Thanks again for watching to the end, and

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.630
I will see you in the next project video!
Bye.
