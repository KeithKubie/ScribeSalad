00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.012
(upbeat music)

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.346
- Hey, come on in!

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:16.082
(80s-style rock)

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.687
Yeah, push and believe.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:21.855
You got it!

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:22.856
Nikki.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:23.690
- What?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.924 line:0%
Wow!

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:25.592 line:0%
- I didn't mean to
catch you off guard.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.259
- You kinda did.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.360
What is this?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.762
- This is actually prune juice.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:29.696
- Okay.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:30.930
- And we do have champagne.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.799
We do have some bubbly
to celebrate the moment.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:33.767
- Right.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.068
- We do have food options.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.070
I have flown into Boston

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.073
fresh lobster from Alaska.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.541
- Why?

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.043 align:start size:94% position:6%
- The lobster, the water's
actually a cooler--

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:44.110
It's a Pacific lobster.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.378
- Okay.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:45.945 align:start size:84% position:16%

take a look at that.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:46.646

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:48.014
Oh, my God!

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:49.015
- [Brody] Yes!

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.583
- I'm really psyched about this!

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.618
- We have French fries.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:53.086
We have cole slaw.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.687 align:start size:88% position:13%
I will go ahead and pour
you some prune juice.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.389
- I would love some.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.458
I am just, I'm so thirsty.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.526
- You got it.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.363
(slow jazz music)

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.004
That's just prune juice for you.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.238
- Thank you.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.873
- [Brody] And then I
am going to celebrate.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:14.808
- Do it.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:15.809
- Here we go.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:16.643
Whoo!

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:17.477
Enjoy!

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:20.947
- Go, go!

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:23.283
Oh, my God.

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:25.385
You okay?

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:26.486
- Mmhmm.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:29.389
(sighs) Delicious.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:30.323
All right.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:32.058
- You want to get into this now?

00:01:32.058 --> 00:01:34.594 align:start size:94% position:6%
Oh, God.
- Wow, you are an expert.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.062
- I love seafood.
- What's the key

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:37.263
to opening this?

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.532
- You just take the fork,

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.668
and you take the first prong.

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:42.602
- Okay, I grabbed it.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:43.436
- Oh, wow!

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.471
- I just grabbed it.

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:47.674
- Yeah, rip that
little part off.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:48.508
- Not bad.
- Right?

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:49.342
- Delicious.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:50.376
- Ew.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:51.611
A lot of goop.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:52.612
- Oh, you got a lot
of goop in that.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:53.580
I'll tell you what.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.347
If you're not happy with that--

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:55.181
- I'm happy!

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.416
I'm so happy.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:57.383 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'm just going to
give you another option.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.218
- Okay.

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.452
- [Brody] Okay.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.822
If you are into meat products--

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.491
- Oh my God.

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.059 align:start size:84% position:16%
The animals that
had to die for this.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:08.228
- We do have some sausage.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.064
- Mmhmm.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.766
I'm totally good with lobster.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:14.601
- Okay.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:17.871
You sure?

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.507
- Yes, I'm sure.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:26.713 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I also travel on the
road with my uncle's ashes.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:28.681
Would this at all...

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.317
- Yeah, bring 'em into the mix.

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.519
What was his name?

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.087
- Uncle Eddie.

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:35.555
He travels with me, you know?

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.024
I take Southwest Airlines.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:39.559
- [Both] Bags fly free.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:40.760
- You are with me.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.594
- Yeah.

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:42.428
- You travel a lot.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:43.263
- [Nikki] A lot.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:44.430
- What cities?

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.098 align:start size:84% position:16%

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.234
Short drive, five
hours from L.A.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:49.536 align:start size:81% position:19%
Where else?
- Not bad for you.

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:51.037
Oh, I like Kansas City.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:53.306 align:start size:94% position:6%

Boom, yes!

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.193
- Wow.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.900
Letting it breathe.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.335

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.954
And I'd just like to give you...

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:41.788

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:50.263
Okay. (nervous laugh)
