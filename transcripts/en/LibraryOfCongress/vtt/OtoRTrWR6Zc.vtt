00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.340
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Hey.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.570
Welcome. Welcome to the Teen Board.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.670
And our 2016 author visit.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.410
We're very excited.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.020
Meg Medina is a very dear friend
of the Young Reader's Center

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.610
and the Library of Congress.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.600
She's -- thank you -- she's been
to our national book festival,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.910
and she's coming again this year.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.220
And she's participated
in a symposium

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.110
that we had last year on diversity.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.020
And she's leading and participating
in a symposium next month

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.720
on immigration and
children's literature.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.020
So, we're all very
excited to have her.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.010
And while she does, she's
an award-winning author,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.870
who produces a lot of
about picture books.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.430
But she also produces
a lot of YA books.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.120
And you will be very lucky to
be receiving a copy of The Girl

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.370
Who Could Silence The Wind
at the end of the program.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.930
And she will be signing
these for you.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.740
And why she's signing
them, surprise.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.020 position:56%
While she's signing them, Kathy will
pick up on the previous conversation

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.220
and talk a little bit about
some new books that she has,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.870
so that you can take something else
away to read, besides this book,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.970
which you'll probably read first.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.310
Two books that you
might be familiar with.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.700
That you've heard from Kathy.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.410
Yaqui Delgado Wants
to Kick Your Ass.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.430
And her recent book, that just
came out, Burn Baby, Burn.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.660
So, I'm just going the give
the program over to Meg Medina,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.010
and feel free, when it's
appropriate, to ask her questions.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.900
And I think you'll
enjoy the program.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.500
Thanks.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Can you guys all here
me okay, if I'm just talking here?

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.170
Okay, that's great.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.550
So, first of all, the is the middle
of April, which means that the end

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.180
of the school year is in sight.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.610
Yay. You made it.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.430
It's within reach, people.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.240
So. Congratulations.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.210
I always love spring, and during
the school year, because I feel

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.480
like it's almost there, that
it's time to rest and to stop.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.290
And Karen's right, that I love to
come to the Young Reader's Center,

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.720
because I think the Library
of Congress is probably one

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.410
of the most beautiful
buildings I've ever seen.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.880
All in celebration to knowledge
and book, which is really

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.990 position:56%
where people's power is to be found.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.180
So, I'm, every time I get
an invitation, I don't,

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.360
I don't even listen very
carefully to the invitation.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.510
I say yes, of course,
I'd be happy to be there.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.830
So, today I'm going to
just introduce myself,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.420
just a little bit about my books.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.720
Just very briefly.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.290
And then we're going to talk about
the newest one that came out.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.600
But I do want to tell
you about the one

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.390
that you're getting as a present.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.500
So, I write fiction for all ages.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.940
Sometimes I write picture books.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.780
Sometimes I write middle-grade
fiction.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.080
Sometimes I write YA.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.920
It just depends on my mood.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.510
And the story.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.150
So, for my picture books, when
I'm wanting to feel like joyous

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.740
and happy and full of light,
I write a picture book.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.310
Because, you know what a
four and a five and a six

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.610
and a seven-year-old is like.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.280
These are the people who go to the
grocery store in a Superman outfit.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.580
Or, like a tutu.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.880
For no reason.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.180
You've got to love that.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.360
So, I write a picture book
when I'm feeling hopeful.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.090
But, when I'm feeling, like,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.340
I really want to explore
something a little bit harder.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.980
When I'm feeling snarky.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.510
When I'm feeling fed up.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.120 position:56%
When I'm feeling like I'm on my last
nerve, I turn to fiction for you.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.880
Young adult fiction.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.360
And I love it because I think
teens ask hard questions.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.080
I think teens smell a rat easily.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.840
I think that teens
are really discerning.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.740
So, I like to write
stories that sort

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.150
of capture the experience
of growing up.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.600
The beautiful parts of it,
and the funny parts of it,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.570
and also the really
awful parts of it.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.480
So, most people know me in YA

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.750
for a book called Yaqui
Delgado Wants to Kick Your Ass.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.930
What do you think was the biggest
problem that I had with that book?

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.230
Shall we guess?

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.950
Right. It was the title, of course.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.170
It was always the first
line of the book.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.470
Always, always.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.370 position:56%
But I had not put that on the title.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.220
Because I felt bad for librarians.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.520
That was the first thing.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.780
And also, because I couldn't
picture them saying, " Welcome,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.640
Meg Medina to our school.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.940
Author of ..."

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.140
and you know, I just
couldn't picture like how

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.000
that was going to go in a school.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.320
And also because my mother was
alive, and she lived with me,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.620
and I was like, how am I going
to tell my 88-year-old mother

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.920
that this is the title of book?

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.840
So, I felt very bad about it.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.880
But, in the end, I'm
very glad that the book,

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.390
that the title is what it is.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.390
Because the book names the
experience of bullying, I think,

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.840
the way it actually looks.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.120
And it names the experience like
what happens to us when randomly,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.720 position:56%
out of nowhere, somebody targets us.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.480
How does a girl unravel?

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.980
And more importantly, how does a
girl sew herself back together.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.630
Because, as all of you know,
sitting out there, you know,

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.930
middle school and high school.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.850
It's not for the weak.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.820
And every day is sometimes,
can feel like an onslaught

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.920
of little insults and big insults.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.430
Small hurts and hurts that
you'll about for years

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.280
and years into your life.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.830 position:56%
And so, when I wrote that back, I
decided to go back into my own life,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.210 position:56%
and remember when a girl in a rabbit
fur coat came up to me and said,

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.280
"Yaqui Delgado is going
to kick your ass."

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.570
And everything that happened to me,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.580
and then I made up
a bunch of things.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.800
But what was true what the
feeling of feeling lost,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.390
and having to figure out
who I was as a Latina.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.220
Who I was as a girl.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.380
And how I was going to protect
myself and set up boundaries.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.740
And you probably have to do that
yourself, every day at school.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.120
So, the other book that I
wrote that's YA is this one,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.830 position:56%
The Girl Who Could Silence The Wind.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.130
I always call it the book
that almost killed Meg Medina.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.820
Because, it was my first YA.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.260
And, how many of you
out here like to write?

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.560
In your own time?

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.950
Okay. So, you know that
feeling, when you're trying

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.260
to get it right, and you can't.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.050
Okay. That was the
story of this book.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.700
I rewrote that book
about seven times.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.400
Each time, trying to
get it closer and closer

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.930
to the kind of book that I wanted.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.920 position:56%
I wanted to write a magical realism.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.960
Because it's such a gift from
Latin American, in literature.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.610
I wanted to write a story
about why people migrate.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.900
Because that's the conversation
in our country right now.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.600
There's so much conversation about
who's coming to this country.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.100
And immigrants.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.730
And I wanted to tell the story

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.970
about why people move,
and what's at stake.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:13.100
And so, I kept writing
it, and kept failing.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.680
My agent said it was
terrible, and she sent me back

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.320
to rewrite it a couple of times.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.170
My editor kept saying well,
let's try one more time.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.470
Let's try one more time.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.770
It ended up being seven.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.030
In the end, I have loved this book.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.360
I will tell you that it's sad.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.060
So, be prepared.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.830
And I am going the
apologize ahead of time.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.910
I'm sorry, I had to do it.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.470
Once you read the book,
this will all make sense.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.430
I had to do it.

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.480
I had to do it, and I won't
tell you what that "it" is,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.760
because the journey to
get to this country is

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.290 position:56%
in fact a violent and dangerous one.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.710
And I felt loo like
if I softened it,

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.280
that I wouldn't be
telling the truth.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.810
And the thing is, that
when you write for teens,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.210
if you write for young people,
I think the deal that you make

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.140
with your readers is that
you're going to tell the truth.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.840
Even though you're making a
fiction up, a piece of fiction,

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.990
you have to tell the truth
about the human experience.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:25.000
For that kid, privately, to be
able to sit, you, in your room,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.080
or in your library, or
whenever you like to read,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.970
and say that's exactly right.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.720
Or that's how it feels.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.770
Or, oh my gosh, I never
thought about it that way.

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.890
So, I'm sorry.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.400
You'll have to tell me.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.390 position:56%
You'll have to write to me on e-mail
and so on about what you thought.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.300
And then, I come to
Burn, Baby, Burn.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.290
So, when I say "burn, baby, burn",
what do you think of immediately?

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.160
What comes to your mind?

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.370 position:56%
As soon as I say "burn, baby, burn"?

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.160
Most people go oh.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.460
What is it?

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.760
Raise you hand if you know.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.060
Khadid? [assumed spelling]

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.360
&gt;&gt; Khadid: Disco inferno.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.660
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Disco inferno, yes.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.610
Disco music.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.910
All right.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.210
So. Here's the thing, people.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.610
I grew up in Queens, New York.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.240
And I was 13 in 1977.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.540
I'm pretty old.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.120
Remain calm.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.390
So, disco was all over
the air waves.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.940
1977 in New York.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.890
You know, if you say to a
New Yorker, of a certain age,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.950
my age and older, " Oh, yeah.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.870
1977. This is the face
they all make.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:42.160
It's like this revulsion.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.920
This horror.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.690
And you don't know why.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.180
But people who lived
through it though why.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.570
And I'm going to take
you on a little journey

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.790
into what New York City
looked like in 1977.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.450
42nd Street, which is today
Times Square, which is a place

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.920
where people go the get their
picture taken with Belle, or Beauty

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.150
and the Beast, or to go to the
Wax Museum, was in fact a triple-

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:18.040
X rated place where people could go
and see half-naked women dancing,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.750
and buy horrible magazines.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.730
There was a lot of prostitution,
and there was an enormous amount

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.330
of drug activity on the street.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:31.420
So, when I was a student, even
years later at Hunter College,

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.170 position:56%
years later, they would give us free
tickets, or student-rate tickets,

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.330
to go see shows on
Broadway for very little.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.840
Like 10 bucks, or 15 bucks.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.470
Some ridiculous amount of money.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.770
But you'd be afraid to go.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.860
Because you had to got on
the subway, and get out in

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.980
that part of town and navigate.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.870
And it was scary.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.570
The subways were covered
in graffiti.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:57.420
The city was bankrupt.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.100
So, I do remember that
teachers would get their checks

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.180
on Friday and go sprinting.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.730
I want you to picture
your teachers doing this.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.700
Right to the bank,
to cash their check,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.140
because they weren't sure the
city would have funds to pay them.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.460
So, that was a huge stress.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.280
It looked like that on
the inside of the subway.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.230
And it smelled like urine.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.670
That is the memory that I had,

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.490
sitting in there, like
a dusty urine.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.570 position:56%
People would defecate in the subway.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.380
People were sleeping on the subway.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.010
It was, it looked like this.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.120
But then there was disco music.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.420
And, not only disco music.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.720
Look at this ticket.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.080
This is the band Queen.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.160
Right? Look at the
price to go see them.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.460
Where was it?

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.820 position:56%
Seven dollars and 50 cents, at
Madison Square Garden, for a ticket.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.140
Can you imagine?

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.130
So, Queen was new.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.430
Led Zeppelin was new.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.040
Punk rock music was new.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.650
And it was this clash
of sound in the city.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.980
So, you could be wearing
your platform shoes,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:12.710
and your white his-and-her
matching velour jump suit,

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:16.760
and your glitter eye stuff,
and your hair all flipped out.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.550
And then there was somebody
all punked out with safety pins

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.220
through their ears, and so on.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.900
It was a whole clash.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.180
So, it wasn't all bad.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.880
It was the women's movement.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.480
Ms. Magazine was five
years old that year.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.140
And when Ms. Magazine, which is a
feminist magazine, first came out,

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.600
people said, who's going
to buy that magazine?

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.900
Are you crazy?

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.320
It'll be out of business
by the end of the year.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.520
It was celebrating
its fifth anniversary.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:51.270
Bella Abzug had, was
running for Mayor that year.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.760
And this is how she
decided to launch it.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.060
She got a bull horn.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.360
You see how she's wearing a hat?

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.990
She's famous for wearing hats.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:03.100
And she had a big mouth, and a
big, big Brooklyn kind of accent.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.080
And she got a bull
horn, and she walked

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.410
down Fifth Avenue going
" Hello, New York.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:14.290
I'm running for Mayor," in
the middle of the day, right?

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.770
And the greatest thing is

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.630
that traffic stopped,
and it become a parade.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:23.640
It was all a little crazy.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.920
And this was happening.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.490
See, this is Ms. Magazine.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:34.530
And I know that now, with our
I-phones and Twitter and Facebook,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.780
we get news immediately, and
there's nothing that's private.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.130
But I'm here to tell
you that, in 1976,

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:46.280
that cover of Ms. Magazine was the
first time any major magazine had

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.580
covered violence against women.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:55.160
It was shocking that anybody
would talk about this,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.050
that anybody would say, men aren't
supposed to hit their women.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:02.880
You are not supposed
to keep that secret.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:10.240
So, all of these layers
were being peeled back.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.220
I remember all of these buttons.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.360
Everybody was fighting for
the Equal Rights Amendment.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.220
But this is mostly what a remember.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:25.520
That, in the middle of all of that,
girls started to turn up dead.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.100
And they were young women.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.400
18 years old.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.100
19, 20, 25.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.370
Who were out on dates
with their boyfriends.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.210
And someone would shoot
into the car.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.360
And it started to happen sort

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.600
of in the early fall,
and then more and more.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.980
And what we didn't know,
because this was pre-Twitter,

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.060
and all of that, is what
the police already suspected

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.280
that it was one man.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.480
One sane guy, who was
shooting with a .44.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.760
So, we called him the
44- Caliber Killer.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:08.720
Until he started to write
letters to the newspaper.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.150
These long, rambling
love letters to New York.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.810
I'm still here.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.640
I'm going to get you on Friday.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.370
Don't think I'm sleeping.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.580
And he'd write them
to the newspaper.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:27.010
And newspapers are in the
business of selling news papers.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.240
So, this was huge.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.220
So, they started to publish them.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.630
I, I'm sorry to give it away,
that it ended up being him.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.650 position:56%
Which was such a disappointing
thing, when he was finally arrested.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.090
He worked for the Post Office.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.520
They arrested David
Berkowicz, was his name.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.990
They arrested him walking
to his car.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.790
He had a little brown lunch sack

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.350
in which he was holding
his.44 caliber gun.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:59.930
And an entire man hunt, a
year-long man hunt had been funded

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.230
around finding him.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.510
All of the police officers
who had been laid off,

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.010
because of the city's
financial crisis,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.130
had been rehired to find him.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.010
And he had the city crazy.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.240
Girls were dyeing their hair,
because he liked dark-haired girls.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.220
So, they would dye their hair
blond, or would be wearing hats.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.340
You wouldn't go out after dark.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.910
It was a panic.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.670
This was one of the first
young women, Christine Freund.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.810
She was killed with her fiance.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:38.680
And then, these are some
samples of his letters.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.450
And they were rambling.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:42.150
They were crazy, crazy letters.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.020
And then, of course, you could
see all the different headlines

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.100
that were going on at the time.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:52.100
But for a kid who's 13,
every day, to ask who's dead.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.220 position:56%
And these thing were happening,
sometimes blocks from where I lived.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.750
His first shooting was,
he, I think made a mistake.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:06.330
It was on Depo Road, sort of
near where our building was.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.470
Maybe six or seven blocks.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:14.150
And the person who ended
up hurt was the young men.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.890
But he had long hair.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.920
He had long brown hair.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.590
So, we think David Berkowicz
assumed he was the girl.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.990
Because he was sitting
in the passenger's seat.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.540 position:56%
The war belonged to the young woman.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.970
Who, as it turns out,
was the daughter

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.230
of a detective at the
107th Precinct.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.970
That was the headquarters
of operational Mega,

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:41.010
which was his, the
task force for him.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:45.110 position:56%
You know, we just got really scared.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.990
And people started
to do crazy things.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.650
There was a hotline set up.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.940
So, the hotline was always
clogged with people saying

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.560
"I think it's my brother.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.860
It's my father.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.880
I'm sure it's my sixth-grade
teacher."

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.480
You know, like all of this stuff.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.740
Everybody throwing
people under the bus.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.130
And, of course, every
headline was this.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.430
So, we were panicked.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.570
Interestingly, this also
happened that same year.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.450
Yeah. New York was broke, so
they hired a marketing firm,

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.500
and they designed that campaign.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.800
You know it.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.210
[sings] I love New York.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.370
And it had all the Broadway
people dancing into the camera.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.790
I love New York.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.940
And New Yorkers were
like, are you crazy?

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.240
We don't love New York.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.950
We want to get out of New York.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.530
This is a sham.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.740
And the irony is that this
was one of the most successful

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.980
and long-lasting marketing
campaigns ever launched.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:43.410
And it came at a time when
the city was imploding.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.400
So, all of that was cooking.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.530
Let me just see what I have.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:54.110
All of that was cooking, and
the temperature was rising.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.520
And in July, we had a heat wave.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:01.350
A heat wave is a horrible
thing in brick building

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.040
that have no air-conditioning.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.900
So, it was 98 degrees,
then it was 101 degrees,

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.200
then it was 105 degrees.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.440
It just ticked up and ticked up.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.970
And New Yorkers, even
on the best day,

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:16.290
are a little cranky
sometimes, right?

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.440
So, you can imagine, in the
heat, and with the fear,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.800
and Son of Sam is still out.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.460
And then, that summer night
in July, a storm happens.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.890
A lightning strike.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:31.590
And the entire city goes dark.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:36.190
Manhattan, Brooklyn,
Bronx, the Queens.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.490
All of it.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.790
Not a single light.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.590
Now, let me tell you something.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.560
If you live in a small
town in the woods,

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.910
you're used to complete darkness.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.800
Where you do this,
and you see nothing.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.750
But there's no New
Yorker that's used

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.820
to complete silence
or complete darkness.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.380
It doesn't actually exist
naturally in New York City.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.250
There's always the
lights of Broadway,

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.460
the streetlights, everything.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:11.960
Gone. So, what happens
to a city that's broke,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.820
that has enormous crime.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.580
That has fear.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:22.170
Just in every part of itself,
when it suddenly goes dark.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.160
I'm tell you what happened
this time.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.960
Everybody went into
the streets looting.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.260
And I mean everybody.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.410
All kinds of people, and all kinds
of neighborhoods were looting.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.150
So, there were no alarms
on the stores, right?

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.450
So, you could break.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.230
And if it wasn't nailed
down, people took it.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.310
Everything from diapers
to groceries.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:45.950 position:56%
My personal favorite in the research
was people driving off new cars

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.250
from the lot.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.320
They just drove through
the plate glass window.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.830
And took the car, because
who was going to stop you?

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.020
It was a night of craziness, right?

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.750
And so, fires were set.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:04.290
Because that year, arson
was the crime of the day.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:07.520
So, I think it was like
1000 fires was set.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.960
This is the scene of a hospital
that night, and you can see,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.190 position:56%
people are getting hurt by shattered
glass, and everything else.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.680
Yeah. 1000 fires were reported.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.070
3700 people were arrested.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:26.740
And, in total, it was $
300 million in damages.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.940
After that event, I mean,
I think the city just had

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.710
to do so much soul-searching.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:37.910
So, I'm here to tell you
that I was 13 that summer.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.060
That year.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:46.660
And all of that went inside.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.960
And as young writers, you know,
or maybe you don't know, just yet,

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.550
that everything you live on
a daily basis comes inside

00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.120
and has the potential
to become a work

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.930
of art inside you,
or a book inside you.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.840
And I never did forget that year.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.690
How afraid I was.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.590
How scary the city was.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:16.430
And how hard it was to be young,
and just happy, against a backdrop

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.780
of stuff that was truly,
truly scary.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.210
So, I decided, okay.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.480
I'm going to see if can
write this next novel.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.590
I'm going to set it
in 1977 in New York.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.320
It's like, what's the story?

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.300 position:56%
It's impossible to pick, like, which
thing I was going to write about.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.040
So, I would come to
the paper sometimes,

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.340
and I would start writing.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.640
It was more feminist.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.930
And then sometimes I would write
mostly about the Son of Sam things.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.910
And then, I kept getting lost.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:51.260
And, a couple of things
came forward.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.240
The first thing was that I didn't
want to used Son of Sam murders

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.670
in a way that was insensitive
to the families

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:03.610
of these young people
who were gunned down.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:08.540
They still have people who think of
them, and love them, and miss them.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.730
And I didn't want to
make it entertainment.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.040
So, that was one consideration.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.850
Toning that down, making it scary,
but not making it the focus.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:24.520
And then, my editor
said to me, listen.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.960
If you make it the
story of the girl.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.670
I always write with a
strong girl main character.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.410
If you make it the
story of the girl,

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:38.320
and everything else is her world,
whatever is true for her is true.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.620
It's the story.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.880
So, stay focused on her.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.420
So, I made Nora Lopez,
who's 17 that year.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.370
And she's falling in love.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:54.070
Or wants to, or wants to date
this person who's asking her out.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:57.190
But she's scared to
death to be in a car

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:01.290
with this guy virtually anywhere.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:08.170
But in addition, as I was getting
to know Nora, as I was writing her,

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.260
I realized that Nora had
some secrets of her own.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:17.880 position:56%
And that there was violence outside,
but there was also violence inside.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.760
And that's when things got tricky.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.370
Because the story is really

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:26.110
about something called
juvenile domestic violence.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:30.470
So, when we think about
violent homes, we often think

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:34.510
that it's the adult being
violent to the child.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.320
That's usually how
it works, actually.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.340
But, not always.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.520
Sometimes we have violent children.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.120
Sometimes a brother
is really violent,

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.770 position:56%
or a sister is really violent to the
other siblings, or to the parents.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:57.530
The thing about that is that
people tend to keep that secret.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.930
Because there's shame
involved in it.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:05.010 position:56%
Parents don't like to talk about it,
because they feel like, you know,

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:09.230
they have no control over their
children, or what does this say

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:12.210
about their parenting
skills, et cetera.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.810
Kids doesn't like to talk about it,

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.320
because they're afraid
of their siblings.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.490
Right? And so, it's shrouded
in sort of this secrecy.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:25.020
And then, in Latino families,
because I'm often writing

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.140
about families that are
from other countries,

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.230
and people speak different
languages, and so on.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.540
There was some really hard things.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:38.150
Like, mental health is a hard
thing to have, like, to pay for.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.040
The medicine, the therapy.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:45.020
All of those things, if you
don't have the money to do so.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.110
Mental health services
are hard to access

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:53.230
if you can't find a psychiatrist
that speaks the same language.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.840
Or who understands, like,
the nuances of your culture.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:03.490
Right? So, I had to throw
all of that at Nora.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:06.880
To really figure out
what she was going to do,

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.000
about violence outside
and violence inside.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.200
So, the interesting part, as
I was writing this, some days,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.510
I was saying this to myself.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.750
And I said it same thing
when I was writing The Girl

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.050
Who Could Silence The Wind.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:23.200
When I got to that part
that we can't discuss yet.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.000
I said, why would I do
this to young people?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.230
Why am I going to write this
just terribly sad, scary thing?

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:33.530
Don't read this aloud.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.830
Like, that kind of thing.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.310
Why would I do this?

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:40.890
And so, I gave that
a lot of thought.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:45.960
And I started to think
about, what is it about 1977

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.590
that has anything to do with you?

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.920
In 2016? Like, who cares.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.010
I wonder if I have
the picture of, yeah.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.320
I mean, do you really
want to go back to this?

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.620
I don't know.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.430
How do you make this cool?

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.940
So, yeah. I know.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.430
I know. The shoes are,
in particular.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:05.740
They're really something.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.780
But, I kept wrestling with that.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.220
Like, why would somebody
your age care?

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:19.290 position:56%
And then, I started to close my eyes
and think about your day, every day.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:25.680
And I thought to myself,
well, when I was 13,

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.750
I never had to do a sniper drill.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:33.580
When I was 13, I never thought

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:39.810
that somebody could become
dangerous in my own school.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:43.570
When I was 13, I didn't worry

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.670
if somebody had packed something
very dangerous in a backpack,

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:52.060
to hurt us at a bus
stop, or here or there.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:58.290
So, there was some, some of
that random violence of then,

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:02.690
I think you know exactly
what that feels like now.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.450
And somehow, it becomes
a part of your wallpaper.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.460
It doesn't stop you from
getting up and going to school.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.060
It doesn't stop you from
laughing in the lunchroom.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.100
It doesn't stop you from
having friends and going out.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.760
And yet, it's part
of your wallpaper.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.290
So, you know, I saw
commonalities there.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.460
And then, certainly in the
70s, unfortunately, you know,

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.350
drugs was a huge part of
the whole disco scene.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:35.250
And drugs continued
to be a big problem

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.350
in all of our communities now.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:42.220
So, I did see, like
there were through lines,

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.760
from one period of
time to the other.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.320
So, that's how I wrote this book.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.320
I just, I kept my focus on Nora.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.290
I did historical research
like crazy.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:30:00.550
I was next door, in fact, at
the James Madison Library,

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:04.640
that building, looking
for, because I couldn't --

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.540
not every library has every
old newspaper and magazine.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.580
You have to go hunting, right?

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.410
So, I went all over where I
live now, in Richmond, Virginia.

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:19.370
And I couldn't find, like, the
Daily News, the New York Post.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:20.830
They didn't have those.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:24.010
So, I had to train up here, two
hours, and sit in the microfiche,

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:25.310
[ Imitates buzzing ]

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:29.310
You know, with that silly machine,
trying to figure it all out.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:33.120
And what I decided to do was
to scare myself all over again.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.330
So, I sat down, and I started
reading the newspaper every day,

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.630
basically, right?

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:44.290
In live time, to see what
the story would feel like.

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:45.590
Here's the amazing part.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:49.600
Like, in some days, I
was like, but it's him.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.900
You know, like you're frustrated,

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.600
because you know what
people don't know yet.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.600 position:56%
And you're like, it's him, it's him.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.900
Don't go there.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.580
And you're so worried about
what's going to happen,

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:04.620
and you know it's going to happen.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.380
And then, I felt terrified,
all over again.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.040
I felt really nervous, especially
when David Berkowicz began all

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.950
that letter-writing campaign.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:18.700
And you really got a glimpse
into his mindset, at that time.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.000
That's always a scary place.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.820
I want to tell you,
he's still alive.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:27.170
He's serving his life sentences,
and he's in upstate New York,

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:31.000
where he is a model
prisoner, they say.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.570
So, it's, I even found
footage of him in recent years.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.720
He looks like an old guy that
you'd get into the elevator with.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.020
I'm not kidding.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.590
It's really kind of creepy.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.390
But, here he was, this monster guy.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:51.460
The monster of our imagination,
who was in effect a post guy.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.060
A Post Office guy.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.170
Who was doing all of this.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:32:00.630
So, anyway, that's, that's how
I grappled with the big story.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.520
But, I have, I think you
guys have arcs, maybe?

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.170
So, you have arcs.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.040
And do you know what arcs are?

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.280
Okay. So, as I write a
book, it goes in stages.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.300
I start with a manuscript.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:19.360
And the book takes about
two years to produce.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.460
Right? From the time
that you give it

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:23.090
to your editor, and
they agree to that.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.480
It has to get designed, they
have to find the cover person

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.250
who types it, all of that.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:31.010
About six months before a
book is going to come out,

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:35.040
they need these things called
at advance reader copies.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.310
ARCs. And they send them to
all the newspapers and stuff,

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.840
so that reviewers can review it.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:44.170
It's not like the final
book, though.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.160
You have to know that there
are many things it this

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:51.300 position:56%
that are a little different from the
final book, that I did on purpose.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.840
You know, like I, when I
was reading this, I said no.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.480
I don't want her to use that word.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.780
I want him.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.100
Or, I want to add this scene.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:03.040
So, there are things that are in
the arc that are still incorrect.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.690
Because they do it
from my manuscript,

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:09.960
from like the first pass,
after the copy editor sees it.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.200
So, it's not in it's final form.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:17.610
But, you still do get a
general idea of the book.

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:21.260
So, I'm imagining you may have
some questions about writing,

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.590
even though it's late in the day,

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.950
and you have been probably
up since 7 a.m..

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:30.430
I'm guessing you have
some questions?

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.740
Yes? Ask away.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.440
We have a mic, so that you
can -- I'll hold it up to you.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.320
You can ask me anything you like.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.430
Disco. Do I dance?

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:46.450
&gt;&gt; Question: You said you wrote
your book at least 10 to 7 times.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:47.840
So, what advice could you give

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.640
to someone who's starting
to write a new book?

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.940
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.060
I think, here's the thing.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:58.500
Perseverance is a word
that you're going to have

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.260
to like truly keep in your pocket.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:07.920
Because in publishing, you're
going to be told no a lot more

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.720
than you're going to be told yes.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:16.020
So, early on, at your age, the most
important thing is to read widely.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.970
Read, read, read for
the things that,

00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:22.320
the kind of book that
you want to write.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.340
For the topics, the
genre that you're into.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.640
If it's horror.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:27.940
If it's romance.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.240
If it's literary fiction.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.540
Whatever it is.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:34.200
But read widely, so you
develop an ear for the story,

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:39.530
and you get a sense of what
a story line looks like.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.110
If you have any chance
to take writing classes.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:44.080
Creative writing classes
in middle school

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.600
and higher school and
college, do that.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.520
Sign up for your paper.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.720
The best training I ever
got as a fiction writer was

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.000
when I started as a journalist.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.030
Because I had this crusty editor,

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.420
who would like read
the first paragraph

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.570
that I wrote, and he'd say this.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:02.870
This is terrible.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.280
Nobody's going to read after this.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.390
And he'd like throw it back at
me, and I was like [whimpering].

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:08.830
You know, it was a terrible thing.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:11.370
And you want to just
like nurse your wounds,

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:14.130
but in writing, you
need crocodile skin.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.430
You need crocodile skin.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:23.090 position:56%
You need to be able to write as an
artist for awhile, and then you need

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:26.570
to step back from it, and be
able to say, you're right.

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:29.030
Those first 30 pages, they stink.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:31.270
Or, I'm going to change
that last chapter.

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:33.090
I'm going to do this or that.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.350
And that can hurt.

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:37.950
You know? You really want things.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:41.380
In fact, if you go on my blog,
a couple of weeks ago, I think,

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.920
I put up what the original
beginning was to this novel.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.500
It's not what's in the book.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:52.500
Originally, I started the novel
in January, because in January,

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:57.150
Freddie Prinz Sr, not
Junior, killed himself.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.500
I loved Freddie Prinz.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.800
As a Latina girl in
Queens, here he was,

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.060
this Puerto Rican guy
playing a Mexican.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.440
In tight jeans and good
hair and puppy dog eyes.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.730
I was like madly in love
with my television screen.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:14.040
Freddie Prinz was everything.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.360
And then, sadly, Freddie
Prinz committed suicide.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.660
It was horrible.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.980
The other thing that was
happening that winter

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.810
with that the temperature dropped.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.110
It was frigid.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.410
It was like zero.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:29.640
And I lived in a building where
the super, because of gas shortages

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.350
and things like that, the
super would lower the heat.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:35.930
And sometimes you wouldn't
have heat or hot water.

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:39.670
And I'd have to boil water to
wash my face, to get to school.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.190
You know, the whole rigamarole.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.670
It's just a pain.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:46.670
So, I wanted to start there.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:51.040
Because, like, there was something
about Freddie Prinz' death

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.850
that felt so devastating.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:58.790 position:56%
And then, it was like the thing that
started us on this horrible slide

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.520
for the rest of the year.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.310
Okay, so my editor,
she's really smart.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:06.420
She's 30 or so, something young.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.560
And her name's Kate.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.100
And Kate knows just
how to deal with me.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.950
So, she doesn't read the
manuscript and say, yeah,

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:17.950
that's a stinky beginning -- like
my other editor would have done.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.250
Nobody's gonna read this.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:20.550
And give it to me.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:24.740
She ignores it for a while, and
we work on all the other stuff.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.350
And then, later, way
later, almost at the end

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.530
of the process, she
says, you know, Meg?

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.230
I feel like we should
start in the spring.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:36.100
Just keep it spring to summer.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.570
Because it's just too much time.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:39.870
There's just too much going on.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.230
It gets really diffused.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:44.200
I think you should
start it in March.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.310
And somehow, by then,
I could hear it.

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:50.590 position:56%
If she had said that to me in the
beginning, when I was just drafting,

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:55.000
when I was just getting the good
ideas, I would have felt offensive.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.020
I would have said no, I'm
not going to change it.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.320
I like my beginning.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.620
It's a perfect beginning.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:00.920
Freddie Prinz.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.170
You know, like I would have
had all these defensive things.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:05.440
But, like, there's a time.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.930
I think Kate very wisely knows that
there's a time to let something

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.980
that kind of stinks, stay there.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.730
Because it's the door
into the story.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:21.340
And sometimes you come in through
the back door, or the side door.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.450
Like, not the right door.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.370
But you get in.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:31.530
You figure out the story, and
then you can back out and edit it,

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.090
and make it what you need.

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:39.160
So, don't be afraid of your lousy
first attempts, is what I'm saying.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.530
Because that's all they are.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:44.400
It's your way in, to
see what's there.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.930
Is there a story here
I want to tell?

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:48.430
And everything is changeable.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.600
Everything is up for change.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:53.070
So, that's my advice.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.370
Boy, is that long.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:55.690
I'm so sorry.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:59.190
But read. Read, would
definitely be one.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:01.020
Okay. Other questions?

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.320
You pick. You pick.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.780
Don't put me on the hot seat.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.140
You pick.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.760
&gt;&gt; Question: When did you know
you wanted to be an author?

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.710
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Well,
I was always, I was,

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:15.560
I liked writing, even
when I was little.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.350
So, even in elementary school,
in third grade and fifth grade,

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:22.640
like I was the kid who wanted to
do the short story, or the essay.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.490
Like, I was not the kid
who'd get the piece of paper

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.840
and go [sobs], and start crying.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.060
Right? I did that in math, right?

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.250
If you said to me, and now it's
time to talk about sets, or,

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.900
you know, congruent angles.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.200
I would burst into tears.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.500
But not for essays.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.800
I loved them.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.530
So, there with that.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:45.570
But, I tried very hard not to
be a writer for a long time.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:49.340
Because my mother had come
-- here's another long story.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.040
I am so sorry about these answers.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.210
All right, my mother had
come from Cuba in 1962.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.240
It's a long answer, sister.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.540
All right.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.990
And, as an immigrant,
there was no money.

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.280
There was no language.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.060
There was no safety net under us.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:09.210
So, my mother took
a job in a factory.

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:10.870
And she worked for minimum wage,

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:14.800
which at that time
was $ 3.65 an hour.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.340
My mother worked in that factory
for 30 years, until she retired,

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:25.050 position:56%
and my mother retired still
earning minimum wage at the factory.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:30.650
And what she wanted, more than
anything for me, and for my sister,

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:35.410
with that we would be educated
women, and that we wouldn't have

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:39.960
to work for minimum wage
in a factory for 30 years.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:43.300
So, she wanted us to have
jobs that had health benefits,

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:48.870
and like practical, practical
things, to make our life easier.

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:51.740
So we wouldn't have to always
be worried about money.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.950
The way we were.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.510
Always wondering how we were
going the make the rent.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:59.640
Always worried if we got sick, how
we were going to get to the doctor.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.490
Like, those are real things, right?

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.810
Unfortunately for my mother,

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:10.980
my sister's an artist,
and I am a writer.

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.660
We couldn't do what
she wanted us to do.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:15.210
It was terrible for her.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:17.430
I think she really worried.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:19.840
So, I was a teacher for a while.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.920
I loved teaching.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.520
I taught little kids, from
third grade all the way

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.380
to high school kids,
and I loved them all.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:32.640
The first year I was a teacher
in New York City public schools,

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.040
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.700
But, New York City had
a shortage of teachers.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.400
And so, if you promised to
take 15 credits in education,

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.850
they gave you the keys and the roll
book, and they said have at it.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:47.230
You know? And they gave me 36 kids.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.100
And I'm like, they're crazy.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.440
So, the first month of
school, I think I didn't eat.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.740
I cried every night.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.300
I was a mess.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.440
And my kids mostly came from
the Dominican Republic, many,

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.090
many with no English
skills whatsoever.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:04.930
Because I didn't know what I was
doing, I did all the right things

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:07.240
and the wrong things mixed up.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.610
So, I went to their house
before school started.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:10.910
I walked the neighborhood.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.080
I wasn't afraid of the
neighborhood, because I grew up in

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.380
that neighborhood, right?

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.680
So, I want.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.980
Hola, que tal?

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.280
Soy la maestra.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.580
Let's have a cafe.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.880
So, what's going on?

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.680
So, and meet the whole family,
and just hang with them.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.120
I took kids to baseball.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.310 position:56%
I took kids out to lunch, for pizza.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:29.680
If they were good that week.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.580
You could be arrested for
that stuff today, right?

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.130
So, that was how I
started, as a teacher.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:39.630
Then I tried to be a
journalist for a while.

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:42.760
I wrote public relations things.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.210
Development, meaning raising
money for an organize.

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:48.410
And I was pretty good
at most of that stuff.

00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:51.880
But I was not happy
doing that stuff.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.120
I really wanted to be a writer.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:00.350
So, when I turned 40,
I went into my boss.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:04.240
I was working at a school
for kids with disabilities.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:09.030
And I was having a bad day, and
I think I just lost my mind.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:12.570
And I got up, and I went to the
principal, and I said, Candace,

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:16.530
I'm going to be quitting today.

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:19.700
I'm going to go write a novel.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.340
That's what she did.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:22.780
She went huh.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.840
Like, she just said
okay, and backed away.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.830
Because that's how we
are with artists, right?

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:32.730
It's hard to think of
artists as being able to --
