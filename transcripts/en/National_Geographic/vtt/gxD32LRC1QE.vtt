00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.069
(light ethereal music)

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.106 align:start size:88% position:13%
We are the
detectives of the past.

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:09.476
And we have to figure
out what happened.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.746 align:start size:97% position:3%
That is what is fascinating
about archaeology.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:16.149 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Peru is super special
archaeologically

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.618 line:0%
because this is one of the
cradles of civilization.

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:22.589 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's where civilization
actually arose from nothing.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.728 align:start size:94% position:6%
A little over 100
years ago, Hiram Bingham

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:32.631 align:start size:88% position:13%
went to Peru and relying
on local knowledge

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:36.803
found this crumbling city in
the middle of the rainforest.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:42.075
At the time, he used state of
the art photography equipment

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.143
to record what was there.

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:48.547
It was the first scientific
archaeological expedition

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:51.250
that National Geographic funded.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.185 line:0%
And, in some ways,

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:55.121 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
it helped to launch our
modern age of archaeology.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.526
So the idea of applying new
state of the art technology

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:03.195
to map sites in Peru feels
like a natural extension

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:05.698
of what Hiram Bingham
did over 100 years ago.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.837 align:start size:97% position:3%
One of the dreams of
archaeology has always been

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.439
to look from above.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:17.076 align:start size:97% position:3%
As drones became available,
five or six years ago,

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.545
archaeologists jumped
at this opportunity.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.348
Finally, we can fly
above our excavations

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.183 align:start size:88% position:13%
and take a picture
that reveals everything

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:25.785
that we have been
seeing from below.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:32.057 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now, if you simply go up,
up, up, into space

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:34.894 align:start size:97% position:3%
and look down with a camera,
you can at the same time

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:38.531 align:start size:88% position:13%
look at not one square mile,
but many square miles.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.866 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then you can focus
on specific items

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.269
that you think are important.

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:47.106
Space archaeology is the study

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:50.042
and the use of satellite images

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:53.312 align:start size:88% position:13%
for mapping ancient
archaeological features

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:54.813
and environmental features

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:59.252 align:start size:97% position:3%
by looking at different
parts of the light spectrum.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:01.887
We see subtle changes
on the earth's surface

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:04.257
caused by what's buried beneath.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.724 align:start size:84% position:16%
And what satellites
help us to do

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:09.295
is pinpoint areas and we
know to within a few meters

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:13.466
exactly where something is
from thousands of miles away.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:15.902
We're the generation
with all the tools

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.237
and all the technologies
to be able to map sites

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:19.472
and protect them.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.740
And, using these
new technologies,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.842
we have a real chance
to protect and preserve

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:26.779 align:start size:84% position:16%
these sites for
future generations.
