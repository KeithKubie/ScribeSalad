00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.600
The only genotype that this grandfather could

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.650
be, is actually the heterozygous genotype, plus minus.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.110
Now what's the reasoning behind this? Well

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.310
we know, right off the bat, that because

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.850
it's a dominant trait, and he's affected,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.270
that he can't be homozygous recessive, the minus

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.420
minus. Because this scenario is the normal height

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.240
or the unaffected individual. We know he's affected,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.530
so he can't be that, but now the question

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.330
is we know he has at least one achondroplasia

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.350
allele, one of the plus alleles, but how do

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.640
we know if he has one or two, if he's

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.540
homozygous or heterozygous? And for that answer we're going to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.930
look at his children. specific in the all the factors

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.540
is shown yes to reachout the two factors one

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.730
another factorsif he is in fact come this side dominate

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.520
for the cause we would expect all the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.070
children is infact one of these Dominant alleles. But

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.930
the fact that his son is unaffected means

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.780
that his son did not get a dominant allele.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.810
We know that the mother, obviously didn't give

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.080
him a dominant allele. And the father couldn't have

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.200
given him a dominant allele because he's unaffected.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.080
This must mean that he has two unaffected alleles.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.270
And one of them came from the

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.890
father, which means the father must be heterozygous.
