00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay. Does someone have another question?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Yes. We are real people. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Graham says asking a live question produced a weird effect

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as by now we're very used to hearing recorded video.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We don't make mistakes on video.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I can also show you my arm is really not transparent.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I have to eat a lot of rice noodles to make it transparent for the recordings,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but normally it's not.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You were saying you had a question--Graham.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We can click on someone?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Well, you just have their name and you can see right here.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Go ahead, Graham.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Oh no, I said not a question.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Okay. Who has a question? &gt;&gt;I have a question.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Go ahead. John. Where are you from John? &gt;&gt;I'm from New York.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Hi, John from New York. What's the question.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It seems to me that all of the homework problems--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I mean, do they all count for equal points even though some of them are much harder than others.?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is very true.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They question is does each homework question count the same 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
even though there's a big difference in how hard the questions are?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is the way things are now that every question counts for 1 point,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and we don't have a way to give partial credit.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This is definitely a limitation of our grading system that we would--

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
there are questions that definitely involve a lot more work than others, 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and there are questions that we would like to be able to give partial credit for.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
That's probably something we'll be able to do in future offerings of the course.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
At this point that's a limitation of the way grading works.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Every question is worth the same amount of points.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I encourage people not to get too caught up in the grading.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So definitely my hope is that for the harder questions that you feel like

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 you've accomplished something and learned a lot by doing it

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
even if it's only worth 1 point, or even worse, if it's worth 1 point,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but because of some quirk in the grading system or you forget to remove a stray print or something,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
you don't get that point, try not to get too upset and frustrated by that.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The goal of the homeworks is really for you to learn from that.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Hopefully you feel that you've accomplished something and even if you didn't get the point 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because the way it was graded, you know that you actually were on the right track

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and understood the things that we wanted you to get out of that question.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Expanding on that question, since I did just kind of start today,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I was wondering if the due dates matters?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You should repeat that. &gt;&gt;The question is since Michelle is starting late if the due dates matter.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
They do in the sense of the grades 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that you get for the homework are based on the answers that you submit before the due date.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They don't matter other than that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You can do the homeworks after the deadline.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
If you submit them after the deadline, you see right away whether the answer is correct.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You can get all the same learning benefit out of the homeworks.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Also, you can still get a perfect score in the class even if you missed the homeworks,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
both because one of the ways of grading now is just counting the exam.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Students who join the class late aren't able to get credit for the early homeworks, 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
but if they learn the material and do well on the exam

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
you still have a chance to get a perfect score in the class.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I hope students do value the grades they get on the homeworks, 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
but definitely if you are starting the class late, you can still do the homeworks,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
still learn from them, and still have a chance to get a perfect score in the class.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Part of the reason to do that is it's a really good just keeping everyone together.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
It'd be hard to hold a session like this if we had half our students on Unit 4

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and a third on Unit 1, and another third on another unit.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
That's a good point that there are online classes you can do complete at your own pace.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
For many people that works well.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
For the other people without having the pressure of a deadline and the community experience 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
of going through a course at the same time and being able to do something like we're doing now

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
with live office hours, you really miss that experience, 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and it's much harder to keep up with the course if you don't have deadlines.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But we don't want people to feel like they'll drop out of the course 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
because you missed 1 deadline because you weren't able to get the grade on that homework.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Definitely, the deadlines, if they're helpful for you then take the deadline seriously,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
but it's certainly not required to take the deadlines that seriously. &gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
There's a text question about using third-party libraries for web development.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Okay, so this is a text question for me.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000
This is also a good point, that our goal in this class is to teach computer science concepts,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
using the goal of building a search engine as a vehicle for doing that.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
If your real goal was just to build the best search engine you could

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
then you'd be much better off using existing libraries and putting them together

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
rather than learning how to build your own extracting a links function, say.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
What we did in Unit 1.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
It's definitely a trade-off, and the trade off we're making here is to learn computer science concepts.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
If your goal was to just build a search engine as quickly as you could, 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the way we're doing it in class would not be the best way to do that.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Someone asks, "Are there plans to robots.txt?"

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
This is a good question.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 I hope you saw the interview with Anna Patterson at the end of Unit 3

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
where she talks about how important it is to be polite in a real web crawler.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Someone did ask on the forums what it means to be "polite."

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
How can a computer be polite to another computer.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Yes, and politeness is--I'm glad that Anna used the word "polite"

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
because it's not the normal word people would use,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
but it's actually a good way to think about it that just like when people interact

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
you're not supposed to interrupt people or yell at them all the time. That's impolite to do that.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
When computer interact with other computers, they're not people getting offended in the same way.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
But if you do the kinds of things that are rude when people do them

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
they cause problems for the other computers.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So if you're sending requests as fast as you can at the same server

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and trying to crawl that entire server and sending millions of requests to it

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that's really rude. That's taking resources away from the server.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It costs money. 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It's costing the server operator money, and it's preventing people that actually want to get

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
the content because they're looking for that page from getting it.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
To be a good citizen on the web, if you're writing a web crawler, you have to follow rules

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and limit the resources that you take from the servers that you're crawling.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Robots.text is a file that servers can put on the server that says, 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
"Here's rules about how you should crawl this server."

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
It might give a rate limit. It might say, "Don't crawl these pages."

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
It might say how often can you request-- &gt;&gt;Sometimes that's for privacy reasons.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Yeah, it could be for privacy. It could be for resource us.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It could be there are pages on the site that they don't want to end up in an index.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
A well-behaved web crawler will always check this before requesting any other pages from the site.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
For the crawler that we built in this class, we're not doing that, 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and the reason we're not doing that is our goal is to make things as simple as possible

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and to understand as much computer science.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
The work of reading the robots.txt file, understanding what's in it,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
regulating the crawler, well, that would be hundreds of lines of code.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
The entire web crawler by the very end of this class will be less than 70 lines of code. &gt;&gt;70?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Our goal is to really make it so you understand everything that's going on in core web crawler,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and the search engine is all included in the 70 lines,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
but not need to get into a lot of the details that if you were building 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
a real web crawler it'd be important to get into.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
The good part of this is at least if you're running the code through our server,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
you don't have to worry about politeness, because we're not actually allowing any of 

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
the programs you submit to make arbitrary web requests.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
All the reponses that you get are just for the test pages that we have cached the results for at our server.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
When you submit code, even if it used get_page to request pages,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
it's not actually sending out real web requests, so it's being polite. &gt;&gt;Yes.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Did we want take--does someone have a question they want to ask?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Yeah, does someone have a question whose is a non-typing question? &gt;&gt;Go for it.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
No one. &gt;&gt;I have one.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Good. Well, we have another typed one.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
We got what did the--that's an easy one.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Rishad wants to know where the name "Udacity" come from.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
It has a couple different possibilities.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The most obvious is there is a word "audacity," which means boldness, daring,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and we removed the "a" from audacity to get Udacity.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
We like it starting with a U because that sounds like a university.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
The "-city" sort of also sounds like university, so that's where the name came from.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
I know some people hate, some people like it. It's the name we're going to use.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I hope everyone comes to like it.
