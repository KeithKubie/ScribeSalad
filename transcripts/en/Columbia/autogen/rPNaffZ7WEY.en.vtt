recently our government had a discussion

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:35.890
recently our government had a discussion
 

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:39.730
recently our government had a discussion
to decrease this rate but every year we

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:39.740
to decrease this rate but every year we
 

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.840
to decrease this rate but every year we
have discussions never happened for this

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:43.850
have discussions never happened for this
 

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.480
have discussions never happened for this
part already you are changing and now we

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:46.490
part already you are changing and now we
 

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:48.640
part already you are changing and now we
have a quite rapid to access from

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:48.650
have a quite rapid to access from
 

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:51.760
have a quite rapid to access from
airport to city centre now so maybe next

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:51.770
airport to city centre now so maybe next
 

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:55.180
airport to city centre now so maybe next
year this part will be not weak want a

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:55.190
year this part will be not weak want a
 

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.420
year this part will be not weak want a
look more in Tokyo you'll be changing

00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:57.430
look more in Tokyo you'll be changing
 

00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:04.450
look more in Tokyo you'll be changing
and this is just a kind of crutch you to

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:04.460
and this is just a kind of crutch you to
 

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:08.230
and this is just a kind of crutch you to
expression for this year's GPC I so

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240
expression for this year's GPC I so
 

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.180
expression for this year's GPC I so
later one taco will explain more about

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:10.190
later one taco will explain more about
 

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:13.240

inner city ranking pouring thank you

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:13.250
inner city ranking pouring thank you
 

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:21.160
inner city ranking pouring thank you
very much

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:21.170
 

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:24.140
okay thank you professor Cho so I like

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:24.150
okay thank you professor Cho so I like
 

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:28.130
okay thank you professor Cho so I like
to continue so as a professor said this

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140
to continue so as a professor said this
 

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.800
to continue so as a professor said this
year we initiated the new research for

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:30.810
year we initiated the new research for
 

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:33.710
year we initiated the new research for
global power in Earth's the index very

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720
global power in Earth's the index very
 

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.860
global power in Earth's the index very
similar to the GPC I but a bit different

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:36.870
similar to the GPC I but a bit different
 

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:42.620
similar to the GPC I but a bit different
so on so to do that so why we do that is

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:42.630
so on so to do that so why we do that is
 

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.650
so on so to do that so why we do that is
because we thought the city we are

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:45.660
because we thought the city we are
 

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.050
because we thought the city we are
measuring base by the city's power and

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060
measuring base by the city's power and
 

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.800
measuring base by the city's power and
but those power could be generated in

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:51.810
but those power could be generated in
 

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.780
but those power could be generated in
the very heart of the city is what we

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:53.790
the very heart of the city is what we
 

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:56.870
the very heart of the city is what we
expected like the Manhattan is maybe

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880
expected like the Manhattan is maybe
 

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.060
expected like the Manhattan is maybe
represent the most of the power of New

00:36:59.060 --> 00:36:59.070
represent the most of the power of New
 

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:02.360
represent the most of the power of New
York so and first are we selected the

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:02.370
York so and first are we selected the
 

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:05.240
York so and first are we selected the
cities because we are going to look up

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:05.250
cities because we are going to look up
 

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.280
cities because we are going to look up
the very deep deeper aspects to the city

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:07.290
the very deep deeper aspects to the city
 

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.430
the very deep deeper aspects to the city
so we cannot do all those 35 6 cities so

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440
so we cannot do all those 35 6 cities so
 

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.220
so we cannot do all those 35 6 cities so
we selected our top cities like New York

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:13.230
we selected our top cities like New York
 

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:17.870
we selected our top cities like New York
and London Paris and then a gem our top

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880
and London Paris and then a gem our top
 

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.570
and London Paris and then a gem our top
cities and Tokyo Singapore Hong Kong and

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:20.580
cities and Tokyo Singapore Hong Kong and
 

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.760
cities and Tokyo Singapore Hong Kong and
soul and Shanghai so this chart

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:24.770
soul and Shanghai so this chart
 

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:29.330
soul and Shanghai so this chart
represents the GPC is a result but so

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:29.340
represents the GPC is a result but so
 

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.480
represents the GPC is a result but so
this access the score and this axis

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:32.490
this access the score and this axis
 

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:35.840
this access the score and this axis
represents the population of each cities

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:35.850
represents the population of each cities
 

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:39.890
represents the population of each cities
so you can see these top cities they are

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900
so you can see these top cities they are
 

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.330
so you can see these top cities they are
not always are saying our population see

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:44.340
not always are saying our population see
 

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.310
not always are saying our population see
the Paris is very small but still has a

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320
the Paris is very small but still has a
 

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.990
the Paris is very small but still has a
very high score vs are these Chinese

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000
very high score vs are these Chinese
 

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.380
very high score vs are these Chinese
huge cities is a bunch of populations

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:54.390
huge cities is a bunch of populations
 

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:57.010
huge cities is a bunch of populations
they are still in the lower score and

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:57.020
they are still in the lower score and
 

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.620
they are still in the lower score and
also this the other one this one this

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:00.630
also this the other one this one this
 

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:05.150
also this the other one this one this
axis is for the area for their cities so

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160
axis is for the area for their cities so
 

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.100
axis is for the area for their cities so
and even like Shanghai evasion they

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:07.110
and even like Shanghai evasion they
 

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:12.230
and even like Shanghai evasion they
cannot fit in this this chart so anyway

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240
cannot fit in this this chart so anyway
 

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.920
cannot fit in this this chart so anyway
so the tiny Paris has a quite big power

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:15.930
so the tiny Paris has a quite big power
 

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.590
so the tiny Paris has a quite big power
so then we focused on the size of Paris

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:18.600
so then we focused on the size of Paris
 

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.210
so then we focused on the size of Paris
could be her

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220
could be her
 

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.440
could be her
some are key to the inner city so this

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:24.450
some are key to the inner city so this
 

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:27.470
some are key to the inner city so this
is a scale comparison for each city so

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480
is a scale comparison for each city so
 

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.410
is a scale comparison for each city so
this is Paris in New York so and this

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.420
this is Paris in New York so and this
 

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:36.980
this is Paris in New York so and this
also the rent and Shanghai then we focus

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:36.990
also the rent and Shanghai then we focus
 

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.470
also the rent and Shanghai then we focus
on the size of Paris which is about ah

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480
on the size of Paris which is about ah
 

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.160
on the size of Paris which is about ah
so this is Paris and this is a map of

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:43.170
so this is Paris and this is a map of
 

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.800
so this is Paris and this is a map of
Paris so this a bounder is a Paris and

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:45.810
Paris so this a bounder is a Paris and
 

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:48.470
Paris so this a bounder is a Paris and
this is actually a five-kilometer radius

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480
this is actually a five-kilometer radius
 

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.880
this is actually a five-kilometer radius
which is about three miles so and so

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:52.890
which is about three miles so and so
 

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.420
which is about three miles so and so
first we try to define this

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:55.430
first we try to define this
 

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:58.970
first we try to define this
five-kilometer radius as a inner city

00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980
five-kilometer radius as a inner city
 

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.540
five-kilometer radius as a inner city
but also a supplementary we are also a

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:02.550
but also a supplementary we are also a
 

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:06.050
but also a supplementary we are also a
defining another five kilometers so five

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.060
defining another five kilometers so five
 

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.140
defining another five kilometers so five
kilometer and tinker meter radius for us

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:09.150
kilometer and tinker meter radius for us
 

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:14.330
kilometer and tinker meter radius for us
as inner city for each city and we

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:14.340
as inner city for each city and we
 

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:18.170
as inner city for each city and we
plotted each landmarks and most of the

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.180
plotted each landmarks and most of the
 

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.750
plotted each landmarks and most of the
landmarks are concentrating of course in

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760
landmarks are concentrating of course in
 

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.270
landmarks are concentrating of course in
within the inner city like this is New

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280
within the inner city like this is New
 

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:28.040
within the inner city like this is New
York is my have done and said London so

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:28.050
York is my have done and said London so
 

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:32.510
York is my have done and said London so
this is a Trafalgar Square and within

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520
this is a Trafalgar Square and within
 

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.260
this is a Trafalgar Square and within
the 10 kilometer you can still see the

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:35.270
the 10 kilometer you can still see the
 

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:39.940
the 10 kilometer you can still see the
Docklands around here so we are mostly

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:39.950
Docklands around here so we are mostly
 

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:43.760
Docklands around here so we are mostly
keeping the major aspects or you know

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:43.770
keeping the major aspects or you know
 

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:47.089
keeping the major aspects or you know
functions within these inner city that

00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:47.099
functions within these inner city that
 

00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:51.320
functions within these inner city that
we define and Tokyo as well so we set

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:51.330
we define and Tokyo as well so we set
 

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:56.410
we define and Tokyo as well so we set
the Center for at Imperial Palace and

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:56.420
the Center for at Imperial Palace and
 

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.020
the Center for at Imperial Palace and
Singapore actually the center is around

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:00.030
Singapore actually the center is around
 

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:03.020
Singapore actually the center is around
the marina bay but we set it at oh ja

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:03.030
the marina bay but we set it at oh ja
 

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:08.120
the marina bay but we set it at oh ja
rule for this time and Hong Kong are for

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:08.130
rule for this time and Hong Kong are for
 

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:10.490
rule for this time and Hong Kong are for
the center the colon team shot see is a

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500
the center the colon team shot see is a
 

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:16.190
the center the colon team shot see is a
center study and install actually the

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200
center study and install actually the
 

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.650
center study and install actually the
city center this is a practical center

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:18.660
city center this is a practical center
 

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.540
city center this is a practical center
now but now it's shifting towards the

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:20.550
now but now it's shifting towards the
 

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.470
now but now it's shifting towards the
south which is the next to the u.s. face

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:23.480
south which is the next to the u.s. face
 

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.980
south which is the next to the u.s. face
and this is Shanghai we set the center

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:27.990
and this is Shanghai we set the center
 

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.730
and this is Shanghai we set the center
of the People's Square

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:29.740
of the People's Square
 

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:34.650
of the People's Square
and then we selected also the indicator

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:34.660
and then we selected also the indicator
 

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:37.500
and then we selected also the indicator
so we cannot apply all the 69 indicators

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:37.510
so we cannot apply all the 69 indicators
 

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.300
so we cannot apply all the 69 indicators
because we want to visualize all the

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:39.310
because we want to visualize all the
 

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:42.630
because we want to visualize all the
indicators in the map so we selected 20s

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640
indicators in the map so we selected 20s
 

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.590
indicators in the map so we selected 20s
from these indicators so and we selected

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:46.600
from these indicators so and we selected
 

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.530
from these indicators so and we selected
so the people it which is a kind a

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:49.540
so the people it which is a kind a
 

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.170
so the people it which is a kind a
density in the city and those are tall

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:52.180
density in the city and those are tall
 

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.960
density in the city and those are tall
buildings and top our company so we

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:54.970
buildings and top our company so we
 

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.900
buildings and top our company so we
named that these as vital property and

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:57.910
named that these as vital property and
 

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:01.590
named that these as vital property and
then for the culture property we

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:01.600
then for the culture property we
 

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.870
then for the culture property we
selected top universities and theatres

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880
selected top universities and theatres
 

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.750

and for the luxury property so we set up

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:19.090
and for the luxury property so we set up
 

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:22.800
and for the luxury property so we set up
five star hotels and top restaurants and

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.010
hospitals and shopping centers green and
water coverage receptivity is as a

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:32.020
water coverage receptivity is as a
 

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.220
water coverage receptivity is as a
amenity property and finally the mobile

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:35.230
amenity property and finally the mobile
 

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:38.160
amenity property and finally the mobile
T property it's conditional subway and

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:38.170
T property it's conditional subway and
 

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.620
T property it's conditional subway and
rail transit and also the highway and

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:40.630
rail transit and also the highway and
 

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.800
rail transit and also the highway and
also international transport

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:42.810
also international transport
 

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.970
also international transport
international transport it does not

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:44.980
international transport it does not
 

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:48.990
international transport it does not
always exist inside inner city but we

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.000
always exist inside inner city but we
 

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.030
always exist inside inner city but we
thought it's very important for the

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040
thought it's very important for the
 

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.060
thought it's very important for the
living in the inner city to get the very

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:54.070
living in the inner city to get the very
 

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:57.480
living in the inner city to get the very
easy access towards the overseas so that

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:57.490
easy access towards the overseas so that
 

00:41:57.490 --> 00:42:01.680
easy access towards the overseas so that
we included this so and let me just go

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:01.690
we included this so and let me just go
 

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.030
we included this so and let me just go
over so this is the first when the

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040
over so this is the first when the
 

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.060
over so this is the first when the
population after this color shows the

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:06.070
population after this color shows the
 

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:08.940
population after this color shows the
density of each city within the inner

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:08.950
density of each city within the inner
 

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:13.530
density of each city within the inner
city so the densest is it's actually

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:13.540
city so the densest is it's actually
 

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:18.510
city so the densest is it's actually
it's about 20 more than five fifty

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.520
it's about 20 more than five fifty
 

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:23.030
it's about 20 more than five fifty
thousand people per square kilometer and

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040
thousand people per square kilometer and
 

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.550
thousand people per square kilometer and
so this is a population within the

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.560
so this is a population within the
 

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.620
so this is a population within the
darker part represents the number of

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:28.630
darker part represents the number of
 

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:31.770
darker part represents the number of
people living within the five geometry

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:31.780
people living within the five geometry
 

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:39.090
people living within the five geometry
and so and this are added this dimension

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:39.100
and so and this are added this dimension
 

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.400
and so and this are added this dimension
is showing the people living in the

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:41.410
is showing the people living in the
 

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:44.670
is showing the people living in the
10-kilometer radius then you can see and

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680
10-kilometer radius then you can see and
 

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:48.210
10-kilometer radius then you can see and
this equals our density so and we found

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:48.220
this equals our density so and we found
 

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.940
this equals our density so and we found
that are we expected Paris could be the

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:50.950
that are we expected Paris could be the
 

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:53.670
that are we expected Paris could be the
most but and especially the inner city

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680
most but and especially the inner city
 

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:56.510
most but and especially the inner city
they have a lot but also a singer

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520
they have a lot but also a singer
 

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.490
they have a lot but also a singer
Shanghai is also they have a lot of

00:42:59.490 --> 00:42:59.500
Shanghai is also they have a lot of
 

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.640
Shanghai is also they have a lot of
people living inside the city in the

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:02.650
people living inside the city in the
 

00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:07.680
people living inside the city in the
inner city and also we found very

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:07.690
inner city and also we found very
 

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.620
inner city and also we found very
interesting aspect that so most of the

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:10.630
interesting aspect that so most of the
 

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.460
interesting aspect that so most of the
city so within the five-kilometer radius

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:13.470
city so within the five-kilometer radius
 

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.200
city so within the five-kilometer radius
has a more density compared to the

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:16.210
has a more density compared to the
 

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:19.020
has a more density compared to the
broader think 20 meter radius but only

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.030
broader think 20 meter radius but only
 

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:22.200
broader think 20 meter radius but only
you see Tokyo has its vice versa so talk

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:22.210
you see Tokyo has its vice versa so talk
 

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.530
you see Tokyo has its vice versa so talk
has more density for the rod larger area

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:25.540
has more density for the rod larger area
 

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:29.310
has more density for the rod larger area
that means a 5-kilometer narrow area has

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:29.320
that means a 5-kilometer narrow area has
 

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:34.740
that means a 5-kilometer narrow area has
more fewer density and this one is about

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:34.750
more fewer density and this one is about
 

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.990
more fewer density and this one is about
the building so we counted all the

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000
the building so we counted all the
 

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.290
the building so we counted all the
building which exceeds a hundred meter

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:40.300
building which exceeds a hundred meter
 

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.500
building which exceeds a hundred meter
high which is about 300 or something

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:43.510
high which is about 300 or something
 

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:46.950
high which is about 300 or something
feat so and of course a London Paris

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960
feat so and of course a London Paris
 

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.960
feat so and of course a London Paris
they don't have so much because of their

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:48.970
they don't have so much because of their
 

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:51.870
they don't have so much because of their
policy but anyhow so we can measure the

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880
policy but anyhow so we can measure the
 

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.950
policy but anyhow so we can measure the
power of the over vitality of the cities

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960
power of the over vitality of the cities
 

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.590
power of the over vitality of the cities
based on this measurement and of course

00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:58.600
based on this measurement and of course
 

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.990
based on this measurement and of course
you can see a lot of concentration in

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000
you can see a lot of concentration in
 

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.940
you can see a lot of concentration in
the Midtown and also the downtown in New

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:02.950
the Midtown and also the downtown in New
 

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:07.230
the Midtown and also the downtown in New
York but also in other cities like Tokyo

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:07.240
York but also in other cities like Tokyo
 

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.080
York but also in other cities like Tokyo
it's more like spreading over make this

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:10.090
it's more like spreading over make this
 

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:14.520
it's more like spreading over make this
is Shinjuku a sub-sub inner city area

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:14.530
is Shinjuku a sub-sub inner city area
 

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:20.750
is Shinjuku a sub-sub inner city area
and let's see like Shanghai this is a

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760
and let's see like Shanghai this is a
 

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.330
and let's see like Shanghai this is a
main axis of the city called a are you

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:24.340
main axis of the city called a are you
 

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.940
main axis of the city called a are you
so they have a lot of concentration on

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:26.950
so they have a lot of concentration on
 

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:31.250
so they have a lot of concentration on
here and this is a periodical

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260
here and this is a periodical
 

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.860
here and this is a periodical
classification of each tall building so

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:34.870
classification of each tall building so
 

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.890
classification of each tall building so
of course the era gets

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:37.900
of course the era gets
 

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:41.260
of course the era gets
later so the more building that into the

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:41.270
later so the more building that into the
 

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.780
later so the more building that into the
cities like Shanghai and also this

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:43.790
cities like Shanghai and also this
 

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:47.020
cities like Shanghai and also this
represents a break down the usage within

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:47.030
represents a break down the usage within
 

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.690
represents a break down the usage within
the 10 kilometers and then you can see

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:49.700
the 10 kilometers and then you can see
 

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:53.040
the 10 kilometers and then you can see
Hong Kong they have such a lot of

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:53.050
Hong Kong they have such a lot of
 

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.110
Hong Kong they have such a lot of
residential towers compared to other

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:56.120
residential towers compared to other
 

00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:01.240
residential towers compared to other
cities and this is a top companies

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:01.250
cities and this is a top companies
 

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:04.900
cities and this is a top companies
listed in the global 500 issued by

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:04.910
listed in the global 500 issued by
 

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:10.780
listed in the global 500 issued by
fortune so and within that this source

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:10.790
fortune so and within that this source
 

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:14.170
fortune so and within that this source
so we found Tokyo has the most and also

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:14.180
so we found Tokyo has the most and also
 

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.480
so we found Tokyo has the most and also
are not only for the but with the

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:16.490
are not only for the but with the
 

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:18.250
are not only for the but with the
company's numbers the companies but who

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:18.260
company's numbers the companies but who
 

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.710
company's numbers the companies but who
is the revenues together but also Paris

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720
is the revenues together but also Paris
 

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:25.630
is the revenues together but also Paris
is also having a good point and also the

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:25.640
is also having a good point and also the
 

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.910
is also having a good point and also the
concentration is very similar to what we

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920
concentration is very similar to what we
 

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.110
concentration is very similar to what we
have found for the tall buildings the

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:32.120
have found for the tall buildings the
 

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.080
have found for the tall buildings the
next one is the top universities listed

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:35.090
next one is the top universities listed
 

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:39.790
next one is the top universities listed
in the Newsweek 500 top universities of

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:39.800
in the Newsweek 500 top universities of
 

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.340
in the Newsweek 500 top universities of
course here's at Columbia University but

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:42.350
course here's at Columbia University but
 

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.520
course here's at Columbia University but
anyway we made a comparison both the

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:45.530
anyway we made a comparison both the
 

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:48.180
anyway we made a comparison both the
number of the schools and also the

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:48.190
number of the schools and also the
 

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:50.710
number of the schools and also the
students and also the international

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720
students and also the international
 

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:54.400
students and also the international
students and this time again Paris is

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:54.410
students and this time again Paris is
 

00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:57.820
students and this time again Paris is
doing well and Tokyo seems to be not bad

00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:57.830
doing well and Tokyo seems to be not bad
 

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:01.210
doing well and Tokyo seems to be not bad
but still comparing the international

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:01.220
but still comparing the international
 

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.690
but still comparing the international
student numbers or still low position as

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:04.700
student numbers or still low position as
 

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:09.130
student numbers or still low position as
well as Shanghai and then let's look at

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:09.140
well as Shanghai and then let's look at
 

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.160
well as Shanghai and then let's look at
the theatres in concert halls so these

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:12.170
the theatres in concert halls so these

capacities and also there is a very

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:21.860
capacities and also there is a very
 

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:24.760
capacities and also there is a very
interesting concentration in each cities

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:24.770
interesting concentration in each cities
 

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.310

then these cities are strong but also
 

00:47:30.059 --> 00:47:32.460
then these cities are strong but also
makes us feel sickly like soul in

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:32.470
makes us feel sickly like soul in
 

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:35.130

the European brands in age yes
 

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:58.940
the European brands in age yes
and these are kind of breakdowns and

00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:58.950
and these are kind of breakdowns and
 

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:01.710
and these are kind of breakdowns and
also we can see the concentration in

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:01.720
also we can see the concentration in
 

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:06.510
also we can see the concentration in
very very limited places which has a

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:06.520
very very limited places which has a
 

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.550
very very limited places which has a
very strong commercial accumulation and

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:10.560
very strong commercial accumulation and
 

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.720
very strong commercial accumulation and
shopping center large-scale shopping

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:12.730
shopping center large-scale shopping
 

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:15.210
shopping center large-scale shopping
center is very similar q Malaysian to

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:15.220
center is very similar q Malaysian to
 

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:18.600
center is very similar q Malaysian to
the brand name shops but we counted

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:18.610
the brand name shops but we counted
 

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:21.870
the brand name shops but we counted
major large shopping centers and

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:21.880
major large shopping centers and
 

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:25.050
major large shopping centers and
department stores in these cities inform

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:25.060
department stores in these cities inform
 

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:28.080
department stores in these cities inform
the number still Tokyo has a lot and

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:28.090
the number still Tokyo has a lot and
 

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:31.530
the number still Tokyo has a lot and
also Shanghai as well and this is

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:31.540
also Shanghai as well and this is
 

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.480
also Shanghai as well and this is
another aspect of the the shopping

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:33.490
another aspect of the the shopping
 

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:35.220
another aspect of the the shopping
centers well we picked up the major

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:35.230
centers well we picked up the major
 

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:39.030
centers well we picked up the major
shopping centers and counted operating

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040
shopping centers and counted operating
 

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.670
shopping centers and counted operating
hours per week and these are the

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680
hours per week and these are the
 

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.730
hours per week and these are the
comparison so the agency T seems to have

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:44.740
comparison so the agency T seems to have
 

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:47.040
comparison so the agency T seems to have
more operating time compared to the

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:47.050
more operating time compared to the
 

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:55.170
more operating time compared to the
western cities and hospitals so with the

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:55.180
western cities and hospitals so with the
 

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:57.320
western cities and hospitals so with the
hunt more than hundred bit I was

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:57.330
hunt more than hundred bit I was
 

00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:00.180
hunt more than hundred bit I was
Hospital we've accounted all the numbers

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:00.190
Hospital we've accounted all the numbers
 

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:02.360
Hospital we've accounted all the numbers
and also the numbers a bit and

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:02.370
and also the numbers a bit and
 

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:06.060
and also the numbers a bit and
accumulated so and this time you have

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:06.070
accumulated so and this time you have
 

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:09.240
accumulated so and this time you have
Paris and Tokyo they dominate and also

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:09.250
Paris and Tokyo they dominate and also
 

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:16.580
Paris and Tokyo they dominate and also
New York has a lot of hospitals and on

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:16.590
New York has a lot of hospitals and on
 

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:20.610
New York has a lot of hospitals and on
about the green and water coverage so we

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:20.620
about the green and water coverage so we
 

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:24.030
about the green and water coverage so we
saw the natural environment could be not

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:24.040
saw the natural environment could be not
 

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.730
saw the natural environment could be not
only it could be composed of green space

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:26.740
only it could be composed of green space
 

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.740
only it could be composed of green space
but also the water it's also important

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:28.750
but also the water it's also important
 

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:31.320
but also the water it's also important
to feel that a nature living while

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:31.330
to feel that a nature living while
 

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:34.830
to feel that a nature living while
living in inside inner city so and we

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:34.840
living in inside inner city so and we
 

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.520
living in inside inner city so and we
counted all the green spaces and also

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:38.530
counted all the green spaces and also
 

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:42.440
counted all the green spaces and also
the water spaces and um and made a son

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:42.450
the water spaces and um and made a son
 

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:46.290
the water spaces and um and made a son
so and of course a Hong Kong and soul

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:46.300
so and of course a Hong Kong and soul
 

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:50.400
so and of course a Hong Kong and soul
which has a big number amount of green

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:50.410
which has a big number amount of green
 

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:51.269
which has a big number amount of green
and also

00:52:51.269 --> 00:52:51.279
and also
 

00:52:51.279 --> 00:52:55.529
and also
you know water these two cities are

00:52:55.529 --> 00:52:55.539
you know water these two cities are
 

00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:59.099
you know water these two cities are
kinda exceptional these cities but also

00:52:59.099 --> 00:52:59.109
kinda exceptional these cities but also
 

00:52:59.109 --> 00:53:01.649
kinda exceptional these cities but also
still in New York has a big number of

00:53:01.649 --> 00:53:01.659
still in New York has a big number of
 

00:53:01.659 --> 00:53:05.909
still in New York has a big number of
green in those water and like looking at

00:53:05.909 --> 00:53:05.919
green in those water and like looking at
 

00:53:05.919 --> 00:53:10.589
green in those water and like looking at
all like Paris has major big green and

00:53:10.589 --> 00:53:10.599
all like Paris has major big green and
 

00:53:10.599 --> 00:53:15.659
all like Paris has major big green and
also London also has quite smaller but

00:53:15.659 --> 00:53:15.669
also London also has quite smaller but
 

00:53:15.669 --> 00:53:19.380
also London also has quite smaller but
has even our distribution in spaces

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:19.390
has even our distribution in spaces
 

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:23.099
has even our distribution in spaces
while our Tokyo and Shanghai looks very

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:23.109
while our Tokyo and Shanghai looks very
 

00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:28.519
while our Tokyo and Shanghai looks very
poor compared to these cities okay and

00:53:28.519 --> 00:53:28.529
poor compared to these cities okay and
 

00:53:28.529 --> 00:53:31.859
poor compared to these cities okay and
the truck transportation so subway and

00:53:31.859 --> 00:53:31.869
the truck transportation so subway and
 

00:53:31.869 --> 00:53:33.899
the truck transportation so subway and
rail transit so we counted all the

00:53:33.899 --> 00:53:33.909
rail transit so we counted all the
 

00:53:33.909 --> 00:53:36.390
rail transit so we counted all the
number of the station so not only the

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400
number of the station so not only the
 

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.120
number of the station so not only the
subways but also the irregular trained

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:39.130
subways but also the irregular trained
 

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:44.309
subways but also the irregular trained
in other's makeup and so we found aa so

00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319
in other's makeup and so we found aa so
 

00:53:44.319 --> 00:53:47.370
in other's makeup and so we found aa so
within the 500 meter distance radius so

00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:47.380
within the 500 meter distance radius so
 

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.640
within the 500 meter distance radius so
Paris has the most that means that the

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:50.650
Paris has the most that means that the
 

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:54.779
Paris has the most that means that the
station density is the most part but if

00:53:54.779 --> 00:53:54.789
station density is the most part but if
 

00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:57.449
station density is the most part but if
looking to the wider broader area so

00:53:57.449 --> 00:53:57.459
looking to the wider broader area so
 

00:53:57.459 --> 00:54:01.559
looking to the wider broader area so
Tokyo has more and also you can see

00:54:01.559 --> 00:54:01.569
Tokyo has more and also you can see
 

00:54:01.569 --> 00:54:04.349
Tokyo has more and also you can see
London has also kind of very even

00:54:04.349 --> 00:54:04.359
London has also kind of very even
 

00:54:04.359 --> 00:54:06.779
London has also kind of very even
distribution of the station compared to

00:54:06.779 --> 00:54:06.789
distribution of the station compared to
 

00:54:06.789 --> 00:54:09.749
distribution of the station compared to
that Paris and New York also has a very

00:54:09.749 --> 00:54:09.759
that Paris and New York also has a very
 

00:54:09.759 --> 00:54:12.299
that Paris and New York also has a very
good distribution in this new york city

00:54:12.299 --> 00:54:12.309
good distribution in this new york city
 

00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:17.909
good distribution in this new york city
side but the other side the New Jersey

00:54:17.909 --> 00:54:17.919
side but the other side the New Jersey
 

00:54:17.919 --> 00:54:24.390
side but the other side the New Jersey
side are it's very few stations and and

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400
side are it's very few stations and and
 

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.059
side are it's very few stations and and
this is highway comparison so the lens

00:54:27.059 --> 00:54:27.069
this is highway comparison so the lens
 

00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:31.649
this is highway comparison so the lens
of highways will compare go quick yeah

00:54:31.649 --> 00:54:31.659
of highways will compare go quick yeah
 

00:54:31.659 --> 00:54:35.590
of highways will compare go quick yeah
but somehow Tokyo has a lot

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:35.600
but somehow Tokyo has a lot
 

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:41.650
but somehow Tokyo has a lot
and anyway then finally the airport

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:41.660
and anyway then finally the airport
 

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:46.400
and anyway then finally the airport
access so it's a comparison was a time

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:46.410
access so it's a comparison was a time
 

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:49.400
access so it's a comparison was a time
from the very center of the seat so it's

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:49.410
from the very center of the seat so it's
 

00:54:49.410 --> 00:54:51.920
from the very center of the seat so it's
not only the train but sometimes it

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:51.930
not only the train but sometimes it
 

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:55.010
not only the train but sometimes it
includes a transit so like sitting like

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:55.020
includes a transit so like sitting like
 

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.960
includes a transit so like sitting like
a Paris so we have to take a metro and

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:56.970
a Paris so we have to take a metro and
 

00:54:56.970 --> 00:55:01.100
a Paris so we have to take a metro and
switch and then so so this case so Tokyo

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:01.110
switch and then so so this case so Tokyo
 

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:03.770
switch and then so so this case so Tokyo
is not the worst but at the soul it's a

00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:03.780
is not the worst but at the soul it's a
 

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:09.280
is not the worst but at the soul it's a
better the worst time but looking at the

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:09.290
better the worst time but looking at the
 

00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:12.350
better the worst time but looking at the
number of the time that's a time the

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:12.360
number of the time that's a time the
 

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:15.490
number of the time that's a time the
drive distant because of the bus so

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:15.500
drive distant because of the bus so
 

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.620
drive distant because of the bus so
sometimes the traffic jam happened so

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:18.630
sometimes the traffic jam happened so
 

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:21.280
sometimes the traffic jam happened so
it's very difficult to count the time so

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:21.290
it's very difficult to count the time so
 

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:27.620
it's very difficult to count the time so
we just are colgate the distance and of

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:27.630
we just are colgate the distance and of
 

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:30.170
we just are colgate the distance and of
course the Tokyo and the naruto report

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:30.180
course the Tokyo and the naruto report
 

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:33.530
course the Tokyo and the naruto report
maybe many of you know but its forces in

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.540
maybe many of you know but its forces in
 

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.900
maybe many of you know but its forces in
terms of distance and also comparison of

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:35.910
terms of distance and also comparison of
 

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:41.210
terms of distance and also comparison of
the fair of each like a rail and also

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:41.220
the fair of each like a rail and also
 

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:45.260
the fair of each like a rail and also
bus and taxi so you can see how Tokyo's

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:45.270
bus and taxi so you can see how Tokyo's
 

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:47.570
bus and taxi so you can see how Tokyo's
taxi fare is expensive so you shouldn't

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:47.580
taxi fare is expensive so you shouldn't
 

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.010
taxi fare is expensive so you shouldn't
take a taxi when you can feel okay and

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:51.020
take a taxi when you can feel okay and
 

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:54.470
take a taxi when you can feel okay and
this one is the connection and make a

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480
this one is the connection and make a
 

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.650
this one is the connection and make a
performance of the airport like so so

00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:57.660
performance of the airport like so so
 

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.410
performance of the airport like so so
number the runways old added together of

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420
number the runways old added together of
 

00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:01.730
number the runways old added together of
course New York has three major

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740
course New York has three major
 

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.760
course New York has three major
international airport so it's a pop then

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:04.770
international airport so it's a pop then
 

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:07.820
international airport so it's a pop then
this one is also we all counted the

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:07.830
this one is also we all counted the
 

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.070
this one is also we all counted the
cities with the direct flights and also

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:10.080
cities with the direct flights and also
 

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.170
cities with the direct flights and also
counted souls are a number of the

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:12.180
counted souls are a number of the
 

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.310
counted souls are a number of the
flights then of course London Paris are

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:15.320
flights then of course London Paris are
 

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.610
flights then of course London Paris are
they have a lot in the within their

00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:18.620
they have a lot in the within their
 

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:22.220
they have a lot in the within their
European zone the bigger circle

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:22.230
European zone the bigger circle
 

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:24.590
European zone the bigger circle
represent more bigger amount of the

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:24.600
represent more bigger amount of the
 

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:30.080
represent more bigger amount of the
lines running and so these also

00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:30.090
lines running and so these also
 

00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:32.120
lines running and so these also
represents represents a connection of

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:32.130
represents represents a connection of
 

00:56:32.130 --> 00:56:34.310
represents represents a connection of
the cities between each other so like

00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:34.320
the cities between each other so like
 

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:38.060
the cities between each other so like
New York is connected very well with you

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:38.070
New York is connected very well with you
 

00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:40.340
New York is connected very well with you
know foresters house American cities and

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:40.350
know foresters house American cities and
 

00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:44.300
know foresters house American cities and
also and major cities in Europe as well

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:44.310
also and major cities in Europe as well
 

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:48.890
also and major cities in Europe as well
in Asia but looking at Tokyo so you can

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900
in Asia but looking at Tokyo so you can
 

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:53.150
in Asia but looking at Tokyo so you can
see a big are red in Hawaii so but

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160
see a big are red in Hawaii so but
 

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:57.140
see a big are red in Hawaii so but
anyway and also need one but compared to

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:57.150
anyway and also need one but compared to
 

00:56:57.150 --> 00:57:00.340
anyway and also need one but compared to
like New York you can find a different

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:00.350
like New York you can find a different
 

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:03.770
like New York you can find a different
situation here also like Singapore is

00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:03.780
situation here also like Singapore is
 

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:07.340
situation here also like Singapore is
more concentrated in Asia through Europe

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:07.350
more concentrated in Asia through Europe
 

00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:10.190
more concentrated in Asia through Europe
and those Hong Kong has a very strong

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200
and those Hong Kong has a very strong
 

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.460
and those Hong Kong has a very strong
maybe to some European cities and also

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:13.470
maybe to some European cities and also
 

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:17.030
maybe to some European cities and also
American cities and so may be similar to

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040
American cities and so may be similar to
 

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:22.310
American cities and so may be similar to
Tokyo and Shanghai is still it's ending

00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:22.320
Tokyo and Shanghai is still it's ending
 

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:25.850
Tokyo and Shanghai is still it's ending
up in age so anyhow so this is a

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:25.860
up in age so anyhow so this is a
 

00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:27.950
up in age so anyhow so this is a
conclusion of our study it's not

00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960
conclusion of our study it's not
 

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:31.790
conclusion of our study it's not
completed but it's almost so we

00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800
completed but it's almost so we
 

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.330
completed but it's almost so we
automated all the aspects I showed here

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:35.340
automated all the aspects I showed here
 

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:38.570
automated all the aspects I showed here
so and you can see the very densest part

00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:38.580
so and you can see the very densest part
 

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.830
so and you can see the very densest part
is a kind of what we are defining as a

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:41.840
is a kind of what we are defining as a
 

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:47.030
is a kind of what we are defining as a
powerful places and so this these charts

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040
powerful places and so this these charts
 

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:51.080
powerful places and so this these charts
are they are not always are representing

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:51.090
are they are not always are representing
 

00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:55.220
are they are not always are representing
all the sum of the dots but so each each

00:57:55.220 --> 00:57:55.230
all the sum of the dots but so each each
 

00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:58.460
all the sum of the dots but so each each
category has a so we changed to the

00:57:58.460 --> 00:57:58.470
category has a so we changed to the
 

00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:02.480
category has a so we changed to the
index score so so we have 20 indicators

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:02.490
index score so so we have 20 indicators
 

00:58:02.490 --> 00:58:06.370
index score so so we have 20 indicators
so we change the work so each indicators

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:06.380
so we change the work so each indicators
 

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:10.580
so we change the work so each indicators
200 point scored so the theoretical one

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:10.590
200 point scored so the theoretical one
 

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:12.680
200 point scored so the theoretical one
hundred percent should be two thousand

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:12.690
hundred percent should be two thousand
 

00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:15.410
hundred percent should be two thousand
point so and any also and then we also

00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420
point so and any also and then we also
 

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:19.040
point so and any also and then we also
took took into account not the quality

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:19.050
took took into account not the quality
 

00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:21.800
took took into account not the quality
but like a number not only the number of

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:21.810
but like a number not only the number of
 

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:23.660
but like a number not only the number of
the facilities but also the capacities

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:23.670
the facilities but also the capacities
 

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:26.900
the facilities but also the capacities
or like that then oh yes the sea so the

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:26.910
or like that then oh yes the sea so the
 

00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:31.250
or like that then oh yes the sea so the
Paris with this method collocation it

00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:31.260
Paris with this method collocation it
 

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:34.880
Paris with this method collocation it
stays on the top and then Tokyo follows

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:34.890
stays on the top and then Tokyo follows
 

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:39.140
stays on the top and then Tokyo follows
and somehow on Hong Kong it seems to be

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:39.150
and somehow on Hong Kong it seems to be
 

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:43.730
and somehow on Hong Kong it seems to be
more than 0 and then London come within

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740
more than 0 and then London come within
 

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:46.599
more than 0 and then London come within
the 10-kilometer analysis

00:58:46.599 --> 00:58:46.609
the 10-kilometer analysis
 

00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:49.509
the 10-kilometer analysis
calculation so still Paris Tokyo pounds

00:58:49.509 --> 00:58:49.519
calculation so still Paris Tokyo pounds
 

00:58:49.519 --> 00:58:52.569
calculation so still Paris Tokyo pounds
and then New York and London and then

00:58:52.569 --> 00:58:52.579
and then New York and London and then
 

00:58:52.579 --> 00:58:56.920
and then New York and London and then
Hong Kong and for this and also an other

00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:56.930
Hong Kong and for this and also an other
 

00:58:56.930 --> 00:59:00.489
Hong Kong and for this and also an other
unique thing is one soul it has very low

00:59:00.489 --> 00:59:00.499
unique thing is one soul it has very low
 

00:59:00.499 --> 00:59:03.460
unique thing is one soul it has very low
score within the 500 meter but is that

00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:03.470
score within the 500 meter but is that
 

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:05.979
score within the 500 meter but is that
within the 10 kilometres on so it has

00:59:05.979 --> 00:59:05.989
within the 10 kilometres on so it has
 

00:59:05.989 --> 00:59:09.039
within the 10 kilometres on so it has
more sport so that mean isn't worried i

00:59:09.039 --> 00:59:09.049
more sport so that mean isn't worried i
 

00:59:09.049 --> 00:59:12.220
more sport so that mean isn't worried i
rewrite get stronger so anyhow but it's

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:12.230
rewrite get stronger so anyhow but it's
 

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:14.829
rewrite get stronger so anyhow but it's
not our purpose to make a ranking here

00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:14.839
not our purpose to make a ranking here
 

00:59:14.839 --> 00:59:17.829
not our purpose to make a ranking here
again so we want to rather analysis each

00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839
again so we want to rather analysis each
 

00:59:17.839 --> 00:59:21.039
again so we want to rather analysis each
city so but i have time to go over all

00:59:21.039 --> 00:59:21.049
city so but i have time to go over all
 

00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:25.380
city so but i have time to go over all
cities but you see like so this red is

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:25.390
cities but you see like so this red is
 

00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:28.660
cities but you see like so this red is
showing the score or the it actually is

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:28.670
showing the score or the it actually is
 

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:31.509
showing the score or the it actually is
a deviation score for the five-kilometer

00:59:31.509 --> 00:59:31.519
a deviation score for the five-kilometer
 

00:59:31.519 --> 00:59:35.470
a deviation score for the five-kilometer
radius and this blue zone is showing the

00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480
radius and this blue zone is showing the
 

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:38.499
radius and this blue zone is showing the
score for the pink kilometer radius

00:59:38.499 --> 00:59:38.509
score for the pink kilometer radius
 

00:59:38.509 --> 00:59:41.470
score for the pink kilometer radius
stone and then you can see which our

00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480
stone and then you can see which our
 

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:45.279
stone and then you can see which our
area has a stronger power and also if

00:59:45.279 --> 00:59:45.289
area has a stronger power and also if
 

00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:48.279
area has a stronger power and also if
it's a regular shape or very like odd

00:59:48.279 --> 00:59:48.289
it's a regular shape or very like odd
 

00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:52.029
it's a regular shape or very like odd
shape with tokyo like see these like a

00:59:52.029 --> 00:59:52.039
shape with tokyo like see these like a
 

00:59:52.039 --> 00:59:53.979
shape with tokyo like see these like a
singapore and hong kong so they have

00:59:53.979 --> 00:59:53.989
singapore and hong kong so they have
 

00:59:53.989 --> 00:59:56.859
singapore and hong kong so they have
much more stronger power for the final

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:56.869
much more stronger power for the final
 

00:59:56.869 --> 01:00:00.940
much more stronger power for the final
narrower area but a while so has much

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:00.950
narrower area but a while so has much
 

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:05.130
narrower area but a while so has much
more power is in the broader area and

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:05.140
more power is in the broader area and
 

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.809
more power is in the broader area and
finally looking at the details of tokyo

01:00:07.809 --> 01:00:07.819
finally looking at the details of tokyo
 

01:00:07.819 --> 01:00:10.599
finally looking at the details of tokyo
also and as i introduced so the

01:00:10.599 --> 01:00:10.609
also and as i introduced so the
 

01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:12.579
also and as i introduced so the
population is in the very poor of the

01:00:12.579 --> 01:00:12.589
population is in the very poor of the
 

01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:14.710
population is in the very poor of the
city is pretty small means of course

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720
city is pretty small means of course
 

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:19.089
city is pretty small means of course
small and also the buildings it's seems

01:00:19.089 --> 01:00:19.099
small and also the buildings it's seems
 

01:00:19.099 --> 01:00:23.079
small and also the buildings it's seems
to be getting better but now compared to

01:00:23.079 --> 01:00:23.089
to be getting better but now compared to
 

01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:25.720
to be getting better but now compared to
other on our city so still in the middle

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:25.730
other on our city so still in the middle
 

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:28.790
other on our city so still in the middle
on the way and the company is

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:28.800
on the way and the company is
 

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.880
on the way and the company is
there's big amount and the university is

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:31.890
there's big amount and the university is
 

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:34.670
there's big amount and the university is
pretty well but these theaters and

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680
pretty well but these theaters and
 

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:38.570
pretty well but these theaters and
museums still average our little lower

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:38.580
museums still average our little lower
 

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.710
museums still average our little lower
and stadiums somehow there's big stage

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720
and stadiums somehow there's big stage
 

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.330
and stadiums somehow there's big stage
and in very core of the city and

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:46.340
and in very core of the city and
 

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:49.600
and in very core of the city and
convention are it's pretty middle and

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:49.610
convention are it's pretty middle and
 

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:54.590
convention are it's pretty middle and
embassies are like this situation and

01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:54.600
embassies are like this situation and
 

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:57.110
embassies are like this situation and
also international school are not always

01:00:57.110 --> 01:00:57.120
also international school are not always
 

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.350
also international school are not always
so much and especially the hotel's

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:00.360
so much and especially the hotel's
 

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.920
so much and especially the hotel's
number the good hotels five-star they're

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:03.930
number the good hotels five-star they're
 

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:07.130
number the good hotels five-star they're
still quite a few and quite small number

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:07.140
still quite a few and quite small number
 

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:11.150
still quite a few and quite small number
within these HCBS but see this big gap

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160
within these HCBS but see this big gap
 

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.210
within these HCBS but see this big gap
so the restaurants and branch out and

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:14.220
so the restaurants and branch out and
 

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:18.110
so the restaurants and branch out and
shopping centers so such so Z is kind of

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:18.120
shopping centers so such so Z is kind of
 

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.610

consumption oriented rather than the

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440
consumption oriented rather than the
 

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.220

international interaction the business
is it proceeds more than the life

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:05.270
is it proceeds more than the life
 

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:08.060
is it proceeds more than the life
interaction especially for supporting

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:08.070
interaction especially for supporting

interaction especially for supporting
people and also there is a small space

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:10.770
people and also there is a small space
 

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:14.750
people and also there is a small space
of nature so these are kind of problems

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760
of nature so these are kind of problems
 

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.300
of nature so these are kind of problems
could be a business channels or

developer like more dealing so I'm just
going to quickly so what Maury building

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:24.930
going to quickly so what Maury building
 

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:26.600
going to quickly so what Maury building
is doing at the minute award which is

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:26.610
is doing at the minute award which is
 

01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:33.020

major development down by more buildings

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:37.890
major development down by more buildings
 

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:39.530
major development down by more buildings
called upon hills and this is another

01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540
called upon hills and this is another
 

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:43.370
called upon hills and this is another
one by down by the other developer but

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380
one by down by the other developer but
 

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:45.590
one by down by the other developer but
it's pretty pretty successful but still

01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:45.600
it's pretty pretty successful but still
 

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.370
it's pretty pretty successful but still
see you can see many congested our

01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:48.380
see you can see many congested our
 

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.720
see you can see many congested our
particle things still

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:51.730
particle things still
 

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:54.870

also dangerous in terms of disaster and
 

01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:00.690
also dangerous in terms of disaster and
this is a missile to create the kind of

01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:00.700
this is a missile to create the kind of
 

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.810
this is a missile to create the kind of
compact city so this occupies only three

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:03.820
compact city so this occupies only three
 

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:06.390
compact city so this occupies only three
percent of the land by the building so

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400
percent of the land by the building so
 

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.390
percent of the land by the building so
then they just building a house all of

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400
then they just building a house all of

these are tiny houses and more and other
space it can be returned to the ground

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200
space it can be returned to the ground
 

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:20.340
space it can be returned to the ground
earth so what Maury buildings calling

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:20.350
earth so what Maury buildings calling
 

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:24.420

01:17:29.699 --> 01:17:33.979
you probably read some of those
studies but either way all of these

01:17:33.979 --> 01:17:33.989
studies but either way all of these
 

01:17:33.989 --> 01:17:39.049
studies but either way all of these
studies are trying to look at and trying

01:17:39.049 --> 01:17:39.059
studies are trying to look at and trying
 

01:17:39.059 --> 01:17:42.459
studies are trying to look at and trying
to identify the relationship between

01:17:42.459 --> 01:17:42.469
to identify the relationship between
 

01:17:42.469 --> 01:17:46.189
to identify the relationship between
globalization writ large and an

systems we even still have cities why

01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:17.699
systems we even still have cities why
 

01:18:17.699 --> 01:18:21.560
systems we even still have cities why
they still are important now I think

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:21.570
they still are important now I think
 

01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:24.020
they still are important now I think
what we need to do for a one second is

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:24.030
what we need to do for a one second is
 

01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:25.640
what we need to do for a one second is
to concentrate on this difference

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:25.650
to concentrate on this difference
 

01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:28.640
to concentrate on this difference
between the act the studies that look at

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:28.650
between the act the studies that look at
 

01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:30.589
between the act the studies that look at
attributes of cities and those that look

01:18:30.589 --> 01:18:30.599
attributes of cities and those that look
 

01:18:30.599 --> 01:18:34.580
attributes of cities and those that look
at relations because there is underlying

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:34.590
at relations because there is underlying
 

01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:36.529
at relations because there is underlying
these types of studies fundamental

01:18:36.529 --> 01:18:36.539
these types of studies fundamental
 

01:18:36.539 --> 01:18:40.069
these types of studies fundamental
differences and they relate to as I see

01:18:40.069 --> 01:18:40.079
differences and they relate to as I see
 

01:18:40.079 --> 01:18:43.549
differences and they relate to as I see
it the definition of the city do you

01:18:43.549 --> 01:18:43.559
it the definition of the city do you
 

01:18:43.559 --> 01:18:47.270
it the definition of the city do you
define a city by the attributes in it or

01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280
define a city by the attributes in it or
 

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.609
define a city by the attributes in it or
do you define a city by sort of

01:18:49.609 --> 01:18:49.619
do you define a city by sort of
 

01:18:49.619 --> 01:18:51.859
do you define a city by sort of
processes and linkages and these kind of

01:18:51.859 --> 01:18:51.869
processes and linkages and these kind of
 

01:18:51.869 --> 01:18:55.549
processes and linkages and these kind of
things now in the environmental arena

01:18:55.549 --> 01:18:55.559
things now in the environmental arena
 

01:18:55.559 --> 01:18:58.729
things now in the environmental arena
which is where I am right now this is

01:18:58.729 --> 01:18:58.739
which is where I am right now this is
 

01:18:58.739 --> 01:19:02.600
which is where I am right now this is
incredibly important because what what I

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:02.610
incredibly important because what what I
 

01:19:02.610 --> 01:19:05.660
incredibly important because what what I
think that we need to do increasingly is

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:05.670
think that we need to do increasingly is
 

01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:08.810
think that we need to do increasingly is
to identify the benefits and costs of

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820
to identify the benefits and costs of
 

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:13.299
to identify the benefits and costs of
dense settlement on the environment and

01:19:13.299 --> 01:19:13.309
dense settlement on the environment and
 

01:19:13.309 --> 01:19:16.459
dense settlement on the environment and
in this way we need to know what it is

01:19:16.459 --> 01:19:16.469
in this way we need to know what it is
 

01:19:16.469 --> 01:19:19.939
in this way we need to know what it is
that dense settlement brings to social

01:19:19.939 --> 01:19:19.949
that dense settlement brings to social
 

01:19:19.949 --> 01:19:24.410
that dense settlement brings to social
economic environmental systems all too

01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:24.420
economic environmental systems all too
 

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.540
economic environmental systems all too
often and you'll see this in the

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:26.550
often and you'll see this in the
 

01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:28.430
often and you'll see this in the
environmental literature cities are

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440
environmental literature cities are
 

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:31.250
environmental literature cities are
blamed their blamed for being

01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.260
blamed their blamed for being
 

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:34.160
blamed their blamed for being
environmental villains and in my mind

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:34.170
environmental villains and in my mind
 

01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:38.839
environmental villains and in my mind
those studies conflate lots of processes

01:19:38.839 --> 01:19:38.849
those studies conflate lots of processes
 

01:19:38.849 --> 01:19:41.410
those studies conflate lots of processes
on cities that do not relate

01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:41.420
on cities that do not relate
 

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:45.250
on cities that do not relate
to sit eNOS or dense settlement so in

01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:45.260
to sit eNOS or dense settlement so in
 

01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:48.120
to sit eNOS or dense settlement so in
these are the environment so for example

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:48.130
these are the environment so for example
 

01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:51.010
these are the environment so for example
you'll have Lester Brown always blasting

01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:51.020
you'll have Lester Brown always blasting
 

01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:53.260
you'll have Lester Brown always blasting
cities for the fact that they are

01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:53.270
cities for the fact that they are
 

01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:55.689
cities for the fact that they are
disproportional consumption centers etc

01:19:55.689 --> 01:19:55.699
disproportional consumption centers etc
 

01:19:55.699 --> 01:20:00.310
disproportional consumption centers etc
etc but my question always is is that if

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320
etc but my question always is is that if
 

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.229
etc but my question always is is that if
you took those same activities and

01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239
you took those same activities and
 

01:20:02.239 --> 01:20:04.169
you took those same activities and
spread them out across the landscape

01:20:04.169 --> 01:20:04.179
spread them out across the landscape
 

01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:09.580
spread them out across the landscape
would you get similar environmental

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:09.590
would you get similar environmental
 

01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:12.850
would you get similar environmental
impact worse environmental impacts or

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:12.860
impact worse environmental impacts or
 

01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:16.450
impact worse environmental impacts or
better and this really relates to a

01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:16.460
better and this really relates to a
 

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:20.229
better and this really relates to a
large agenda that is looking at the

01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239
large agenda that is looking at the
 

01:20:20.239 --> 01:20:24.760
large agenda that is looking at the
environment and and cities now bringing

that back to this study I think that

01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:27.080
that back to this study I think that
 

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:32.130
that back to this study I think that
what we have here is a certain of the

what we have here is a certain of the
 

01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:35.080
what we have here is a certain of the
previous a trip attributional studies

what people were identifying things like
 

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:45.030
what people were identifying things like
simply the number of transnational

study that bringing that that was just

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:56.410
study that bringing that that was just
 

01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:59.560
study that bringing that that was just
presented brings to us is a much broader

01:20:59.560 --> 01:20:59.570
presented brings to us is a much broader
 

01:20:59.570 --> 01:21:01.810
presented brings to us is a much broader
set of issues and they actually are

01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:01.820
set of issues and they actually are
 

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:04.470
set of issues and they actually are
including things like livability

01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480
including things like livability
 

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.150

environmental issues into into into the
 

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:17.640
environmental issues into into into the
study and end this research agenda so

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:17.650
study and end this research agenda so
 

01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:22.180
study and end this research agenda so
whether you know what exactly is the

01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:22.190
whether you know what exactly is the
 

01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:24.880
whether you know what exactly is the
correct way to look at these to look at

correct way to look at these to look at
 

01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:26.979
correct way to look at these to look at
cities and the divine global city pneus

01:21:26.979 --> 01:21:26.989
cities and the divine global city pneus
 

01:21:26.989 --> 01:21:30.520
cities and the divine global city pneus
will be subject to the kind of questions

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:30.530
will be subject to the kind of questions
 

01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:32.770
will be subject to the kind of questions
we asked I certainly think that this

01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:32.780
we asked I certainly think that this
 

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.990
we asked I certainly think that this
type of work is an advancement and is

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:35.000
type of work is an advancement and is
 

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.780
type of work is an advancement and is
much needed I think that a lot of the

01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:37.790
much needed I think that a lot of the
 

01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:39.910
much needed I think that a lot of the
data here can be used by other

01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920
data here can be used by other
 

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:42.640
data here can be used by other
researchers that are doing comparative

researchers that are doing comparative
 

01:21:42.650 --> 01:21:46.150
researchers that are doing comparative
studies and I think that this particular

01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:46.160
studies and I think that this particular
 

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:49.650
studies and I think that this particular
study is one that

01:21:49.650 --> 01:21:49.660
study is one that
 

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:53.530
study is one that
continues to look for and identify what

01:21:53.530 --> 01:21:53.540
continues to look for and identify what
 

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:56.710
continues to look for and identify what
global city pneus is in these RV the

01:21:56.710 --> 01:21:56.720
global city pneus is in these RV the
 

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.550
global city pneus is in these RV the
position of cities in a in a hierarchy

01:21:59.550 --> 01:21:59.560
position of cities in a in a hierarchy
 

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:02.170
position of cities in a in a hierarchy
and I think I'll leave monster into that

01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:02.180
and I think I'll leave monster into that
 

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:14.620
and I think I'll leave monster into that
and let the other discusses thank you so

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:14.630

there's a couple of things that struck
 

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:15.550
there's a couple of things that struck
me one of the amazing thing is that a

01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:15.560
me one of the amazing thing is that a
 

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:19.360
me one of the amazing thing is that a
mass amount of information that you were

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:19.370
mass amount of information that you were
 

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:22.810
mass amount of information that you were
able to look at I mean that amount of

01:23:22.810 --> 01:23:22.820
able to look at I mean that amount of
 

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:25.180
able to look at I mean that amount of
criteria but one thing that struck me

Tokyo has been very good city so and
 

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:13.479
Tokyo has been very good city so and
then ask them ask so then measure well

01:29:13.479 --> 01:29:13.489
then ask them ask so then measure well
 

01:29:13.489 --> 01:29:16.060

how talk is good and then we submitted

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:16.070
how talk is good and then we submitted
 

01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:18.729
how talk is good and then we submitted
so still there are many agendas we have

01:29:18.729 --> 01:29:18.739
so still there are many agendas we have
 

01:29:18.739 --> 01:29:23.709
so still there are many agendas we have
to cope with so and that's why we are

01:29:23.709 --> 01:29:23.719
to cope with so and that's why we are
 

01:29:23.719 --> 01:29:27.339
to cope with so and that's why we are
still doing this and also and all and

01:29:27.339 --> 01:29:27.349
still doing this and also and all and
 

01:29:27.349 --> 01:29:29.799
still doing this and also and all and
also a professor Scott mentioned we are

01:29:29.799 --> 01:29:29.809
also a professor Scott mentioned we are
 

01:29:29.809 --> 01:29:33.040
also a professor Scott mentioned we are
not only doing the analysis for Tokyo

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:33.050
not only doing the analysis for Tokyo
 

01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:37.140
not only doing the analysis for Tokyo
but also wanna do utilize this poor

01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:37.150
but also wanna do utilize this poor
 

01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:41.529
but also wanna do utilize this poor
promote other cities like Tokyo yeah

01:29:41.529 --> 01:29:41.539
promote other cities like Tokyo yeah
 

01:29:41.539 --> 01:29:44.560
promote other cities like Tokyo yeah
well it already we should just run

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:44.570
well it already we should just run
 

01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:48.310
well it already we should just run
from the well now only 35 cities some

01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320
from the well now only 35 cities some
 

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.740
from the well now only 35 cities some
opposite is a while requested to us to

01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:50.750
opposite is a while requested to us to
 

01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:53.350
opposite is a while requested to us to
make ranking and some city said why our

01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360
make ranking and some city said why our
 

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:56.770
make ranking and some city said why our
city is you know adopt in this list so

01:29:56.770 --> 01:29:56.780
city is you know adopt in this list so
 

01:29:56.780 --> 01:30:01.120
city is you know adopt in this list so
now we found that many cities are now

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:01.130
now we found that many cities are now
 

01:30:01.130 --> 01:30:04.379
now we found that many cities are now
trying to find their you know big points

01:30:04.379 --> 01:30:04.389
trying to find their you know big points
 

01:30:04.389 --> 01:30:05.690
trying to find their you know big points
under

01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:05.700
under
 

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:07.910
under
points and that should be important to

01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920
points and that should be important to
 

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:10.400
points and that should be important to
make for them to make a new policy but

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:10.410
make for them to make a new policy but
 

01:30:10.410 --> 01:30:16.260
make for them to make a new policy but
this out

01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:16.270
 

01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:19.600
it's fascinating fascinating study and

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:19.610
it's fascinating fascinating study and
 

01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:21.010
it's fascinating fascinating study and
index and it's interesting that you've

01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:21.020
index and it's interesting that you've
 

01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:22.450
index and it's interesting that you've
now chosen to choosing to do this

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:22.460
now chosen to choosing to do this
 

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:25.900
now chosen to choosing to do this
intercity index hi let's try to

01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:25.910
intercity index hi let's try to
 

01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:28.480
intercity index hi let's try to
understand though the way to think about

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:28.490
understand though the way to think about
 

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:30.970
understand though the way to think about
the meaning of all of this in terms of

01:30:30.970 --> 01:30:30.980
the meaning of all of this in terms of
 

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:35.110
the meaning of all of this in terms of
cities representing power and because

01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:35.120
cities representing power and because
 

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.910
cities representing power and because
you know it's not like Athens and Sparta

01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:36.920
you know it's not like Athens and Sparta
 

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.460
you know it's not like Athens and Sparta
we're not going to fight cities fighting

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:39.470
we're not going to fight cities fighting
 

01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:43.360
we're not going to fight cities fighting
right so instead the implication is one

01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:43.370
right so instead the implication is one
 

01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:46.930
right so instead the implication is one
of competitiveness right how well we can

01:30:46.930 --> 01:30:46.940
of competitiveness right how well we can
 

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.880
of competitiveness right how well we can
compete with one another but even that

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:48.890
compete with one another but even that
 

01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:52.090
compete with one another but even that
doesn't sindhu a zero-sum game it seems

01:30:52.090 --> 01:30:52.100
doesn't sindhu a zero-sum game it seems
 

01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:54.330
doesn't sindhu a zero-sum game it seems
like there's an idea that they can all

01:30:54.330 --> 01:30:54.340
like there's an idea that they can all
 

01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:57.640
like there's an idea that they can all
do better in the rankings through

01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:57.650
do better in the rankings through
 

01:30:57.650 --> 01:31:01.390
do better in the rankings through
adopting certain policies and that that

01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.400
adopting certain policies and that that
 

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:04.510
adopting certain policies and that that
that that by being higher in the

01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:04.520
that that by being higher in the
 

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.670
that that by being higher in the
rankings that there's some imputed

01:31:06.670 --> 01:31:06.680
rankings that there's some imputed
 

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.410
rankings that there's some imputed
social value there's some social value

01:31:08.410 --> 01:31:08.420
social value there's some social value
 

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:09.510
social value there's some social value
becomes out of it so it's not just

01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520
becomes out of it so it's not just
 

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:12.160
becomes out of it so it's not just
economic value but it's this idea that

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:12.170
economic value but it's this idea that
 

01:31:12.170 --> 01:31:14.770
economic value but it's this idea that
as a consequence tax base is healthier

01:31:14.770 --> 01:31:14.780
as a consequence tax base is healthier
 

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:16.870
as a consequence tax base is healthier
there are better schools that are better

01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880
there are better schools that are better
 

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:18.850
there are better schools that are better
parks there's you know less poverty

01:31:18.850 --> 01:31:18.860
parks there's you know less poverty
 

01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:21.190
parks there's you know less poverty
because there's that implication it's

01:31:21.190 --> 01:31:21.200
because there's that implication it's
 

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.280
because there's that implication it's
not quite overtly stated and one of the

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:24.290
not quite overtly stated and one of the
 

01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:25.840
not quite overtly stated and one of the
places that implication I think comes

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:25.850
places that implication I think comes
 

01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:28.270
places that implication I think comes
out I think is the persistence of Paris

01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:28.280
out I think is the persistence of Paris
 

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:32.710
out I think is the persistence of Paris
in all the data right because if you

01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:32.720
in all the data right because if you
 

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:35.160
in all the data right because if you
it's just fascinating to me if you

major ranking cities that were presented
 

01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:47.490
major ranking cities that were presented
that would probably be the least

01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:47.500
that would probably be the least
 

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:50.500
that would probably be the least
friendly towards a proposal like that

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:50.510
friendly towards a proposal like that
 

01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:55.030
friendly towards a proposal like that
would be Paris right and I just find

01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040
would be Paris right and I just find
 

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:58.870
would be Paris right and I just find
that I find that interesting in the

01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880

think emulate certain parts of Paris in

01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920
think emulate certain parts of Paris in
 

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:09.150
think emulate certain parts of Paris in
terms of the sort of microscale culture

01:32:09.150 --> 01:32:09.160

and so what I'm wondering is that you
 

01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:21.490
and so what I'm wondering is that you
know is it is it an either or in other

yeah one of the things I like about this
 

01:38:39.670 --> 01:38:42.780
yeah one of the things I like about this
project is that it has an emphasis on

01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:42.790
project is that it has an emphasis on
 

01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:47.460
project is that it has an emphasis on
policy and not only an emphasis on

01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:47.470
policy and not only an emphasis on
 

01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:49.680
policy and not only an emphasis on
policy but that the creators of this

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:49.690
policy but that the creators of this
 

01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:51.960
policy but that the creators of this
index understand that it's just a tool

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:51.970
index understand that it's just a tool
 

01:38:51.970 --> 01:38:55.530
index understand that it's just a tool
it's just a tool it's it's one it's a

01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:55.540
it's just a tool it's it's one it's a
 

01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:58.800
it's just a tool it's it's one it's a
diagnostic tool it can tell you how you

01:38:58.800 --> 01:38:58.810
diagnostic tool it can tell you how you
 

01:38:58.810 --> 01:39:01.410
diagnostic tool it can tell you how you
stand in relationship to other cities

01:39:01.410 --> 01:39:01.420
stand in relationship to other cities
 

01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:04.410
stand in relationship to other cities
and secondly it's a policy tool it can

01:39:04.410 --> 01:39:04.420
and secondly it's a policy tool it can
 

01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:08.010
and secondly it's a policy tool it can
identify where you're strong and way you

01:39:08.010 --> 01:39:08.020
identify where you're strong and way you
 

01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:11.280
identify where you're strong and way you
weak in relationship to other cities one

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:11.290
weak in relationship to other cities one
 

01:39:11.290 --> 01:39:12.420
weak in relationship to other cities one
of the things that they didn't talk

01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:12.430
of the things that they didn't talk
 

01:39:12.430 --> 01:39:13.800
of the things that they didn't talk
about is they do something called

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:13.810
about is they do something called
 

01:39:13.810 --> 01:39:16.650
about is they do something called
scenario analyses or what i would call

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:16.660
scenario analyses or what i would call
 

01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:20.160
scenario analyses or what i would call
sensitivity analyses in which you would

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:20.170
sensitivity analyses in which you would
 

01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:22.860
sensitivity analyses in which you would
you imagine that you changed one of

01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:22.870
you imagine that you changed one of
 

01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:25.080
you imagine that you changed one of
those indicators that for example you

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:25.090
those indicators that for example you
 

01:39:25.090 --> 01:39:26.790
those indicators that for example you
added another one way to the

01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800
added another one way to the
 

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.800
added another one way to the
international day of court while you

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:28.810
international day of court while you
 

01:39:28.810 --> 01:39:31.980
international day of court while you
lowered the corporate tax rate you do

01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:31.990
lowered the corporate tax rate you do
 

01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:34.470
lowered the corporate tax rate you do
the analysis and you say okay if we add

01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480
the analysis and you say okay if we add
 

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:36.150
the analysis and you say okay if we add
another one way how does it change our

01:39:36.150 --> 01:39:36.160
another one way how does it change our
 

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:39.090
another one way how does it change our
ranking or if we lower the corporate tax

01:39:39.090 --> 01:39:39.100
ranking or if we lower the corporate tax
 

01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:41.130
ranking or if we lower the corporate tax
rate how does it change our ranking so

01:39:41.130 --> 01:39:41.140
rate how does it change our ranking so
 

01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:43.740
rate how does it change our ranking so
it gives you a sense mobility to talk

01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:43.750
it gives you a sense mobility to talk
 

01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:47.190
it gives you a sense mobility to talk
about what you might do and what it

01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:47.200
about what you might do and what it
 

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:49.530
about what you might do and what it
might what consequence it might deliver

01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:49.540
might what consequence it might deliver
 

01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:52.430
might what consequence it might deliver
for you in relationship to the index

01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440
for you in relationship to the index
 

01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:55.500
for you in relationship to the index
that I like but I have some problems

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:55.510
that I like but I have some problems
 

01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:58.170
that I like but I have some problems
with this too and the problems I have

01:39:58.170 --> 01:39:58.180
with this too and the problems I have
 

01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:00.750
with this too and the problems I have
with it are have to do with urban space

01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:00.760
with it are have to do with urban space
 

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:03.380
with it are have to do with urban space
and with what I'll call urban time on

01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:03.390
and with what I'll call urban time on
 

01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:06.090
and with what I'll call urban time on
the space side this goes back to a point

01:40:06.090 --> 01:40:06.100
the space side this goes back to a point
 

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:07.950
the space side this goes back to a point
PETA made about how do you think about

01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:07.960
PETA made about how do you think about
 

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:10.350
PETA made about how do you think about
cities if you think of them is what I

01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:10.360
cities if you think of them is what I
 

01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:13.530
cities if you think of them is what I
call isolates there's individualistic

01:40:13.530 --> 01:40:13.540
call isolates there's individualistic
 

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:17.940
call isolates there's individualistic
and fully formed and really somewhat

01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:17.950
and fully formed and really somewhat
 

01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:20.430
and fully formed and really somewhat
disconnected to other cities then that's

01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:20.440
disconnected to other cities then that's
 

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:22.200
disconnected to other cities then that's
one thing but if you think of them as

01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:22.210
one thing but if you think of them as
 

01:40:22.210 --> 01:40:26.250
one thing but if you think of them as
related in networks rather than is that

01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:26.260
related in networks rather than is that
 

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:29.070
related in networks rather than is that
is that when they act there's a reaction

01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.080
is that when they act there's a reaction
 

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.380
is that when they act there's a reaction
by the other entities in the network

01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:31.390
by the other entities in the network
 

01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:33.540
by the other entities in the network
then this changes your whole sense of

01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:33.550
then this changes your whole sense of
 

01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:36.870
then this changes your whole sense of
policy so one could if you think of

01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880
policy so one could if you think of
 

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.060
policy so one could if you think of
cities as network you could say well if

01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:39.070
cities as network you could say well if
 

01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:40.030
cities as network you could say well if
I added

01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:40.040
I added
 

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:42.430
I added
one way what do I expect the other

01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.440
one way what do I expect the other
 

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:44.830
one way what do I expect the other
cities to do well i would expect them to

01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:44.840
cities to do well i would expect them to
 

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:46.840
cities to do well i would expect them to
respond and do something so that they

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:46.850
respond and do something so that they
 

01:40:46.850 --> 01:40:49.690
respond and do something so that they
don't lose their competitive position so

01:40:49.690 --> 01:40:49.700
don't lose their competitive position so
 

01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:51.490
don't lose their competitive position so
that in order to really do a policy

01:40:51.490 --> 01:40:51.500
that in order to really do a policy
 

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.530
that in order to really do a policy
analysis here you can't just look at

01:40:53.530 --> 01:40:53.540
analysis here you can't just look at
 

01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:55.720
analysis here you can't just look at
what you do you have to look at what

01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:55.730
what you do you have to look at what
 

01:40:55.730 --> 01:40:57.840
what you do you have to look at what
other cities will do in response and

01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:57.850
other cities will do in response and
 

01:40:57.850 --> 01:41:00.670
other cities will do in response and
it's very likely that if you add a

01:41:00.670 --> 01:41:00.680
it's very likely that if you add a
 

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.320
it's very likely that if you add a
runway someone else will added one way

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:02.330
runway someone else will added one way
 

01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:04.120
runway someone else will added one way
to there at the National Airport no one

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:04.130
to there at the National Airport no one
 

01:41:04.130 --> 01:41:05.950
to there at the National Airport no one
wants to live there competitive position

01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:05.960
wants to live there competitive position
 

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:08.800
wants to live there competitive position
in this global game so that really

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:08.810
in this global game so that really
 

01:41:08.810 --> 01:41:11.800
in this global game so that really
changes the way you think about making

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:11.810
changes the way you think about making
 

01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:14.260
changes the way you think about making
policy recommendations the other aspect

01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:14.270
policy recommendations the other aspect
 

01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:16.540
policy recommendations the other aspect
of this that's important if you begin to

01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:16.550
of this that's important if you begin to
 

01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:19.090
of this that's important if you begin to
think about cities and networks then

01:41:19.090 --> 01:41:19.100
think about cities and networks then
 

01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:21.130
think about cities and networks then
many of the cities that these cities are

01:41:21.130 --> 01:41:21.140
many of the cities that these cities are
 

01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:25.210
many of the cities that these cities are
networked with are not on the index what

01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:25.220
networked with are not on the index what
 

01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:26.830
networked with are not on the index what
are the important cities for New York

01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:26.840
are the important cities for New York
 

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:32.320
are the important cities for New York

on the index like none of them are on

on the index like none of them are on
the index or if you were going to do an

01:41:41.650 --> 01:41:41.660
the index or if you were going to do an
 

01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:43.990
the index or if you were going to do an
analysis of New York City you would have

01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000
analysis of New York City you would have
 

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.140
analysis of New York City you would have
to bring those cities into the index in

01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:47.150
to bring those cities into the index in
 

01:41:47.150 --> 01:41:49.510
to bring those cities into the index in

can do I mean one of the things we know
 

01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:53.950
can do I mean one of the things we know
about analyzing world cities is unless

01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960
about analyzing world cities is unless
 

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:56.110
about analyzing world cities is unless
they're tightly integrated into their

01:53:20.530 --> 01:53:20.540
competitiveness and about networks
 

01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:23.770
competitiveness and about networks
between cities were Ostia provo post

01:53:23.770 --> 01:53:23.780
between cities were Ostia provo post
 

01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:29.260
between cities were Ostia provo post
index year 2009 we show the three cases

01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:29.270
index year 2009 we show the three cases
 

01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:33.100
index year 2009 we show the three cases
over networks level between cities from

01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:33.110
over networks level between cities from
 

01:53:33.110 --> 01:53:35.760

financial aid countries because of the

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:47.570
financial aid countries because of the
 

01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:52.890
financial aid countries because of the
idea of global circuit of assassins and

01:53:52.890 --> 01:53:52.900
idea of global circuit of assassins and
 

01:53:52.900 --> 01:53:55.750

of course each city has connection each

01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760
of course each city has connection each
 

01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:58.840
of course each city has connection each
other in the world now we have to see

01:53:58.840 --> 01:53:58.850
other in the world now we have to see
 

01:53:58.850 --> 01:54:00.640
other in the world now we have to see
such kind of you friends each other and

01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:00.650
such kind of you friends each other and
 

01:54:00.650 --> 01:54:03.550
such kind of you friends each other and
the last year we did that analysis but

01:54:03.550 --> 01:54:03.560
the last year we did that analysis but
 

01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:06.820
the last year we did that analysis but
this year we didn't the reason is we

01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:06.830
this year we didn't the reason is we
 

01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:10.630
this year we didn't the reason is we
found the connection each other but how

01:54:10.630 --> 01:54:10.640
found the connection each other but how
 

01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:14.110
found the connection each other but how
we could you know Explorer develop this

01:54:14.110 --> 01:54:14.120
we could you know Explorer develop this
 

01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:16.630
we could you know Explorer develop this
kind of a connection so this year we do

01:54:16.630 --> 01:54:16.640
kind of a connection so this year we do
 

01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:19.060
kind of a connection so this year we do
that but still we think is very

01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:19.070
that but still we think is very
 

01:54:19.070 --> 01:54:21.910
that but still we think is very
important issue the networks of big

01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920
important issue the networks of big
 

01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:25.870
important issue the networks of big
cities and this is the data and wherever

01:54:25.870 --> 01:54:25.880
cities and this is the data and wherever
 

01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:28.330

you access to the money memory

01:54:28.330 --> 01:54:28.340
you access to the money memory
 

01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:30.490
you access to the money memory
foundation home pages you can get this

01:54:30.490 --> 01:54:30.500
foundation home pages you can get this

rusty at Roger that the idea of global
 

01:54:33.710 --> 01:54:38.890
rusty at Roger that the idea of global
sub circuit and we found the part of the

01:54:38.890 --> 01:54:38.900
sub circuit and we found the part of the
 

01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:41.530
sub circuit and we found the part of the
story know how we can you know develop

01:54:41.530 --> 01:54:41.540
story know how we can you know develop
 

01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:45.210
story know how we can you know develop
these connections so this is another

01:54:45.210 --> 01:54:45.220
these connections so this is another
 

01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:50.980
these connections so this is another
last year

row before we get to you a question

01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:01.470
 

01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:05.480
hope I have one question actually two

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:05.490
hope I have one question actually two
 

01:55:05.490 --> 01:55:08.810
hope I have one question actually two
questions one question is what do you

01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:08.820

you think global cities impact on

01:55:50.450 --> 01:55:50.460
you think global cities impact on
 

01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:52.870
you think global cities impact on
demographics and family structures in

01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880
demographics and family structures in
 

01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:58.840

those specific cities

01:55:58.840 --> 01:55:58.850
 

01:55:58.850 --> 01:56:01.640
maybe your are the first question you

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:01.650
maybe your are the first question you
 

01:56:01.650 --> 01:56:04.520
maybe your are the first question you
are referring to you like Paris versus

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:04.530
are referring to you like Paris versus
 

01:56:04.530 --> 01:56:07.610
are referring to you like Paris versus
the New York like that right yeah and

01:56:07.610 --> 01:56:07.620
the New York like that right yeah and
 

01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:11.479
the New York like that right yeah and
based on our inner study research so we

01:56:11.479 --> 01:56:11.489
based on our inner study research so we
 

01:56:11.489 --> 01:56:16.070
based on our inner study research so we
found yeah or maybe it's not it's can be

01:56:16.070 --> 01:56:16.080
found yeah or maybe it's not it's can be
 

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:20.870
found yeah or maybe it's not it's can be
also filled but we found so Paris has a

01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880
also filled but we found so Paris has a
 

01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:25.520
also filled but we found so Paris has a
very very big density but consequently

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:25.530
very very big density but consequently
 

01:56:25.530 --> 01:56:28.220
very very big density but consequently
in the very in their area we found a

01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:28.230
in the very in their area we found a
 

01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:34.970
in the very in their area we found a
very few green spaces so and like near

01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:34.980
very few green spaces so and like near
 

01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:37.669
very few green spaces so and like near
before there is a big huge central park

01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679
before there is a big huge central park
 

01:56:37.679 --> 01:56:41.270
before there is a big huge central park
but still are like yeah we found our

01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280
but still are like yeah we found our
 

01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.610
but still are like yeah we found our
Paris has a quite small number within

01:56:43.610 --> 01:56:43.620
Paris has a quite small number within
 

01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:47.209
Paris has a quite small number within
the smaller area so for the green spaces

01:56:47.209 --> 01:56:47.219
the smaller area so for the green spaces
 

01:56:47.219 --> 01:56:50.479
the smaller area so for the green spaces
and but uh they have two big parks right

01:56:50.479 --> 01:56:50.489
and but uh they have two big parks right
 

01:56:50.489 --> 01:56:54.439
and but uh they have two big parks right
and maybe they are these parks are

01:56:54.439 --> 01:56:54.449
and maybe they are these parks are
 

01:56:54.449 --> 01:56:58.220
and maybe they are these parks are
substituting the green space but so but

01:56:58.220 --> 01:56:58.230
substituting the green space but so but
 

01:56:58.230 --> 01:57:01.459
substituting the green space but so but
as we make the city vertical we can get

01:57:01.459 --> 01:57:01.469
as we make the city vertical we can get
 

01:57:01.469 --> 01:57:04.790
as we make the city vertical we can get
more green so it's all up to the

01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800
more green so it's all up to the
 

01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:07.399
more green so it's all up to the
immediate preference so which they want

01:57:07.399 --> 01:57:07.409
immediate preference so which they want
 

01:57:07.409 --> 01:57:11.300
immediate preference so which they want
so and like personally I'm living in a

01:57:11.300 --> 01:57:11.310
so and like personally I'm living in a
 

01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:13.879
so and like personally I'm living in a
tower now and the view is very nice and

01:57:13.879 --> 01:57:13.889
tower now and the view is very nice and
 

01:57:13.889 --> 01:57:17.300
tower now and the view is very nice and
also we get I get the big amount of

01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:17.310
also we get I get the big amount of
 

01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:20.209
also we get I get the big amount of
sunlight and also we have many green

01:57:20.209 --> 01:57:20.219
sunlight and also we have many green
 

01:57:20.219 --> 01:57:23.540
