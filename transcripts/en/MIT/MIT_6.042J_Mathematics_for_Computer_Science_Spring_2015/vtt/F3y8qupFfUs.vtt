00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.840
The law of total probability
is another probability law

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.220
that gives you a way to reason
about cases, which we've

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.120
seen is a fundamental
technique for dealing

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.890
with all sorts of problems.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.542
So the point of
cases, of course,

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:15.250
is that you can prove
a complicated thing

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.550
by breaking it up into, if
you're lucky, easy sub cases.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.810
So here's the way to understand
the law of total probability

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.330
abstractly.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.370
It starts off with set
theoretic reasonings.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.610
Suppose that I have a set A
embedded in some larger sample

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.170
space S. So A is
really an event,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.200
but we're just going to
think of it as a set.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.670
Now suppose that
I have three sets,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.820
B1, B2, and B3 that
partition the sample space.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.985
That is B1, B2, and B3
three don't overlap.

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:47.070
They're disjoined,
and everything

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.480
is in one of those three sets.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.020
So there's a picture of
B1, B2, and B3, cutting up

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.245
the whole sample
space S, represented

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:59.440
by the square or rectangle.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.590
Now of course, these
three sets that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.250
cut up the whole
space, willy nilly

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.360
cut up the set A
into three pieces.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.450
The first piece is the
points in A that are in B1.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.720
The second piece is the
point in A that are in B2.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.800
And the third is the
points in A that are in B3.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.690
So that's why we a
basic set theoretic

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.350
identity that says that
as long as B1, B2, and B3

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.340
have the property, that they're
union is in the universe.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.770
Everything.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.310
And they are pairwise
disjoined, then

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.120
any set A is equal to the
union of the part of A

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.070
that's in B1, the part
of A that's in B2,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.790
the part of A that's in B3.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.090
And this is a disjoint union,
because the B's don't overlap.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.760
That means that if I was
talking about cardinality,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.110
I could add them up.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.880
But in terms of probability,
I can apply the sum rule

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.390
for probabilities and discover
that the probability of A

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.570
is simply the probability of B1
intersection A, B2 intersection

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.830
A, B3 intersection A.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.389
Now the most useful form of
the law of total probabilities

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.020
is when you replace this
intersection, B1 intersection

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.250
A, by the conditional
probability using the product

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.540
rule-- so let's replace it
by the probability of A given

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.730
B1 times the probability of B1.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.646
That's another formula
for B1 intersection A.

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:30.770
And if I do that with
the rest of them,

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.740
I now have the law of
total probability stated

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.520
in the usual way in terms
of conditional probabilities

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.770
where it's most useful.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.550
Now I did it for three sets.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.830
But it obviously works for
any finite number of sets.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.830
As a matter of fact, it works
fine for any countable union

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.330
of sets.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.840
If I have a partition
of the sample space S

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.870
in to B0, B1, and
so on-- a partition

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.020
with a countable
number of blocks-- then

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.490
it's still the case that
the probability of A

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.170
is equal by the sum
rule to the probability

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.464
of these disjoint
pieces, the parts of A

00:03:03.464 --> 00:03:05.130
that are in each of
the different blocks

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.280
of the partition.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.600
And reformulating that as
a conditional probability,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.570
I get the rule that
the probability of A

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.060
is the sum over all possible i
of the probability of A given

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.250
Bi times the probability of Bi.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.800
And that basic rule
is one and we're

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.770
going to get a lot of
mileage out of when

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.500
we turn in the next segment
to analyze and understand

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.892
the results of tests that
are maybe unreliable.
