00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:04.204
- And now it's time to play

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:07.073
Hit Me With Your Mug Shot.

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:10.076
(crowd cheers and applauds)

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.811
The perfect game for you guys.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.046
I think you're gonna
be very good at it.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:15.048
The SmokingGun.com
is an amazing gallery

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:16.516
of mugshots from
around the country.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:17.617
I'm going to show
you some highlights

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:19.119
and for 250 points,

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.087
I want you to speculate
on what the alleged crime

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:24.724 align:start size:88% position:13%
that these alleged perps
allegedly committed,

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:25.658
(audience laughs)

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.127
to get them taken downtown.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.229
- By the way, lawyers
want you to say that.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.398 align:start size:84% position:16%
Where there's
smoke, there's fire.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:32.232
(audience laughs)

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.100
- Good to know.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.301
- If it got past a grand jury,

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.636
they (bleep) did it.

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:38.104
(audience laughs)

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.774
- All right, first one.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.008
This contemplative soul,

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.844
(audience laughs)

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.514
also know as Latino Doug Benson.

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.419
(audience laughs and cheers)

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:54.020
Yes, Travis.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.624 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Sniffed glue,
spilled glue on hands,

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.659
forgot he spilled glue on hands

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:01.127
because he was sniffing glue,

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.129
tried to jack off
in his own mouth.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.598
(audience cheers and laughs)

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:06.733 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Chris] That's
probably what it was.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.269
(audience laughs)

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.604
So he was caught in mid act.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.274
Amazing. Trudy.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:18.211
- This guy is guilty
of promising to take me

00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:19.646
to Chipotle on a date,

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.448
(audience moans)

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:22.949 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then dropping
me off on the corner

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:24.884
with a coupon and
then speeding away.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.153
(audience moans)

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.722
- You didn't chase him down?

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:30.757
- I went home and

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.125
worked it out.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.059
- [Chris] Okay.

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.895
(audience laughs)

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.634
Dangle, do you want
to throw one in?

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:42.502
- No.

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:45.338
(audience laughs)

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:51.611
(audience applauds)

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.951
- You are worse at this
show than Tom Lennon.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:01.721
(audience screams and laughs)

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.759
- But, not quite as gay.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.763
(audience screams and applauds)

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.303
- Next one.

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.139
This professor of criminology.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.773
(Bell dings)

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:21.941
Dangle.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.043 align:start size:88% position:13%
- This is a trick
question Chris because,

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:27.046
(audience laughs)

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.883 align:start size:88% position:13%
I happen to know that
is the actual Hamburglar

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:31.284
without his mask.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:35.989
(audience screams and laughs)

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:41.261
(audience applauds)

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.962
Yeah, it seemed funny before.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.532
- Not funny, points
in rabble, rabble.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:48.034
(audience laughs)

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.769
All right, Travis.

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.105
- I stole the last of
the lembas bread from

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.974
Frodo and blamed Samwise Gamgee.

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:56.176
- Okay.

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.012
(audience cheers)

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.815
(applause)

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:04.417 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Right in the middle
of that sentence

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:05.885
I thought I was having a stroke.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:08.688
(laughter)

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:12.158
Because words just
turned into jives.

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.994
(audience cheers)

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.931
- All right last one.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.966
This unhappy imp

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.802
(audience groans)

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:25.271 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Totally killed the
vibe at the drum circle.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.906
- Yes close.

00:03:26.906 --> 00:03:29.909
(audience applauds)

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:33.947
Dangle.

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:38.051
- He's mostly into
food (bleep)ing.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:43.189
Which on paper sounds like
the perfect crime you know.
