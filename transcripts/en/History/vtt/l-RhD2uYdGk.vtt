[music playing]

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.540
NARRATOR: Jack Begley, Gary
Drayton, and area geophysicist

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.170
Mike West head to
the beach on lot 26,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.120
located on the island's
southwest shore.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.880
They have come here in hopes
of finding historical artifacts

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.380
like the gold-covered brooch
Gary and Rick Lagina discovered

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.420
just one week ago and
which was estimated

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.040
to be as much as 700 years old.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.330
This looks like a
point here all the way

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.500
down there with the boulders.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
This could potentially be--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.210
Yeah, there's definitely
something going on here.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.330
--a landing spot.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.040
Yeah.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.750
And what do people do
when they come up by boat?

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.920
They lose stuff getting
on and off boats.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.210
Yep.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.880
And especially if
they were possibly

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.750
loading and unloading stuff,
let's see what we can find.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.000
Maybe we'll get lucky.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.250
All right, let's
get her going.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.500
All right, mate,
we'll follow you.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.210
OK.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.170
NARRATOR: To assist
them in their search,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.420
Mike will use a metal-detecting
device known as the EM61.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.380
Unlike conventional metal
detectors, which are generally

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.750
limited to an average scanning
depth of between 1 and 3 feet,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.380
the EM61 is equipped
with powerful transmitter

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.790
and receiver coils, allowing it
to sense metal objects buried

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.380
up to 20 feet deep underground.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.580
It also features a GPS device,
which will allow the team

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.460
to record the exact
location of any targets

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.580
too deep to be dug up by hand.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.460
Come on, Mr. West.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.620
Find us something good.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.750
I'll find something.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.290
Think he's got something?

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.000
Any idea of the size of it?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.830
Yeah, something here.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.960
It's quite small.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.170
But in this area
here where I just

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.170
kicked off here a little bit--

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.120
[beeping]

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.290
Yeah, I'm getting it.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.080
It's only reading 4 or 5 inches.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.420
What?

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.290
All right, that makes it easy.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.670
Do you want to check?

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.920
Yep.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.330
[beeping]

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.460
Oh, it's out right there.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.120
I see it.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.420
Yep, I see it.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.330
[beeping]

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.330
What is it?

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.290
Hey, look at that.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.670
A welding rod?

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.620
No, look at this
tip on the end.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.750
Oh, shoot.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.250
That is unbelievable.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.540
That looks like a
bleeding bolt. Wow.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.710
That looks like a crossbolt.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.040
Totally.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.620
NARRATOR: A crossbow
bolt on Oak Island?

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.710
But how did such
an unusual object

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.000
come to be in Nova Scotia?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.880
And perhaps even more
important, who brought it here?

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.380
That is sweet.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.670
I mean, this is old.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.040
We're talking,
like, Templar old.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.790
No?

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.790
Yeah.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.120
That's when they used them.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.790
That could be anywhere
from 1000 to 1500.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.710
Hey, Gary?

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.170
Well, we'll show you
what we've been up to.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.710
What is that?

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.710
It's a weapon or
a crossbow bolt.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.420
Yeah.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.170
Yeah.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.210
Exactly, crossbolt or arrow,
but I think that's a crossbolt.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.710
And if that's a crossbolt,
that is very, very, very old.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.540
And something like
this would have been

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.250
used for piercing chain mail.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.250
Templar, baby.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.420
I'm using the T word.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.170
[laughter]

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.750
I think we were all blown away
by the potential crossbow bolt.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.080
Gary is saying it's
very, very, very old,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.250
and this type of
crossbow bolt was

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.080
meant to penetrate chain mail.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.080
Well, chain mail is medieval.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.420
So it's possible that it might
go back perhaps to the 1200

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.620
or 1300s, perhaps even earlier.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.460
So it's an exciting find.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.920
There's no question about it.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.750
I mean, that is
fantastic, crossbolt.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.790
You guys are smiling now.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.460
We knew you would like that.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.790
That is cool.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.620
That is cool.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.580
This shape might be--

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.750
The head of it--

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.710
--culture
influence or some way

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.290
to define where it came from.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.380
Laird and/or Kelly
Bourassa would

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.460
know something about this.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.960
But you're right.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.880
That's a find right there.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.790
And it's exciting.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.540
It is.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.920
The example.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.540
Well, I don't know
which is more exciting,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.790
this or what yet remains to
be found in the Money Pit.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.290
But it's all about
now continuing

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.500
to search and do research.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.920
I feel like we just scratched
the surface in this area.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.000
I can't say anything but
thanks for all your efforts.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.750
Great day, you know?

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.420
Great day.
