00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.640
if the angles A, B, and C of a triangle
are in an arithmetic progression

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.540
and if a, b and c - lower case a, b and c
denote the length of the sides opposite to

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.050
the capital, the angles A - capital A, capital
B and capital C respectively

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.320
then what is the value of this expression
right over here so let's see if we can

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.449
work our way

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.710
through this, so let's just draw the triangle so
we have visualization of what all the letters

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.779
represent

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.290
so we have the angles A, B and C

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.660
so let me just draw them like this

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.170
so we have the angles A

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.239
B

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.380
and C and then the sides opposites them are the
lower case versions, so the side opposite the

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.040
capital A is lower case a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.000
the side opposite to capital B is lower case
b and the side opposite to the angle capital

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.610
C is

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.870
lower case c. Now the first piece of information
they tell us is that they

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.409
the angles

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.850
capital A, capital B and capital C of the
triangle

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.350
are in an

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.129
arithmetic progression

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.380
arithmetic

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.810
progression

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.880
very fancy word

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.570
but all an arithmetic progression is, is a series of numbers
that are separated by the same amount, so

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.380
and let me give you some examples, so 1,2,3 - that's an arithmetic progression

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.260
2, 4, 6

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.119
arithmetic progression were separated by 2
every time

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.400
i could do 10, 20, 30

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.270
also an arithmetic progression. These are all
arithmetic progressions. So all they're saying

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.080
is

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.272
is to go from angle A to angle B - however much
that is, is this the same amount to go from angle

00:01:35.272 --> 00:01:37.680
B to angle C. So let's see

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.279
what that tells us

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:44.100
what that tells us about or maybe tells us, maybe doesn't tell us anything about those angles

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.820
so if we could say

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.439
we could say we have angle A

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.479
and then we have the notion angle B

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.720
so we could say that B is equal to A plus

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.240
some constant we don't know what that is. it could go by 1, it could go by 2, it could go by 10

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.330
we don't know what it is, so A plus N

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.750
and then C

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.750
would be equal to B plus N

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.550
which is the same thing

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.689
which is the same thing as B is A plus N, so this is A plus N
it plus

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.709
plus N which is equal to

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.489
A plus

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.809
2N

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:23.809
so what does that tell us? Well, the other thing
we know about three angles in a triangle

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:28.439
that they have to add up to a 180
degrees. So:

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.040
this, this and this have to add up to a 180 degrees

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.725
let's try it out so we have

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:36.870
A plus A plus N

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.019
plus A plus 2N, plus A plus 2N is going to be equal to 180 degrees

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.249
we have one, two, three "A"s here, so we get 3A

00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:51.069
plus with one N and another two N: three A plus 3 N

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.769
is equal to 180 degrees

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.849
or you could divide both sides by 3 and you
get A

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.099
plus N is equal to

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.730
A plus N is equal to 60 degrees

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.739
so what does that

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.559
what does that tell us

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:10.370
well A could still be anything cause if N is 1 then A is 59

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.889
if N is 10

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.569
then A is going to be 50, so it doesn't give us much information

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.679
about the angle A

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:20.929
but if you look up here, do you see A+N anywhere?

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:26.039
you see it right over here. B is equal to
A plus N and we just figured out that

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.269
A plus N has to be equal to sixty degrees

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.909
so using this first piece of information we
are able to come up with something pretty

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:33.749
tangible

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:39.489
B must be equal to sixty degrees and you
could try it out with a bunch of numbers these

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.509
could be

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.019
59

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:42.749
60

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:43.859
and 61

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.660
that's an arithmetic progression

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.379
and once again B is the middle one
right over here. These could be 50

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.180
60

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.110
and 70

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.689
could be 40

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:54.859
60

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:55.330
and 80

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.510
but no matter what the arithmetic progression
is in order for these three angles to add

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.629
up to 180 the middle one

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.319
has to be equal to

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.229
has to be equal to 60 degrees. So that was
a pretty

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.939
that's.. we're doing pretty well so far so let's
see what we can do at the next part

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.209
with the next part of problem. I'm trying to save some screen real estate right over here

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:15.819
okay

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.669
so they want us to figure out the value of
the expression a over c sine of two

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.069
C - capital C, plus c over a sine of two A. So
let me just write it down

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:26.419
so we have

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.120
i'll do it.. i'll do it in blue

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.949
a over c

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.819
a over c

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:33.770
sine

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.550
of two times capital C

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.320
plus c over a

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.129
sine

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.550
of two times capital A

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.729
what's that going to be equal to? so, whenever
you see stuff like this you got a 2 here

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.299
a 2 here

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:51.819
frankly the best things you should do is just experiment
with your trigonometric identities and see

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.450
if anything pops out of you that might be
useful

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.660
and a little bit of a clue here the first
part of the problem helped us figure out what

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.279
B is

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:01.689
it helped us figure out what B is

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.489
but right now the expression has no B in it.
So right now this information seems kind of

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:06.220
useless

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.890
but if we could

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.050
put this somehow in terms of B

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.219
then we'll have will will be making progress
as we know information about angle B

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:15.860
so let's see what we can do

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.840
so the first thing

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.439
i would use is

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:22.110
well sine of 2A - let me just rewrite each
of these

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.919
so sine of

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.960
i just say sine of two times anything

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.009
that's just the same thing as

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.789
and this is called the double angle formula

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.209
so this is

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:35.839
i might be wrong i was for the actual
names of them but sine of two time something

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:37.629
is two

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:38.369
sine

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:39.759
of that something

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.620
times the cosine of that

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.990
times the cosine of that something and you'll
see that in any trigonometric book on the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.399
inside cover even a lot of calculus books

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:51.189
let's do that for this the same thing right
over here so sine of 2A over here is going

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:52.339
to be

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.179
2 sine of

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:55.699
A

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:56.539
cosine of A

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.800
that's just a standard trigonometric identity

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.400
and we, in the trigonometric, less we prove
that identity i think we do it multiple times

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.240
then out on front we have our coefficients till we have a over c times this

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.779
plus c over a times this

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:15.400
now is there anything we can do and remember
in the back of our mind we should be thinking

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.030
of how can we use this information that be is
equal to sixty

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.649
so if we can somehow put this

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:21.910
in the form

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.190
got a b here

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.560
when i think about how do you get a b here
I think well

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.479
you know we have a triangle here so the things
that relate the sides of the triangle when

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.490
especially when it's not a right triangle we are really gonna deal with the law of sines or law of cosines

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.509
and a law of sines let me just rewrite it over
here just for our reference

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:41.139
Law of sines would say sine of A

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.520
over a is equal to sine

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.639
of B over b which is equal to sine

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:48.930
of C

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:49.929
over c

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:53.289
And it looks like we might be able to use that
let me just read the law of cosine here

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.050
the law of cosine is c squared

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.849
it should look as a Pythagorean theorem with little
adjustment for the fact that is not a right triangle

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:05.929
So c squared is equal to a squared plus b
squared

00:07:05.929 --> 00:07:06.720
minus

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.889
2 ab

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:10.249
cosine

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:15.479
cosine of C of capital C so it's law of sines and law of cosines, so let's if we can

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:20.710
somehow use both of these to put these in
terms of b which we have information about

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.430
well the first thing is

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.879
i could rewrite this so this is sine of C
over c and this is sine of A over a, so let

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:27.999
me do that

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:29.639
so i have

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:31.870
so i have the 2a

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.770
I have 2a

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.069
cosine of c let me write that separately

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:38.460
so that's 2a

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.809
cosine

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:40.960
cosine of

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.990
capital c

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.949
and then times

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:46.460
sine of C over c

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:46.949
times

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:49.270
with white sine

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.419
of c

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:52.259
that's a capital c

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:57.460
sine of capital c over lower case c, that's
that term and that term right over there

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.809
and then to that I'm adding

00:07:59.809 --> 00:08:03.539
to that I'm adding let me do this the same thing over
here, I have two times

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:05.139
I'm going to separate

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:07.369
these guys out

00:08:07.369 --> 00:08:10.029
Actually I wanted to do the sines so let me separate

00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:13.860
I'm gonna separate this guy and in this guy out

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.839
and so I get plus

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:18.249
2c

00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:18.959
cosine

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:21.180
of A

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.719
times sine of capital a over lower case a

00:08:25.719 --> 00:08:26.589
times sine

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:30.669
of capital a over lower case a and what does this
do for me

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:35.189
Well look at the law of sines
right over there I have sine of C over c

00:08:35.189 --> 00:08:36.230
that's that over there

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.279
and then I've sine of A over a and that's that over
there capital a over lower case a.

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:44.870
they're both equal to sign of B over b so we're making progress

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.309
we started introducing b into the equation

00:08:47.309 --> 00:08:50.990
and that's what we actually have information about

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.370
so this

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.140
It could be rewritten a sine of be over b

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.150
so this is the same thing as sine

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.000
of capital b over lower case b

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.570
and this is the same thing a sine

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.910
of capital b over

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.640
lower case b and they're both

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.709
being multiplied

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:12.070
or both of these terms are multiplying

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.910
are being multiplied by that

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.090
2a cosine of capital c times that

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.810
and then plus

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:19.940
2c

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.920
it's a lower case c

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.340
cosine of capital a times that

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:30.150
so we can factor out the sine of B over b so let's do that, let's factor it out

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.360
so this is the same thing

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.280
as

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.160
it's the same thing as

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.510
2a

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.440
2a

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.650
and I really have a sense of what the next
step is so I'll leave a space here

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.760
2a times cosine of C

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.140
plus this and these are being multiplied I'll have 
some space there

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.770
plus 2c two lower case c

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.189
times the cosine of A

00:09:54.189 --> 00:09:55.880
and all of this

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.440
all of this times

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.050
the sine

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.860
the sine of B over b and we already know that B is 60 degrees

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.390
so we can evaluate this

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.210
uh... pat

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.640
pretty easily but let's just continue

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.459
let's see if we can somehow put this

00:10:11.459 --> 00:10:13.470
right over here in terms of b

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.180
well if you look over here we have 2a cosine of C

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.900
2c cosine of A

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:19.970
it's trying to look

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.730
pretty darn close

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.960
each of these terms look preety darn close to this part

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.040
to this part of the law of cosines over there and actually let's solve

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.400
for that part of the law of cosines

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.820
let's see what we could do

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.760
so if you add if you add

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.670
2ab cosine C to both sides you get 2ab

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.880
cosine of capital c

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.260
plus c squared is equal to a squared

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.930
plus b squared

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.870
or if you subtract c squared from both sides you get

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.790
2ab

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.480
cosine of capital c

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.760
is equal to a squared plus b squared
minus

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.130
c squared

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.020
and this is interesting and you know we can switch around the letters later on

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.480
but this looks pretty darn close to the so what if and this looks pretty darn close

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.050
to this except here we're dealing with
an a instead of the c, we've just switched

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.160
letters around

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.640
and we could rewrite this

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.360
actually let me rewrite it just for fun

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.050
i could rewrite this over here as

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.140
2

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.430
2cb

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.709
not rewrite I can swap the letters

00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:26.620
times the cosine of A

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:32.189
you see I'm swaping the a(s) and the c(s) is equal to c squared plus b squared minus

00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:33.180
a squared

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.630
there's nothing unique about the sides I can do this with all of the sides

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.080
so here

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.840
It's a big c here, you have an a and b out front

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.660
and then you have tha a squared plus b squared minus the small c squared, if you have the big A then you gonna have

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.580
the cb in the front and you're subtracting the a squared right over here

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.730
and this is useful because

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.880
this term right over here this term right
over here looks almost like this term over

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.580
here if we could just
multiply this by b

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.720
so let's do that we can multiply that by b

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.899
but let's multiply

00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:08.240
this whole numerator this whole term by b(s)
if we multiply this whole term by b what do we get

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.600
we get a b there

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.550
we get

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.300
a b there

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.719
and of course you can just arbitrarily multiply an expression by b that'll change its value.

00:12:15.719 --> 00:12:19.100
so what we could do is multiply the expression by b which we just did

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.710
we distributed the b across here but they were also divided by b

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.270
where which so I'll divide by b, that's an equivalent
of multiplying the denominator

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.509
the denominator there not b squared

00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:34.720
that's equivalent of multiplying the denominator there by b. That simple thing is dividing it by b

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.639
We've multiplied it by b divided by b

00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:37.920
That's the same thing

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.330
I'm just turning this into b squared

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.930
now what does this give us

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.000
well we have this term right over here

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.190
this term right over here is now the exact
same thing is that over there

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:55.400
so it is now in a squared plus b squared
minus c squared

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.260
and then this term

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.399
right over here

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:02.249
is now the exact same thing as this thing over here which is the same thing as that

00:13:02.249 --> 00:13:04.240
We're using the law of

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.410
cosines so this is plus

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.750
c squared plus b squared minus

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.310
a squared

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.630
and then all of that times this sine of b

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:17.590
sine of capital b over b squared

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.430
now what does this give us the we have an a squared and a negative a squared things are starting

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.020
to simplify

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.510
a squared negative a squared

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:29.530
we have a negative c squared and a positive c squared

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:33.670
so what are we left with we're just left out with the 2b squared so our whole expression

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.940
has simplified to

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.730
2b squared sine of B

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.730
sine of capital b

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:41.650
over

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.420
lower case b squared

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.710
these cancel out

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.500
so our whole expression simplifies to

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.089
2 sine of B

00:13:50.089 --> 00:13:54.569
and from from the get go we knew what b was we know it's sixty degrees so this is

00:13:54.569 --> 00:13:56.900
equal to two times

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:02.070
the sine of sixty degrees and if you
don't have the sine of sixty degrees memorized

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.490
you can always just break out of thirty sixty
ninety triangle

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.040
so let me draw

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.039
this is a right triangle right over here this is
sixty degrees

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:14.230
hypotenuse has length one we're dealing with
the unit circle

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.159
this side is thirty degrees

00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:19.010
the side opposite to the thirty degrees is one-half

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.880
the side opposite to the sixty degrees is square root of three times that so it's a sqaure root of three over two

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.690
You can even use the Pythagorean theorem to figure out

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.520
when you know one of them you could figure out the other one

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.489
So it's the sine of, sinus

00:14:30.489 --> 00:14:33.820
opposite over hypotenuse so square root of three
over two over one

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.430
Or just square root of three over two, so this is equal to two

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.380
times

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.360
there's a home stretch, it;s very exciting !

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.940
square root of three over two

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.220
these cancel out so we are left with

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.690
the square root

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.770
of three

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.910
that's a pretty neat problem and just in case you're curious this came from the

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.890
two thousand ten IIT joint entrance examination

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:02.730
hard to get into engineering and
science universities in India

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.459
and they gave this example like you know hundreds of thousands of kids and you know the top

00:15:06.459 --> 00:15:09.889
the top i don't know like two thousand actually get into one of the ideas but anyway I just thought

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:11.899
it was a pretty pretty neat problem
