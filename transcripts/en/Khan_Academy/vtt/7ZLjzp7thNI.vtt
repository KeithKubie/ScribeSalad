00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:02.558
- [Voiceover] We're gonna
talk about the relationship

00:00:02.558 --> 00:00:06.249
between pH and pK_a

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:08.362
and buffers.

00:00:08.362 --> 00:00:12.081
And specifically, we're
going to be talking mostly

00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:16.730
about this in terms of the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.850
But before we go to the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.866
which I am gonna assume
you've seen before,

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.239
and if not we have some
other videos introducing it

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.424
and also deriving it,
let's do a quick review

00:00:27.424 --> 00:00:29.277
of what exactly is a buffer.

00:00:29.277 --> 00:00:32.687
So a buffer is something that contains

00:00:32.687 --> 00:00:36.725
an aqueous solution.

00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:41.086
It's something that
contains both a weak acid,

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:44.044
which generically we write as HA,

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:48.920
and it also contains in equilibrium

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.601
the conjugate base of
our acid, so A minus.

00:00:55.273 --> 00:00:57.219
This is, as written,

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:02.030
it's the acid dissociation
on reaction for HA

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.774
and since it's an equilibrium

00:01:04.774 --> 00:01:08.967
we can write an expression called K_a,

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:13.967
which is just the equilibrium
constant for this equation.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.509
And it just has a special
name, 'cause it happens to be

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.500
for the dissociation of an acid.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.190
K_a is just equal to

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.733
H_three O plus times A minus

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.185
all over the concentration of HA,

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:31.151
and we don't include water
because it's a pure liquid,

00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:34.207
so we assume that the
concentration is always one.

00:01:34.207 --> 00:01:38.725
Based on this expression
for K_a, we can, and do,

00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:40.461
in the separate video, derive the

00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:42.555
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

00:01:42.555 --> 00:01:44.700
So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.886
just says that the pH is equal to

00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:51.917
the pK_a plus the log

00:01:51.917 --> 00:01:55.892
of A minus over HA,

00:01:57.313 --> 00:01:59.453
where HA is our weak acid

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:02.606
and A minus is its conjugate base.

00:02:02.606 --> 00:02:04.849
And as you can see up here,

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.312
an acid and its conjugate base

00:02:06.312 --> 00:02:10.245
are just related by the fact
that the acid has an extra H.

00:02:10.245 --> 00:02:13.431
We can rearrange the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation

00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:16.584
to get a lot of different
kinds of information.

00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:17.930
One kind of problem you see a lot

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.790
is for some buffer,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.831
you know, they might ask you,

00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:23.521
oh, what's the pH?

00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:25.536
And then that means you
probably know the pK_a

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:29.172
and you know the concentrations
of A minus and HA.

00:02:29.172 --> 00:02:30.830
The other thing that you can use the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.105
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to tell you

00:02:33.105 --> 00:02:34.538
is the relationship

00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:38.594
between A minus and HA

00:02:38.594 --> 00:02:40.616
which is something you might wanna know.

00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:42.339
A lot of times, you just wanna know,

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:43.835
you know, what's in your solution,

00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:46.143
depending on what you
wanna do to your solution,

00:02:46.143 --> 00:02:47.573
if you wanna add things to it,

00:02:47.573 --> 00:02:49.816
maybe you wanna add some
acid, you wanna add some base.

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:50.856
You wanna know what's going on.

00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:51.929
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:55.407
gives you a really quick
and easy way of doing that.

00:02:55.407 --> 00:02:57.200
So what we're gonna do, is we're gonna

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.329
rearrange this equation
to solve for this ratio

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.247
that we might be interested in.

00:03:02.247 --> 00:03:05.571
So we're gonna subtract

00:03:05.571 --> 00:03:08.984
pK_a from both sides

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:10.674
and that gives us a log

00:03:10.674 --> 00:03:14.170
of A minus over HA.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.696
And I don't know about
you, but I actually find,

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:21.928
well, (laughs) I find logs
not super-intuitive sometimes.

00:03:21.928 --> 00:03:24.269
So I'm actually going
to get rid of the log

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.740
by raising both sides to the 10th power.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.527
So that gives us

00:03:28.527 --> 00:03:32.526
10 to the pH minus pK_a

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:33.956
is equal to

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:38.410
A minus over HA.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.937
So what does this tell us?

00:03:39.937 --> 00:03:42.083
It may not look like it
tells us a whole lot more,

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:43.253
but actually, it tells us a lot.

00:03:43.253 --> 00:03:46.276
It tells us about the
relative relationship and size

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:50.307
between A minus and HA concentration.

00:03:50.307 --> 00:03:53.655
And it's saying that these
two things are related

00:03:53.655 --> 00:03:57.036
to the relative size of pH and pK_a.

00:03:57.036 --> 00:04:00.956
So if we look at this, we can
derive a couple relationships.

00:04:02.786 --> 00:04:05.842
We're saying that pH versus pK_a,

00:04:05.842 --> 00:04:08.995
this relationship, can tell us

00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:12.269
about A minus

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.999
over HA, which is a ratio,

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:18.608
but that in turn we can relate to

00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:23.592
just the relative size of HA versus A.

00:04:23.592 --> 00:04:27.996
So let's go ahead and look
at all the possible scenarios

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:30.564
for these three things.

00:04:30.564 --> 00:04:33.535
We're going to start with the
simplest possible scenario,

00:04:33.535 --> 00:04:38.327
which is that pH is equal to pK_a.

00:04:38.327 --> 00:04:41.058
When pH is equal to pK_a, we're raising

00:04:41.058 --> 00:04:42.943
10 to the zeroth power.

00:04:42.943 --> 00:04:46.031
So anything to the zeroth
power is equal to one.

00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.087
Which tells us that this
ratio is equal to one.

00:04:49.087 --> 00:04:50.953
And if A minus concentration

00:04:50.953 --> 00:04:53.228
over HA concentration is equal to one,

00:04:53.228 --> 00:04:57.129
that means that they have
the same concentration.

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:58.397
I forgot a minus sign there.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:00.413
This is a really helpful
thing to remember.

00:05:00.413 --> 00:05:02.558
Any time you have a buffer

00:05:02.558 --> 00:05:04.573
and the pH of your solution

00:05:04.573 --> 00:05:06.654
is equal to the pK_a of your buffer,

00:05:06.654 --> 00:05:08.864
you immediately know
that the concentration

00:05:08.864 --> 00:05:11.660
of your acid and its
conjugate base are the same.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.832
And this comes up a lot not
just when you're talking

00:05:13.832 --> 00:05:15.750
about buffers by themselves, but also when

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.161
you're doing titrations.

00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:18.656
And the point in your titration

00:05:18.656 --> 00:05:21.257
where the HA is equal to A minus

00:05:21.257 --> 00:05:24.394
is called the half-equivalence point.

00:05:26.062 --> 00:05:29.833
Half-equivalence point.

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:32.043
And if you haven't learnt
about buffers, that's okay.

00:05:32.043 --> 00:05:34.183
Oh, sorry, if you haven't
learn about titrations yet,

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:35.386
that's fully fine.

00:05:35.386 --> 00:05:37.173
Just ignore what I just said (laughs),

00:05:37.173 --> 00:05:38.701
but if you have, the moral is just that,

00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:42.147
this is a really, really
important relationship

00:05:42.147 --> 00:05:44.125
that is really helpful to remember.

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.172
And I said really a lot there.

00:05:46.172 --> 00:05:48.285
So there are two other possibilities

00:05:48.285 --> 00:05:50.138
for pH and pK_a.

00:05:50.138 --> 00:05:53.191
We can have a pH that's greater than pK_a

00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:55.500
for your buffer, and you can have a pH

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.649
that is less than you
pK_a for your buffer.

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:01.510
So if your pH is bigger than your pK_a,

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.265
then this term up here,

00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:06.159
10 to the pH minus pK_a,
is going to be positive.

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.429
And when you raise 10
to a positive number,

00:06:13.752 --> 00:06:16.366
when you raise 10 to a positive number,

00:06:16.366 --> 00:06:19.237
you get a ratio that is

00:06:19.237 --> 00:06:22.683
greater than one.

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:27.572
So if our ratio A minus over HA

00:06:27.572 --> 00:06:31.896
is greater than one, that tells us that

00:06:31.896 --> 00:06:35.959
A minus, the numerator,
is actually greater than

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:38.573
the denominator, HA.

00:06:38.573 --> 00:06:39.952
So if you know the pH

00:06:39.952 --> 00:06:43.365
and you know it's bigger
than the pK_a of your buffer,

00:06:43.365 --> 00:06:45.250
buffer's acid, to be more specific,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.201
then you immediately know that you have

00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:49.444
more conjugate base around than your acid.

00:06:49.444 --> 00:06:53.052
The last scenario, pH is less than pK_a,

00:06:53.052 --> 00:06:55.360
well in that case, we're raising 10

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.481
to a negative number, because

00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:02.329
we're subtracting a bigger
number from a smaller number.

00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:04.749
And that means that our ratio,

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:08.997
A minus over HA, is
actually less than one.

00:07:08.997 --> 00:07:12.125
So that tells us that our denominator, HA,

00:07:14.703 --> 00:07:17.501
is actually bigger than our numerator.

00:07:18.844 --> 00:07:20.665
So just to wrap up, we can look at

00:07:20.665 --> 00:07:22.433
the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation

00:07:22.433 --> 00:07:24.546
and we can just look at the relationship

00:07:24.546 --> 00:07:26.724
between pK_a and pH,

00:07:26.724 --> 00:07:28.869
and depending on whether
they're equal to each other

00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:30.592
or one is bigger than the other,

00:07:30.592 --> 00:07:33.160
we can immediately know
what the relationship is

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.872
between our acid and its
conjugate base in our solution.

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.887
It's very easy to derive.

00:07:37.887 --> 00:07:39.350
We did it in just a few minutes,

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.463
so it's okay if you don't
remember this all the time.

00:07:41.463 --> 00:07:43.933
I usually just remember
that pH equals pK_a

00:07:43.933 --> 00:07:45.689
means you have the same concentration,

00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:49.182
and then, if I forget, I will
derive the other relation.
