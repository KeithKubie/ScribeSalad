00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.030
DIANA SAVIT: I did
not think, very much,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.470
about what would Jewish
life be like, there.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.800
ARIEL FUTTER: I really wanted
a strong Jewish community,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.200
but not something so big
that I would get lost in it.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.680
SHILPA NADIMPALLI KOBREN:
When I came to Princeton,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.820
I was not Jewish.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.360
BENJY GERUT: I had the option
of choosing which Rosh Hashanah

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.680
service I wanted to go to.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.300
SHIRA COHEN: I knew
that being Jewish --

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.290
and being Jewish at
Princeton, and beyond --

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.680
was incredibly important
to me before I got here.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.140
I just didn't know
what that meant.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.390
LEN BERMAN: And I remember,
when I was applying there,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.640
when I'd go there -- and,
I think, plenty of people

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.210
have his experience -- it's like,
what nice Jewish boy would

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.330
go to Princeton University?

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.750
There was still a difference
between people's perceptions

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.720
of the University, and
the reality of what

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.790
it was like to be Jewish there.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.910
DAVID LANGER: My grandfather,
Marcus Lester Aaron,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.290
Class of 1920, wrote,
during his time

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.580
at Princeton from 1916 to 1920.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.500
JULIA LANGER: "For the
last six or eight weeks

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.250
a few of my friends
have been meeting here

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.690
in my room regularly every
Friday evening for service."

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.110
DAVID LANGER: "I think I
can say, without the slightest

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.690
exaggeration, that there can be
no more broad-minded institution

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.560
of higher learning, or any other
kind of learning, anywhere,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.500
than Princeton.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.540
JULIA LANGER: In one of
the letters from November

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.280
of his freshman year, he talks
about hanging up his banner

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.680
for the first time -- his
class banner, in 1920,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.100
and it's hung in my
dorm room every year.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.990
It's a nice reminder
of one of the reasons

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.030
why I wanted to come to
Princeton is tradition.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.400
ARIEL FUTTER: My grandfather's
first cousin came to Princeton

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.050
in the early '50s, after
surviving the Holocaust,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.790
when hiding in a monastery.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.960
And then came over to
Paterson, New Jersey,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.740
and decided to
apply to Princeton,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.220
and persisted after being
told that Jews don't really

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.140
get in there.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.850
And then he came here
in the early '50s.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.110
JAMES GREILSHEIMER:
The objective

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.690
of 100%, which I believe
started in the 1940s,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.820
after World War II, was to
prevent a situation where

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.550
some members of a class would
not be selected for any club,

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.470
and would therefore not have a
full social life at Princeton.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.740
MARK BIDERMAN: Every club
had to interview everybody --

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.370
once or twice, I think,
was the rule at that point.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.910
And then they'd
slowly cut people.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.960
JAMES GREILSHEIMER: I was a
member of the sophomore Bicker

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.460
Committee.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.240
And I saw that, the people
who were not getting bids,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.810
that a large number of the
people in trouble, were Jews.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.270
MARK BIDERMAN: You
know, and I only

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.280
got a bid from one of them,
which was, at the time,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.910
considered in the lower tier.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.400
JAMES GREILSHEIMER: And
I thought that something

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.180
should be done about it.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.000
And I went public with it.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.990
These clubs were
really a very important,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.570
an integral, part of Princeton.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.980
And, therefore, it was part of
Princeton as an institution,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.220
and that discrimination
should not be allowed.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.320
And I said to President
Goheen, this is just wrong,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.580
it cannot be tolerated, it sends
out the wrong message about

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.460
Princeton, everywhere.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.990
And something should be done.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.340
And you're the person to do it.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.100
I mean, almost, I'm reliving
some of that conversation.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.080
I mean, done in a
very respectful way,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.660
but there was no
missing my meaning.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.020
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.730
ARIEL FUTTER: For me, thinking
about what the Orthodox

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.690
Jewish community looks
like was really important,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.380
and what daily services
were going to look like,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.920
and how large those
were going to be.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.310
DIANA SAVIT: My first
year, before Stevenson Hall

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.180
opened with the kosher facility,
the kosher dining option

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.410
was to eat at Yavneh
House, off campus.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.870
ARIEL FUTTER: In the orthodox
community, we call it Yavneh.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.170
And it's been around for
over 50 years, at this point.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.960
TOBY ROBISON: Of the
early years of Yavneh,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.050
were on Olden Street.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.940
But they had moved closer
to us and 46 Wiggins.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.450
Then they had this kosher
house, and it was very nice.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.230
It wasn't exactly
University rules.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.990
There was one cook who
provided all three meals.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.690
And if you came to
morning services,

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.360
you were invited to
stay to breakfast.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.660
DIANA SAVIT: It was
a very small group,

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.120
largely graduate students.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.970
And I felt I was really
being removed from my peers,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.590
and I wasn't forming a community
with other students on campus,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:08.580
Jewish and non-Jewish.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.940
Because, mostly, you form
a community with the people

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.270
you eat with, and live with.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.300
ELAINE ROBISON: If you had a
kosher eating house on campus,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.150
supported by the
University, that

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.040
would be a magnet
for undergraduates.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.740
TOBY ROBISON: But then, the
University put a lot of money

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.280
into setting up a kosher
dining hall at 83 Prospect.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.850
And in return, they demanded
that the Jewish community

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.630
come up with 40-meal contracts.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.250
DIANA SAVIT: When Stevenson Hall
opened with a kosher facility,

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.250
it was one of only
three universities

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.650
in the country where
you could eat kosher

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.840
in a university-sponsored
facility,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.830
the other two being the Yeshiva
University and Brandeis.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.150
So, of course, it immediately
became very attractive

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.570
to more observant people.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.030
KEITH KRIVITZKY:
Stevenson Hall was

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.290
a place where tons
of people came,

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.080
who weren't a part of
the Jewish community.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.430
And it was a warm,
welcoming place.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.800
TOBY ROBISON: So it made an
enormous difference to come,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.190
to the students who,
otherwise, would

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.250
have been happy to be eat their
TV dinners that were kosher.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.630
BENJY GERUT: There's
a quiet comfort

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.980
when you have certain pieces
of life that are in place,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.440
especially as a Jewish person,
if it comes to kosher food,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.040
when it comes to religious
events -- prayer, things

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.190
like that.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.930
When those things are
there, you can really live.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.980
ARIEL FUTTER: So an
eruv is an enclosure.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.520
It's, in many ways, like
a fence or a doorway.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.920
And what the University
has been amazing to do,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.000
is to, in many respects,
create that enclosure,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.210
so we can feel part of it,
and contribute and benefit

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.190
from Princeton as a whole.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.650
BENJY GERUT:
Princeton has an eruv.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.130
That's really beautiful.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.330
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.910
WILLIAM G. BOWEN:
It just seemed to me

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.000
that the University would be a
much richer, better learning

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.920
environment, if it had
a variety of people

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.730
from different backgrounds,
different points of view,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.180
interacting easily and
comfortably with each other.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.220
And that has not always been
true in Princeton's history.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.690
In our proper
effort to celebrate

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.360
the successes of Jewish
students at Princeton,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.460
over many, many years, we should
recognize that it's not always

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.870
been an easy path.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.740
I mean, there were
Jewish quotas that I

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.810
was very well aware
of when I came here

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.240
as a graduate student.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.250
So there was not a
very nice history.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.520
And so, it seemed to me,
important to do something

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.560
about that.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.720
I became particularly
aware of this problem,

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.290
at the undergraduate level,
as a result of teaching.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.260
As I talked with
Jewish students,

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:45.080
I became aware that they really
did not feel, in all respects,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.530
comfortable at Princeton.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:52.860
They felt isolated and
really not at home, fully.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.480
ARIEL FUTTER: When
my dad tells a story

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.830
that students put together
a proposal saying,

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.920
let's create a space
for Jewish services

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.930
on campus, that might be
a little bit for bigger

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.940
than what they had a
Murray-Dodge, at the time.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.150
So they put together a
proposal for a Hillel center

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.070
in Chancellor Green,
and presented it

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.370
to President Bowen.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.940
And President
Bowen, at the time,

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.040
said that he liked the
idea, but that wasn't where

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.710
they were going.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.250
But felt that there
was an obligation

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.200
that Princeton had to
foster Jewish life,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.300
and had a historical obligation.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.840
LEN BERMAN: So I
woke up one morning,

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.630
and went to get The Daily
Prince sitting outside my door.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.960
And I remember
seeing the headline --

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.960
Shapiro named president,
or something like that.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.160
And I just stared at
it, almost in disbelief,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.620
that they picked
a Jewish guy to be

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.050
president of this University.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.180
HAROLD T. SHAPIRO: A new
kind of tiger is arriving,

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.200
and I wasn't quite
sure what they meant.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.960
From the Jewish
community's point of view,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.600
yeah, they were very excited
that I was appointed president.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.940
They were also very worried.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.310
Why are they worried?

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.950
They're worried
that I might fail.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:49.450
Right?

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.370
And how would this
reflect on them?

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.710
Once my appointment
was announced,

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:59.450
it was very clear that many
Jewish alumni, in particular,

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.370
wrote me letters saying, how
important this was to them,

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.360
they never thought
this would happen,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.300
that they didn't
imagine that Princeton,

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.200
in the fullness of history,
would ever get to this point.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.390
So, for example,
I think the person

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.800
who actually, eventually,
provided the money

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.720
for the Center for Jewish Life,
this was the reason he did it.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.260
He didn't do it for
any other reason.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:23.400
He just said to me, if
Princeton can change that much,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.500
then I can support them.

DARCIE DUBOIS: The community, here in
the CJL, is very tight.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.630
And it just feels very
comfortable, and very much

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.160
like home.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.040
RABBI DARCIE CRYSTAL: I was
among the class that

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.080
was the first to benefit from
the Center for Jewish Life,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.760
for our entire four
years on campus.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.270
TOBY ROBISON: When
CJL was built,

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.250
it was the first
University building

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.850
you would see as you drove up
Washington Road, toward campus.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.220
SHILPA NADIMPALLI
KOBREN: The CJL

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.390
had a really big role in making
Princeton feel like home to me.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.590
Now, I've undergone a
conservative conversion --

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.990
two years ago, now -- with
everyone singing together,

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.040
and people who were
there to celebrate me.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.460
That's a really when
it really hit me,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.790
that this is the moment.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.000
This is what means a lot to me.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.670
MAYA WAHRMAN: We don't
all have to agree

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.930
or practice our
Judaism the same way.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.830
But there's a place
for all of them.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.540
MASHA SHPOLBERG: I
didn't know that there

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.630
was such a lively
community, with so

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.830
many different Jewish
backgrounds represented.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.440
So that was a great thing
to discover, upon arrival.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.560
And it actually changed my
perception of Princeton.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.430
SHILPA NADIMPALLI KOBREN:
Every Friday night,

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.640
after Shabbat dinner,
everybody would get together --

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.800
either at the Chabad
House, or Hillel,

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.110
or somebody's house on
campus, or off campus --

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.350
and just have
discussions about like,

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.250
what are the ethics of this,
and how do you feel about this.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.310
In that sense, it felt like,
community is a big part

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.860
of a lot of religions.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.580
But for me, for Judaism,
that was Judaism.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.410
BENJY GERUT: Neither
Chabad, nor the CJL,

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.870
or the Jewish
community, generally,

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.870
would be where it is without the
University's efforts thus far.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.080
But my hope would be, that
the University continues

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.560
to want to integrate,
as much as possible,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.020
these things -- in
a way that allows

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.560
them to completely flourish.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.620
KEITH KRIVITZKY: I really want
to acknowledge Jim Diamond --

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.960
Rabbi Jim Diamond.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.060
His passing was a tremendous
loss for the Jewish community,

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.670
and for the
University community.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:49.350
He was an amazing thinker, a
mensch -- someone who's just

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.690
a great person, all around.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.230 position:61%
RABBI DARCIE CRYSTAL: Rabbi Diamond was
somebody that I looked up to.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.100
I always saw him as a mentor.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.100
And, I think, he
really encouraged me

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.520
in terms of my own
leadership, and in terms

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.560
of pursuing a career in the
rabbinate after Princeton.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.160
MAYA WAHRMAN: There are
so many rich opportunities

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.070
for learning about Jewish
texts, about Jewish history,

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:23.090
and just getting a much richer
picture, of not only what

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.840
Judaism is, but
how I would want it

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.050
to interact with my own life.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.130
MARK BIDERMAN: I think the
University's commitment

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.680
to the program has
been fantastic.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.110
And I think the
involvement of the faculty,

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.520
and now the younger
generation of faculty --

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.480
which is so impressive -- was
started by a corps of faculty,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.190
now many of whom have retired.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.190
And there's a whole new
cadre, which is just terrific,

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.030
to see it grow.

CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER:
I had an amazing discovery

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.700
when I was helping my son
with a family history project.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.180
Found out that my
mother, who had

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.010
kept this secret throughout
her life, was Jewish,

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.080
and that I was Jewish.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.200
And that's been a very
meaningful discovery for me,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:03.770
in my life.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.610
And it certainly has affected
my relationship to Jewish life

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:07.700
at Princeton.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.790
In my first year as
president, the students

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.950
invited me to participate
in their all-night talk

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.220
show, which was called the
All-Nighter with David Drew.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:19.540
And they had found out
about my recent discovery

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.810
that I was Jewish.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.750
And so they asked me whether or
not I had been bar mitzvahed.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.340
And of course, I hadn't.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.190
And then they bar
mitzvahed me on stage,

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.620
in a wild, three-minute
celebration,

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.140
that took all the main elements
of a Long Island bar mitzvah,

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.600
and brought them on
to a Princeton stage,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.390
and condensed them.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.340
At the end of it, they were
hoisting me up in a chair.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.210
They were having fun.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.260
I was kind of having fun.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.340
Their parents were very
worried, in the front row,

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.090
that they were about
to drop the president

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.890
of the University on the stage.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.690
But it was one of the
most memorable experiences

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.310
that I've had as a
Princeton president.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.810
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.940
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER:
It's wonderful to be

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.430
able to celebrate 100
years of Jewish life,

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.350
and recognize all that's
happened in the past.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.440
We are recognizing that we have
a lot of traditions that we

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.040
have celebrated for a long
time, at Princeton, and newer

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.810
traditions, and ways of thinking
about the institution, that

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.070
are equally meaningful,
and add to the Princeton

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.510
that we are today, and
the Princeton that we

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.560
want to be in the future.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.330
I think this conference
is a special opportunity

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.690
to make that happen.
