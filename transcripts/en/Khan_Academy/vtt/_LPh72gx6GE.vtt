00:00:00.496 --> 00:00:02.120
What I want to explore
in this video is

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.560
the different ways of
measuring the amount of money

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.730
we have in circulation.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.190
So we're going to start
things with our Central

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.630
Bank in the US.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.360
This would be the
US Federal Reserve.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.340
And let's say that
they print $4.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.830
And we're going to focus, just
for visualization purposes,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.400
on that they're
doing it physically.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.244
They could also do
it electronically.

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:25.160
But we're just going to
focus on the physical.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.118
And the way that they
get this into circulation

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:29.100
is it they'll take
these $4 and they'll

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.240
go buy securities in the
open market, normally

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.310
very safe and very
liquid securities.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.540
Liquid means it's very
easy to buy and sell

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.500
those securities in
large quantities.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.050
For example,
government treasuries

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.880
is a liquid security,
or liquid asset.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.761
PEZ dispensers would
not be a liquid asset.

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:47.510
If I bought a billion
dollars worth of PEZ

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.780
dispensers it would be very
hard for me to sell-- one

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.960
it would be very hard for me
to buy a billion dollars worth.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.668
And it would be even
probably even harder

00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:57.060
for me to sell a billion dollars
worth in any short or medium

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.042
timeframe.

00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:00.500
So the Central Bank goes out,
and let's say they go and buy

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.210
one liquid security for $4.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.300
So this is a security
right over here.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.510
And the person that they
bought the security from

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.152
decides to deposit it in a bank.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.110
They could either directly
deposit it in a bank

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.630
or they could use
that money that they

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.600
got from selling their
security to buy things,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.183
and the person they
bought things from

00:01:16.183 --> 00:01:17.330
could deposit it in a bank.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.371
But one way or another we
can imagine it all gets

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.050
deposited in a bank.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.810
So this is our private bank.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.900
I'll call this private
bank number one.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.760
So now all of these
dollars are transferred

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.960
to private bank number one.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.040
And they are no longer--
the Federal Reserve,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.250
or the Central Bank,
in the general case,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.380
is no longer in
possession of them.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.114
They've been transferred
right over here.

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:45.530
And I want to cross
these out just

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.540
so we can keep track of things.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.670
Now when they deposit it
in private bank number one,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.000
they said, well, I need three
of these dollars on demand.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.880
And I want to write
checks against them.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.979
So they put three of these
dollars in a checking account.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.270
There are at three of these
dollars a checking account.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:13.390
So checks up too-- so
write checks up to $3.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.490
And so they can get a
little bit more interest,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.090
and the bank's willing to give
a little bit more interest

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.923
on a savings account
because they don't have

00:02:18.923 --> 00:02:22.530
to keep the reserves, they
put $1 into a savings account.

00:02:25.214 --> 00:02:27.630
And they cannot write checks
against that savings account.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.296
Now there are special
circumstances now,

00:02:29.296 --> 00:02:32.380
but for simplicity, let's just
say that they cannot write

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.880
checks.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.921
There are some that have
restricted check writing

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.200
and things like that now.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.920
So this bank says, OK,
well, this dollar, I

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.920
don't have to even have
any reserves against it.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.128
I could loan out this dollar.

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:43.680
And the person they
lend it to, let's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.130
say that they immediately go and
deposit it into another bank.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.830
So they immediately go and
deposit this in private bank,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.550
I'll call this private bank two.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.920
So it's no longer
in private bank one.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.120
Let me draw a private bank two.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.880
Private bank two is
a right over here.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.690
Private bank number two.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.470
And they deposit it
into a savings account

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.540
in private bank number two.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.710
And let's say all of
this, out of all of this,

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.460
the bank says, well,
this is a demand deposit,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.960
I have to keep some reserves.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.640
This is a fractional
reserve system.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.670
But I can lend out, in the
US, I could lend out up to 90%

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.270
of this.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.000
And maybe this bank is a
little bit more conservative,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.680
They only lend out 2/3 of this.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.737
So they lend out
$2 out of these $3

00:03:27.737 --> 00:03:29.570
And let's say the person
they let it do also

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.910
happens to deposit it
in private bank number

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.700
two, just coincidentally.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.060
So these two also end up
in private bank number two.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.250
And so they're no longer
in private bank number

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.760
one, although this person could
still write checks up to $3.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.420
And now here in
private bank number

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.045
two-- and let's say
these are deposited

00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:53.590
in a checking account.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.260
These are deposited right over
here in a checking account.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.910
Now private bank number two,
it can do a couple of things.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.160
In this checking account it
has to keep some reserves.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.310
Let's say it's even
more conservative.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.018
It only decides to
lend out half of this,

00:04:06.018 --> 00:04:08.280
even though it
could lend out 90%.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.264
And so it lends out
one of these dollars.

00:04:11.264 --> 00:04:13.680
And the person that they lend
it to just takes that dollar

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.860
and they put it in their wallet.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.360
So they just put
it in their wallet.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.594
And they could also lend
out this entire savings.

00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:21.010
And let's just say
that the person

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.370
that they lend that
$1 in savings to also

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.370
puts it in their wallet.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.790
And notice, the original
$4 are still there.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.890
One, two, three, four.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.870
Now, and just to be clear,
this person right over here can

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.420
write checks up to $3 .

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.290
And this person
right over here can

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.770
write checks-- let me do
that same checking account

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:53.350
color-- they can
write checks up to $2.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.780
Now let's think about the
different forms of money

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.770
there are here.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.500
Well, we could think of money in
a very, very narrow way, which

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.200
is just what did the Central
Bank print, or create

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.210
electronically as electronic
reserves of its member banks?

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.710
But for simplicity
here you can just

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.060
think about the physical
currency that it printed,

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.610
its base money.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.410
And so that, often, is just
referred to as base money.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.370
And in the US and
other countries

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.310
it's often the same thing as M0.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.640
There's slight differences
from country to country.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.560
And in this example, as soon
as they printed it and put it

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.090
into circulation, that was $4.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.460
We had $4 of base money.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.770
And that's obvious because
as soon as they printed this

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.311
and they bought the
security with it,

00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:38.610
and it was in circulation, that
$4 could be used to buy things.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.770
It could be used to
facilitate transactions.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.050
Now that clearly isn't
all of the stuff that

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.460
can be used as money in this
little universe we created.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.130
This guy, you have the
$4 but these people

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.540
can also write checks
right over here.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.360
And so we can have a slightly
broader definition of money.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.350
And over here, we
will call it M1.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.850
And here, there's a couple of
ways you could think about it.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.300
You could think about it as
all of the currency that's

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.700
in people's pockets plus all of
the check writing capabilities.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.200
So if you view it
that way it, would

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.340
be this $2 plus $5 of
check writing capabilities

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.520
right over here.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.660
So you could have $2
of physical currency

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.520
that's in people's wallets,
not in bank reserves,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.400
plus the $5 of check
writing capability,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.460
which would give you $7.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.580
Another way you
could view it, you

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:35.390
could view it as M0
plus checkable deposits.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.396
I'll just write checks
here, plus-- well

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:39.770
I'll write-- checkable deposits.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.410
But if you do that,
you are now double

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.620
counting because
some of the M0 is

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.002
reserves in the
checkable deposits.

00:06:46.002 --> 00:06:47.960
Or you could say some of
the checkable deposits

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.110
is held as reserves for M0.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.155
So then you would have to
subtract out the bank reserves.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.239
And so then you would
get $4 because we

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:01.280
don't want to double count
these right over here.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.200
You would get M0 is $4.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.420
And I want to do that in white.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.690
M0 is $4.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.080
The checkable deposits is $5.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.580
Let me do that in the pink.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.610
Plus the $5.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.070
And then you would want to
subtract out the reserves.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.270
And the reserves here, there
are $2 of the reserves.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.080
So minus $2.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.920
And you would get
yourself back to the $7.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.420
And the whole point of this is
so you're not double counting

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.878
something, you're not double
counting this right over here,

00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:41.430
as part of checkable
deposits and part of the M0.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.480
You're not using this twice.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.660
It's not part of the base money.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.010
It is both the base money
and checkable deposits.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.790
And we don't want
to count it twice.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.272
So the simplest
way to think about

00:07:51.272 --> 00:07:53.480
is, well, what can be used
in this broader definition

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.110
to facilitate transactions?

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.410
These $2 in people's
pockets, and this ability

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.550
to write up to $5 of checks.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.160
So that's this view
right over here.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.120
And if we want to get
even broader than that,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.806
we can get to
something called M2.

00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:08.680
And here we could say,
OK, what's immediately

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.280
usable to facilitate a
transaction right now?

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.260
So that would be our M1.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.250
So that would be our $7 of M1.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.400
Plus things that can be
easily converted to M1.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.220
So for example, these
savings accounts

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.110
can be easily converted
to checking accounts.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.530
It might only take
a couple of days.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.920
There might be
some restrictions.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.025
But it can be converted.

00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:29.400
And when it gets converted
will change the bank's reserve

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.770
requirements a little bit.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.360
But it will allow, if
this person converts it

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.169
they will have the ability
to write more checks.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.909
So M2 includes M1
plus things that

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.740
are very easy to convert to M1.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.515
And so they'll include things
like savings accounts, money

00:08:45.515 --> 00:08:47.640
market accounts, which I
won't go into detail here.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.190
But they're really kind
of similar in that you

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.470
get slightly higher
interest, but there

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.440
are restrictions on your
ability to access it.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.480
But it's not too hard to turn
it into checking accounts.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.070
And small dollar value
time deposit, CD accounts.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.070
But for the sake of
simplicity, in this example,

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.990
it would be the saving accounts.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:09.620
So it would be our
$7 of M1, plus the $2

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.180
of savings accounts
right over here.

00:09:15.527 --> 00:09:17.110
So this is just to
give you a picture.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.190
When someone talks
about the money

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.380
supply you really
have to say, well,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.504
what are you talking about?

00:09:20.504 --> 00:09:23.680
The most typical one is that
you're really talking about M1,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.060
because this is the stuff that's
directly usable to facilitate

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:27.880
transactions.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.588
Things like the ability
to write a check,

00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:31.520
or dollar bills in
someone's wallet.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.310
But they might be talking about
base money, M0, narrow money,

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.930
always of referring
to the same thing,

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.070
especially in the United States.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.410
Or they might be referring
to something even broader.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.785
And there are
broader definitions

00:09:41.785 --> 00:09:44.400
even than M2,
although M3, they've

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.720
stopped reporting about it.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.630
But M3 would have things
that are a little bit further

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.760
from being true money, from
being a checking account.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.980
But they are already
fairly liquid

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.130
and so they'll include
other types of assets.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.880
But the Fed has
stopped reporting

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.420
this in the recent past.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.130
So these are the ones that
are typically referred to.
