00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
Vsauce!

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.110
Kevin here.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.540
I’ll sell you this 100 dollar bill for 1
dollar.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.629
Seriously, that’s a pretty amazing deal
for you, right?

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:10.910
It’s a free 99 bucks!

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.910
So?

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.910
Whaddya say?

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.599
Do we have a deal?

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:15.599
Great!

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.599
Here ya go...

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:17.599
What was that?

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:18.599
Huh?

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.080
Oh, it sounds like your friend Billy will
give me 5 bucks for my 100 dollar bill.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.050
And that’s a better deal for me.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.050
So...

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.160
Billy, you've got yourself a...

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160
Hey!

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.160
Hey!

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.160
Hey!

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.160
Aren't you gonna outbid him?

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.930
If you bid 10 bucks for my 100 dollar bill
you can still win a 90 dollar profit.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.220
So… aren’t you gonna do that?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.290
Of course you are!

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.290
Why wouldn’t you?

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.830
It’s the rational thing to do.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.310
But there is a catch.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.730
Before we get to that….the concept of buying
money with money made me wonder how much money

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.670
it costs to buy money?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.540
According to the 2018 Federal Reserve currency
budget, it costs 5.6 cents to print a dollar

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.680
bill but 13.2 cents for a hundred note.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.630
It costs 136% more because it has fancier
anti-counterfeiting technologies like this

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.350
blue 3D ribbon thing.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.220
You can buy 240 authentic Monopoly money bills,
the most printed currency in the world, for

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.420
$6.78 or about 2.8 cents per note.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.700
And a $10,000 stack of the prop hundreds used
in movies runs $25 bucks.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.979
Or 0.25 cents per fake one hundred dollar
bill.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.280
But I will sell this real hundred dollar bill
at auction to the highest bidder.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.159
Between you and your friend.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.990
The catch is that not only do I get the winning
bid obviously, because the winner is buying

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.860
my bill, but the second-highest bidder also
has to pay me their losing bid.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.700
So you definitely don’t want to lose or
else you’re just throwing away your money

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.700
for nothing.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.799
So where did we leave off?

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.159
You bid 10 bucks and your friend Billy bid
5.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.010
If he drops out now, that means you win!

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.060
You pay 10 bucks for my 100 dollar bill, netting
yourself a 90 dollar profit and your friend

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.340
pays me his losing bid of 5 bucks.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.770
But he’s not gonna drop out of the game
because he can just outbid you with $20 bucks.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.209
And if you drop out that’s the easiest $80
bucks that Billy has ever made.

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.370
Hopefully.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.480
So you outbid him at $30 bucks.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.239
He goes to $40.

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.239
You go to $50 and I’m about to be very,
very happy.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.900
By the way, if anyone has already figured
out the mess that’s about to unfold here

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.060
-- I’ll explain how you figured that out
in just a bit.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.599
Alright, Billy bids $60 for my $100 dollar
bill and I’ve officially just made a profit.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.269
As long as the winning bid and the losing
bid combine to be more than $100 bucks - I

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.269
win.

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.540
So if the winning bid is $60 dollars and the
losing bid is $50 - I get paid $110 bucks

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.880
for my $100 bill.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.170
A cool $10 dollar profit for me and a gain
of $40 for the winner.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.550
Here’s the thing.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.430
Even at $99.99, whoever wins is still coming
out ahead.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.430
Even if you’re just getting a free penny.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.190
And the higher the bidding goes, the more
money the losing bidder will lose.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.660
So you both keep bidding $70.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.930
$80.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.200
$90.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.990
When you first started this game, $100 for
a buck sounded awesome.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.420
But $100 for $90… not as awesome.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.269
Still totally worth it, though.

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.659
So we keep going.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:49.959
Billy doesn’t want to lose his $80 bucks
for no reason so he bids $100 and we’ve

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.040
officially reached dollar equilibrium.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.989
Billy just agreed to pay $100 dollars for
$100 dollars.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.599
The profit incentive to keep bidding is now
gone.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:09.260
But minimizing the loss compels you to bid
$110 dollars because that way you’re only

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.250
overpaying $10 dollars for my $100 dollar
bill and you’re not losing your $90 bid.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.629
But Billy doesn’t want to lose $100 dollars
so he bids $120.

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:26.539
At this point you’re locked in an endlessly
increasing contest to see who can pay more

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.939
money for my one hundred dollar bill.

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:32.889
All the while telling yourself that you’re
doing the right thing, because based on your

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.910
previous bid, you are.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.240
In a 1976 volume of the journal, “Organizational
Behavior and Human Performance,” Barry M.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.550
Staw called this the ‘escalation of commitment.’

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.139
You’re already in, you know the rules and
you might as well keep going, because you

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.699
don’t want to lose.

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.220
So the bidding grows.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.349
$130.

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.479
$150.

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.620
$1,000 dollars for my $100 bill.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.889
Once we passed the $100 dollar bidding threshold,
I’m the only one who can win this game.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.750
Because you two can’t -- ever.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.789
Before bidding hit $100 bucks one of you could
have won the auction and made a profit, that’s

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.120
why you kept bidding.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.949
That’s why you got into this game in the
first place.

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.910
But as long as everyone playing makes a rational
decision based on their prior action, the

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.939
bidding reaches a point where it’s impossible
to come out ahead of where you started.

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:36.259
It becomes impossible for you to actually
win.

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.460
When Yale economist Martin Shubik published
“The Dollar Auction game: A paradox in noncooperative

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.169
behavior and escalation,” he wanted to demonstrate
the paradox of something with a defined value

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:54.259
like a dollar bill selling for more than that
amount due to perfectly rational behavior.

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.770
He conducted his game at cocktail parties
with large groups of people when quote, “spirits

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.909
are high and the propensity to calculate does
not settle in until two or more bids have

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:04.909
been made.”

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:09.770
He was using $1 bills, and he said that it
wasn’t uncommon for bidding to reach $3

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.210
to $5.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.679
3 to 5 times the amount of his buck.

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:22.629
Once Shubik’s auction begins, it’s almost
guaranteed to ruin everyone but the auctioneer.

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:29.569
And that was his point: some games you can’t
win because escalation based on rational decision-making

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:33.940
drives you to an irrational result.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.379
For those who figured out what was going on
before the bidding war began -- you used backward

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:39.469
induction.

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:43.970
A method of reasoning in which you start at
the end of a scenario and determine which

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.020
choices along the way are optimal.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.159
By the time you worked your way back to the
beginning, you could tell that even if you

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:56.349
rationally did the right thing -- you kept
outbidding Billy based on the commitment to

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.999
your previous bid -- this was going to end
badly.

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:03.569
For both of you.

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.349
In game theory, it’s a no-win situation
-- no matter what choices you make, you’ll

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:09.879
never gain from them.

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:16.469
Shubik’s lesson here is clear: beware of
escalation, and sometimes the only way to

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:21.639
win a game is to not play it.

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.340
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:34.129
Uhh..oooh I'm getting a little squirrel-y
now about what I've done and what I haven't

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:35.899
done.

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:39.090
So this was zero.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:46.909
Um, so I just missed out on one.

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:48.330
Now.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.159
At one.

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:54.000
Oh no.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.419
Um.

00:07:55.419 --> 00:08:01.090
Can we just cut?

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.219
I need to think.
