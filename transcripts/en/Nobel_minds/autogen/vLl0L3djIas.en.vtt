to tell you that that news it isn't
totally incorrect so you have to be a

totally incorrect so you have to be a
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.710
totally incorrect so you have to be a
little bit cautious in believing that

made me think it probably was real but

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450
made me think it probably was real but
 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.850
made me think it probably was real but
of course your initial reaction must

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
of course your initial reaction must
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.270
of course your initial reaction must
always be is it just a someone teasing

I I imagine the Swedish accent helps
 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.929
I I imagine the Swedish accent helps
make it sank yes thought that helps too

make it sank yes thought that helps too
 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.730
make it sank yes thought that helps too
but you have to be a bit cautious I

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740
but you have to be a bit cautious I
 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.720
but you have to be a bit cautious I
think quite it has been it is indeed the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
think quite it has been it is indeed the
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.840
think quite it has been it is indeed the
50th anniversary of that 1962

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850
50th anniversary of that 1962
 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.040
50th anniversary of that 1962
publication of yours so it has been a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050
publication of yours so it has been a
 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.150
publication of yours so it has been a
long time yes well it's perfectly true

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160
long time yes well it's perfectly true
 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.460
long time yes well it's perfectly true
that the the major publication of which

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
that the the major publication of which
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.170
that the the major publication of which
no doubt the award was made was actually

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180
no doubt the award was made was actually
 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.420
no doubt the award was made was actually
it was 50 years ago and the experiment

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430
it was 50 years ago and the experiment
 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.790
it was 50 years ago and the experiment
was course done a bit before that so

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800
was course done a bit before that so
 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.460
was course done a bit before that so
it's I'm fortunate of course to survive

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470
it's I'm fortunate of course to survive
 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.430
it's I'm fortunate of course to survive
long enough to have this amazing honor I

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440
long enough to have this amazing honor I
 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.710
long enough to have this amazing honor I
suppose it says something about the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720
suppose it says something about the
 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.479
suppose it says something about the
progress of science and expand how

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489
progress of science and expand how
 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.610
progress of science and expand how
expectations shouldn't be too great that

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620
expectations shouldn't be too great that
 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.740
expectations shouldn't be too great that
things are going to yield benefit

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750
things are going to yield benefit
 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.470
things are going to yield benefit
immediately I think that's right yes and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480
immediately I think that's right yes and
 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.900
immediately I think that's right yes and
of course one is always looking for

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910
of course one is always looking for
 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.789
of course one is always looking for
therapeutic benefits and I would say

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799
therapeutic benefits and I would say
 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.590
therapeutic benefits and I would say
when the work was done there was over

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600
when the work was done there was over
 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.380
when the work was done there was over
virtually no expectation of any

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390
virtually no expectation of any
 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.070
virtually no expectation of any
immediate therapeutic benefits so the

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080
immediate therapeutic benefits so the
 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.660
immediate therapeutic benefits so the
recognition as it were as the early

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670
recognition as it were as the early
 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.880
recognition as it were as the early
result one can understand has to wait

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890
result one can understand has to wait
 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.130
result one can understand has to wait
and indeed there was quite a period

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140
and indeed there was quite a period
 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.039
and indeed there was quite a period
after the early work when people were to

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049
after the early work when people were to
 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.310
after the early work when people were to
not believe the results so it took about

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320
not believe the results so it took about
 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.890
not believe the results so it took about
nearly 10 years for the major result to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900
nearly 10 years for the major result to
 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.099
nearly 10 years for the major result to
be accepted well quite because it was 50

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109
be accepted well quite because it was 50
 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.140
be accepted well quite because it was 50
years ago and you were just a graduate

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150
years ago and you were just a graduate
 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.640
years ago and you were just a graduate
student at that point I was indeed a

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650
student at that point I was indeed a
 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.620
student at that point I was indeed a
graduate student yes when the major

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630
graduate student yes when the major
 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.599
graduate student yes when the major
result was obtained that's absolutely

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609
result was obtained that's absolutely
 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.440
result was obtained that's absolutely
right that was in 1958 and then I took a

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450
right that was in 1958 and then I took a
 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.319
right that was in 1958 and then I took a
postdoc job in California working in a

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329
postdoc job in California working in a
 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.170
postdoc job in California working in a
completely unrelated field so i left my

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180
completely unrelated field so i left my
 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.660
completely unrelated field so i left my
frogs which i'd grown with my supervisor

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670
frogs which i'd grown with my supervisor
 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.270
frogs which i'd grown with my supervisor
who'd moved to geneva and he and the

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280
who'd moved to geneva and he and the
 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.360
who'd moved to geneva and he and the
technician grew them up so that by 1962

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370
technician grew them up so that by 1962
 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.280
technician grew them up so that by 1962
they were adults and one could publish a

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290
they were adults and one could publish a
 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.819
they were adults and one could publish a
paper to say that these these animals

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829
paper to say that these these animals
 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.250
paper to say that these these animals
derived from nuclear transfer really

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260
derived from nuclear transfer really
 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.520
derived from nuclear transfer really
were absolutely normal so it took a

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530
were absolutely normal so it took a
 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.590

I'm of course extremely grateful to him
for taking that positive view but in his

for taking that positive view but in his
 

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.049
for taking that positive view but in his
work he was I think looking for factors

00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:35.059

explain how you go from an egg to an

would always hope that the basic science

would be supported because so often it
