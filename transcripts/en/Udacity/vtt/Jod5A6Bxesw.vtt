All right, and as I mentioned, if we wanted

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.805
to predefine fields, this is where you would do it.

00:00:03.805 --> 00:00:04.185
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:06.270
&gt;&gt; But in this case, we're pretty much done. Other

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.860
than, why don't you click on the Stage link to go

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.110
back to the stage object? And why don't we add this

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.900
to the page layout so we can see it in Chatter.
