00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.580
And in this case, the correct answer is that class

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.870
diagram and deployment diagrams are the only two UML structural

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.950
diagrams among these four. So the answer to this quiz

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.250
was probably pretty obvious, but I wanted to use it

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.840
also to stress, once more, the difference between structural and

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.560
behavioral diagrams. Structural diagrams provide the static picture of the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.100
system being modeled, presented from different perspective. For example, from

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.630
the perspective of the class diagram and of the deployment diagram.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.760
Behavioral diagrams, on the other hand, provide information on

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.460
the dynamic behavior of the system being modeled, also

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.020
presented from different perspective. So it's important to be

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.020
able to distinguish between these two types of diagrams. This

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.450
concludes this lesson on object orientation and UML. But

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.960
I encourage you to look at the references provided

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.390
in the class notes, in case you want to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.440
know more about object orientation, object oriented analysis, and UML.
