&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Hi
everyone, welcome.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.940
I am Maria Russo, I'm the
children's books editor

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.240
at the New York Times
Book Review.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.000
And I am so happy
to welcome here

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.370
to the National Book
Festival and we're grateful

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.760
to the Library of Congress

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.550
for making it possible
Marisha Pessl.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.950
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Hello.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Who.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.640
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
Thank you so much.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.940
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: It's so
great to have you here

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.240
and you're here on the YA stage.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.540
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.400
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Which is
a new place for Marisha.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.160
As you guys probably
know Marisha

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.490
as an adult fiction writer,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.840
her new book Neverworld Wake
is her first foray into YA.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.560
And the big question people
always have about any YA writer,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.460
but especially one who came
like you from the world

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.890
of adult fiction where
your books, Special Topics

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.970
in Calamity Physics and
the second one Night Film,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.440
I have always wanted to say
Night Train, Night Film were

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.250
so well received and
considered you know

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.210
such incredible works
of fiction.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.940
Why would an author decide
to write for teenagers

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.240
and decide to write YA?

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.900
That is my first
question for you.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.280
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Oh thank
you so much and thank you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.900
for being here and
to all of you.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.030
It's actually something that
I, I always knew that I wanted

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.130
to write for children
even before I published my

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.430
first novel.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.770
Books were such an important
part of me as a young person.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.000
First and foremost, I'm a
reader even before I'm a writer.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.780
So I always knew that I wanted
to contribute to that space

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.290
at some point, I didn't
know how or when I just knew

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.360
at some point an idea
would strike me that seemed

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.670
at home more in the YA space
than in the adult space.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.730
So about two years ago
or so I was working

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.180
on my third adult novel
when I had the idea

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.560
of this very claustrophobic
tightknit group

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.900
of former high school
students stuck not only

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.950
in a remote location
but also stuck in time.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.370
And there was just something
about the nature of this story

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.000
that felt that it needed to
be YA, simply because the age

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.610
of the teenagers I wanted
them just a little bit removed

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.800
from that, you know, the
pressure cooker of high school.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.760
So I really set out to write
this book as a side project

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.870
and was very excited
to enter this space.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.580
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: And
really it grew and became,

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.840
we should talk a little bit
about the plot of the novel.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.810
Just if anyone here has
had a chance to read it yet

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.840
and if not, we're
hoping you'll pick it up

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.760
and Marisha will do
some signing, right?

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.640
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
Yes, I'll be signing.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.810
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: So as Marisha
said, it's set the year

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.100
after the main characters have
graduated from high school.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.070
They are going back to the house

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.920
where they spent a
lot of time together.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.220
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.520
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: When
they were in high school.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.110
And can you give us your
elevator pitch of what happens

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.940
when they all five of them.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.240
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.170
so one year after they've
graduated high school they all

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.710
return for a reunion of sorts

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.120
to a remote estate
belonging to one of them.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.400
And they were all very tightknit
in high school but the death

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.760
of the sixth member of
their group really tore them

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.060
all apart.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.840
So our main character
Beatrice returns hoping,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.750
a year later hoping
to get some questions.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.640
And as all big moments in one's
mind the reality never matches

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.940
with what you've hoped.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.720
So after a series of
short conversations

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.830
where she's really not
getting to the bottom

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.320
of you know what exactly
happened to the sixth member

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.250
of their group they have
a near-death collision

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.790
and they survive
and return home.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.730
And that is when a stranger
knocks on the door and announces

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.380
that they've entered
the neverworld wake.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.770
And you really have to read the
book to find out what this is.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.230
But it is a break in
the space-time continuum

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.420
where they relive the same
hours over and over again.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.840
And that is really how the novel
unfolds, they have to figure

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.820
out how to free themselves.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.610
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Really
what was so cool to me

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.110
about this book is how
it reads like realism,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.270
like you really believe
these people exist.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.170
And yeah, as you can see it's
actually a work of high fantasy,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.480
it's a time travel,
time-space continuum plot.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.040
So how did you balance
those two, those two genres?

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.710
How do make it seem so
realistic when they're jumping

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.680
around in time, they're
living the same day

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.980
over and over again?

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.280
There's all kinds of.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.280
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yeah, so I
always put my, I mean I think

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.060
with all novels you know
even when there is an element

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.220
of fantasy I want it to
be grounded in reality

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.200
as if this is actually
happening.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.990
So it's really just a
question of putting yourself

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.670
in that circumstance and
figuring out how it's going

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.610
to unfold as if you
were actually there.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.860
And the idea started
from the standpoint

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.260
of an unsolved mystery and
I was struck by the idea

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.270
that some mysteries
are unsolved simply

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.920
because of the parameters
of a human life.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.320
And that we can't
possibly synthesize all,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.570
an amount of information
in a given lifespan.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.290
And we also only have 24
hours a day to work with.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.710
So I was thinking what if that
change and someone had infinity

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.020
or at least the perception of
infinity to solve this mystery.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.320
So it really came from there.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.650
And of course there's an element
of Groundhog Day which was one

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.950
of my favorite movies.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.140
And Groundhog Day is such an
endemic part of our culture,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.270
it's just like another
kind of conceit to use.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.330
So I was thinking like you
know getting beyond that.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.740
So the characters
are reliving it

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.270
and they have their different
experiences of what that means.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.140
But I always wanted
a push and see

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.560
from a psychological standpoint
what's beyond simply being

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.740
trapped in time, like you know
how that is going to unfold.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.040
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: You know now

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.970
that you mention it it's
reality, it's science fiction,

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.110
but it also is mystery
you're right.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.410
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.710
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Because
when they go back

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.010
and relive each day
they're trying

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.650
out different theories
about this murder.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.690
They're trying to
get more information.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.990
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.270
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: An increasingly
outrageous, there's just a lot

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.390
of because at a certain point
they realize the stakes are

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.860
so low if they shoot someone,
if they shoot themselves.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.180
The next day they wake up
and everything's the same.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.480
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.110
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: So the
plot gets really kind

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.190
of totally wild by the end.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.490
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right, right.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.790
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: But I mean,

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.090
but you are following the
rules of a murder mystery.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.810
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes, I mean I
think I have such a love affair

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.560
with the murder mystery
as an idea

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.380
because I think it's my trojan
horse to explore other elements

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.190
of what it means to be human.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:17.070
You can go really deep within
the conceit of a murder mystery.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.150
And I'm a big Agatha Christie
fan, she was actually one

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.090
of my favorite authors
and still is in some ways.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.620
So I love to keep the audience
guessing and have that sort

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.960
of clockwork puzzle, but
you can within that explore

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.820
so many phenomenal themes

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.060
with that narrative pull
pulling the reader along.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.360
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Right, right.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.280
And the other theme that really
jumps out besides the sort

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.200
of life, death, limits
of a life,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.670
limits of a day is this
theme of friendship

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.900
between these characters and how
you think you know your friend

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.200
so well.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.720
And this is of course taking
place at a boarding school,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.660
so they really thought
they knew each other,

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.890
they lived with each
other for many years.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.850
And then it turns out
none of them knew any

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.150
of the others really
at enough, at all.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.920
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes, I mean
I think the longer I've been a

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.570
writer I'm just fascinated,
well actually when I was

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.420
on book tour someone
asked me like what I love

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.720
and what I'm afraid of.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.880
And it's a human being because
human beings are capable

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.410
from such a range of acts,
benevolent and truly evil.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.750
So there's such a
range within that.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.460
And the more as a novelist you
work on character and you work

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.240
on human psychology you
realize you can never really get

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.010
to the end of a human
being in terms

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.190
of the core of who someone in.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.920
Personality is so much
influenced by time,

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.490
circumstance, mood, whether or
not someone's had a large lunch,

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.480
so I mean it kind
of all depends.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.800
So within this timeframe

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.380
of infinite time what does
it means to, like continue

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.200
to get to know somebody.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.430
And I mean human beings are
infinite well that's kind

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.080
of what I figured out as well.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.510
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Right,
right, it does seem that way.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.000
The main character Beatrice
especially is an interesting

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.340
study in this because she's
for most of the book we sort

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.110
of take her word
and sort of assume

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.480
that she's the good girl
right, she's the simple one

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.730
that they all not
necessarily look down on

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.180
but they all consider her oh
boring, [inaudible] Beatrice.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.480
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.830
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: And then in
fact we learn at the end.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.130
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.580
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Two fairly major
secrets which we won't spoil.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.880
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
Yes, no spoilers.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.260
But yeah, so I mean I think
especially in high school it's

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.010
so easy to really pigeonhole
people as you were trying

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.070
to make your own way
as a young person.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.650
And even thinking back in my
own life you know thinking back

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.410
to all the different characters
or people that I knew I sort

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.260
of made certain assumptions
about them.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.020
And then later as
an adult I found

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.020
out really what the reality was
of what was going in a friend

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.430
of mine's house or what
you know they were dealing

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.040
with in their family situation.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.590
So you just really realize
as a young person there's

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.150
such a huge universe that
is out of sight and not

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.310
within your daily experience.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.780
Abd so I wanted to explore that

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:15.300
and I think the messages is
really, not that anything boils

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.950
down to a message in the
book, but it's about empathy

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.410
and understanding that there's
so much of personal history

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.730
that one does not now.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.030
So it allows you to.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.330
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: It's really
important for high school.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.630
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
To approach people

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.830
with a little bit more
I would say grace.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.630
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Further
possibilities that each person.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.930
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.230
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Holds.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.020
And another theme that
as if there wasn't enough

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.690
in this book already, another
them I really like that sort

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:48.270
of snuck up on me at the and
was a kind of feminist approach

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.600
to you know men take women's
words and women's work

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.400
and take credit for it a lot.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.740
And as a woman you have to be
really careful, are you helping

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:03.130
by giving your work away to men
who get the credit and the glory

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.570
or are you destroying
kind of both of you.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.810
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes, I mean
I think, I'm so glad you picked

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.810
up on that because I've actually
never talked about that before.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.070
But yes, I think I was
inspired by the fact

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.960
that throughout history women

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.330
through their love
have supported so much

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.790
and allowed others really
to stand on their shoulders.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.200
So there are certainly elements.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.890
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: You
have the male genius.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.190
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.490
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Like we start
the book thinking there are

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.010
these two male characters who
are just kings of the world

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.450
and it's not quite, all is
not as it seems with them.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.750
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.050
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Either.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.350
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
Right, right exactly.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.500
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: So there's
that, really that was one

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.340
of those threads that you
just kind of wove in there

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.430
and then hold at the very end.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.730
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.030
Well some of it it's
interesting,

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.830
some of it is plot ahead of time
and then some of these elements

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.910
of character that you're
mentioning, some of it just sort

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.090
of seeps in kind
of inadvertently.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:01.560
And so those are those things
that you can't necessarily plan.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.860
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: That's true.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.020
Well since you mentioned that
people are always curious

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.010
about a novelist's process.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.310
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:09.610
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Could you
describe what your typical,

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.300
you know, the journey
of the manuscript is.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.390
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
Yes, in a nutshell.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:19.720
So I always start out with
some sort of gut idea.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.900
And it's interesting sometimes
I'll think I have an idea

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.830
for a novel, but then it
will wither really quickly

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.840
over like three days when I'm
starting to think about it

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.630
and I'm like oh it's not big
enough, it's not strange enough,

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.170
it's not wild enough,
it's not different enough.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.660
So you know I'll put
an idea like that aside

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.460
or I'll just write it down and
put it in a drawer somewhere.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.440
But so you start with the
idea and I really do a lot

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:49.740
of research ahead of time in
a novel with pen and paper

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.970
and writing out characters
and writing out plot points

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.380
that seem unusual that I
haven't seen before in a book

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.470
or something that would
be really thrilling.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.500
So just doing a lot of that
character work and plotting

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.410
with pen and paper,
like writing longhand.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.820
And then I'll start to
develop really a buyable

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.940
for the writing, before
I've really written

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.240
on the [inaudible] yet.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.540
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Oh like
a TV show [inaudible]?

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.840
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yeah,
like a TV show [inaudible].

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.110
And with character, plot points,
a few visuals, definitely not

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.670
like visuals of the characters
but things that allow me

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.670
to get a sense of the texture
of the character, like the logo

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.060
on their sweatshirt or what
kind of shoes they would wear

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.130
or you know something that they
would cut out of a magazine

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.430
or something like that.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.010
So I kind of have a
sense of each character.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.300
And then at that point after
maybe I would say that's

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.750
about a month's time, then
I'll start the writing.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.070
And the writing is really
just like an excavation,

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.940
like you just have
to keep going deeper.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.220
And I was giving
writing advice recently

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.840
to someone who's writing
their first novel and they're

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.030
like worried about
their opening paragraph.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.130
And I'm like that opening
paragraph is actually going

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.120
to be the final thing that
you write, so don't even worry

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.560
about what your first
sentence is.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.620
It's like you know dive in
and you're just like you have

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.530
to keep just digging
and digging and digging.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.750
And then when you think you're
finished, then you bring

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.100
in your editor and then
you'll realize you've really

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.520
just started.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.220
There's always a moment
where I think I'm finished

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.810
and the editor comes back to
me and I'm like oh my gosh.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.260
It's really funny, there's

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:27.240
so of writing that's complete
psychological like mind bending,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.600
you think something is good

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.720
and then you come back
later and you realize whoa.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.150
So it's really just about
coming back again and again,

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.830
working with your editor,

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:39.200
and you know allowing
something to kind of solidify.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.470
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Was this book
easier than the first two,

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.590
does it get easier
the third time?

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.320
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
I don't think so.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.460
I mean I think for me I really
like to challenge myself.

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:54.070
If I think that something's easy
then I really think I'm way off.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:58.950
So no, I think there is
was a speed to the writing

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.560
because I did plot a
lot of it out beforehand

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.020
so I was writing much faster

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.130
than I wrote Special
Topics or Night Film.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.270
But I also went back

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.320
and probably wrote the
book two more times.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.230
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Wow and was
there anything especially

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:16.320
helpful that your
editor said or did?

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.670
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Oh
yes, I mean I had,

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.890
I was telling you before I had
a wonderful young adult editor,

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.840
she's obviously different
than my adult editor.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.220
And she was great, I mean
she's, I wouldn't even say

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.460
that she's a young adult editor
she's just a great editor.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:35.070
So she was pushing me really
on, she really pushed me

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.680
on the emotional aspect
of things and I love

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.560
that because sometimes
I can get very

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.280
into like the cerebral
puzzle part of it.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.900
And she's the one who pushed me

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.020
with like the heart,
the heart, the hear.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:52.220
It's harder for me to write
those things because I guess,

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.590
you know, to get the
emotional element on the page.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:56.910
It's not just a question
of putting

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.310
on like a Whitney Houston song
and you'll be like all crying

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.630
and then writing because then
your writing isn't very good.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.260
So it's really that
emotional part is hard for me.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.560
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: That's
interesting that you say

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.270
that because that's another
thing that kind of snuck

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.080
up about halfway
through the love story.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.380
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Oh, okay.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.680
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Which is always
is sort of buried in the --

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.180
you know that there
was this relationship

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.480
but we don't hear
anything about it.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.960
And then halfway through
you sort of opened that up

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.910
and you write a very
beautiful love story.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.410
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Oh
thank you, thank you.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.540
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Teenage, you
know, teenager the tragedy

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.060
and wonder of teenage love.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.360
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right, right.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.660
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: That
feels like forever.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.160
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yeah, I
mean that is the hardest thing

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.460
for me personally to write

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.310
because it can be very
painstaking and you have

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.520
to get a lot of people
to read it and see

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.640
if something is reading.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.870
Some of it feels very surgical
sometimes, I mean it's not just

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.570
as I was saying before just
like an outpouring of how I feel

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.670
as a writer it has
to be on the page.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:58.060
And sometimes you can
feel emotional as a writer

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:59.510
and then it's not on the page.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.140
So there's a huge difference

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.480
between what the
writer is feeling

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.620
and then what's on there yeah.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.280
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Well we
are going to have some time

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.160
for questions, but I have one
more thing I really wanted

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.270
to ask about, which is so you've
been talking with teenagers

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.900
about this, but how
has their reaction been

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.250
and how has it been
to be in this world

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.180
of writing for teenagers?

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.480
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: I
love it, I love it.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.780
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Well can
you tell us a little bit

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.080
about what you've experienced?

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:33.060
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes, I
mean I will say even starting

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.770
out before the book even
came out entering this phase

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.390
and talking to teenagers.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.800
I'm really struck by how
books become such a part

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.810
of their lives and how when
they love something it's really

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.280
something that is
very heartfelt.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.610
In a way that with adults,
actually that's not true,

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.650
adults really love books too.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.030
But there's just
something really pure

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:01.370
about that relationship
with books and adolescents.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.170
And that very much reminds
me of my own experience,

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:05.470
so it's a return to that.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.620
And also to see that the rumors

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.140
of books' deaths are
greatly exaggerated.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.950
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Especially
if you look at the teenager.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.930
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yeah, I
know, I know, I remember.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.230
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Children's
books.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.530
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Exactly.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.830
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Are just
this vibrant [inaudible] part

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.130
of our culture right now.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.430
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Exactly and
it really gives me a great sense

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.840
of -- to be able to be a writer
is just such an amazing thing

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:31.490
and it's an act of bravery
and it's an act of giving

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.820
to people a story that
they hopefully enjoy.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.350
It's a wonderful thing
to be able to do so.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.400
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: For the young,
for the next generation?

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.700
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes, yes.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.780
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Have
you had a chance

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.770
to develop other favorite
current YA authors or?

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.340
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes, actually.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.650
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Or past?

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:55.200
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Well so I
will say my favorite books

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.520
as a child were the Chronicles
of Narnia, like C. S. Lewis.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.440
And now I'm reading
what's really popular

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.250
like [inaudible] Blood and Bone
and I'm so amazed by her talent.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.050
And so I guess I'm starting out,
do you have any recommendations?

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:15.740
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Oh boy I
have way, way too many.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:20.530
But should we give the audience
some time for questions soon

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.700
or how are we doing on time?

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.000
We have?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.370
&gt;&gt; It's about 16, we have
about 14 minutes left.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.230
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Okay let's
go over a few more questions,

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.770
a few more questions and
then we'll give you guys.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.070
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Oh that's
right she has [inaudible].

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.050
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Okay great.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.350
What else can I ask you about?

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.260
Okay there's one other theme
that I'm going to have to bring

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.320
up that is a big theme of yours
and you handle it really well.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.080
But it's strong stuff
and this is death.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.870
The way you write about death
to me is unlike any other

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:56.110
because you are so comfortable
with sort of the back and forth

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.040
and the boundary
between life and death.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.560
And this is novel
that has several

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.760
because of the repeating day,

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.270
the characters die
and die and die.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:08.570
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right.

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.980
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: There's many,
many death scenes for this book.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.280
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.580
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: And almost all

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.880
of these characters get
to experience death.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.180
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.480
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: And they
tell us what death is like.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.780
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right, right.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.960
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: So could you
talk a little bit about your,

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.030
how do you approach
writing about death

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.190
and did it feel different
doing that for teenagers?

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.030
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
That's interesting.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.390
So how do I, well I think a lot

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.370
about death myself
I think simply

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.580
because obviously
is the great mystery

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.380
that we all wonder about.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.210
But thinking of mortality
gives one a certain freedom

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.820
in your own action.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.960
So I think I'm fairly
at ease with the idea

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:54.470
and it was exciting in this
particular book to answer

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.490
that question and to actually
like write a death scene

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.500
as I believe it to have
happened for certain people.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:05.070
So that was actually really
exciting to be able to do.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.690
And but no I wouldn't,

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:10.570
I certainly when I was writing
this book did not change how I

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.260
would write something for teens.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.200
I didn't change anything
about my writing style,

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.480
I didn't change anything
in terms of writing

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.210
about death or life or anything.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.490
I didn't want to, I guess
I didn't want to dumb

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:32.890
down certainly and I also
didn't want to shield my reader

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.210
from a certain reality.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.630
I think that the young
adult audience can handle

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.010
really everything.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.310
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Yes.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.610
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: In
terms of subject matter

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:43.910
and I think that they do.

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:48.600
And I think adolescent and young
readers can actually handle

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.970
subjects better than
adults sometimes.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:51.270
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: True, in fact.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.570
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
Would have been mine.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:53.870
Yeah.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.170
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Teenagers
probably I would say think

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.470
about death a lot.

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.770
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes because
death touches their lives.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.070
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: In a sort
on theoretical way that you.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.370
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:01.670
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Right.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:02.970
And there's one scene where one

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.270
of your characters has
a death experience.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.050
And I love this one so much

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.210
because you know she describes
what it's like and then she says

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.240
and finally it was just joy.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.540
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:13.840
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: I thought
that was so comforting.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:15.140
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right, right.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.750
Well and also, I
think I was inspired

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.650
by my own grandmother's
death especially

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.530
when I was writing Night
Film because I was raised

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.220
by my grandmother and
she passed away at 101

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.300
when I was writing that film.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.980
And just seeing her in that
process really had a huge impact

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.180
on me and I felt
that there was joy

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.660
and that was really my
interpretation of being

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.510
with her in those times.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.920
But there was a sadness
to let go

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.770
but then there was a
letting go and there was joy,

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.710
so I put that in the book.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.570
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: And as you
said, not the book is messaging

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:53.390
at all, but there is an implicit
message in that and I think

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:57.220
in the book, which is
that live your life

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.920
because we all know
death is right there.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.510
Live your life with
purpose and meaning and joy.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.210
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes and
I think about that too.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.710
I think anytime I'm
afraid to try something,

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:12.500
especially in terms of writing
a book I just think we're all

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.260
headed to the same point

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:19.770
so why not you know really
climb the highest mountain

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.900
and see how far one can go so.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.590
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: You've
certainly done that.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.840
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Well I don't
know about that, but thank you.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.750
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Well we do have,
we are at our 10-minute mark,

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.230
so do we have some
questions for Marisha?

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:37.550
&gt;&gt; Do you want me to
go to the microphone

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.170
or I can use my teacher voice?

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.390
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: The
teacher voice sounds good.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.490
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: You
have a wonderful voice

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.250
so we can hear you.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:48.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.730
Okay, so first of all I
absolutely loved your two

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.370
first books.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.310
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Oh
thank you so much.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:01.290
&gt;&gt; It's very clear how
researched they were,

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:07.110
it was just incredibly, it
was incredibly [inaudible].

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:11.960
But you said first and foremost
if you are a reader or a writer

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.120
and you had mentioned that
Agatha Christie was one

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.420
of your favorite authors.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.720
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.390
&gt;&gt; And I was curious what
other writers have influenced

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.690
your writing.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:24.990
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Certainly.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.290
I mean when I was a teenager

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:32.750
and really even now I read
everything I can get my

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.050
hands on.

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:38.400
So I was an English
literature major in college,

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.570
so I mean obviously the
greats like Charles Dickens.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.950
I went through a little
obsession with Nabokov

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.790
at the time that I was
writing Special Topics.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.260
So I would say Charles
Dickens primarily

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.000
because of just the sheer
boisterous nature of his novels.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.960
And just how much one can
do within a story in terms

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.400
of the corporeality
of the characters

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.700
or addressing social issues.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.050
And this big boisterous
tapestry to create,

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:09.150
I mean I always loved that idea.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:15.680
More contemporary at the
time I loved Jonathan Franzen

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.880
and Jeffrey Eugenides

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:23.510
and American literary fiction
maybe 10 years ago I was really

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.810
obsessed with.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.000
But now I'm going back
to the classics too

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.560
and it's always good to just
read a wide range, the high,

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.410
the low, the genre
of the literary.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:34.760
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: You were
saying the Secret Garden.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.500
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Oh
yes, the Secret Garden.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.420
I went Peter Pan and
now I have children

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.980
so now I'm revisiting
those children's classics.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.280
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Oh, great.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.580
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: That
are just [inaudible].

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.580
The Little Princess, I mean all
of these like amazing books.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.770
And some of them are and
actually Little Women too.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:57.070
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Yes,

00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:00.250
I just started watching
the PBS Little Women,

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:04.150
you have to watch that.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:05.450
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: I
have to watch that.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:06.750
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: It's very good.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.620
Any other questions for --
oh, the light is so bright.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.920
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Okay, hi.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.380
&gt;&gt; So how challenging was
it having a plot where like

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.260
of course emotionally it would
matter the next day what they

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:26.100
had done, but physically like
it didn't matter what they did,

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.870
like you have so much room to
do anything you want there.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.170
So how did you do
that in your book?

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:35.770
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: You mean in
terms of having so much choice

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.360
because of the infinity
nature f the time?

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.960
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: That's
such a good question.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.990
So I had to limit myself
and I allowed the characters

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:51.650
to tell me their limits
because I was bound

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.680
by the nature of
these characters.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.420
And so characters kept
me to a grounded place

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.860
as to what they were
going to do.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:11.170
Beatrice was going to actually
try to get everyone to vote,

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.390
she was the responsible one.

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.400
She was the one who
really wanted to try this.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:23.310
I won't go into all
of them, I don't want

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.610
to give away too much.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.170
But I was bound by character.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:33.340
And I have found no matter what
character is what you always

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.330
return to as a writer.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:40.260
Whether you're going, you're
writing a huge sprawling epic

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:45.350
or a tiny little thing,
your characters are bound

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:48.910
by their sheer nature of
mortality, their circumstance.

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.780
It's really all about character
and that's the wonderful thing.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:58.020
And that really keeps
you as a writer grounded

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.490
because you're writing
about people.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.930
That's why I don't think I've
ever, I won't limit myself,

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:07.750
but to write about
aliens or something,

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:13.750
then there would be no limits
and it would truly be scary.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:18.700
But people I can handle,
people have a corporality,

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.020
they have something
I can handle.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:27.220
So that's how I dealt
with that infinity.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.520
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.820
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
You're welcome.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.120
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Great.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.790
Anyone else want to
step up to that mic?

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.440
&gt;&gt; I've got a question,

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.920
I've actually got a
couple of confessions.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.290
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Oh
here's one here.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:42.900
&gt;&gt; A couple of confessions
and a question.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.950
My first confession is I
haven't yet read the new book,

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:49.210
so I don't know if my
question will apply to that.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:50.510
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Okay.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:51.810
&gt;&gt; To the book.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:57.250
But my other confession is that
it's a little bit disarming

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:00.910
because you have exactly
the same mannerisms

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:06.030
as an ex-girlfriend of mine and
she's also a writer so I'm kind

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.130
of like, I'm kind of
freaking out, I'm sorry.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.640
But my question is, in the
first two books you do a lot of,

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.050
obviously Night Film is a lot
about movies and so do you,

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:16.360
like do you think about
movies in the same way

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:18.860
and do you enjoy movies
the same way that you said

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.160
like you're a reader first?

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.460
Is film a big influence
on your writing?

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.760
Do you have a favorite
genre of film?

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.060
Favorite directors?

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.360
Does that kind of you
know work into your books?

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.660
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes, so I --
well so, I grew up with a mom

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.960
who was obsessed with
classical cinema.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.260
So when my friends were out like
at a normal movie theater my mom

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.560
and I would be watching
like Turner classic movies

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.860
and I would be watching like
Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.160
and His Girl Friday and
obsessed with Cary Grant

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.460
and Jimmy Stewart,
Alfred Hitchcock.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.760
So that was another way
for me to really get

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.060
through my adolescence
was you know loving these

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.360
like old movies where
people had shoulder pads

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.660
and cigarette holders and
James Cagney and all these

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.960
like crazy characters.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.260
So certainly like, you know,
like all influences in childhood

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.560
like that will play out in
one's art in different ways.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.860
Certainly with Night Film the
original, the originating idea

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.160
for that was really
Stanley Kubrick and reading

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.460
about the behind-the-scenes
behavior that he really exerted

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.760
on his surroundings,
all in the name of art.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.060
And the sort of various
means of torture

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.360
that different actors would
sign up for simply to be

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.660
in a Kubrick film and I just
found that so interesting.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:53.960
Why were people allowing
themselves to be treated

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.260
like this, was it for the
fame, was it to get outside

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.560
of their day-to-day existence,
which maybe was dreary

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.860
and they wanted to go
off to sort of adult camp

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.160
and have some sort
of experience?

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.460
So I really started reading

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.880
about these you know
usually male film directors

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.080
and how they were
allowed and able

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.520
to like create art,
an art that we love.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.040
I mean I love Alfred Hitchcock
and then it subsequently come

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.560
out as to how he actually
treated people behind the set,

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.140
so behind-the-scenes.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:20.080
So really, that was
my originating idea.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.390
So certainly, my childhood
was all about books and movies

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:27.870
but you know books that's my
centerpiece, that's my love.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.230
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Two minutes.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:32.170
Can I ask who is your
favorite character in the book?

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.470
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
Oh in Neverworld?

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:34.770
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Yeah,
because I think [inaudible].

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:36.070
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Definitely
Martha, [inaudible].

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:40.350
No, no. But I love them all,

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:42.380
I mean even my characters
who are bad.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.680
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Yes,
all lovable,

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.980
they're all really lovable.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.720
I'm not, I can't see with
the lights, anyone else?

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.530
Who here we are.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:50.830
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.910
&gt;&gt; Can you step to
the microphone?

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.210
&gt;&gt; An adult film.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:56.510
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
Oh say that again?

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:57.810
&gt;&gt; Could the new book have
been an adult film [inaudible]?

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.490
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: He's saying
could the new book have been an

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:00.790
adult novel?

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.090
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: No, I think,

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:03.390
well actually adults
who've read it have said

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.470
that it's not necessarily YA
and we were actually talking

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.010
about this, like what makes
something young adult.

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:14.060
I always conceived it as young
adult simply because the age

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.360
of the main characters.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.660
And when I started working

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.680
with my young adult editor she
really said because of the age

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.920
of the characters it
makes it young adult.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.090
But then Maria said.

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.230
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: One rule of
thumb that some people use is

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.400
that if it's just
about teenagers,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.420
but it's for grown-ups there
will be a sense of looking back

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.850
on what happened from
the grown-up perspective.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:36.210
And there will sort
of signposts showing

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.530
that these characters
went on to adult lives

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.200
that is sort of the present.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.410
Whereas in a YA book, you know
these characters really are

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.870
in the perspective of teenagers
you don't know what your

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.870
future's going to hold, you
don't know if you're going

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.540
to even survive into adulthood.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:52.840
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Right, right.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.140
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: So
I think this does,

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.450
in some ways it's
classic YA in that sense

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.820
that it's not retrospective.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.430
But you know as everyone here
probably knows YA is a new

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:06.120
category, it didn't exist when
you know Catcher and the Rye

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.810
and the Outsiders you know
these were just books.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.960
And it's sort of a new
phenomenon to call,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.890
to rope these off
and call then YAs.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.860
So everybody should read
YA, what's called YA.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:18.920
And in fact people say,

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.480
the publishing industry
will tell you 50%

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.780
of YA readers are
actually grown-ups.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.080
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
Exactly, that's right.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.380
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: So I'm
sure lots of you here.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.680
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
I think it started

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.980
with the Harry Potter
phenomenon.

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.280
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Right, exactly.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.580
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
Everyone wants to go back

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.880
and read these stories
that they get lost in.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.180
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Okay
we're going to wrap it up,

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.800
anyone want to sneak in a list
speed dating kind of question?

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.100
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:43.510
&gt;&gt; You said you were working
on your third novel for adults

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:49.930
when you got the idea
for Neverworld Wake

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:53.680
and I absolutely
love Night Film.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.980
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Oh, thank you.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.630
&gt;&gt; Do you know when your next
book for adults might come out?

00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:59.930
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
It will be shortly.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.690
I'm finishing it up and that's

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.480
about all I can tell
you but it's coming.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.780
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Is it the one

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.580
that you discarded
the earlier idea?

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.880
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Oh no, no,

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.290
no that was another
young adult idea.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:15.960
So no, I did not discard
this idea, definitely not.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:21.800
So it's coming your
way but stay tuned

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.770
for more, I'm very excited.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.240
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Did we get
everybody who wanted to,

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.140
we have probably to
sneak in one more.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.440
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl:
Any other questions?

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.820
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Oh here we are.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.120
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes, hi.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.040
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Do you have
a question in the pink?

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.340
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Hi.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.640
&gt;&gt; Are you going to make
another [inaudible]?

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.940
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Yes.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:42.240
Yes, I definitely am.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.090
So my plan is to switch, so I'm
going to write my next adult

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:45.390
and then I'm already working

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:46.690
on a new young adult,
so definitely.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:47.990
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: So you're
going to go back and forth?

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:49.290
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: I think I'm
going to go back and forth.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.590
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: That is good
news for everyone in this room.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:51.890
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Why leave
when it's so nice here,

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:53.190
I'm not going to leave.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:54.490
So yes, I'm definitely writing
another young adult book

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:55.790
and more news on that soon.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.090
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: Well
fantastical.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:58.390
Well Marisha Pessl,
thank you so much.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:33:59.690
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Thank
you Maria so much for.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:00.990
&gt;&gt; Maria Russo: It
was such an honor.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.290
&gt;&gt; Marisha Pessl: Wonderful.
