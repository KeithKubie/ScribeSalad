TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm now
here with Kristen Johnson,

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.380
the lead product
manager on Fabric.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.470
Kristen, how are you?

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.060
KRISTEN JOHNSON: Doing well.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.950
We've had a great day
here in Amsterdam.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.033
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, it's
been really incredible.

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.760
Now you were in the
keynote this morning,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.551
and you talked a little
bit about something

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:15.550
that I know you're
really passionate about,

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.900
and that's bringing Fabric
and Firebase together

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.525
for developers.

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:21.010
Can you tell us a little
bit about this project

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.010
and your passion for it?

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.880
KRISTEN JOHNSON: Sure,
so since we joined Google

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.430
earlier this year, we realized
that our missions are really

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.764
strongly aligned across
Firebase and Fabric.

00:00:28.764 --> 00:00:30.180
So we thought the
best thing to do

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.130
was to work together
to bring the best

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.660
platform to developers.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.285
TIMOTHY JORDAN: One
of the other things

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:38.320
you talked about was Crashlytics
being in the Firebase console

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.950
and that enabling interaction
such as Crashlytics

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.090
plus functions.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.510
Can tell me a bit
more about that?

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.310
KRISTEN JOHNSON:
Right, so we're really

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.060
excited about this
integration because you

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.260
can take Crash events and
trigger a cloud function.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.900
So you can think about a
really powerful example,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.710
like when you really care a
lot about [INAUDIBLE] flows

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.880
and something goes wrong
and you have a crash,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.650
you want to make sure that that
gets to the people who can fix

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.132
that as fast as possible.

00:01:01.132 --> 00:01:03.090
So we have it so you
could, for example, set it

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.550
up so it connects to Slack
or PagerDuty, the things

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.670
that you already use
in your workflow,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.030
to make sure that you fix the
issue as soon as possible.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.680
All right, is
there anything else

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.430
that developers should
be looking out for?

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.971
KRISTEN JOHNSON: I
think you're going

00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:19.400
to see more and more Fabric
plus Firebase integrations,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.389
so we'll talk more about
that probably at Google IO.

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:24.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome,
thank you so much.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.456
KRISTEN JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:27.206
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks
for joining me here

00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:30.630
at the Firebase Dev
Summit 2017 in Amsterdam.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.940
For links to all the session
videos, look in the description

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.440
below.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.450
I'm Timothy Jordan for
"The Developer Show."

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.740
I'll see you next time.
