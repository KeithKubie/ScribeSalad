1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,400
So let's begin now.
First of all,

2
00:00:04,401 --> 00:00:09,401
I'm assuming all of you have some idea
what special relativity meet that are two

3
00:00:09,681 --> 00:00:12,830
theories of relativity. One, his special
theory and one is a general theory.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,110
The general theory is something we
won't do it. Any detail. The specialty,

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,980
it is something we will
do in reasonable detail.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,470
So it got to begin by asking
some of you what is your

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:30,380
present understanding of what the
subject is all about? Yes sir.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,930
He heel cap. What do you think? It's about

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,070
reference system.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,270
Okay. It's about relative
speed and to reference system.

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,220
I'll come to you then I'll come to you.
Yes.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,050
The laws of physics in any reference range

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,340
initially and constantly.

14
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,400
Okay. I will take a last row there. Yes.

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:07,971
Okay,

16
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:12,830
so what I've heard so far is that the
laws of physics are the same for two

17
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:17,210
people who are both inertial frames of
reference and the velocity of light is a

18
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,870
constant,
right?

19
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,980
That's certainly the way we understand,
especially the relativity theory,

20
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,510
but it's a very old one. It's been
going on long before I enshrined came.

21
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,670
There is a theory of relativity at the
time of Newton and that's where I want to

22
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:38,530
begin. The relativity is not a
new idea at all. It's an old one

23
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,160
and the whole idea can be illustrated
in this way and it will agree with your

24
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:46,150
own experience.

25
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,600
So the standard technique for all of
relativity is to get these high speed

26
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:56,560
trains. I'm going to have
our own high speed train.

27
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,340
There's the top view of the train and
like in everything I do will get away with

28
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:06,930
the lowest number of dimensions,
which happens to be,

29
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:10,270
there's one special dimension
and of course that is time.

30
00:02:10,271 --> 00:02:12,120
So the train is moving along the x axis.

31
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,760
You are in this strain,

32
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,070
you board the train and
all the blinds are closed

33
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,430
because you're not,
you don't want to look outside.

34
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,430
Well that's not because you're traveling
through some parts of New Jersey.

35
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:30,540
You don't want to look outside.

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,290
They don't want to look outside
for this particular experiment.

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,170
Get into the train.

38
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,920
You settled down and you
explore the world around you.

39
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,390
You pour yourself a drink,
you play pool,

40
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,140
you juggled some ping pong balls,
tennis balls,

41
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,280
and you have a certain
awareness of what's happening,

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,560
namely your understanding of the
mechanical world. And then you go to sleep

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,420
when you're sleeping.

44
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,830
Some unseen hand gives to this strain.

45
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,730
A large velocity,
200 miles an hour.

46
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,120
Question is when you wake up,

47
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,180
can you tell if you're moving or not?
That's the whole question.

48
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,390
Will Lewis Speed,
whatever they gave you,

49
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:27,340
200 miles per hour will do anything to
you in this strain that'll betrayed that

50
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,200
velocity. So when you wake up,
when you say I'm moving or not,

51
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,990
now you might say,

52
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,890
I'm not moving because I am an Amtrak
and I know this strain is not going

53
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:42,460
anywhere. That kind of
sociological reasons. By the way,

54
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:46,690
there are many of them you cannot invoke.
You can only say I haven't.

55
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:49,060
The strain is anything different.

56
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,120
And the claim is that
nothing would be different.

57
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,920
You just will knock know you're moving.

58
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,090
Now,
if the train picks up speed or slows down,

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,980
you will know right away.

60
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,340
If it picks up speed dot accelerates
you and find yourself pushed against the

61
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:09,040
back of the seat of the driver,
slams on the break,

62
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,340
he will slam in the front
of the seat in front of you.

63
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,780
No one is saying that when the motion
is accelerated, you will not know.

64
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,600
Accelerated motion can be detected
close strain without looking outside.

65
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,180
Question is uniform velocity.

66
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,190
No matter how high can that be perceived,
can that be detected?

67
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,070
So at the time of Galileo
and Newton, everybody agreed
that you cannot detect it.

68
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,160
Remember that if you started out
and Newton's laws work for you,

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,260
you're calling an inertial observer
one of the laws. You want this.

70
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:50,880
If you leave something,
you should stay where it is one.

71
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,960
When the train is accelerating,
that won't be true.

72
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,560
You leave things on the floor when it's
accelerating things from slide backwards.

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,910
So with no apparent force acting on it,
things will begin to accelerate.

74
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,000
That's a non inertial frame.
We're not interested in that.

75
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,510
You started out as a observer for whom?
The Laws of Newton work,

76
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,640
law of inertia works,
FSE called [inaudible].

77
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,560
Then you go to sleep and you wake up.
So when I said everything looks the same,

78
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,470
I really meant that the laws of Newton
continue to be the same because if the

79
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:23,470
laws of Newton are the same,
everything will look the same.

80
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,110
That's what it means to say
everything looks the same.

81
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,030
I would expectations and what
happens when I throw it up,

82
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:31,810
but what happens when two
billiard balls collide?

83
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,160
Everything is connected
to the loss of newt.

84
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,490
So the claim is a loss of Newton who
will be unchanged when this velocities

85
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,470
added onto you.
Now we should be clear about one thing.

86
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,330
If there is a train next
to you in the beginning,

87
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,220
let me just put it on this
side for convenience and
you got in and you bought it

88
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,530
this train, but you looked at
this rain, it was not moving.

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,000
If you lift the blind and look through,

90
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:02,780
you'll see the other train and that's
another passenger in the other train and

91
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,400
you look at each other,
you're not moving

92
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,030
when you wake up after this brief nap.
You find when you look outside,

93
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:13,850
the other train is moving
at 200 miles an hour.

94
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,770
The question is can you tell if it's
you who's responsible for this relative

95
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:21,914
motion?

96
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,510
It may be nothing happened to you and the
other train is moving the opposite way

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,090
and the claim of relativity is
that you really cannot tell.

98
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,920
You can tell that this motion between
the two trains that wasn't there before.

99
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,870
That's very clear if you look outside,

100
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,460
but there is no way to tell what
actually happened when you were sleeping.

101
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,690
Whether you are given the velocity of
200 to the right or the other train was

102
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:50,630
given over last year, 200 to the left
or maybe a combination of the two.

103
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,810
You just cannot tell.
That's the word relative.

104
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,190
So far I didn't tell you
if you have only one train,

105
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,900
what I told you earlier is that uniform
velocity does not leave an imprint on

106
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,080
anything you can measure.
If you look outside,

107
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:08,300
of course you can see the
motion of the other train,

108
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,060
but you still cannot tell who is moving.

109
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,450
You cannot distinguish between different
possibilities. So you are every,

110
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:21,050
you have every right to insist that you
are not moving and the other train is

111
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:25,100
moving the opposite way.
Once again,

112
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,520
you can make this argument only
for uniform relative motion.

113
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,520
If your train is accelerating.

114
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,120
Now I'm saying it as if it's
an absolute thing and it is,

115
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,710
you cannot say I'm not accelerating the
other trainers accelerating the other

116
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:40,544
direction.

117
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,830
You cannot say that because you're the
one who was barfing up and throwing up

118
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:48,830
and slamming your head on the wall.
Nothing's happened. The other person,

119
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,510
you cannot say, uh, I'm still in the same
frame. You are going the opposite way.

120
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,680
If you're going the opposite way,

121
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:59,681
why am I throwing up so or if
a rocket rockets taking off,

122
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,500
you know, the g forces are
enormous. Many times your weight.

123
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,610
It's the astronauts who are going
through the discomfort at that time.

124
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:11,210
They cannot say we are addressed and
everyone's going the opposite way because

125
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,430
no one else is in danger.
But you are.

126
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,140
So accelerated motion will
produce effects. You cannot
talk your way out of that.

127
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,660
But uniform velocity will
produce no effects on, you know,

128
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,070
effects on the other person.
You can detect relative motion,

129
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,580
but you cannot in any sense main thing
that you are moving and he's not or he's

130
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:35,630
moving new or not. You can say I am
addressed things at the same as before.

131
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,610
The train is moving the opposite way.

132
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,140
Now if you go in the Amtrak and you look
outside and you don't see another train

133
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:45,980
but you see the landscape,

134
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,790
you see trees and cows and everything
going at 200 miles an hour in the opposite

135
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:50,624
direction,

136
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,530
you have some reason to believe that
probably the ground is not moving and

137
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,364
you're moving.

138
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,080
But that just based on what I called
earlier to some sociological factors,

139
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:04,891
in other words,

140
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:09,891
it's completely possible to devise an
experiment in which somebody puts the

141
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:13,260
whole landscape on wheels. And when
you go to sleep, the landscape,

142
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,610
cows and trees that are made to move
the opposite way, not very likely.

143
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:20,100
But that's because we know in practice,

144
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,990
no one's going to bother to do that just
to fool you. But if that did happen,

145
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,130
you won't know the difference.

146
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,700
So the reason we ruled that out as being
or some extraneous things not connected

147
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:30,720
to the laws of physics.

148
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,590
That's why we don't like to take open
the window and look at the landscape

149
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:36,880
because then we have a bias.
Open the window,

150
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,910
look at another train
and you just want to know

151
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,020
that does the principle of relativity,

152
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:46,810
that uniform motion between two observers,

153
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,570
[inaudible] is relative. Each one can
insist that he or she is not moving.

154
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,680
The other person is the one who is moving.
Of course.

155
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:59,970
Now if the two, in reality, if
the two trains were addressed,

156
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,450
let's imagine my train got accelerated
so during the time it goes accelerator I

157
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:08,400
would know,
but if I was sleeping at that time,

158
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,810
I don't know end when I wake
up at the acceleration is gone.

159
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,970
The velocity is constant.
That's when I say I just cannot tell.

160
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,780
All right now let's

161
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,380
show once and for all that the loss of
Newton, I'm not going to be modified.

162
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,300
So you find the loss of Newton
before you go to sleep. You wake up,

163
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:32,580
you find them again,
you won't get the same laws.

164
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,810
That's the claim and I hope you understand
that all the mechanical things you

165
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:39,150
see in the world around you
just come from ethical semi.

166
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,440
We have seen a project times and
collision or billiard balls and rockets.

167
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,180
They're all Newtonian mechanics,

168
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,500
so to say that things will look the same
is to say the loss of Newton that you

169
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:52,740
will, that use before and after
waking up will be the same.

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,780
So let's show that when you show that
you're really done with it once and for

171
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:58,530
all.

172
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:03,530
So let's do the following [inaudible]
the x axis and here is my frame of

173
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:09,330
reference. This is my exaxis.
Next column is the origin.

174
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,020
The frame was the negative
and positive x values.

175
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,150
Pick some object sitting at the point x.

176
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,170
Now we are going to first
define the notion of an event

177
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,760
and events is something that happens
at a certain place at a certain time.

178
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,000
That's called an event.

179
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,303
Yeah.

180
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,430
For example, if there's a little cracker
going off somewhere at some time,

181
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,180
some time the x is where it had
happened and the t is when it happened.

182
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,040
So this is space time.
Once again,

183
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,160
space time does not require
Einstein coming in at all.

184
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:53,080
We have known for thousands of years.

185
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,850
If you want to set up a
meeting with somebody,

186
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,740
you got to say where and you've got to
say when and things do happen in space

187
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:03,640
time. The fact that you need x and t Odey
for living in three spatial dimensions,

188
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,750
fact that they need x, Y,
Z, and T. It's not new.

189
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,010
That is not that
evolution that am created.

190
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:15,070
The fact that you need for coordinates,
labeling event is nothing new.

191
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,460
What he did that is new.
It will be clear later

192
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,960
so everyone understand
what an event means. Okay.

193
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,180
You went to something that happens and
to say exactly where and when it happened

194
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,780
in our world that one dimension, we'll
give it an accident. We'll give it a tea.

195
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,390
No, that's me and I'm going
to give my frame of reference.

196
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,970
The name s turns out s this
not just based on my name.

197
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,790
This is canonical name for two observers.

198
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:50,620
One is called less and one is called s
prime, so s prime. Let's say it's you.

199
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,640
So your frame of reference is going to
be taken to be sliding relative to mine.

200
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,160
So I don't know how to draw this.
And let's draw a y axis here.

201
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,760
We don't really deal with
the white coordinate, but
just to give you a feeling,

202
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,390
uh, this is my y axis that's
makes acts as this my origin.

203
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,400
Why is not going to play a big
role? No, you are sliding this way.

204
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,790
Put that right in your speed

205
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,400
and velocity is always denoted by you.

206
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,620
So some number of meters per second,
you're zooming to the right at some speed.

207
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:32,454
You,

208
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,900
so you imagine now you
got to going past me some.

209
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,270
I'm instant. I'm sitting here
at the audit in of coordinates,

210
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,220
you cross me and then little
later you are somewhere there.

211
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:52,221
So that's your white prime is that's
your origin and the same event you see it

212
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:54,930
has a coordinate x prime.

213
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,620
We already did.
So that when you're zoomed past me,

214
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,800
you set your clock to zero.

215
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,340
And I set my clock to zero when you
wanted to set the clock to see it as

216
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:12,830
completely arbitrary. So we will decide
right when you pass me, I'm am the audit.

217
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:15,570
You know my coordinates. You are the
artist in New York coordinates, right?

218
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:16,440
When you pass me,

219
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:20,610
we'll click our stopwatches and
we will set the time to zero.

220
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,470
Yeah,

221
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,270
so here's an event you and I crossed.
What are the coordinates for that event?

222
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,830
According to me,

223
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,720
that event occurred at x equals zero
and the claim was chosen to be zero

224
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,620
according to you.

225
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,130
Your origin was also on top of my audit
and so explained was zero and the time

226
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:47,310
is just the time. Everybody has a
single time. That time was called zero.

227
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,680
That is one event.

228
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,020
We Amanda coordinated the demand
zero zero for both you and me.

229
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,040
It is zero in space because
my origin cross your origin.

230
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,370
That crossing took place at my origin.
That's where my ex is.

231
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:04,820
Zero took place at your origin.
That's what you're explaining is you know,

232
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,030
and the common time he chose
to be zero by convention.

233
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,300
Yeah.

234
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,010
Then we want a second event.

235
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,110
So let's say the second event is
some firecracker going off here.

236
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,660
Here's something I should explain that
I've used to forget in the previous years.

237
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,960
When I say I am moving,

238
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,790
I imagine I am part of a huge team
of people who are all moving with me.

239
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,550
So I got agents all over the x
axis who are my eyes and ears.

240
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,310
They're looking out for me.
So even though I am here,

241
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,520
just a firecracker exploding here,
my guys will tell me,

242
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,480
and you are carrying your own agents.

243
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,040
Let's say at every point x you have a
reporter x equal to one, two, three, four.

244
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,700
There are people sitting and watching.
So when I say my,

245
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,440
when I say I see something I really
mean me and my buddies all traveling the

246
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:04,240
same train at the same speed, all over
space, taking notes on what's happening.

247
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,260
We will pull out information later, but
we know this explosion took place here.

248
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,930
I would simplify it by saying I know an
explanation and exploit explosion took

249
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,630
place here at location x at time t

250
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,580
so this is our crossing this event.

251
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,770
It's been be crossed then
that is a firecracker

252
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,720
but firecracker,
I have to give some events.

253
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,650
I said took place at location x at time.
T

254
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,010
what did you say? You measured
the distance from your origin.

255
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,500
You call it [inaudible]. The time is
still tea. In Newtonian mechanics,

256
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,610
the time is just the time.
How many seconds are past?
It's the same for everybody.

257
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,040
The question is what is
the relation between x,

258
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:03,570
prime and x?
That's what we want to think about,

259
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,750
so you guys should think before it.
Write down the answer.

260
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,550
What's the relation of x prime two x?
Well,

261
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,580
this event took place at time t so I
know that your origin is to the right by

262
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:19,500
and I'm on your time,
Steve.

263
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,423
Okay,

264
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:26,720
so the distance from your
origin for this event,

265
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,600
I maintain this x price is x minus ut.

266
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,480
Again, I want all of you to follow
everything. These are all simple notions.

267
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:47,450
Would origins coincided.
Ub Zero time for the event occurs at time.

268
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:51,240
T therefore know in a sense
you're rushing towards the event,

269
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:55,950
you've gone a distance. Ut therefore
the distance from your origins,

270
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,620
that event will be less than
mine by this amount. Ut.

271
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,210
This is the law of transformation of
coordinates in Newtonian mechanics.

272
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:15,110
If you haven't event, which occurs
at the, if you want formally,

273
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,550
you can define a time t prime
for the prime, the Observer.

274
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,730
It goes without saying that
t prime and t are the same.

275
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,370
There is no notion of time
for me and time for you.

276
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,420
That's universal time and you're
20 mechanics that are just runs.

277
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,600
We can call something a
zero once we have agreed,

278
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,150
if you say you and I met at [inaudible]
and explosion explosion took place,

279
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,950
five seconds after that we're meeting,

280
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,850
it's going to be five seconds after
meeting for me and it's going to be five

281
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:48,620
seconds after the meeting for you.
The time difference between two events,

282
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:53,420
it's the same for all people. This is
called the Galilean transformation.

283
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,940
Okay.

284
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,540
What are the consequences of
Galilean transformation? Well,

285
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,450
let's look at the fact that
x prime is x mine as ut.

286
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,353
Yeah.

287
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,150
You remember everything
is varying with time,

288
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,500
so x prime is a function of time
and x is the function of time.

289
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,090
If you're watching a moving party,

290
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,910
suppose this firecracker is not just
one event, but it's a moving object.

291
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,270
Let's give the object some speed.
It's moving to the right.

292
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,650
Then the velocity according to me,

293
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,290
I'm going to call V as Dxdt

294
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,780
is the velocity.
Let's just call it the bullet.

295
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,273
Okay.

296
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:54,850
According to s then w is a standard name
is the velocity of the bullet according

297
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,710
to as prime.

298
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,000
So what I've done is I first took one
event and I gave it some coordinates and I

299
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:11,270
told you how to transform the coordinate
from one person to the other person,

300
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,810
but now take that point x
not to be a fixed location,

301
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,820
but a moving object so that as a
function of time that body's moving.

302
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,570
Then it's velocity at any time.

303
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,510
Is the prime DT according to you.

304
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,260
That is the Dx d t according to me
minus the did ever do a bis just you.

305
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,050
Does that make sense?
They should agree with common sense.

306
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,840
For example, did that bullet's going
at 600 miles per hour to the right?

307
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,260
That is 600 for me

308
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,120
and you are going to the right in
your train or 200 miles per hour.

309
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,280
You should measure the bullet speed to
be reduced by 200 and you should get 400

310
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,130
that's all it means.

311
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,790
The two people will disagree on the
velocity of the bullet because they are

312
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,270
moving relative to each other.
This is the way you will add velocities.

313
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,080
Okay,

314
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,580
well let's look at the acceleration.

315
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,470
Dwd t is going to be Dvdt minus
zero because you as a constant,

316
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,610
that means you and I agree on
the acceleration of the body.

317
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,580
We disagree on where it is. We disagree
on how fast the bullets moving,

318
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,100
but we agree on the acceleration,
the body,

319
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:43,490
because all I've done this at a
constant velocity to everything you see.

320
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,013
Therefore,

321
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,340
if according to the velocity of the
body is not changing according to me,

322
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:53,870
the velocity of the body's not changing
because we bought the constant I added

323
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:57,260
will drop out of the difference
or the body as an acceleration.

324
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,750
We'll both get the same
answer for the acceleration.

325
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,240
So that is the common acceleration.

326
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,110
A So if you like a prime is the same as a

327
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,640
so the acceleration of bodies doesn't
change when you go from one frame of

328
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:15,190
reference and other one
going at a constant speed.

329
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,140
All right,
so let's look at ethicals Ama,

330
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,160
which is m d two x over DT square
is equal to some force on the body

331
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,550
and you look at the body and you
say need to extreme over dts.

332
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:40,030
Where is the force on your body?
First I want to convince you,

333
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,890
we wanted to see that the left hand side,

334
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:45,340
so at equal because the
acceleration is the same.

335
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,710
Then I want to convince you the right hand
side, so we're also going to be equal.

336
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,510
I can take many examples,
but eventually you will get the point.

337
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,820
Let us not consider one body,
but let's consider two bodies.

338
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,500
Two bodies are feeling a certain
force you to say gravitation

339
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,280
and gravitation is of course
a forest in three dimension.

340
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:13,210
But let's write the force
in just one dimension.

341
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,540
And let's say the force of gravity is
equal to one over x one minus six to four,

342
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:21,750
some one,
two,

343
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,750
two and the force on to you do one will
be minus of one over x one minus six

344
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:28,324
too.

345
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,920
Okay,

346
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,610
did he enforces that Arbonne?
There's separation in three dimensions,

347
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:38,100
but this is a fictitious force, I want
to call it gravity. It is any forced,

348
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:40,210
it depends on the coordinates
of the two particles.

349
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,890
So I will say m one the two x one
over d t square is one over x,

350
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:50,210
one minus x to

351
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:58,150
and m to do two x two over d t square
this minus one over x one minus.

352
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,610
I have forgotten constantly g and m one
and m two they don't matter for this

353
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:07,610
purpose.
So he hit our two bodies,

354
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,110
they feel a force for each other and I've
discovered what the forces is one over

355
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:13,190
x one minus X to,

356
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,020
I don't care if it one over x one minus
x two or x one minus x to the square.

357
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,980
That's not important.

358
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,290
What's important is it depends on x one
minus x to you come along and you study

359
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:28,610
the same two masses.
What will you say is happening?

360
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,830
You will say m one the two x one prime
over d t square is equal to one over x

361
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:42,650
one prime minus x two prime.
Maybe I will. Let me, I'm sorry.

362
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:46,730
Let me do it a little better.
I can tell you what you will see

363
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,580
given this is what I see.
I can tell you what you will see.

364
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:52,690
Let's do that in our head.

365
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,290
We know that the acceleration
is the same for any mass,

366
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:01,240
so I'm going to write this thing as
m of the x one prime over d this way.

367
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:01,841
In other words,

368
00:25:01,841 --> 00:25:05,920
the acceleration according to me is the
same as the activation of according to

369
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,754
you.

370
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:12,540
Then I'm also going to write the right
hand side is x one prime minus x 2.0 do

371
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:17,380
you understand that if there
are two bodies feeling of force,

372
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,610
if you see it from a moving train,
the distance between the two bodies,

373
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,810
it's the same for you and me

374
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,690
because x one prime is x minus
ut x two primus x two minus ut.

375
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:31,920
Take the difference. The difference
between the location of the particular,

376
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:34,120
it's the same for you and me acceleration,

377
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:36,730
the same mass as
postulated to be the same.

378
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,240
So I know that you will get
the same law that I get.

379
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,930
You will get f equals a your
activation with the same as mine.

380
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:48,050
The force you attribute between the
two bodies and also be the same.

381
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,970
That is why I know that you will also
did use the same Newtonian laws that I

382
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,833
will.

383
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,210
Yeah.

384
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,500
You can also see it differently.

385
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,080
Yeah.

386
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,030
Uh, if I woke up from my nap and I am now
in the moving train and I examined the

387
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:07,670
world around me, I'm going to
get the same ethic. Was Amy

388
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,610
because they're seen by
a person on the ground.

389
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,340
The master's will be f equals m
a I am in this moving train. No,

390
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,800
but I have the same acceleration for
each mass and I have the same force.

391
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,871
If you want,

392
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:26,871
I'll complete the second equation to the
two x two prime over DT square will be

393
00:26:27,871 --> 00:26:31,680
minus one over x one prime
minister can still cry

394
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,190
like this is a little difficult.
We should talk about this.

395
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,960
I'm telling you that if I did use
ethic was m a at the f depends on the

396
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:49,221
separation between the particles then I
am sure that you will find the same loss

397
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:56,601
of motion because the acceleration is the
same that I get because we have seen a

398
00:26:56,641 --> 00:27:00,960
primus same as hay and the force will
also be the same because the force defense

399
00:27:00,961 --> 00:27:04,110
on the separation between particles
and that doesn't depend on,

400
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,230
that doesn't depend on which train
unit or it's not affected by adding a

401
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:14,700
constant velocity to the frame
of reference. So if you like,

402
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,140
this is the way you prove in Newtonian
mechanics, that principle of relativity.

403
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,530
So not only is it something you
observed by going on trains and whatnot,

404
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,800
you can actually show that this is
the reason everything looks the same.

405
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,170
In other words,
if the train was at rest in the platform,

406
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,520
and you and I were comparing notes and
we both find f equals m a I go to sleep

407
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:41,220
and I'm waking up in the train
going at a constant speed.

408
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,330
If you can look through the window and
look at the objects in my train, you will,

409
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,300
you will say they will be f equals Amy
because nothing has happened to you.

410
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,300
But you will predict. I will
also say f equals, I mean,

411
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,720
because if you see an acceleration,
I will see the same acceleration.

412
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,290
If you see a distance between
two masters to be one meter,

413
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:02,220
I also think it's one meter. If the force
is one over the square of the distance.

414
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:05,790
We agree on the force, we agree on the
acceleration, will agree on everything.

415
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,700
And once you prove an
f equals m a is valid,

416
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,170
it follows that every mechanical
phenomenon will behave the same way.

417
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,210
That's the reason things
behaving the same way.

418
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,903
Yep.

419
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,013
Pardon me?

420
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,000
You mean if the room failed
in the other frame? Yeah.

421
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,610
Suppose hypothetically that happened,

422
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,970
then it would mean that when
you wake up in the train you,

423
00:28:39,971 --> 00:28:41,170
we'll look at the world around you.

424
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:44,650
It will look different
because f is no longer a ma.

425
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,250
You will conclude when I went to sleep,
it was f equals, I may, when I got up,

426
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:50,560
F is not equal to Ama.
The train is moving.

427
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,620
So you will have to conclude that uniform
velocity makes detectable changes.

428
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:02,380
And if you look outside the train to
the other train or the train's going

429
00:29:02,381 --> 00:29:06,760
backwards, you cannot no longer
say you are going the other way.

430
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:10,540
I'm not moving. Because the
other person will say, Hey,
I calls, I may works for me.

431
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,150
It doesn't work for you.
So you're the guy who's moving.

432
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:19,140
So you've lost the equal status with
other inertial observers because those for

433
00:29:19,211 --> 00:29:21,220
whom f equals I may work,

434
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,210
we'll say they are not moving
and for you it doesn't work.

435
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,730
So you will have to consider your movie.
So uniform velocity,

436
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:31,990
if it makes perceptible changes,
can no longer be considered as relative.

437
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,160
Absolute.
And if you and I find each other moving,

438
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,150
that may be a real sense in which I am
addressing your moving because for me,

439
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:45,100
ethical, it works for you.
It doesn't, well, that's not
what happens in real life.

440
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:48,520
You find that works for both.
Then we say either of us can maintain.

441
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,354
We're not moving,

442
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:55,480
so now you've got a fast
forward to about 300 years.

443
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,010
This goes on. No problem. With
this principle of relativity.

444
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,290
In 300 years later,

445
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,370
people have discovered
electricity and magnetism,

446
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:11,430
electromagnetism and electromagnetic
waves with the identify as light and then

447
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,870
it was discovered that what you and I
call light is just electric and magnetic

448
00:30:18,871 --> 00:30:20,700
fields traveling in space.

449
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,640
You don't have to know what electric
and magnetic fields are right now.

450
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,620
There are some measurable
phenomenon there.

451
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,630
Lake waves and the waves had a certain
velocity that Maxwell calculated that

452
00:30:31,771 --> 00:30:36,660
velocity is this famous number three
times 10 to the eighth meters per second,

453
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,550
and the question was for who is this?
The velocity.

454
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,090
Then if for example,

455
00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:48,300
you can do a calculation of waves on a
string or something we'll be able to do

456
00:30:48,301 --> 00:30:49,134
in our course,

457
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,790
the waves on the string will be some
answer that depends on the tension on the

458
00:30:53,791 --> 00:30:55,740
string and the mass density of the string.

459
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,730
And that's the velocity as seen by a
person for whom the string is at rest

460
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:05,000
artifact. Calculate the waves of sound
in this room, right? Talk to you.

461
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,330
You hear Miele slightly later the time
it takes to travel as the velocity of

462
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:10,260
sound in this room

463
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,500
that is calculated with respect to the
air in this room because the waves travel

464
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:19,050
in the air.
In fact,

465
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:22,350
the fact that all of us are sitting
on the planet but itself is moving at

466
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:22,980
whatever,

467
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,540
1100 miles per second doesn't matter
because the ad is being carried along.

468
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,060
So even if the earth campus,
I'm in the hall,

469
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,400
as far as the velocity of sound
in this room is concerned,

470
00:31:32,401 --> 00:31:34,860
it won't matter because we
caddying the medium with us.

471
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:39,240
So people wanted to know
what does the medium,

472
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,770
which caddies the waves of light,
electromagnetic waves.

473
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:45,811
First of all,

474
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:50,811
the medium is everywhere because
then how do we know it's everywhere,

475
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,083
but they tell me,

476
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,670
yes, right? It travels
through the vacuum of space.

477
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:04,730
We can see the sun, we can see the stars,
so we know the medium is everywhere.

478
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:10,370
Then you can sort of ask how dense is
the medium. It turns out that denser,

479
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:14,870
the medium more rapidly signals travel
in most of the things that we know.

480
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,510
For example, when we look
at waves and sound, I'd,

481
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:22,770
when we look at the sound waves in a
solid or an iron, you'll find different,

482
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,650
very dense material velocity is very high.

483
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,500
So this medium, which is called
Ethan, would have to be very,

484
00:32:30,501 --> 00:32:33,200
very dense to support waves
of this incredible velocity.

485
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,980
But then planners are moving through
this medium for years and years and years

486
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,110
and not slowing down.
It's a very peculiar media,

487
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,040
but it has to be everywhere.

488
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,460
So we are all immersed in this medium
because we're able to send light signals

489
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:52,640
to different parts of the universe.
And the question is,

490
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,350
how fast is the earth moving
relative to this medium?

491
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,780
Do you understand this medium?
Is all pervasive.

492
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,460
We know that we can see the stars,

493
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,200
so it's going all the way up to the stars
and beyond and we are immersed in this

494
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:13,490
and we are drifting around in space.
What is our speed relative to the media?

495
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,590
That's a question that was asked about
the find the spirit alert to the medium.

496
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:23,300
You calculate the velocity in
the medium by Maxwell's theory,

497
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,320
so here's the medium in which
waves travel at a certain speed.

498
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,250
This is planet earth going around the sun.

499
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,870
At some instant you will have a
certain velocity with respect to either

500
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:42,590
and therefore the velocity of light as
seen by you will be modified from C to c

501
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:46,130
minus V
in particular.

502
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,180
Suppose the waves are traveling
to the right in ether,

503
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,090
and let me try it this way.
The earth is going at this instant.

504
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:56,180
At a speed V we expect
the speed to VC minus v

505
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,310
because part of the speed is neutralized
because you're going along with the

506
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:04,140
waves.
You will see a slower velocity.

507
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,210
So Mr Michelson and his assistant morally,

508
00:34:12,211 --> 00:34:17,100
they did the experiment
and they got the answer equally with this,

509
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,243
what does that mean?

510
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,200
What does that mean?
If you go yes,

511
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,280
no, no, but you cannot jump to that
right now. If you are following

512
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,820
Newtonian physics, you're expectation
is it should be c minus B. Yes.

513
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,510
Yup.
It means that there is no,

514
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,160
well, that's not so fast, but it
certainly means the following,

515
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,410
but that's the simple answer then that.
Yes.

516
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:53,950
[inaudible]

517
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,130
with what speed?
Zero.

518
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,130
Zero because you don't have to look,

519
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:04,290
you guys had already to
overthrow everything because
you know the answer, right?

520
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,391
Well,

521
00:35:04,391 --> 00:35:09,391
you got to put yourself in the place of
somebody in early 1900 there's no reason

522
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:14,320
to overthrow anything. The answer
this, you are going at a speed zero.

523
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Of course you realize it's incredibly
fortunate that on the one day Michelson

524
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,870
wants to do the experiment.

525
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,430
We happened to be addressed
with respect to the ether. Fine,

526
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:31,930
but we know that luck is not going to
last forever because you're going around

527
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:35,530
the sun
on a particular day.

528
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:39,720
Maybe that velocity was such
that on that day the earth was,

529
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:43,410
it rest with the specter of the ether is
clear the six months later when you're

530
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:44,430
going the other direction,

531
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,950
you cannot also be addressed
with respect to the ether.

532
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,240
But that's what you find
when you do the experiment.

533
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:54,150
You find every day get the same answer.

534
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:58,110
Any jolly will know you are not addressed.
You're moving around the sun for sure.

535
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,073
Yep.

536
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,230
Yeah.
So people try other solutions,

537
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,340
but it's simply a fact that when you
move one way or six months later,

538
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:12,160
the opposite way, you get
the same answers. See,

539
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,370
so one possibility is,
uh,

540
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,910
you don't want to look, don't be ready
to do revolutions. You try to avoid it.

541
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,270
So one answer this,
look at the speed of sound.

542
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,380
You and I talked to each other
then and we talked to each other.

543
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,720
Six months from now,
you get the same speed of sound.

544
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:35,980
Speed of sound is published textbooks,
right? 700 and something miles per hour.

545
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,590
How come that doesn't
change from day to day?

546
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,150
Anybody here this site?

547
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:45,100
Tell me why the speed of sound
doesn't change from day to day,

548
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,470
even though we're moving.

549
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,690
No one here can.
Yes.

550
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,110
Uh, no. We are moving
even six months from now.

551
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,140
We get the same speed of sound in
this room, but I talked to you.

552
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:05,630
Does it matter what time
of year it is? Yes. Yeah.

553
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,020
We had cadding air.
As the earth moves through space,

554
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:12,830
it carries the air with you and the speed
of the waivers is with respect to the

555
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,750
medium.
If you can caddy the medium with you,

556
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,590
then it doesn't matter how fast
you're moving. So they tried that.

557
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:23,620
They tried to argue that the earth carries
ether with it the way it caddies ed

558
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:27,170
with them,
then it's not an accident.

559
00:37:27,171 --> 00:37:29,780
You're addressed with respect to the
ether because you're taking it with you,

560
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,760
but it's very easy to show by looking at
distant stars that you cannot be doing

561
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:37,460
that. I don't have time to
tell you why that is true.

562
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,533
Yeah,

563
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:45,440
so you cannot take the ether with you.
You cannot leave it behind.

564
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,940
That's the impasse people with it.

565
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:55,830
So it's as if that is a car that's
going to the writer at a certain speed.

566
00:37:55,921 --> 00:38:00,120
See, you moved to the writers
some speed, maybe see over to,

567
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,890
I expect you to get a speed c over
to, but you keep getting, see,

568
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,650
you go at three 40 the velocity of light,

569
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:13,130
you still get the velocity of light that
is very contrary to what we believe.

570
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:16,800
In fact, that's in violent
opposition to this law here.

571
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,080
If this V we're not a bullet,
but a light beam,

572
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,080
suppose for me it's traveling at a speed
c and you are traveling to the right

573
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:28,760
and speed you,
you should get c minus you.

574
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:33,761
That's an inevitable consequence of
Newtonian physics and you don't get that.

575
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:36,860
Okay? That was a big problem.

576
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,960
So people tried to fix it up by
doing different models of eater,

577
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,310
but none of which worked.

578
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,630
And nobody knew why light is
behaving in this peculiar fashion.

579
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,800
So that's when Einstein came and said,

580
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,260
I know way light is behaving
in this peculiar fashion,

581
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:00,140
behaving in this way,
because if it didn't behave in this way,

582
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,780
the speed of light dependent
on how fast they're moving,

583
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,560
then when I wake up in the strain,

584
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,730
all I have to do is measure the
speed of light you've originally,

585
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:13,130
I got some number and I
may get a different number.

586
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:15,620
The difference will give
me the speed of the train.

587
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:21,260
So it would have been possible detective
velocity of the train without looking

588
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:23,330
outside just by doing an
experiment with light.

589
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,800
So even though mechanical laws involving
ethical may or the same loss of

590
00:39:30,591 --> 00:39:35,190
electricity and magnetism would be
such that somehow they will betray your

591
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,043
velocity.

592
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,490
So that would mean uniform velocity does
make an observable change because it

593
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:46,480
changes the velocity of light that
you would measure. But conversely,

594
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:51,510
the fact that you keep getting the same
answer means that electric and magnetic

595
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:55,060
phenomena are part of the
conspiracy to hide your velocity.

596
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,050
Just like mechanical phenomenon won't
tell you how fast you're moving,

597
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,880
neither will electromagnetic phenomena.

598
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:06,190
Because I understand it was very obvious
that narrative will not design a system

599
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:10,420
in which mechanical laws are the same,
but lots of electricity are different.

600
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,880
So he postulated that all phenomenon,
whatever it be,

601
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:20,881
that nature would be unaffected by going
through a frame at a constant velocity.

602
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,510
I lived through the initial one.

603
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,790
That's a very brave postulate because
it even applies to biological phenomenon

604
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,840
boat, which I'm sure Ryan
stay in new video little,

605
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,230
but he believes that natural phenomenon,

606
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,070
we'll just follow either the
principal or relativity or they want.

607
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,780
And that is something,
uh,

608
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,050
something you should think about because
that puts the only reason he had.

609
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,591
He just said,

610
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:50,790
I don't believe chapters one through 10
and our book will be able to Nativity

611
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:54,860
and chapters 20 through 30 bed.
We do ENM, doesn't beliefs,

612
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,500
all of that to the phenomenon
will obey the same principle,

613
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:02,370
which says all observers or
uniform motion, that equivalent.

614
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:07,140
Now that's really based on a lot of faith.
And even though you know scientists,

615
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:09,210
generally you're a pollster
intelligent design,

616
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,940
we all have some bias about the
way not to. The laws were designed.

617
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:16,650
There is no question about it.
You can talk to any practicing physicists.

618
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:21,690
We have a faith that underlying loss of
nature will have a certain elegance and

619
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:25,800
a certain beauty in a certain uniformity
across all of natural phenomena.

620
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,060
That is a fate we have. It's, it's
not, it's not a religious issue,

621
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,310
otherwise I won't bring
it up in the classroom,

622
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,260
but it's certainly credo of all
scientists or at least all physicists,

623
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,480
that that is some elegance in the laws
of nature and we put a lot of money on

624
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:46,160
that fate that the laws of nature
will do this, that will not do this.

625
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,660
Who are we to say that?

626
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:52,100
We would wait to say a nature wouldn't
have a system in which mechanics are the

627
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:56,990
a but electricity. Magnetism doesn't, we
haven't run into somebody called nature.

628
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,690
We don't worship a certain
age deity called nature,

629
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:01,490
but we believe the loss
of native obey that.

630
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,370
So even though a scientists or physicists
in particular men are believing

631
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,260
designed by any personal God,

632
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:14,180
they do believe in this
underlying rational system
that we're trying to uncover.

633
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,160
You could be disproven, you could be
wrong and make the assumption, but he had,

634
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,133
it was right.

635
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:24,590
It was really driven by this notion
that all laws of physics should obey the

636
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:26,600
same principle of relativity.

637
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:33,040
So the Einsteins postulates are that
light behaves in this way because if it

638
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:36,980
didn't behave in this way, it would
violate the principle of relativity.

639
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,480
Whereas we know mechanical phenomena do
electrical phenomenon.

640
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:47,150
I would not, that cannot be the
case. You have a question? Yes.

641
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,010
Why would that apply?

642
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:56,530
Yes. Uh, because in the case
of speed of sound, you are,

643
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,190
you can't take the medium with you.
So that is no such experiments.

644
00:43:00,191 --> 00:43:04,760
You can perform seeing the train.
If you could carry the ether with you,

645
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:06,310
it's no surprise you get the same answer.

646
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,910
But we know we cannot carry the medium
with us that come from steris real

647
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:10,744
experiments.

648
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:15,190
That's where the velocity of sound is
not elevated to a fundamental velocity on

649
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:19,690
which everybody will agree.
So the two great postulates,

650
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,070
so you've got nowhere to postulates
came from. The postulate.

651
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:28,080
Number one is simply a restatement
of the relatively principle.

652
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,430
I'll just say it in one sentence.
Uh,

653
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,440
exact wording is not
the important of inner.

654
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:37,870
She'll observers are equivalent.

655
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,953
Yeah.

656
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,540
Bye.

657
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:47,540
Equivalent means each one of them is as
privileged as any other one to discover

658
00:43:48,421 --> 00:43:49,290
the loss of nature.

659
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:56,100
So the loss of nature we found are not
an accident related to our state of

660
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:59,670
motion. If I find some loss and
you're moving to the tip to me,

661
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:03,480
you will find the same laws and if you
and I find each other and relate to

662
00:44:03,481 --> 00:44:04,314
motion,

663
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,130
you have as much right to
claim your address and I'm
moving and I have a Smith's

664
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,900
ready to claim that I am
addressed in your movie.

665
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,730
That is complete symmetry between
observers in uniform, relative motion.

666
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:19,260
There's no symmetry between people
in non uniform motion. As I said,

667
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:23,180
non uniform motion creates effects which
can destroy me and not destroy you.

668
00:44:23,181 --> 00:44:25,440
So no one's trying to talk
your way out of acceleration.

669
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,200
Where do you can talk your
way out of uniform velocity?

670
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,550
That's the first principle.
So this dead even from the time of Newton.

671
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,960
What is true here is that all inertia
observers equivalent with respect to all

672
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,620
natural phenomenon,
meaning all natural laws.

673
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,093
Okay.

674
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,550
And that does a generalization.
When we say all instead of just mechanical

675
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,710
and the second postulate,

676
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,600
you call it a postulate because
there just nobody to reduce this,

677
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,300
which is that the velocity of light

678
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,360
is independent of

679
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:11,600
the state of motion

680
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,880
off the source of the
observer of everything.

681
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:20,223
Yeah.

682
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,920
If a light beam,

683
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,050
they admitted it the way moving rocket
doesn't matter if the light beam is seen

684
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:29,790
in a moving rocket,
doesn't matter.

685
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,830
All people will get the same answer
for the velocity of light. Yep.

686
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,420
No, that's where it's a apostolic.
You can show a few things later on.

687
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,870
You can show that if there is any other
speed, which is the same for everybody,

688
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:51,350
that would have to be the speed of light
in the final theory of relativity that

689
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:55,350
are not two or three velocities that
come out the same for everybody.

690
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,340
There's only one velocity that can
have the same answer for all people.

691
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,590
That velocity is the velocity of light,

692
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:05,180
but that I don't mean it has to
be light itself. For example,

693
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,660
gravitational waves travel at the speed
of light. It's not just the light.

694
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:12,960
It has to do the velocity of
light being a single number,

695
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:17,370
which has to have the same
value for everybody. Okay,

696
00:46:17,371 --> 00:46:22,371
so it looks like he assaulted a big
problem because he has said white light

697
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:23,574
behaves this way.

698
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,600
Light behaves this way because it's part
of the big conspiracy to hide uniform

699
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:28,434
motion,

700
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,930
but you will see that you have
made a terrible bargain now

701
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,110
because once you take
these two postulates,

702
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,960
you have restored the relatively
principle to all phenomena. Okay?

703
00:46:42,961 --> 00:46:46,350
You've gone beyond mechanical
phenomena to electromagnetic phenomena,

704
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,510
but you will find that you have to give
up all the other cherish Nordstrom's of

705
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:52,560
Newtonian physics.

706
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,240
Think about why we're saying here's a
car going 200 miles an hour according to

707
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:05,850
me. You get into your own car and
follow that car at 50 miles an hour,

708
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:11,630
you should get one 50 when you keep
getting 200 at places may not be true for

709
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:14,070
cars going at the speeds.
I mentioned,

710
00:47:14,071 --> 00:47:16,230
but it finally you're talking
about a pulse of light.

711
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,520
That is true and you've got to agree
that it's really not compatible with our

712
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:24,830
daily notions or with the formula
I rode down. W Equals v minus you

713
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:31,370
when you put B equal to c w has to come
out to BC and that's not property of the

714
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:33,280
Newtonian transformation.

715
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:39,120
So what we are looking for is a new rule
for connecting x and t and experiment

716
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,653
[inaudible]

717
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:47,200
such that when the velocities are
computed and I played with the velocity of

718
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:50,710
light, you get the same answer.
That's what we want to do now.

719
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,290
So he had a sound good. I'm going to
do this now. Let's think about it.

720
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,370
Let me send a pumps to
the right or speech. See,

721
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,250
you are going to the
right at three fourth of,

722
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:08,251
see my Newtonian expectation you should
get the speed of the pulse would be one

723
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:11,470
fourth of c or do you insist that the sea,

724
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,340
so what will I say to you?
What will they accused you of doing?

725
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:21,070
I say you should get see over four and
you're getting C and you're finding

726
00:48:21,071 --> 00:48:23,980
velocity by finding the distance
it travels and dividing.

727
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:28,630
By the time you're jacking up a number,
like one fourth to see itself.

728
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,550
So what could make you do that?

729
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:34,623
Yep.

730
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:44,450
Then you're going to measure,
then your eventual philosophy would,

731
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,880
you should have had a greater lens.
Yeah,

732
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,730
so one option,
let me repeat what he said.

733
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,470
I will say your meter sticks
or being somehow shorter.

734
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,470
When you and I were buddies
and we were in the same train,

735
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:02,290
we agreed on the meter stick,
but have you gone into the moving train?

736
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,470
I will say that there's something
wrong with the meter stick.

737
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,710
Not only something wrong specifically
I would say metal sticks. I've shrunk.

738
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,820
For example,
if they frank to one fourth,

739
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:14,650
their size is very clear that you will
get the velocity before times what they

740
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:19,210
expect. But there
another possibility. Yes,

741
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:25,210
your clocks may be running slow so you
let the light travel for four seconds and

742
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:27,730
he thought it was only one second.
That's where you got four times.

743
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:31,810
The answer out of could be both,
but something has to give.

744
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,950
And that is why it is an amazing theory.

745
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:41,530
That's where it sounds amazing to me
that somebody who is 26 years old would

746
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,280
simply follow the consequences of this
theory and take it wherever it takes you.

747
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,020
But there's at the very foundations of
space and time that you have to modify.

748
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:54,220
So even though you restored the relativity
of principle and brought it back to

749
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:57,580
the front, the price you have to
pay is to give up your notions.

750
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,890
That length is length and time is time.

751
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,920
We used to think of meters because a
meter stick and a clock is a clock.

752
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:06,520
If I have a clock that ticks on one
seconds, you take it on a train.

753
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,610
I expected to be taking one seconds,
but we're saying it's not,

754
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:14,380
or something has to give in length,
measurement of time, measurement or both.

755
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,150
And that's what we're going to find out.
So here is how you find the route.

756
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,250
So let us say that,
uh,

757
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,990
maybe I'll do it all in one
blackboard because this is the,

758
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,750
this the key to the whole calculation.
You remember now

759
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,640
if that is an event here,

760
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:41,230
you call it an x prime and I call it x.

761
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,513
Okay.

762
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,170
And according to me,
you have traveled the distance ut

763
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,680
so x prime equals x minus ut.

764
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:01,660
Yes.
What we used to say in the old days,

765
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,930
and the converse of that is x equals X.
Brian,

766
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,200
bless you tea.
But no,

767
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:16,280
we'll admit the fact that maybe a t
and t prime are no longer the same.

768
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,740
But that's not all we do.

769
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,470
I would say whenever you give me a
length x prime, I just don't buy it.

770
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,440
I take any length you give me.

771
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:31,790
Yeah.

772
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:35,780
And I jack it up by a factor of gamma
to get the length according to me,

773
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:37,130
the coordinator according to me,

774
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:43,280
and you will take any answer they give
you and you were multiplied by the same

775
00:51:43,281 --> 00:51:48,260
factor. In other words, we
don't buy our units of length.

776
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:55,130
So if you say it should be
explained plus you tip frame, right?

777
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:57,050
That's your formula backwards for me.

778
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:02,570
Coordinate an event according to you in
the old days was explain plus Uti. No,

779
00:52:02,571 --> 00:52:06,770
we admit the t and t prime and
I'd be the same. Let me say,

780
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,470
but I will not take your legs.

781
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,340
I will multiply them by Gamma to get
the lengths according to me and you will

782
00:52:13,341 --> 00:52:17,060
not take my expectations, but you wouldn't
like to play it by the same gamma.

783
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,590
That is the symmetry between the
two observers. In other words,

784
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:25,820
if I think your meter sticks are sharp
and gamma is some number less than one,

785
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,840
I'm allowing you to accuse me of
having meters six, which are short.

786
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,890
Just very interesting.

787
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,460
If I said you are made of six a
short and you say my middle six,

788
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:37,370
a longer than average,
that's an absolute difference.

789
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:42,080
But we bought accuse each other of using
shotgun meter sticks and so we use the

790
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:46,930
same factor of gamma.
You're going to find this gamma now?

791
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:47,780
Yes.

792
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,070
Um, how do you know that?
Both the incentive time,

793
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,010
we'll give it the possibility.
They are different,

794
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,920
then we will see that they are different.

795
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,670
We know something's wrong with
space and something wrong with time.

796
00:53:02,671 --> 00:53:05,160
So we not assume that
d prime equals the tea.

797
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,060
You have to open up the possibility if
you in the end it may be the nature will

798
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:12,570
say the premise tea and something
happens to link the loan,

799
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,150
but we will find the
answer is more symmetric.

800
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:21,440
Yep. And why do we up that?

801
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,220
Because that is the symmetry between

802
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,910
the two observers. Uh,
if, if I want to save,

803
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,810
you want me to stick?
So shard,

804
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,480
why should you can see that you should
be able to accuse me of saying the only

805
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:38,700
different between you and me as you are
moving to the right and I'm moving to

806
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:41,010
the left.
Other than the sign of the velocity,

807
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,710
each person says the
other person's moving.

808
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:48,510
And so we will say that any length you
give, I'll discount by a factor of gamma,

809
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,840
by symmetry. Anything that
I call a lengthy, we'll
discount by the same factor.

810
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:52,674
Gamble.

811
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:57,210
Now let's apply this XT
was a certain event, right?

812
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:00,900
Let's apply it to the following event.
You've got to follow this very carefully.

813
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,080
When you and I crossed,

814
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:09,750
remember that was at the
origin of coordinates x
equal the t equals zero and x

815
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:12,480
prime equal to p prime equal to zero.

816
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:17,460
At that instance when our origin
story to let us emit a flash of light,

817
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,820
okay, maybe the audit and
starts, there's a spark,

818
00:54:20,821 --> 00:54:24,780
the light signal goes out and
the light signal is detected here

819
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,600
by a light detector.

820
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,330
That second event detection of the pulse,

821
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:41,020
it has a coordinate x t for me.

822
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:44,620
It has a coordinate x
prime t prime for you.

823
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:50,700
Same event as given different coordinates.

824
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:53,490
We are already used to the fact
that coordinates will be different,

825
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:57,390
but we are saying not only will
explain not be equal x t prime men,

826
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:58,500
I'd equal to t either.

827
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:07,530
Okay. But now let's write
down one important condition.

828
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,790
What is the relation between x prime and
deep frame in this particular pair of

829
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:12,624
events?

830
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,600
But what does x prime is the location
of the light poles after certain time.

831
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,670
So what the relation of the location of
the detection of the light poles in the

832
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:27,504
time t prime.

833
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,953
Yep.

834
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,800
Yeah,
he's saying x prime.

835
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:39,463
Yeah,

836
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:42,930
you guys understand that.
You agree with that statement.

837
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,390
This is not a random event. The second
event was the detection of a light poles.

838
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:53,400
Light Poles left the origin deep prime
seconds earlier and it's come to this

839
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:57,360
point according to this guy and the
ratio of the distance at the time is the

840
00:55:57,361 --> 00:56:02,361
velocity of light but it's also true
that for me the light went to distance

841
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:04,830
accident at time t

842
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,080
so that's the relation
of extra tea for me. Also

843
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,310
I'm going to use those students,

844
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:18,320
ELLs and combine into with this defined
this factor of gamma and we will do that

845
00:56:20,011 --> 00:56:20,844
now.

846
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:26,200
So I want you to multiply the lefthand
side where the left hand side and the

847
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:29,500
right hand side by the right
hand side of that equation.

848
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,200
I hope you understand that in the
Galilean days, in the old days,

849
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,310
let's see what you will say.

850
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,500
I will say experiments x minus ut because
the origins of shifted when a moral

851
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:45,280
duty and you will say x is explain
plus ut with the same time.

852
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,980
Now I'm saying time is different.
Not only that,

853
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:52,210
I don't buy your leg if you expect
me to have this length. I say no,

854
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:55,960
you exaggerated everything. I'll
scale it down by gamma and vice versa.

855
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,360
So if you multiply the lefthand side,
but the left hand side, you get xx prime,

856
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,350
the right hand side,
you get gamma square times x,

857
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:10,351
x prime plus you x deep
frying minus u x prime,

858
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,270
t minus used square t t prime,

859
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,040
no divide everything by xx prime.

860
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:33,050
Then you get one equals gamma
square times one plus you.

861
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,380
If you divide this by xx prime it,
we'll get deep prime over x prime.

862
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,390
If you divide this back six prime,
you would get tea over x.

863
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:44,481
Then you hear it,

864
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:49,481
you get used square times t o at
x five steep prime at x price.

865
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,670
So what does that mean?
Well t prime over x prime is one over c

866
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:10,700
and t o what? X is also one overs
because of what I wrote here.

867
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,260
If you want,
let me write this,

868
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:17,261
a steep frame over the next prime equal
to c and t over x equal to c so they

869
00:58:18,141 --> 00:58:19,130
will,
they will cancel

870
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:24,680
and I will get one equals
gamma squared times one minus.

871
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,790
I use square oversee square
because this to you or what?

872
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,590
X is a one over CNT prime over explain.
It's another one overseas,

873
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:42,460
so that gives us the result that gamma
is one over square root of one minus

874
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:48,050
two squared or c square.

875
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,020
If you plug that gamma back in,

876
00:58:55,890 --> 00:59:00,890
you will find x prime is
x minus ut divided by one
minus used quit or c squared.

877
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:18,400
Now once you do that, once you got
the relations with an experiment,

878
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:21,760
next you can go to the lower the
equation to solve for t frames.

879
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,260
I don't feel like doing that.
It's a simple algebraic equation.

880
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:29,390
Once you got to explain
how to solve for t frame,

881
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,440
take the second of the two
equations and solve for deep prime.

882
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,200
That detail I won't fill
out what you would get.

883
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:41,210
Keep prime is t minus two x
overseas squared divided by this.

884
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,820
So I have not done every step, but I've
given you all the things you need to do.

885
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:47,391
The one step,

886
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:52,150
I mean there are equations up there that
relate excellent experience with t and

887
00:59:52,151 --> 00:59:56,630
deep prime. So if you can get experiment
terms of x and t, the other equation,

888
00:59:56,631 --> 00:59:59,060
if you're solid, it will give
you t prime in terms of x and T.

889
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:01,220
And this is the results.

890
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:05,211
Okay?

891
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:10,211
This guy deserves a tool boxes because
it is the greatest results from

892
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:15,590
relativity.
It's called the Lawrence transformation.

893
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,780
And we're being able to derive
the load them, the summation

894
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,180
with what little we know.
And you can see,

895
01:00:23,181 --> 01:00:25,310
you can be a kid in high
school and you can do this.

896
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:30,350
There is no calculus or anything else
involved other than being open to the fact

897
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:33,800
that velocity of light
behaves in a strange way.

898
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:36,783
Yes.

899
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:44,670
Why is steel would actually
equal to c? Oh, of course. Uh,

900
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:49,340
you quite right. So you caught
the mistake here. T or what?

901
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:51,950
X is one oversea and one oversea.

902
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:55,670
So I really meant to write x equals CT,
yes,

903
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:01,860
negative solution rejected?
No.

904
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
If you defined gamma to be the absolute
value by which you transfer lengths from

905
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:12,600
you to me, then you can take
the positive group. Well,

906
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:17,010
I can also tell you other reasons.
Uh, let's take this formula here.

907
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:20,370
Let's take the case for the velocities.

908
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:25,050
Very small competitor velocity of light
that you oversee is a very small number.

909
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:29,730
This number is almost one and I get
explained, we could explain as UTI,

910
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:33,000
which in order to be the correct
answer at low velocities,

911
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,590
if you pick the minus sign, I'll get
to experiment with minus x minus ut.

912
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:40,470
That's not the right answer.
Not even close to advance.

913
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:44,880
Our low velocities,
if you go to velocity,

914
01:01:44,881 --> 01:01:47,610
you oversee much less than one.

915
01:01:47,611 --> 01:01:50,850
You got to get back the
Galilean transformation.

916
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,120
You can see if you oversee goes to zero.

917
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:58,110
You can forget all about this factory
here. You can explain this x, miners,

918
01:01:58,111 --> 01:02:01,890
ut and here you oversee can be neglected.

919
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,740
Forget all that you get p prime equals t.

920
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:11,890
So this coordinate transformation will
reduce to the Galilean transformation.

921
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:17,410
If the velocity between me and you is
much smaller than the velocity of lake.

922
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:23,160
So the formula it really
kicks in for velocity is
comparable with over last year.

923
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,700
Yep. Good sprayer. That speed.

924
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:33,720
Well, you start getting crazy
answers right, so you don't,

925
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,430
you can already see that the theory will
not admit velocities bigger than the

926
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:39,270
velocity of light.

927
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:43,980
You can already see it in this formula
that tells you that the one single

928
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:46,470
velocity that you wanted it to be.
Same for everybody.

929
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,660
It's honestly the greatest possible
velocity that no observer can move at the

930
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:55,770
speed with respect.
Another observer that is equal to what?

931
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:59,850
An excess of the speed of light.
So the speed of light,

932
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,880
which came out to be a constant in the
beginning of the theory is also turning

933
01:03:02,881 --> 01:03:05,880
out to be the upper limit
on possible velocities.

934
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,220
That's the auditing of the statement
that no observer can travel at the speed

935
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:14,100
because in the light,
but we'll discuss it more and more.

936
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:18,110
But you have to understand what
it is that has been derived. No.

937
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:22,770
What is the meaning of this formula here?
What is it telling you?

938
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,950
If I say, okay, these are called
the load and transformations,

939
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:29,010
what did they tell you?
What is,

940
01:03:29,011 --> 01:03:32,580
what are these numbers and
what is the significance

941
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,580
you like to try?
Yes.

942
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,510
Yeah. Well, one thing that they tell you,

943
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:42,930
it happens to be greater than

944
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,770
no, no, I don't mean the, what happens
in the formula and special cases?

945
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,610
What is it relating? What is XD
and what is extreme tip, right?

946
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:54,411
Okay.

947
01:03:54,411 --> 01:03:59,411
So x prize is would be the distance that
the person who's traveling or the high

948
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,590
he experiences you as the speed at
which we have a person whose job,

949
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:11,750
the speed of light. Then for that
frozen distances will seem shorter.

950
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:14,290
Uh, no, I don't even want, no, see,

951
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:17,530
I'm not even telling you to get
the consequences of the equation.

952
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:22,750
What are the numbers? X and t in this
equation and what are the numbers?

953
01:04:22,751 --> 01:04:24,880
[inaudible] piece frame in the sequence.
That's all

954
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,460
excellent.
T are

955
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:33,080
distance and time for a person
who is in right now and x,

956
01:04:35,401 --> 01:04:40,401
y and to prime our distance and
time for the person who is moving.

957
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,280
Right.

958
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,070
And when you say distance and time,
what do you mean distance in time?

959
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:47,310
The way that uh,

960
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:50,380
the length of the distance will
seem to them that they travel.

961
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:54,950
Uh, but what is happening at XD?
It's the coordinates of what?

962
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,360
Of their location.

963
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:02,820
They are located at zero, zero, right.
What's happening at [inaudible]? Yes,

964
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,113
yes.

965
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:11,670
Is the event.
The key I was looking for is an event.

966
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,890
So here is you've got to understand what
the formula is connecting things that

967
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,940
happening in space and in time,
right.

968
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:24,450
Something happens here that something
has spatial coordinate at a time code in

969
01:05:24,951 --> 01:05:26,560
it.
According to two observers,

970
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,540
the observers originally had their origins
in their clocks going site when they

971
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:35,420
passed. That's how they related and
one is moving to the rate of speed. You

972
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:41,320
then the claim is that if one event
had occurred in that accident t for one

973
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:46,030
person, for the other person moving to
the right or speed you the same event,

974
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,560
we'll have coordinators experiment type
frame and the relation between x and P

975
01:05:50,561 --> 01:05:52,180
and experiment t frame is this?

976
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:56,763
Yep.

977
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,760
No. The fact that an event
has different coordinates,

978
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:15,890
it doesn't mean that'd be Aruba observing
different laws. For example, uh,

979
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:19,190
let's take a that fire extinguisher,
we look at it,

980
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,620
it's obeying f equals Amy,
right.

981
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:25,400
The coordinator of the fire extinguisher
with me as the audit in is quite

982
01:06:25,401 --> 01:06:27,020
different from us.
The auditing.

983
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,193
Yeah.

984
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:45,670
You mean in this new
equations? Yeah. Yeah.

985
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:48,010
The new equations f equals
I may will not work.

986
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,013
That's correct.

987
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,031
Yes.

988
01:06:54,031 --> 01:06:58,710
So the point is the loss of Newton
themselves have to be modified.

989
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,580
F equals I'm able to be
modified in a certain way,

990
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:08,400
but the new modified laws will reduce
the f equals m a low velocities,

991
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:11,180
which is why in the old days
it looked like f equaled Emmy,

992
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:14,220
but that'll be new laws,

993
01:07:14,221 --> 01:07:16,920
but they will also have the
property that when I measured them,

994
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,030
I'll get the laws that will agree
with what you measured. Yes.

995
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:26,090
This individual valleys for time or
distance don't have to read the laws that

996
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,840
the coordinates of an event will
differ from person to person.

997
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:35,920
That's not the same as seeing the laws
as did use. Would it be different?

998
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:38,290
For example that are two stars.

999
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:41,770
We had attracted each other by gravitation
and they're orbiting around a common

1000
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:43,780
center of mass.
If I see them,

1001
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:47,980
I would find they obey the
law of gravitation with m
one m two overarch square

1002
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:48,510
where artists,

1003
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:51,970
the distance between the points and the
acceleration is whatever I think it is.

1004
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,030
You can go on a rocket and
look at the same two stars.

1005
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:57,580
They will be in a more complicated motion.

1006
01:07:57,581 --> 01:07:59,800
Maybe the whole system a bit
drifting dilutive to you,

1007
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:04,660
but the acceleration will be the same
as what I get in the force between them.

1008
01:08:04,661 --> 01:08:08,260
We'll also be the same as what I get
and the laws that you will that use by

1009
01:08:08,261 --> 01:08:11,380
looking at that star with the
same laws that I really did use.

1010
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,190
So that's the difference between the
laws being the and the coordinators being

1011
01:08:16,191 --> 01:08:20,810
the same. No one said x prime
and same in that equation there.

1012
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:21,621
They are different.

1013
01:08:21,621 --> 01:08:25,040
We are looking at it from different
vantage point for the second did of that.

1014
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:30,041
The fact that forces equal to mass times
acceleration is the same for the two

1015
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:34,580
people. Okay. The last will be the same,

1016
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:38,000
but things won't look the same. For
example, you can stand on your head,

1017
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,090
don't even have to go to another frame
of reference. You stand on your head,

1018
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,290
your z coordinates.

1019
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:45,530
The minus of my CSI coordinator for
whatever event I give a z will give minus

1020
01:08:45,531 --> 01:08:47,690
dizzy.
But the world,

1021
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,690
even though you're a little messed
up and want to stand on your head,

1022
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:55,390
you had every right to do that because
you will find ethicals. I May. Uh,

1023
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,850
so the point is the way we see events
may depend on what the original

1024
01:08:59,851 --> 01:09:00,684
coordinates,

1025
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:04,760
but the loss we did use have to be
distinguished from the perception that we

1026
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:08,660
have. Okay? For example,
if I'm on the ground,

1027
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:11,570
I send a piece of chocolate,
goes up and goes down.

1028
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,750
If you see me from a moving train,
you will think it went on a parabola.

1029
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:19,010
So no one says the chalk will go up and
down for you, for you to go like this.

1030
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:24,110
But it's motion. We'll still obey
f equals may. It's what I'm saying.

1031
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:28,340
So that's all you really mean
by saying things look the same.

1032
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:34,190
So what you have to understand is the
Lord and transformations are the way to

1033
01:09:34,191 --> 01:09:37,940
relate a pair of events and given event.
So here's a simple example.

1034
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:42,020
If you live in the x, y plane, that's
a point here. It's not an event.

1035
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:43,640
It's simply a point in the x,
y plane.

1036
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:47,420
You measured it this way and that
way and you call it the coordinators.

1037
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:52,970
If somebody else picks a different
coordinate system at an angle data,

1038
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:57,140
that person will say that's x
prime and that is white frame

1039
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,650
and x prime and white pray but
not the same. I remind the x,

1040
01:10:01,651 --> 01:10:06,240
prime is Xcor sine theta minus y
plus wasteland data, et cetera.

1041
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:11,240
And white frame is something else. Data
is the angle between the tubes servers.

1042
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:15,410
So the point is the point, it certainly
looks different than the two people,

1043
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:19,250
but the same point as to coordinates.
Similarly the same event,

1044
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,840
like the collision of two cars will have
different events for different people.

1045
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:25,850
It's not,
that's not the new part.

1046
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:31,070
The new part is that the
rules for connecting exterior
extremity prime is quite

1047
01:10:31,071 --> 01:10:33,530
different from the Galilean moons.
New rules.

1048
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,070
It's what do you guys have to understand?
And finally,

1049
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:41,930
why did Einstein get the credit for
turning the world in the fourth dimension

1050
01:10:41,931 --> 01:10:42,764
instead of three?

1051
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:48,650
I've trawled accent ever present there
to the point is t prime is always equal

1052
01:10:48,651 --> 01:10:52,610
to t no matter how you move,
whether it's in the Einstein theory,

1053
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:57,530
x and t gets scrambled into experiment.
T prime just the way x and y.

1054
01:10:57,531 --> 01:10:59,930
It gets scrambled in each other.
When you rotate your axes.

1055
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:04,610
So to have time as another variable,
that doesn't transform at all.

1056
01:11:04,611 --> 01:11:06,980
It's not same as making
it into coordinate.

1057
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,420
The four dimensional well of Einstein is
four dimensional because space and time

1058
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,270
mixed with each other.
When you change your frame of reference,

1059
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,990
that's what makes tea.
Now we coordinate that previously leaders,

1060
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:19,460
something same for all people.
