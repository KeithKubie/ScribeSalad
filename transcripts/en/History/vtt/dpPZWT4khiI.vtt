00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.540
NARRATOR: Valley of the
Kings, Luxor, Egypt.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.210
Opposite from the famous
burial chamber of King Tut

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.040
is a small crypt, KV55.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.830
It is known only by a number,
because even though it was

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.830
discovered over a
century ago, no one is

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.420
certain who was buried there.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.750
This is at KV55 in
the Valley of the Kings

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.040
away from the public
eye, most egyptologists

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.750
and archaeologists are baffled
and have a lot of questions--

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.210
very little was known
about this tomb, OK.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.330
[music playing]

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.500
One of the most common features
of all the tombs in the Valley

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.420
of the Kings is the amount of
wall paintings on the tombs,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.880
explaining everything
and telling the world

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.120
that this is the
tomb of that king,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.580
and this is how
great that king is.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.210
But look at this tomb--

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
completely empty.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.210
NARRATOR: In 1907,
archaeologists allegedly found

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.620
an ominous curse on
the wall, assuring that

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.080
whoever occupied
this tomb would not

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.920
return in a subsequent life.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.080
When they first
opened his tomb,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.460
they found little
remains of hieroglyphics

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.040
on this wall that
says, "The evil one

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.540
should not live again."

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.920
NARRATOR: Inside,
archaeologists found

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.670
a coffin with the remains
of a mummified body

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.250
with an elongated head.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.830
The right side of its
skull was smashed in.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.120
But perhaps the most
striking feature of the tomb

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.170
is that unlike all other
tombs in the valley,

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.420
it was not built to
keep grave robbers out.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.830
It was built specifically
to keep someone

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.290
or something trapped inside.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.290
This is the burial
chamber of the tomb.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.790
Right here is exactly where the
sarcophagus would have gone.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.330
And to north, south, east,
and west of the sarcophagus

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.380
where the four magical
cardinal blocks

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.880
that protects the tomb
from any intruders.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.040
[music playing]

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.880
This is a part of some of
the magical blocks that

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.120
surrounded the sarcophagus.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.120
These rocks and every
other tomb had inscriptions

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.040
on the outside, on the
side facing the world,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.210
so it protects the tomb from
the world except for this tomb.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.040
This tomb, the rocks
had hieroglyphics

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.250
with the inscriptions
on the inside,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.830
as if they intentionally wanted
to protect the outside world

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.250
from the contents of this tomb.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.250
NARRATOR: The ancient
Egyptians were strong believers

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.830
in reincarnation and
even had a specific name

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.920
for the part of the individual
that attaches itself

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.670
from the body after death.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.540
They referred to it as ba.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.500
The ba is the personality.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.250
The ba is the character.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.380
Every human had a ba.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.500
And the ba is the
part they believed

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.920
moves out and is
reincarnated in another life,

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.920
another living human.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.460
NARRATOR: Ancient
astronaut theorists

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.380
suggest that the concept of
what the Egyptians referred

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.460
to as the ba or the detachment
of the spirit from the body

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.460
has been depicted in
artwork throughout history.
