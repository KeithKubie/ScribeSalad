00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Why do we care about how far light can travel in 1 nanosecond?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There will be instructions on the website how you can do this for other operating systems,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but you'll see a window like this appear that will tell you what kind of processor you have.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you zoom that a little bit, you can see that it says we have a 2.7 GHz Intel Core Processor.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What GHz stands for is gigahertz,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which means we can do 2.7 billion cycles in each second.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That means the time we have to one cycle is actually less than a nanosecond.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You can think of a cycle as the time the computer has to do one step.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It does one step 2.7 billion times in a second.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That means the time for each cycle is 1 divided by 2.7 nanoseconds.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That means in the time the computer has for one cycle light travels 11.1 cm.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
How far is that?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Let's have a little scale here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If we have a dollar bill that's actually quite a bit longer than 11.1 cm--

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
11.1 cm is about three-quarters of the way across the bill.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Within the time light can travel that distance,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
the computer has got to finish processing one cycle,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
finish at least part of an instruction.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This should give you some idea of how fast the computer is operating.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is part of the reason a processor has to be so small.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If the processor was bigger than 11 cm,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we couldn't even send light across the processor in the time for one cycle.
