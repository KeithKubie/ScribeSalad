Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Janet. Boom, rod. I am Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab. And this next segment began with a simple question. Seeing as our topics before has been limits. And sure we'd done body when we did the brain. Oh, we're going to go really big. Yeah. Yeah. So we called up Steve Strogatz, mathematician at Cornell University, frequent guest on the show. And we asked him, are there limits to human knowledge? Yeah. And his answer sent us on a little adventure. Um, yeah. Is there anything that's at the limits of our knowledge is a question that a lot of us scientists worry about. And, and uh, certainly the 20th century taught us that there are many things that limit our knowledge. For instance, that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum physics showed us that you can't know the position and momentum of a subatomic particle at the same time. You just can't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:49          It's not a matter of not having good enough instruments or not being clever enough. It's just a fundamental barrier that nature puts in your way. Um, in logic girdles theorem tells us you can't prove certain things even though they're true. So we, there are all kinds of limits, but those seem a bit remote from everyday experience. And yet I think there are really important limits on our knowledge that we're all familiar with. What I'm thinking of here is our inability to think about big numbers because with your fingers you've got 10 you know, normally. So we're good at 10, we're barely good at a hundred and once you start getting to thousands, millions, billions and trillions, it gets hazier and hazier. When you hear now about the trillions of dollars in the deficit or whatever it is, the debt, you know, we don't, that means nothing. How are you supposed to think about that?

Speaker 1:          01:40          Now when you ask, why can't we understand the common cold? But we can put a person on the moon. It has to do with large numbers, not just large numbers of numbers. So Steve, that large numbers of things interacting, that there are so many genes involved and so many biochemical reactions involved, our brains are limited, our memories are very limited. And so, um, I worry a little bit that the, we might be approaching the end of our ability to have insight into certain kinds of questions. What Steve Means by the word insight is not like a, you found the answer. It's like, that's like a feeling, right? You like that. Oh, I get it. Feeling you get when you really understand the answer. Yeah. That satisfying feeling that I can see the reasoning and I can actually feel it in my bones. That's, that's a very pleasurable feeling.

Speaker 1:          02:28          But, um, one that we may not always be able to enjoy. I mean, you can see the space. We weren't really quite sure how to feel about this, but then Steve said, yeah, don't take my word for it. Talk to these guys that work down the hall from me. You'll see we can, we can go right ahead. Cool. Can you guys introduce yourself? Tell me who I'm talking to. Yeah. So, uh, my name is Hod Lipson. My name is Michael Schmitz. I'm a phd student and a, I'm a roboticist and hot and Mike have developed this thing which does make you wonder if Steve's right. It's a computer. Yes. Actually many a whole tower of computers that are all grinding away in this morning calculations.

Speaker 1:          03:10          Actually when you get down to it, it's just a piece of software, but they've named it Eureka cause that's what it was designed to do, to have you Rica moments. Uh, maybe a, a kind of simpler example. And the story of Eureka begins pretty simply with a pendulum. Okay? Depending on just one of these things you see hanging off a grandfather clock, okay, I've got a regular pendulum swinging in my mind. Okay? Swinging left and right now says w instead of a string connected to ball, make it a string, connected to a ball, connected to another string, connected to another ball, which is basically like a double pendulum. The cool thing about this is you just put it, you, you lift it up and let it go. And what you'll get says Mike is chaos.

Speaker 1:          03:52          That's really crazy behavior instead of Nice. And even now you got random. It's almost impossible actually try to predict where the single move. So what they did was they got a camera connected it to Eureka and Jessica just had Eureka Watch this thing. I mean a move about crazily. And then they asked the computer a really simple question, can you make some kind of sense out of this erratic behavior? Like is there something in this system that always stays the same? Tell me what about these pendulums over time is not changing cause with everything there's gotta be some kind of logic in there. So you're looking for a law, basically I'm, you're looking for the law of the double pendulum. Yes. That's the idea. So Eureka is there watching this pending numbers about 3:00 AM in the lab is basically spitting out all of these different guesses, formulating hypotheses. It's getting closer and closer. And then onto the screen pops this simple formula f equals m. What is f equals? I mean, is that actually the [inaudible]? The law that f equals the May is Newton's law of motion.

Speaker 2:          05:01          The Isaac Newton that Sir Isaac. To you. So Basic Law of physics in one of the greatest discoveries in the history of human thinking.

Speaker 3:          05:11          Uh,

Speaker 4:          05:11          took it about day 24 hours.

Speaker 3:          05:16          Okay.

Speaker 4:          05:17          But the interesting thing is that it came up with this thing without knowing anything about physics, nothing. That's why we kind of, we think that this algorithm might be able to find new laws that we don't know about yet.

Speaker 1:          05:30          In fact, once word got out about Eureka, that's when the emails start a couple emails a day to scientists all over the place who were like, Hey, do you mind if we borrow your robot for what kinds of stuff?

Speaker 4:          05:46          Um, anything you can think of from trying to predict behaviors of cows in the herd to particle physics, to a stock market

Speaker 1:          05:54          and fat. And this is when we get Steve's point about the limits of insight. That's when they met this guy. My name is girl soil girl is a biologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. He got in touch with hod

Speaker 4:          06:07          when you said, I have this amazing data, which is single cell dynamics,

Speaker 1:          06:13          meaning he's got this tiny little things. So simple bacteria, really basic, and he's been collecting this information on how it works on its inside,

Speaker 4:          06:20          how things go up and down. Certain nutrients increase certain nutrients, decrease over time, just like a [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          06:26          The thing is in a cell, it's like a thousands of pendulums. There's so many part genes turning on and off, thousands and thousands, tens of thousands proteins turning on other genes and nutrients going up and down. It's this crazy quilt of complicated feedback. And you wanted to know inside of this cell, how are all of these things related. I mean, we can measure it all, we can see things going up and down and all that. But what are the rules? What are the rules here in this? He says is the problem for biology. Biology is one of the least well understood systems compared to let's say, chemistry and physics. They're still lacking the basics. So we said, look, Mr Robot, can you tell us what you think are sort of the important principles governing this organism and maybe detect things that were hidden from us.

Speaker 4:          07:06          So he sent us the data and uh, we analyzed it

Speaker 1:          07:11          and uh, well, OK, let's not let, yeah, so what happened suddenly equation starting, popping out almost immediately the robot came back to us and said, okay, here's a set of two equations that describe your data. Do you remember by any chance what the, what the actual equation was? Not, not that we'd understand it, but just sort of to hear it said out loud. Yeah, no, I don't want, you don't have my rain man skills developed to that degree yet. The important thing is that the equation was telling them things like when this protein goes up, this other thing always goes down. And when that thing goes down, this gene turns on and there's a loop de loop. And when he went to his cell to check all this out, the equation was right. These equations match the data. And in fact, they explain new data.

Speaker 1:          07:58          These equations could even predict with the cell was about to do, but hold the champagne. There's just one little problem here. The formulas checkout, but we don't know what they mean. You don't know what they mean. Right? Meaning they don't know why these equations work. I why when this goes up, does that go down? Why when that goes up, does this go sideways? Why? I had to first look at this and try to make sense of it. We said like, oh, okay, I think we understand. And we were like, oh maybe we don't. We think that we're close to understanding it,

Speaker 4:          08:33          but you know, now we're in this bizarre situation. We can't even publish it right now cause we can't just publish a equation without explaining it.

Speaker 1:          08:42          So in the end, they're in this awkward position when they've got the answer, but they don't have the insight. And I think it's a preview of what's the common signs. The more we turned to with these big

Speaker 5:          08:56          questions, the more they'll give us answers that we just don't understand. We'll be faced with this challenge of having to find ways to get a computer to explain what it found. But that will leave us if this really happens in some weird position as bystanders where we're, we're sort of listening to the oracle, but not really understanding the answer. Is there gonna be a time when we, we can't cut it anymore. We've had this, this window in human history when we could not just know things but actually understand them. That is, you could know why they were true, not just know, but to know why. And that's a beautiful moment in human history. But I feel like it may only be a moment. Well, I don't really see it quite that, that sort of sad and dramatic because at the end there will be simple principles to describe even the most complicated of processes.

Speaker 5:          09:49          So you have a bias that prevents you from feeling the kind of despair that Steve feels that we were hoping you would feel. Oh, well I'm, I, I have a positive outlook, but I just wondering about the, we look what we have discovered. You'll say when you're an old man with your robot sitting there and address next to you and the robot will be holding your hand. But that will be a cold hand and Jad and I will be thinking, I dunno who's the we here. I as well. I would say we is sort of knowledge. I'm just thirsty for understanding and thirsty for knowledge. Me and the cold hand holding my hand, we've accumulated and contributed to the overall understanding of something that we thought maybe 50 years ago wasn't possible. And that would be something that would make me happy.
