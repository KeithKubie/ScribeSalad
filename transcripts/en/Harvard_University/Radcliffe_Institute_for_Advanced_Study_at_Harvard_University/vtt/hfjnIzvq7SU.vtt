00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.000
-Thank you so much, Judy.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.350
This was such a lovely and
thoughtful introduction.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.970
And also, thank you so much
for so much warmth and support

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.180
and just wonderful
conversation all year.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.402
And thanks to Liz Cohen for
her generosity in so many ways,

00:00:20.402 --> 00:00:22.360
and to everyone else at
the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.651
for this incredible fellowship.

00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:27.480
It's been not only massively
productive, but also just

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.710
a really inspiring time.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.680
I feel so lucky to be surrounded
by Fellows as brilliant and as

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.430
kind as all of you.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.570
And huge thanks to Sharon,
and Rebecca, and Mervy,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.670
and Katie for making
the Fellowship

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.730
run so amazingly, and
also for having the answer

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.570
to everything.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.920
It's pretty incredible.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.790
And thanks to you all
for being here today.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.980
So Judy you mentioned
the UnAmericans,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.410
which is my first book.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.350
It's a collection
of short stories.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.440
And it took me 10
years to write,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.190
and that was, like, working all
the time kind of obsessively.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.130
And because of the
subject matter,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.599
I ended up doing an
enormous amount of research

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.050
in many countries.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.950
And so today I
thought I would talk

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.480
about how I put
the book together,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.670
and then also just about how
one goes about researching

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.570
and writing a collection of
fictional stories, all of which

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.440
are grounded, in one way
or another, in history.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.600
And throughout the talk,
I'll read from my book.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.650
And then we can open it up
into a larger discussion.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.960
So I begin with
this deep interest

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.400
in exploring this triangle
between East European politics

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.934
during the Cold War,
Jewish American liberalism,

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:35.600
and the effect that
these two things had

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.190
on contemporary Israel.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.800
And so it's no surprise that
the stories in my collection

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.660
moved from McCarthy
Era Los Angeles

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.680
to contemporary Tel Aviv, to
communist era Prague and back

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.490
again.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.250
But beyond that idea,
I really had no idea

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.110
what themes would connect
the stories or how--

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.932
or even if-- the whole book
would come together as a whole.

00:01:56.932 --> 00:01:58.890
And the truth is that I
felt like I kind of had

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.660
to keep these crazy blinders
on the whole time I was writing

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.850
these stories, and just not to
worry about any of that stuff.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.220
And to just trust that
once I finished writing,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.120
the work itself would start to
tell me what these themes were.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.810
And that is basically
what happened,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.340
although it took a long time.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.305
And once the stories
that ultimately made it

00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:18.930
into this book were
done-- and I should

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.096
say there were so many
stories that didn't make it

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:23.470
into the book and that ended
up, like, in a secret drawer

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.620
that I hope no one ever looks
in because they're so bad.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.279
But once the stories that made
it into the book were there--

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.070
And I remember having
them all printed out.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.570
And I put them on
the floor of a room.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.110
And every day I would kind of
go in and stare at the stories

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.344
and shuffle them around.

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:39.760
And I was trying to figure out
both the order of the book,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.510
but also how these were all
threaded together thematically.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.860
And what I realize is that
they weren't put together

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.500
by a particular place or by a
particular voice, as so many

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.460
of my favorite collections are.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.770
They move around the globe
throughout almost a century

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.550
of history.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.630
And they're narrated by women
and men, younger, older,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.140
American, Israeli, and European.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.760
But rather, in the length there
was this underlying question

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.550
that was just sort of
thrumming beneath the surface.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.410
And the question was, what are
the complicated and sometimes

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.440
devastating effects that
one person's attempts

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.260
to improve the world can have
on the people closest to them?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.030
And so that's what these
stories are really about for me.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.990
So first of all, I'll turn
to the stories in Israel.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.010
I've spent a lot of my adult
life going back and forth

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.240
between the US and Israel.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.740
I used to work for a
nonprofit there, and also

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.440
at an immigration
absorptions center

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.070
for Ethiopian and
Russian immigrants.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.010
And the first connotation that
the word "unAmericans" has,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.170
I think for most of us,
is the McCarthy era.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.930
But as I worked on the
book, I became so interested

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.010
in this complex meaning
that the word unAmerican

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.910
might have to this current
generation of Israelis who

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.550
are forced to contend every
day with their country's

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.700
very messy but incredibly
close relationship to America.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.920
So for example, in
one of my stories

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.000
I have an Israeli
soldier who deeply

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.470
resents having to defend a
settlement filled with Brooklyn

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.760
born religious families,
but still pines for a chance

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.750
to visit the US for himself.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.740
And I also found
myself exploring

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.880
this idea of unAmericanness
in terms of privilege.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.380
So for example,
in another story,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.870
I have a working
class Israeli narrator

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.740
who has been living in
the US for a decade.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.690
And he doesn't at
all feel American.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.500
Whereas his wealthy
American wife can just globe

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.642
trot throughout the Middle East
with utter confidence and ease.

00:04:33.642 --> 00:04:35.100
And so that felt
really interesting

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.808
for me to think about,
the way that money

00:04:36.808 --> 00:04:38.500
works into that idea.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.130
And so what I wanted
to do, as I said,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.310
I'll be reading a bit
from my book as I talk.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.770
And so I wanted to read from
a story called "A Difficult

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.090
Phase," which is about a
young Israeli journalist named

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.960
Talia who's stationed in
Ukraine and whose career

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.100
and ultimately her life is
upended by America's most

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.520
recent economic crash.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.060
And I'll just read a couple
pages about her life in Keiv.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.480
And everyone can hear me, right?

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.560
I just got up and started
talking, so-- OK, good.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.890
So her name is Talia.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.426
And here we go.

00:05:07.426 --> 00:05:09.050
"When are you coming
back," her parents

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.070
would ask during
their weekly calls.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.730
They thought she was
insane for wanting

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.130
to report on the very
city her grandparents had

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.290
worked so hard to leave.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.350
The moment Talia
heard their voices

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.040
she felt as if she'd been
yanked across the Mediterranean

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.220
and transported back home.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.900
Her father on the porch,
listening to the radio.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.090
Her mother always beside
him, shelling fava beans

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.610
or peeling beets.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.990
Her two sisters chasing
after their toddlers

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.190
while their husbands
relaxed on the lawn.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.680
Things are working
out here, Talia

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.070
would tell them, wondering
how just having them

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.960
on the end of the line
could make her feel as

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.190
defensive as she'd been at 16.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.580
And the truth was that
things had been working out.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.290
Talia had wanted
to be a reporter

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.770
since she could remember.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.210
And it had stunned her,
sitting in her cubicle in Kiev,

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.970
that her life was
actually unfolding

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.950
the way she'd fantasized.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.680
She'd started at the Jerusalem
Bureau of an American paper

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.250
right out of college doing
whatever grunt work was needed,

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.320
filing, fact checking,
going on coffee runs

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.300
when the intern was busy.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.000
But her English was near
fluent, and after years

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.270
of begging and badgering
the Bureau chief,

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.507
he finally started giving her
work, as if the very behavior

00:06:18.507 --> 00:06:20.090
that had gotten her
sent to the corner

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.330
as a child was the thing
that garnered his respect.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.100
It was true, he
said, that she was

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.070
living in one of the hardest
countries to find staff jobs.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.860
No one ever left their
positions at the Israeli papers.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.430
And reporters from
all over the world

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.750
competed for work
at the foreign ones.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.910
But with her language
skills-- probably the one time

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.450
her Slavic literature
degree made

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.230
her more employable-- he'd
lobby the higher-ups in Chicago

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.080
to send her to Kiev if
things got bad enough

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.140
to need someone on the ground.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.840
That was four years ago,
in the fall of 2004.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.980
And Talia remembered
sitting in the flickering

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.770
fluorescent-lit conference
room of the Jerusalem Bureau

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.320
watching it all unfold
on TV, the election fraud

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.670
allegations, Ushanko's
terrifying, ever-changing face,

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.710
and holding onto a shameful,
selfish hope for things

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.940
to keep spiraling.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.310
She'd always felt so envious
of the other reporters

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.270
at her paper in Jerusalem.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.000
None of them Israeli,
all of them cabbing over

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.030
to the bar at the
American Colony Hotel

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.230
every night after
work as if living out

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.340
some vintage fantasy.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.520
They were all smart.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.166
They all spoke the language.

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:27.040
Many had relatives there
and knew the country

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.990
even before they were hired.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.370
But there was something so
romantic about the way they

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.380
saw their jobs, sinking into
chairs in the garden bar,

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.210
press passes still
dangling from their necks.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.310
Immediately launching
into thrilling tales

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.170
at how they were this
close to danger that day

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.810
before pausing and taking a
handful of the free cashews

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.690
on the table.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.180
Even her bureau chief-- whom
Talia genuinely admired--

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.790
still acted as
though he was playing

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.090
the part of the
daredevil reporter,

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.740
always driving himself
into the territories,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.420
traveling with a
separate passport

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.230
through Lebanon and Syria as
if relentlessly performing

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.220
for a rapt imaginary audience
back home in Chicago.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.930
It had always bothered
Talia, listening to them

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.870
debate her country's politics
when it was implicitly

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.580
understood that the moment
their brushes with danger

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.430
went from being this close
to way too fucking close,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:20.350
they could leave.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.880
But then she was given
the same opportunity

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.812
to be lifted from her
life and plunked down

00:08:24.812 --> 00:08:26.270
in a place to which
she had an even

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.020
flimsier connection than many
of her coworkers had to Israel.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.184
And she found herself guilty
of that same excitement.

00:08:33.184 --> 00:08:34.600
Anyone would have
felt it covering

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.652
the demonstrations, of course.

00:08:36.652 --> 00:08:38.610
But she'd been just as
amped in the months that

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.341
followed, sitting in the
stuffy, windowless media

00:08:41.341 --> 00:08:44.260
room in the district court
house or transcribing

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.720
at her desk for hours, eating
meal after meal of crackers

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.250
with chocolate spread.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.130
As if everything
took on a significant

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.600
she'd never felt
back home, the thrill

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.750
of living on the other
side of the glass.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.990
I'll stop there.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.810
So as I kept
working on this book

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.770
and was working
on these stories,

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.420
I kept thinking about this
notion of unAmericanness

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.340
also for my East
European characters.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.250
And those characters are
dissidents and academics,

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.220
banned artists and writers
who risk their lives

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.710
for their politics and
their mother countries

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.270
only to come to
the US, where they

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.970
have to reinvent
their identities

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.410
and where they're treated
as anything but American.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.730
And I kept thinking about
this really complicated

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.900
emotional impact that
the fall of communism

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.410
might have had for my
characters during that time.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.620
Like, what is it like
to dedicate yourself

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.030
to a cause-- for these
characters in this case,

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.410
it's defeating communism-- that,
in the course of world events,

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:42.700
is ultimately successful, and
therefore it comes to an end?

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.180
And I wondered
whether some people

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.400
might have had a niggling
feeling of nostalgia

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.400
for this incredibly bleak
time simply because they

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.870
held a significant place in it.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.870
For so many of my characters,
their entire sense of self

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.070
is shaped by their
political work.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.930
And I felt like I was
spending so much time

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.740
just trying to understand
their political lives.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.460
And I wanted to explore how
having lived under surveillance

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.440
in Eastern Europe influences
their lives once they immigrate

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.620
to America, where
they quickly realize

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.890
that not only are they
no longer being watched,

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.940
they're not even being noticed.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.000
And so I wanted now
to read a couple pages

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.810
from a story that's in
conversation with this idea.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:24.690
And the story is set in this
fictional college town in Maine

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.430
where a former Czech dissident
named Tomas is teaching.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.600
And he has a supremely
fractured relationship

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.939
with his ex-wife, Katka,
and their daughter, Daniela.

00:10:34.939 --> 00:10:37.230
And he has just learned that
his daughter Daniela-- who

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:40.490
is in her 20s-- has written
a play about their family,

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.680
and that it's going to
be produced off-Broadway.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.670
And he's just a disaster.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.265
And he is massively
paranoid and terrified

00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:51.640
that the play is going to
expose him and his shortcomings

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.700
as a father.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.520
And so he strong-arms his
daughter into a weekend

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.480
up in Maine so that he can
get his hands on the play

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.530
and attempt to revise it.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.380
So that's the story.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.780
And I'll read a few pages
as he prepares for her visit

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.110
and looks back on these
early years in America.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.010
And the story is called
"The Quietest Man."

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.050
And you can all just picture me
as a paranoid, middle aged man

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:14.580
as I read.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.150
So, "The Quietest Man."

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.650
OK.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.120
And so, again, Daniela is the
daughter and Katka is the wife.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.510
Daniela was two when
Katka and I separated.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.530
She was bred on a lifetime of
her mother's tales about me.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.744
Katka, I imagined,
would begin by saying

00:11:38.744 --> 00:11:40.160
that I was the one
who dragged her

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.490
to America in the first place.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.050
In Prague, we had written
anonymously with our colleagues

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.790
for The Journal, the
chronicle of our time.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.300
We wrote by hand.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.800
The government had a record of
everyone who owned typewriters.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.100
And late at night, I'd sneak
into different university

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.620
buildings to type the materials.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.380
Every time we finished an
issue, we'd distribute it

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.800
to people we knew, who
then passed it along

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.810
to people they knew, until
we have thousands of readers

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.439
throughout the country.

00:12:07.439 --> 00:12:08.980
But when the government
still managed

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.910
to link me to a typewriter, I
was brought in for questioning

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.250
and fired from my teaching post.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.780
At the time, Katka had
seemed like the lucky one.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.820
She was on maternity leave that
term and so avoided suspicion.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.430
But it was my name people
chanted outside the university.

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.410
It was my name that made
international headlines

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.070
and reached the desk
of Saul Sandalowski

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:31.830
the American professor
who campaigned

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:36.570
to get me a visa and a teaching
job to avoid imprisonment.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.860
She'd tell Daniela about packing
our entire flat in three days

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.110
before boarding the long
flight to the states.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.640
She'd talked about
the brick faculty

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.020
apartment that
awaited us in Vermont,

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.030
boxy and carpeted and new.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:53.130
A million times nicer than our
flat back home, but dimly quiet

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.450
without our friends crowded
around the living room,

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.680
chatting away the evening.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.930
She talked about how my
assistant professor's salary

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:01.880
barely covered our rent.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.880
And she'd talked about
working the early morning

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.220
shift as a janitor
at the college,

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.640
mopping the same mahogany
classrooms I lectured in,

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.900
emptying the garbage
can full of my students

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.170
crumpled napkins and
paper coffee cups.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.924
Katka came from a long
line of intellectuals.

00:13:17.924 --> 00:13:19.840
She was the one who was
supposed to be offered

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.120
a professorship in America.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.280
Her father had been shipped
to a psychiatric prison

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.370
for writing his own
anti-government pieces when

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.090
Katka was still a baby.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.930
And an enormous part
of her childhood

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.370
was watching her mother devote
herself to getting him out.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.340
I remember Katka
back in university,

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.940
and trying to impress
her with my big ideas,

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.250
only to realize the
political books I was reading

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.430
for the first time were one
she had already dissected

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.470
and gleaned an
understanding of years ago.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.400
There was something
so romantic--

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.360
almost exciting-- about watching
this brawny college girl reduce

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.180
my ideas to a lumpy
pile of porridge,

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.480
making me feel not like a
rising star at the university,

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.290
but what I knew I
really was deep down,

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.960
a skinny kid from a family
of uneducated dairy farmers.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.680
A big part of me
had always believed

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.920
I was destined to
ride her coattails.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.060
I could see how hard the
move to Vermont was on her.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.350
I could see it in the way
she closed into herself when

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.420
I dragged her to cocktail
hour at the Provost House.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.960
The way even meeting me for
a quick lunch before class

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.620
made her anxious.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.720
The woman who had once stood
outside party headquarters

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.190
chanting "STSTB equals
just the gestapo"

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.860
was suddenly afraid to order
at the campus sandwich shop

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.545
because she didn't
understand the menu.

00:14:34.545 --> 00:14:36.670
At this point, Katka would
say the transition would

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.128
have been difficult
no matter what,

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:40.570
but that I certainly
didn't help.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.720
She'd say even when I was
home I wasn't really there.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.610
At the dinner table, or lifting
a crying Daniela from her crib,

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.260
I always seemed to be silently
working on another essay.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.360
How I ducked into my study
at every possible moment,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.580
how birthdays and
anniversaries slipped

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:00.060
into a murky, irretrievable
place in my mind.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.140
But how I never seemed to forget
the dates of Saul Sandalowski's

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.520
dinner parties.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.910
And she would be right.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.580
But those dinners!

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.340
Saul with his floppy,
wheat-colored hair and shirt

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.960
sleeves rolled to his elbows
clamping a hand on my shoulder

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.960
as he led me inside.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.155
His stone house on
Seminary Road, so amazing

00:15:19.155 --> 00:15:22.750
and grand I always got lost
looking for the bathroom.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.650
I was the honored guest, the
man with the stories scholars

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.130
and journalists and
philanthropists wanted to hear.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.400
And so, over glasses of wine,
I told him about the two STB

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.407
officials waiting outside the
Political Science Department.

00:15:36.407 --> 00:15:38.540
"Tomas Novak," one had said.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.810
And I had said, "Why
do you need to know?"

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.680
And they dragged me into
a black service car.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.640
It was late April,
sunny but cold.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.820
And as we pulled
away from the curb,

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.200
I saw people outside
the university

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.540
staring away or
feigning conversations

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.790
so they wouldn't be witnesses.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.720
In the headquarters,
the officials

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.200
led me down a long hallway
into a windowless room

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.030
with white walls and a steel
desk with a green-eyed,

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.260
round faced man behind it.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.330
He calmly asked me to name
the other writers involved

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:10.500
in the journal.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.920
I refused.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.450
He asked again.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.860
He asked again and again,
so many times that the hours

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.460
began to blur, and
I couldn't tell

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.840
if we'd entered the next day.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.680
All over Czechoslovakia,
writers were

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.146
breaking down and naming names.

00:16:25.146 --> 00:16:27.270
But did they really believe
sleep deprivation would

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.630
crack a father with a newborn,
I joked to Saul's guests.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.540
Though I remembered the
moment I'd started to cry,

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.280
sitting in that hardback
chair as I recalled stories

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.030
of people brought
in for questioning

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.350
and never heard from again.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.600
The lights were bright.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.850
And one of the chair legs
was shorter than the others,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.120
so I felt as if I was
perpetually sliding off.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.020
And every time I
nodded into sleep,

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:53.210
the man would slam his desk
drawer shut, jolting me awake.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.424
But I continued to refuse.

00:16:55.424 --> 00:16:56.840
And when one of
Saul's guest would

00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.130
ask where that bravery came
from-- as someone always

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.579
did-- I'd tell them we all had a
reserve when we needed it most.

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:06.770
I believed that,
though sometimes I

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.650
wondered if I could
ever depend on it again.

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.859
When I was finally
released, word spread.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.109
And I became famous
among other writers.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:17.060
They called me the Quietest Man.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.920
Yet, as I circled Saul's
living room with Brubeck

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.780
on the stereo and little salmon
crudities being passed around,

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.730
I understood I could finally
name the names of the chronicle

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.910
writers without consequence.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.470
So I told them about Katka
Novak, my brave, brilliant

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.960
wife, who unfortunately
wasn't here

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.690
this evening because we
couldn't find a sitter, I lied.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.420
When in truth, she really wanted
to leave the apartment anymore.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.820
My wife, who, for
the four days I

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.100
remained quiet in the
interrogation room,

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.060
was anything but.

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.480
With a newborn on her
hip, she led rallies

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.300
outside the university,
marching through the streets

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.074
and up to a podium
in Wenceslas Square.

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.490
She spoke with
such force that she

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.022
persuaded an American reporter
to write a piece about me.

00:18:00.022 --> 00:18:01.980
So while people with less
evidence against them

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.860
were jailed, enough support
came through that my family

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.280
and I were given
emergency clearance.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.750
And when I described
Katka to Saul's guests,

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.190
it was like she was
back up on the podium,

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.580
drawing so large a crowd
that children climbed

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.200
the trees to glimpse her.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.080
But then Saul's
dinners would end,

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.090
and I'd tiptoe into
our silent apartment

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.380
and find the new Katka in
bed with the lights off.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.890
"You awake," I'd whisper,
a little drunk off the wine

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.020
as I ran a finger along
her pale freckled arm.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.420
"No," she'd say, rolling over.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.850
And it was only hours
later as the sun came up

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.810
and I walked her through campus
that she'd unlock the lecture

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.840
hall with her chunky
ring of janitors keys

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.010
and say, "Imagine eating alone
while I was at dinner parties."

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.640
That's how Katka was.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.280
She'd pick up a
conversation I thought

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.480
had ended eons ago without
ever reintroducing the topic.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.730
"I'm not saying we go home.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.570
I know we can't," she'd
say. "But maybe New York.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.260
Somewhere," she'd said,
"With people like us."

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.300
Somewhere that didn't feel
like the edge of the Earth.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.360
But before I could answer,
the first students of the day

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.470
would breeze past
us as if we were

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.300
no more significant
than the chalk

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.980
boards and long wooden
desks that filled the room.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.160
Katka continued to push the
idea of moving to New York.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.280
But things were changing
for me at work, and fast.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.270
Katka said I was being selfish.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.990
I told her I was working
hard for all of us.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.406
She said I owed it to our
daughter to be home more,

00:19:25.406 --> 00:19:27.030
that if I didn't
consider her feelings,

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.760
she'd leave me and
take Daniela to stay

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.910
with her cousin in Queens.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.060
I begged her not to, but
there was a secret part of me

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.100
that wanted her
to go, that longed

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.220
to be free from the
responsibility of my family.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.590
I wasn't ready to leave Vermont,
not when I felt my life there

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.890
opening up wider and wider.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.680
Of course, I didn't
really expect a woman

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.435
with no money and next
to no English to leave.

00:19:50.435 --> 00:19:52.310
And it was only when I
made the first custody

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.640
drive down the Taconic
that it actually felt real.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.190
Of course, I didn't expect
Katka to find steady enough work

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.210
cleaning houses in New
York, or that she'd

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.750
parlay it into her own business
with a dozen employees.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.430
And of course, I didn't expect
that three years after Katka

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.500
left, communism would collapse
and the work I dedicated

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.680
my life to would be done.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.160
That the dinner discussions
at Saul Sandalowski's

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.490
would suddenly
revolve around Bosnia,

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.180
and that a young female Serb
would become Saul's newest

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.310
honored guest.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.320
And I certainly didn't
expect that same woman

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.780
to win tenure over me.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.310
That my 30s and 40s
would be about mastering

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.120
the delicate tricky dance
of pleading for adjunct

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:34.600
work up and down the East coast,
Albany, Durham, Burlington,

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.110
and now for the past
two years, in Harpswick,

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.687
Maine-- which, if Katka
had thought of Vermont

00:20:39.687 --> 00:20:41.770
as the edge of the Earth,
would have made her feel

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:42.936
she'd fallen off completely.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.040
So thanks.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.248
And the other thing that I
wanted to talk about today

00:20:51.248 --> 00:20:54.120
is family history and the
way that those elements

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.440
worked their way into
the writing of the book.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.530
And Judy mentioned this essay.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.280
And I have to say the
most exciting thing.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.380
So I had wanted to talk
about this woman from Antopol

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.390
that I had met at this friend
of a friend's party in Haifa.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:08.670
And this was back in 2000.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.690
I had just graduated college,
and I was living in Israel.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.720
And then I walked in here to
give a talk, and I met a man.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.890
And David and Kitty-- who
I just met 20 minutes ago--

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.000
and their family is from
the village of Antopol.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.960
And they brought the book.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.700
So that was really exciting!

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.530
So, it was just like
I wanted to cry!

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.520
I felt so emotional
right before this talk.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.860
So it's just so incredible.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.440
And so thank you so much
for bringing this book.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.180
And there aren't
that many of them.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.340
Yeah.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.680
So I would like to talk
a bit about this book.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.220
And as Judy had said,
so I had met this woman.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.000
And you know, I
was at this friend

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.649
of a friend's party in Haifa.

00:21:49.649 --> 00:21:51.440
I think the only person
I knew at the party

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.760
was the friend who'd invited me.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.468
So I had no one to
talk to at this party,

00:21:54.468 --> 00:21:56.490
and this is how this
interaction happened.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.134
I was standing by
the dessert table

00:21:58.134 --> 00:22:00.550
just kind of eating desserts
and having no one to talk to,

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.849
feeling embarrassed.

00:22:01.849 --> 00:22:04.140
And then I went to the kitchen
to have something to do.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.060
And I met this
elderly woman who Judy

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.470
mentioned in her introduction.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.160
We started chatting, and I think
it was about 30 seconds of me

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.410
trying to chat with her up
with her in Hebrew when she

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.370
was like where are you from?

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:14.310
And I said America.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.180
And she said, no, no, no.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:15.971
Where are you from?

00:22:15.971 --> 00:22:16.530
California.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:17.488
No, where are you from?

00:22:17.488 --> 00:22:18.290
We got to Antopol.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.630
And I found out that this
woman was from Antopol.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:24.170
And it was genuinely one of
the most extraordinary moments

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:24.830
of my life.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.150
I come from of a big
family of storytellers.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.940
And so growing up,
I had just relished

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.340
these tales of all of these
times before I was born.

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.560
So I had heard about
this battered VW Bug

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.640
that my parents had lived
in before I was born,

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.140
and then when I was little.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.360
It was nicknamed "Blue"
after the Joni Mitchell album

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:49.290
that I just remember on
repeat my entire childhood.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.610
And then before that, the
generation before that,

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.160
my grandfather had been really
active in the Communist party.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.130
And I had heard so many stories
from my mom and her siblings

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.850
about those dinnertime
visits from the FBI.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.390
You know, always right
at dinner time, always

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:04.790
these two men in these
stiff brown suits

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.310
asking my grandfather if
he had a moment to talk.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.330
Those were the stories
that I heard so many times.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.640
And then as Judy mentioned,
I had also heard stories

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.670
about my namesake,
my great grandmother

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.990
Molly, who had come from
this village of Antopol.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.206
And who had basically had to
leave her entire family behind,

00:23:21.206 --> 00:23:22.830
went to work in the
sweat shop that was

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.630
run by another cousin of ours.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.400
And she didn't make enough
money to send her family over.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.990
But besides that,
I just knew nothing

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.140
about where Molly was from.

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.640
And I knew nothing
about this place.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.200
And it was just this
kind of dark place

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.940
that no one in my
family talked about.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.780
And even the funniest
relatives just kind of

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.905
didn't know how to twist
that into a good anecdote.

00:23:40.905 --> 00:23:42.590
And so nobody talked about it.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.820
And I had spent all
of these years trying

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.770
to summon an image of
this place or that time,

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:47.850
and I didn't know how.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:51.250
And so meeting that woman
and finding that book

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:53.410
was incredibly life changing.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:57.016
And it's funny, because I mean,
I'm only here for the term.

00:23:57.016 --> 00:23:58.390
So I don't have
the book with me.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.945
So the fact that the book is
here while I'm talking about it

00:24:00.945 --> 00:24:02.600
is pretty mind blowing.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.990
And so I wanted to
describe it a little bit.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.980
So as Judy talked about,
it's a Yizkor book.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.160
It's a memorial book.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.140
It's a memorial book basically
from all of these villages

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.100
that were basically just
destroyed during the Holocaust.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.280
And so there are
these books that

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.700
are published by
former residents,

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.630
or by aid societies as
remembrances of communities

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.530
and of people lost
during the Holocaust.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.810
And it's this enormous,
I think really carefully

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.110
and beautifully
put together book.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.005
You can just feel
the careful bindings

00:24:34.005 --> 00:24:35.380
and in the thickness
of the pages

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.650
that people just put so much
effort into creating this book.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.270
And one of the things that I
loved the most about this book

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:45.470
and that captured me the
most were the accounts

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.140
of the villages partisan
fighters, teenagers

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.066
who escaped the ghettos
during World War Ii,

00:24:50.066 --> 00:24:51.690
and joined these
underground resistance

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.290
movements in the forests
surrounding Antopol.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:57.160
And growing up in the states,
I had known very, very little

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.440
about the partisans.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.830
But in Israel I was
living there that year

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:02.504
and working with teenagers.

00:25:02.504 --> 00:25:04.920
And I was learning that it was
basically an essential part

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.200
of the school curricula.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.340
And that was so
intriguing to me,

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.260
that in Israel they weren't
teaching the Holocaust

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.420
just as a story about victims
and about innocent lambs being

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.560
led to the slaughter.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.070
But rather that, among
these tales of the camps

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:20.430
and the ghettos that they
were teaching in the schools,

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:21.917
there existed this
other narrative

00:25:21.917 --> 00:25:24.000
that was being taught,
which was the story of Jews

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.147
fighting back.

00:25:25.147 --> 00:25:26.730
And to the Russian
of the Chechen kids

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.650
that I was working with that
year at the absorption center,

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.504
the Lithuanian
poet Abba Kovner--

00:25:31.504 --> 00:25:33.920
who was a partisan fighter who
went on to live in Israel--

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.730
was considered a national
treasure to them.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.970
And they were reading
his poems in class.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.010
And growing up in the states, I
had never heard of Abba Kovner

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.860
And for so many
years, I had just

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:47.844
wondered about all of
these people from the past.

00:25:47.844 --> 00:25:50.510
All of the people who had stayed
Antopol, and all of the friends

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.968
and the neighbors
and the relatives

00:25:51.968 --> 00:25:53.330
that Molly had left behind.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.770
And I did really feel that
suddenly finding this book,

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.540
it was as if I finally got
access to these stories

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.520
and into these voices.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.310
And I became obsessed
with this book.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.550
I carted it around with
me everywhere that year.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.240
It was really the
year that I first

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:14.260
started planting the early seeds
of what would become this book.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.970
And really drawing
on my family history,

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.719
whether they were the
McCarthy era stories

00:26:17.719 --> 00:26:19.500
or the liberalism of the 70s.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.010
And I suddenly
felt like I sort of

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.470
had the access and
the authority--

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.460
I thought-- to be able to
write about this place and time

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.650
as well.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:31.450
And it would be so
perfect to tell all of you

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.500
that I read all of
these books and that it

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.380
was incredibly helpful
and illuminating for me.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:41.199
But the truth is that I found
this bookstore in Tel Aviv that

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:42.490
wasn't far from where I worked.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:43.698
And it was on Allenby Street.

00:26:43.698 --> 00:26:46.379
And it was behind this
electronics repair shop

00:26:46.379 --> 00:26:47.670
and the Sephardic luncheonette.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.420
And I would go in there
every couple days.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:54.220
It had this seemingly endless
resource of Jewish history

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.197
books in English.

00:26:55.197 --> 00:26:57.780
And the guy, the owner, I would
always stop and chat with him.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.855
And I remember he was
kind of large and balding,

00:26:59.855 --> 00:27:02.230
and his clothes were so rumpled
that he kind of resembled

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.856
an overstuffed drawer.

00:27:03.856 --> 00:27:05.980
And I remember he looked
at me one day and he said,

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.270
I have never met anyone with a
more depressing taste in books.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.830
And I thought, that is true, OK.

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.760
But I have to say-- and you too?

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.320
Judy and I share that.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.580
So I had this depressing
taste in books.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.610
And I just read, and
read, and read everything

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:24.440
that I could find about partisan
life all around that area.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.830
And it would be so perfect
to report now to all of you

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.705
that I had finished that
whole stack of books

00:27:28.705 --> 00:27:30.770
that I got from the
bookstore on Allenby Street

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:34.020
with this really sharp and
nuanced picture of Antopol.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.840
And that I finally
felt like I had

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.580
the knowledge and the
authority to write

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.332
about this faraway
place and time.

00:27:39.332 --> 00:27:41.040
And then on weekends,
I went and hung out

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.581
with this woman in
Haifa And we drink

00:27:42.581 --> 00:27:45.420
tea and bonded and swapped
stories and became friends.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.950
But the truth is is that I
never heard from her again.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:51.900
And I think that, to her,
I was the American girl who

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.210
showed up at a party,
cornered her by the sink,

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.530
and asked way too
many questions.

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.330
Which is fine, and that's true.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:01.400
But I will say that everything
had just felt so clear when I

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.350
was reading that Antopol book.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.610
Because it's so enormous.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:05.660
And it's so detailed.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.600
And it contains such
a myriad of voices,

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.800
that I had really
wanted with everything

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.832
to believe that it was
this pillar of fact.

00:28:11.832 --> 00:28:14.290
But the more books that I read
and the more research that I

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:16.245
did, the more my doubts grew.

00:28:16.245 --> 00:28:18.370
Because suddenly, putting
all these books together,

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.240
all of these inconsistencies
started to come out.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.700
So I had read a dozen books
on partisan life near Antopol

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.020
and still I had questions.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.830
In fact, I had more questions.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.690
So one person would
recount subsisting solely

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.780
on blackberries and
mushrooms in the encampment

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.390
they set up in the forest.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.810
Another person living
in the same forest

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.670
during the same chilly
autumn in brutal winter

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.540
described the weekly village
raids, pillaging bread

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.750
from peasants kitchens,
livestock from their farms,

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.330
potatoes and turnips and
onions from their gardens,

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:52.030
all cooked over a fire in their
makeshift outdoor kitchen.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.260
One writer mentioned
this plethora of weapons

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.850
that he and his partisan
brigade stole from peasants

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.260
in nearby villages.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.460
Another person again, living
in the exact same forest

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:05.210
during the exact same time,
described the one snub nose

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.180
revolver that the brigade
had to gingerly pass around

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.610
and the spent bullets that
they had to pry from the forest

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.760
floor to reuse again and again
because that was all they had.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.510
And you know I have
to say that I've never

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.600
believed that it's a
fiction writers job

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.820
to create an exact
replica of the past.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.477
I deeply, deeply
believe that it is not.

00:29:22.477 --> 00:29:24.060
I don't think that
we should be trying

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.100
to create a diorama for
a reader to step into.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.860
I think we have civil
war reenactments.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.745
I think we have
historical home tours.

00:29:30.745 --> 00:29:32.370
And it doesn't need
to happen in books.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.536
And it definitely doesn't
need to happen in fiction.

00:29:34.536 --> 00:29:36.530
But I think that it
is my responsibility

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:39.140
to learn everything about the
world that I'm writing about,

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.300
and to try really hard
to become an expert.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.770
Because I think that, in
order to truly understand

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.430
my characters and to try to make
them feel real and empathetic

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.580
to my readers, I
have to understand

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.860
the politics and the history
that influenced who they are

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.750
and influenced their decisions.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.240
And that's the only
way that I know

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.900
how to make the imagined
feel authentic, which is what

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.730
I'm trying to do as a writer.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.530
And the question is, what if
these details don't add up?

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:06.200
And what if, despite months
or years of research,

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.230
I remain uncertain as to where
the truth actually resides?

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:12.420
And how else can I glean
facts about a village

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.550
when there's no one left in that
village to answer my questions?

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.110
I've always loved
this idea that memory

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.380
isn't a precise duplicate
of the original.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.540
That it's not, instead,
it's this continuing act

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.790
of creation.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.820
And whenever I think
about memory in that way,

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.380
I envision all of
these partisans

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.550
from Belarus who
chose to relive some

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:34.030
of the darkest moments in their
lives for the sake of a book.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.560
And I can't believe that it
crossed any of their minds

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.810
that one day, more than
70 years after the war

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.710
ended and they'd left the woods,
that an American writer would

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:45.740
be comparing details from
one book against another,

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.090
neurotically worrying
whether blackberries really

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.850
grew rampant in the forest
in the autumn of 1942.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.380
I can't believe it.

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.500
But rather, I imagine that
by writing these books,

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.060
or by allowing biographers
to write about them or people

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.670
to interview them,
that they were

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.130
attempting to make sense
out of a harrowing history

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:06.730
and trying to kind of control
it and shape it through language

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.770
and through telling the story.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:10.250
And I think that
as a writer it is

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.630
important to focus
on the blackberries

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.320
and these other kind of details.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.820
But where these facts
don't jibe, no matter

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.200
how deeply I research,
no matter how many

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.520
books I read and
archives I visit,

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.110
I think my job as a
fiction writer is not

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.260
to impose order on
a host of disparate

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.860
and often contradictory
facts, but rather

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.660
to adhere to the
deeper emotional truth

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.100
of my characters.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.270
So whether they ate blackberries
or whether they ate turnips,

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.230
and whether they carry
pistols, rifles, or sticks,

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.790
they were living, hunted,
in a freezing forest

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:43.690
with no anchor to the lives
that they had once known.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.300
And what does that feel like?

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.020
And what does that
do to a person,

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.950
both there in the forest
and-- for the lucky ones--

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.360
when they trudged out, filthy,
exhausted, and bone thin?

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.220
What does that do to someone?

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.820
And I have to say that I've
come to this realization over,

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.020
and over, and over.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.160
It has hit me at some point
in every single story I've

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.290
written, all the stories
that made it into the book

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.050
at all the stories that
hopefully will never make it

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:06.550
anywhere.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.091
And it's the advice
that I would give

00:32:08.091 --> 00:32:10.010
to anyone who's writing
anything kind of based

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.890
in real life,
which is, nail down

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.830
the facts to the
best of your ability,

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.710
and then mine them for truth.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.230
And once you've done that,
you've earned the license

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:22.490
to make the rest up, and that's
why they call it fiction.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.650
So I'll just with
a flash fiction

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:27.520
piece that I wrote
that was inspired

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.930
by all of this research.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.980
And this piece ultimately
became a longer story

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:31.730
in the collection.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.060
Maybe you've heard this story.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.480
1942, and a winter so
cold my grandfather

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.970
watched hot soup
freeze in a bowl.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.000
He was living in the
forest with other teenagers

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.850
outside Antopol.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.260
Maybe you heard
about the weapons

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.580
he robbed from nearby peasants.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.520
Maybe you heard about
the sticks of dynamite

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.550
he set along
military rail routes,

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:59.300
waiting for them to
spark and explode.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.870
Maybe you heard about the bear
he chased out of the woods.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.350
When I was a kid we'd
spend summers in Tel Aviv,

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.490
squeezed into his
sweaty kitchen,

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:11.060
picking at a bowl of grapes
while my mother fixed us lunch.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.360
He had a deep tan
and a big voice,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.620
white hair parted
drastically to one side.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.950
He liked to sit around in
his undershirt and sandals

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:22.600
and tell stories, stories I half
believed, but still repeated

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.480
to my friends like
gospel of secret missions

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.980
and near escapes.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.020
And always, always at some
point, he and my father

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.420
would argue.

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.920
My mother and I could never
predict what set them off.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:37.200
It was like watching a
barometer rise from zero to 80.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.950
And suddenly, it was
as if the two of them

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:41.350
had taken up all the
oxygen in the apartment,

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.000
and my grandfather would
stomp out to the patio.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.520
And my father would say to us,
"He's always been like this.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.050
The war is over 70 years,
and still he's in it.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.980
He hate everything."

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.590
And my mother would say,
"Nahum, calmed down."

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.000
And my father would
say, "I am calm."

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.910
And then she'd give
me the look, and I'd

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.270
pack up our uneaten lunch
and take my grandfather

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.270
around the block to the park.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.930
"I worked 40 years at the
shoe store," he'd say to me.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:07.780
"I turned it into a franchise.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.520
You tell your father that's
looking forward, not back.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.770
And I don't hate everything."

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.090
He didn't walk the streets
so much as patrol them.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:17.360
"I love my apartment.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.389
I love the heat.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.620
I love you.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.580
I love this park," he
says, gesturing wildly.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.920
I watch Filipino women
push the very young

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.400
and the very old
down the path, watch

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.300
two teenagers, barefooted in
Bedouin pants, chase a Frisbee.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.989
"I love this bench," he says.

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.670
"It's our bench."

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.330
But then he starts
popping his knuckles

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.800
like he does when he's antsy,
and I know this can't go on.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.270
"But I don't love that
squirrel, he blurts.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:45.340
It's nothing but a
rat with a fancy tail.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.610
And those kids, they're
lazy at Frisbee.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:49.300
Why aren't they in school?

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.800
Give me that bag," he says.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.929
And when I do, he lays out our
lunch-- boiled eggs and pita

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:56.409
and fruit salad-- and says,
"I don't love the berries

00:34:56.409 --> 00:34:58.070
at SuperSaul, they're mush.

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.970
I ate better ones that year
in the forest, no joke.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.870
All winter it was potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.171
But come summer,
blackberries were everywhere.

00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:06.670
See?

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.440
That's me being positive.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.900
Give me a napkin.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.110
Give me a fork.

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.800
Give me that stick over there,"
he says, "It's a good one.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.910
You see this?

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:16.590
Long and so straight
that at night, they

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.400
might mistake it for a rifle.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.710
Hold it up like this, and
no one can ever hurt you."

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.250
Thanks.
