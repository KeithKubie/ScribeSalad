&gt;&gt; Sasha Zborovsky, Cleveland, OH; Ohio State
University:

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.150
You should apply for the junior fellows program
because you're going to be able to work with

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.200
not only so many pieces of unique literature
and documents but also the people you will

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.320
meet in this library are unparalleled across
the world.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.770
I have interacted with the Ethiopian librarian,
the Armenian librarian, the Hebraic librarian

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.270
learning about their stories and what career
paths they took to get them to where they

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.100
are today and why they are interested in the
things they are passionate about.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.480
&gt;&gt; Marcus Frias, Miami FL; Florida International
University:

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.180
I would encourage others to apply for the
Junior Fellowship program because it really

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.110
opens up a world like no other.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.760
A world beyond books a world beyond anything
that I've ever known before and having the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.449
opportunity to really tie all of my experience
that I have done before this together and

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.149
work towards my future has been really remarkable.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.969
&gt;&gt; Joshua Burrell, Columbia, MD, Morehouse
College:

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:07.200
It's not what you expect but as a open mind
set person you would; you would understand

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.640
that things you don't expect can be really
the things that lead your life into the direction

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.820
you did not plan for it to be, but the direction
you needed it to be in to fulfill and express

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.159
yourself and the best of your abilities.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.670
&gt;&gt; Yuri Shimoda, Los Angeles, CA; University
of California, Los Angeles:

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.781
Junior fellows program is extremely valuable
because we not only are learning about all

00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:35.220
the different avenues you can pursue in your
future.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.560
You are learning valuable life skills that
will help you no matter what field you choose

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.980
to pursue.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.390
&gt;&gt; Flynn Shannon, Amanda, OH; Kenyan College:
I would encourage other people to apply to

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.960
the Junior Fellowship Program because throughout
the entire process it really feels like you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.380
are working on your own project and people
are there to support you.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.790
And it was a really amazing new experience.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.570
&gt;&gt; Patrice Green, Roanoke, AL, University
of South Carolina:

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.280
What I want to say to encourage people to
apply is that, you know this is not out of

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.660
reach for you, and that you can do it I think
the government could use more young people

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.790
like us.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.750
&gt;&gt; Marcus Frias, Miami FL; Florida International
University:

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.890
There's a quote that I always think back to
of "You can't be what you don't see."

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.140
At the Library of Congress I've seen exactly
what I can be in my future and in the people

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.890
that work here and what I aspire to and work
toward every single day.
