00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.600
Well, in the same way that CNN
does very well in their ratings

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.033
when there's war, the Weather
Channel does really well

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:08.200
when there's extreme weather.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.266
Right.

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.033
So people love watching
extreme weather--

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:11.834
the tornadoes--

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:12.867
It's mesmerizing.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:13.734
--hurricanes.

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:14.834
Absolutely.

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:16.200
And I don't know why,
because it's deadly.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.066
But maybe we just like deadly--
like, kids here like looking

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.166
into the mouth of T-Rex.

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.266
Yeah.

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.433
And who doesn't love
black holes, right?

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:25.367
That will rip you to shreds.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.834
So-- so maybe there's
some morbid fascination

00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:29.900
we have as humans with
things that could kill us,

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.700
but we somehow keep
a safe distance from.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.266
Or fascination with scale and
power that we can't comprehend.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.066
Energy, yeah.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.266
Yeah.

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.667
The manifestation of
energy beyond our control.

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.400
Mm-hm.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.100
So-- so Rad, do
you have any insights

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.467
into people's fascination
with extreme weather?

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.333
Yeah, I think we heard a
big part of it right there.

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.934
As we're getting better in
some ways at managing risk,

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:49.266
planning for the future.

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.533
As satellites improve, I think
it's somewhat human nature

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.333
to still be in awe
of these things

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.400
that can immediately disrupt--

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.333
At a safe distance.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.667
At a safe distance.

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:01.166
Everything that-- that can
disrupt all of our best plans.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.033
And I think that clearly,
it's compelling to study

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:05.233
some of these extreme events.

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.400
Because if we can
better understand

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.633
what's going to happen,
either in terms of predicting

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:12.800
an individual storm or how
the statistics of storms

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.533
may change in the future,
then we can reduce some

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.834
of those-- some of those risks.

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:18.967
But I think there's another
piece here perhaps related

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:20.734
which is this-- I think
we should acknowledge

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:22.600
this just sort of
visceral element

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.567
by which we're fascinated
by these things.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.066
Thinking of tornado chasers.

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:29.367
You know, there's a
beauty to these extremes

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:32.000
as well that maybe we need
to connect with in some

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of our messaging, too.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.200
So our--

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.900
I think also-- also, I
think-- if I'm alone here,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.967
just let me know.

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:39.266
But we're all looking
forward to death.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.533
[laughing]

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:43.333
When should we let you know?

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.133
Now?

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.200
[laughing]

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.567
Let's have a talk afterwards.

00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:48.567
No, I think-- I think the safe
distance from something that

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:51.934
will kill you is an
intere-- who doesn't love

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:56.800
sitting behind a picture window
watching a thunderstorm unfold

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.900
Right.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.700
And maybe there's a way
we can even leverage

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.266
the idea that these
extreme events

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.900
are sort of exciting to people.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.367
As macabre as it is, is
there a way for that to get

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:08.900
some people to the table?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.867
When horrible things happen
like Hurricane Sandy,

00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:13.633
can there be a
teaching moment after?

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:17.333
Where do you sometimes have
potential to, right after.

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:19.100
When people have seen the
vulnerability, when they're

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.600
making decisions about whether
to rebuild, how to-- how

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600
to use that information.
