&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon, ladies and gentleman,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.180
and welcome to the African
Middle/East Reading Room.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.520
I'm glad you're here.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.000
This is the before last program
that we're going to be hosting

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.130
in this wonderful reading room.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.630
We are moving to the Northeast
Pavilion, which is behind me,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.670
over there, another very
beautiful reading room,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.190
in January and in the meantime,
we have to move out from here.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.260
So unfortunately, we will not
be hosting any more programs

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.690
for the next three months.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.660
So you are here in a
way celebrating the last

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.650
of what has been a very,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.220
very exciting time
in this reading room.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.660
So we're all sad that we're
leaving but on the other hand,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.600
it's only temporarily stopping.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.630
We will resume our
exciting programs in January

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.350
and we would invite you
then in a new environment

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.910
but a very lovely one as well.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.100
So I want to thank those
who have been coming

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:38.480
to these programs who have
been attending our series.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.790
I want to thank my own staff who
have been absolutely diligent

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.810
until the last minute bringing
wonderful writers, thinkers,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.350
authors, scholars to this
reading room to share with us

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.040
and with the public
outside around the nation,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.810
around the world, the
scholarship and the thinking

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.100
that has come through
their work, that has come

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.240
through these collections
that they have used.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.800
So it's only an au revoir.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.950
It's not a goodbye but
it's just a short stop

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.910
until we resume again
in January.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.350
So today we are very
fortunate to have

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:43.040
with us Mr. Dawit Gebremichael
Habte who is going to be talking

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.360
about his own book, his
own story, his own past

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.560
and hopefully project into
the future a returning scholar

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.530
to our reading room.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.390
We have not had many
programs on Eritrea

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.940
and so it's very exciting to
have one today and to share

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.700
with our patrons, with our
members here at the Library

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.180
and with the rest of the world
a story which is very exciting,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.870
very moving and a story that
is shared by most people

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.570
around the country since
we're all at one time

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.320
or another immigrants.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:39.470
So to introduce the author, we
have our own Fentahun Tiruneh

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.670
who has been forever
our Ethiopian

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.330
and Eritrean specialist here
at the Library of Congress

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.120
and who has done a fantastic
job building the collections.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.780
So with no further ado, Fentahun
will introduce our speaker.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.080
Thank you.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.660
&gt;&gt; Fentahun Tiruneh:
Thank you, Mary Jane.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.930
Ladies and gentleman, I
welcome you to today's program.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.480
My name is Fentahun Tiruneh
and I'm the area specialist

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.270
for the Ethiopian and
Eritrean collections.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.350
Today I present to
you a professional man

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.200
with unique story of
his immigrant life.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.860
Raised in a tiny village
just south of Asmara,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.250
the capital of Eritrea, Dawit
Gebremichael Habte fled to Kenya

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.240
as a teenager and sought
asylum in the United States.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.480
Dawit is now a father,
husband, software engineer,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.080
and author of "Gratitude
in Low Voices: A Memoir."

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.970
This story is a record
of a saga of a young man

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.490
who faced several
turbulent events

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.160
in his immigrant life outside
of his family and country.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.180
This story is told by
a very successful man

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.780
who withstood the
vagaries of immigrant life

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.160
in different countries
and who finally made it

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.730
to the United States
to build a family life.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.210
His story encapsulates
the story of many of us

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.220
from the same region but the
difference is Dawit took his

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.470
time and successfully published
his adventures into a book.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.290
Instead of trying to
detail his life story,

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.000
I'll let Dawit narrate
the rest of his adventure,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.270
country by country
and event by event.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.460
Dawit is featured in the
United States "USA Today,

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.570
New York Times, Associated
Press,

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.540
and Johns Hopkins
Gazette' and has written

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.390
for various Eritrean
websites and publications.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.870
He lives in Maryland with
his wife and five children

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.860
and works for Bloomberg BNA.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.740
Before I call on our
guest to the forum,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.310
I'd like to make a
couple of announcements.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.540
This event is being videotaped
for subsequent broadcast

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.940
on the Library's
webcast and other media.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.400
There will be a formal
question and answer period

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.690
after the lecture in which
the audience is encouraged

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.450
to ask questions
and offer comments.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.540
But please be advised that your
voice and image may be recorded

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.910
and later broadcast
as part of the event.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.850
By participating in the
question and answer period,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.960
you are consenting to the
Library's possible reproduction

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.750
and transmission
of your remarks.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.520
An additional announcement is

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.940
that this forum does
not entertain questions

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.520
of political nature.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.930
Thank you for your
understanding.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.510
Now help me to welcome
Dawit Gebremichael Habte.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.200
[ Applause ]

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.390
&gt;&gt; Dawit Gebremichael Habte:

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.220
I think I would be fairly
certain the majority

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.780
of you would love to go back to
where everybody knows your name

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.960
and actually they
are glad you came.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.020
Cheers was one of my favorite
sitcoms when I first came

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:35.800
to the United States during my
high school years and the place

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:42.800
where not only everybody
knew my name

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.150
but I also knew everybody's
name is called Gejeret,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.970
a small neighborhood in the
city of Eritrea in the city

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.240
of Asmara, the capital
city of Asmara.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.920
That is an amazing place

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:05.250
where we all knew each
other's cousins, uncles,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.710
and distant relatives and
we took care of each other.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:17.120
So "Gratitude in Low
Voices" is a human story.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:24.440
It's a universal human
story in that it's a journey

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:31.590
from my birthplace in
Gejeret, in Asmara to a place

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.880
where I knew and where
everything was familiar

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:42.830
to unknown destinations, unknown
places, unfamiliar destinations.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:55.640
It's also a story of those that
I encountered along the way,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:02.250
so many angels without
wings, individuals who came

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.480
to my rescue and to my
family's rescue in the form

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.110
of human beings

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:15.400
but nevertheless,
angels without wings.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:24.030
When I narrate my story,
my story does not start

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:31.080
from the date that I was born
because the circumstances,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.240
the situations that forced me

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.060
to leave home also
forced my parents,

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.260
my father to leave home.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.910
They also put my
grandparents in situations

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:53.470
that are not normal,
to say the least.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.670
So I'm forced to
go back generations

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:02.400
and you can imagine it doesn't
stop with my great parents.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.070
It actually has to go back
and tell the story of Eritrea

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.680
and the people of Eritrea.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:16.500
The human cost of history,
the human cost of war needs

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.860
to be told with the
right context

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.390
and with the right
perspective because at the end

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.790
of the day, context matters.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.280
Angels without wings.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.910
You see the gentleman, the
young man in the picture?

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:42.400
He is my childhood
friend, my best friend

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:54.330
and that's what makes sitting
here an amazing opportunity is I

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:59.120
could have, my fate and
some of my friends' fate

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.210
who are sitting here could have
been the same as that young man.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:10.050
He perished in a war, in a war
that should not have existed,

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:15.090
that should not have happened.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.800
But his story needs to be told
with the right perspective

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.080
and the story of my
grandparents, you see them,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:30.260
the story of my aunt who
allowed us to live in her house

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.850
and grow, have a
normal childhood

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.800
in the middle of war zone.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.630
The story of my aunt who
has no kids who actually has

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:50.080
to help my mom because my mother
has to spend half of the week

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:57.970
in the village to attend to,
look after the farm and work

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.600
and then come during
the weekends

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.380
to take care of her kids.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:07.560
That's story has to be told
with the right perspective.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.580
The story of my father has to
be told living in Saudi Arabia,

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:18.860
where he has to acquire
an Islamic name in order

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:23.310
to raise his kids to work
18 hours as a truck driver.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:28.000
That story needs to be told
with the right perspective.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.310
All is not gloomy.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.100
It's not doom and gloom.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.560
The story of Dr.
Tekie Fessehatzion,

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.240
a professor that I met
in Baltimore who ended

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.810
up becoming the father
that I never had.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.950
His story needs to be told.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:49.470
The story of my counselor
Beatrice Newell, a German,

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:57.230
who has nothing in common with
me and I had nothing in common

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.150
with her, but she took out of --

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.440
She went out of her way to
make sure this young immigrant

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.340
who barely spoke
English to end up going

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:14.920
to Johns Hopkins University,
after barely attending two years

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.930
of high school in
Silver Spring, Maryland.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.780
Her story needs to be told,
with the right perspective

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.510
and with the right context.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:30.000
The story of Mike Bloomberg, the
three-term mayor of New York,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.720
who gave his young immigrant
an opportunity to go back

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.010
to his country to
contribute to be part

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:49.270
of a demobilization process of
reintegrating his country folks,

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:53.130
his countrymen his age.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:58.630
This young man was probably age
20 to 23 who funded my project.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.870
His story needs to be told,
who also funded the publication

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.720
of this book by preordering
10,000 copies.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.110
His story needs to be told.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:17.500
The story of Rose
Varner-Gaskins, David Rysak,

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:22.050
their story needs to be told
because that is American story.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:27.000
That's not really
broadcasted in the mainstream.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.090
Their story needs to be told
because it's a human story.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:36.110
The commonalities that I found
between me and the individuals

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.010
that I encountered
are just we happened

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.650
to be decent human beings.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:45.100
We decided to see what
is best in each other.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.190
So that's why I referred
them in my book,

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:53.630
"Gratitude in Low Voices"
as "angels without wings."

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.550
And Robin Farrell Edmunds
of "Forward Review,"

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.210
he actually got it right.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.510
This is what he wrote.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:05.870
"This book is a reaffirmation
of the good that people can do

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.970
and how one young man succeeded
despite the odds against him."

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.130
The focus is on the people
because that gentleman has

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:20.390
to do whatever he did for
his own good but those angels

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:27.330
without wings actually did
it for no other reason except

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.770
because they see a delight in
seeing somebody else succeed,

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:39.160
somebody else being
happy, to say the least.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.790
The African-American author,

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:47.440
writer and critic James
Baldwin had this to say.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.520
"People are trapped in history
and history is trapped in them."

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:59.270
At the beginning, I said
my story does not start

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.270
with my birthday.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.610
My journey might have started
from the place that I was born

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.050
but my story does not start
from the day that I was born.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.080
In 1915, John Foster Dulles,

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.710
one of the highly
renowned US ambassadors,

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.370
had this to say in New York.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.810
"From the point of view
of justice, the opinions

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.540
of the Eritrean people
must receive consideration.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.270
Nevertheless, the strategic
interest of the United States

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.520
in the Red Sea basin and the
considerations of security

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.040
and world peace make it
necessary that the country has

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:42.330
to be linked with
our ally Ethiopia."

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:47.120
Twelve years later, Eritrea was
forcefully annexed by Ethiopia .

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.420
Guess what?

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.330
Five more years later,
half a million

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.420
of Eritreans became
refuges in Sudan.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.980
That, by the way, is a
third of the population.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.800
So when we talk about history,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.550
we completely forget the
human cost of history.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.400
We talk about war.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.280
We talk about casualties.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.350
We talk about collateral damage.

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:22.850
We dehumanize the human because
that's much easier for us

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:27.210
to read and have
our [inaudible].

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:32.800
And my objective, one of
my objectives in "Gratitude

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:38.050
in Low Voices" is to
awaken our consciousness.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.490
History does eat people,
especially Eritrean history.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:57.960
When 53 countries in Africa
were granted their independence

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.240
in the 1960s, Eritrea
was the only one,

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.710
Eritreans were the only ones

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.800
that were not granted
that opportunity.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.100
And guess what?

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.600
That's supposed to
be in considerations

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.280
for security and world peace.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.580
Isn't that oxymoron?

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:32.120
We will secure peace by putting
the lives of others in danger.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.000
And to someone, this
might be a correlation

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.400
but this is more
than correlation.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.700
This is a causation.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.320
This is a cause and effect
because Eritreans were not given

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.250
that right to determine
their fate.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:52.670
They have become refugees
and they are stranded all

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.830
over the world till this day.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:02.200
So that's why when I said my
story does not from the date

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.240
of my birth because
the circumstances

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:14.290
that defined my fate
go much deeper.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:29.210
So I spent ten years to write
a memoire and I spend most

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.390
of the time, maybe
seven to eight years,

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:34.990
doing research on Eritrea.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:39.300
The African proverb goes, "Until
the story of the hunt is told

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.800
by the lion, the tale

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.960
of the hunt will always
glorify the hunter."

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.880
Case in point.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.150
The story of Eritreans, you
don't find it in many places

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.490
because it was intentionally
avoided

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:58.770
because the other
side was glorified.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:04.950
And again, I'm extremely
grateful to Mr. Mike Bloomberg

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.540
for his endorsement
when he wrote

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.650
"A candid inspiring
memoire of cultural

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.040
and historical importance."

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.860
We have to be candid even
when it comes to history.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.340
We have to reconcile with
our own history, the bad,

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.640
the good and the ugly.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:30.900
And I have tried in
"Gratitude in Low Voices"

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.680
to present an accurate

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.630
and properly referenced
historical material.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.510
One thing that you'll find
in "Gratitude in Low Voices"

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:49.110
that you don't find in any other
memoire is this book has more

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:54.890
than 46 actual documented
references

00:20:54.890 --> 00:21:04.290
because when historical
events is presented,

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.350
especially in a type of
memoire, our references have

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.790
to be properly documented.

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.230
So I have gone out of my way.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.750
I spent more than two years

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.780
to make sure my claims
are properly documented.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.680
Well, to summarize, "Gratitude

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.530
in Low Voices" is
an Eritrean story.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.390
It is the story of Eritrea
and the people of Eritrea.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:40.110
As one of the reviewers in
Eritrea accurately described,

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.660
she said, "Gratitude

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:48.140
in Low Voices" is a
memoire of a society."

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.970
"Gratitude in Low Voices"
is an American story.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:04.790
I can't say much about other
places that I have never been

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:10.430
but what I witnessed
in the society

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:15.450
in this country is Americans
are as decent as you could get,

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:20.210
at a human level, at
the personal level

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.310
and that story needs to be told.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.500
That's why I believe this
book an American story.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.500
At the end of the day,
though, most of all,

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.310
"Gratitude in Low Voices"
is a universal human story.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.110
Thank you so much.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:41.800
[ Applause ]

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:49.930
&gt;&gt; Fentahun Tiruneh: Do you
have any comments or questions?

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.230
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.460
for giving us the
[inaudible] of your book.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.410
And I know that we're all
excited to read the book itself.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.550
But I have a question.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:06.890
In terms of structure, of
organization, how did you,

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.340
how did you organize
your source?

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.810
Was it in phases?

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.690
Was it chronologically?

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:19.580
Was it in different
experiences at different times?

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.250
How did you organize
your material?

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.960
&gt;&gt; Dawit Gebremichael Habte:
The advantage I have is

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.810
that by training,
I'm a biophysicist.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.370
I have a biophysics degree.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.920
So I was trained
how to do research.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.450
By profession, I'm
a software engineer.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.170
So I'm trained how
to think in blocks

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:42.400
because it has been [inaudible]
and for better or worse,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.290
by necessity I became a writer

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.390
because that story
needs to be told.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:51.370
So the organization
is chronological

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.120
but the challenge you
find with chronological,

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.870
with telling a story
chronologically is

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.460
and you are trying to provide
a context, you have to know

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.880
where to put that context

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.590
because if the historical
reference becomes a bit too far,

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.900
then you might lose
your audience.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.440
So you have to try to bring
it as much as possible.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:18.080
And no matter how tempting it
is to try to bring information

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.260
to the book, you have to find
a way to tie it to your story.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.380
So it was extremely,
extremely challenging

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.390
and I'm extremely
grateful for the editors

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.150
of the [inaudible] books in
that we spent close to a year

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:44.460
and a half trying to get
that organization right.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.750
Give you case in point.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:51.760
It's easier to start
with the date of my birth

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.750
but fortunately it's
my great grandmother

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.050
who gave me the name.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:59.220
So to me, that's a
good link to go back

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.250
in terms of family history.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:07.600
And then I come to the late
'80s, '89, that's when I had

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.410
to leave Eritrea because I was
drafted into the Ethiopian army.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.470
So that is also the perfect
place to bring the close

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.680
of the war and to
try to give context.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:23.610
So it was extremely challenging

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:27.600
but eventually it
becomes gratifying

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.230
because the proper
contexts were able

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.820
to put it in the right place.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:39.800
But the simple answer is it's
a chronological starting --

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.820
Actually the title of the first
chapter is "What is in a Name"

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.180
because there was a
great deal of squabble

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.490
when my great grandmother
was giving me my name.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.420
Now that gives me an
opportunity because in Eritrea,

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.460
you cannot give a name, same
name as your family member

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.950
who is still alive because I had
a cousin who's name is Dawit.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.690
So that gives me
an opportunity now

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:06.640
to explore the cultural
aspect of the society.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.940
Yes, sir?

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.960
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if
[inaudible] whether you wrote it

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:19.770
in your Native language and how
you arranged for translation.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:26.670
Also if you could
maybe talk a little bit

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:27.970
about how you [inaudible].

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.270
&gt;&gt; Dawit Gebremichael
Habte: Got it.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.820
If I understand you correctly,
one is how did I write it

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.500
in my native language
and get it translated.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.360
&gt;&gt; Right. Or did you write
part of it in English?

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.890
&gt;&gt; Dawit Gebremichael Habte: Or
did I write it part in English

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.400
and part in my native language?

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.700
The second part is how did I --

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.170
What is the process
that I followed

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.260
for publishing the book.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.210
For the first one, I
actually wrote the book

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.180
from the beginning
to end in English.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.440
English is my kids' language.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.040
The first language I spoke
is my mother tongue Tigrinya.

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.120
In school, we were
forced to learn Amharic.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.350
So we're taught using Amharic.

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:11.710
Once I arrived in Kenya,

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.820
survival forced me
to learn Kiswahili.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.070
And then came to the US.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:26.010
So the option was either Spanish
or English and I chose English.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:31.700
So I will explain
part of the process.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.610
For Bloomberg, my responsibility
is to manage the dev-ops,

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:37.280
developmental operations team.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.960
And one of the principles
of dev-ops is fail fast.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:47.610
And I failed actually
badly at the beginning

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.590
when I had my first book
draft ready in 2005.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.130
I sent it to publishers in 2006.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.950
I was rejected by
more than 26 of them.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.550
And one of them gave
me good advice.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.220
He called me to his office.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.250
He said he doesn't remember it
because he's is the president

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.840
of the company that
published the book.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:14.720
So the idea he gave me was that
I should go write an article

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.950
to one of the New
York publications

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.980
and then an editor
might pick it up

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.640
and then they might interview me

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:29.220
so that they could
ghostwrite the book for me.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.290
It's a fair -- I took
it as fair feedback

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.920
because he's the only one
who actually took his time

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.280
to give me that feedback.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.490
And the message I received I
took from that conversation was

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.950
that I have a good story
but my writing sucked.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:47.980
No way around it.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:54.030
So Professor Tekie Fessehatzion,
who was the chairman

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:58.410
of the economics department
at Morgan, I relayed to him,

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:03.860
I told him the feedback that
I received and he suggested

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.740
that I read about 15 books.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:12.580
So went back, started reading,
and started writing online.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:20.950
And one of the best books that
I read that seriously helped me

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:29.500
with this book is titled the
"Kaffir Boy," by Mark Mathabane,

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.060
if I am not mistaken,
South African.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.560
He has done an amazing job in
terms of capturing the life

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.380
of apartheid and how he
survived as a young man

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.580
and then how he came
to the United States.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:50.310
So I kept reading, writing,
reading, and writing.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:55.870
Finally, a miracle happened.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:30:05.030
A lot of people -- Well, I moved
to New Jersey, I mean to --

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.760
I'm kind of in tears
because it's a miracle

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.500
that I can't say any, I can't
describe it in any other way.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:18.850
I moved to Virginia and I got
hired by a company called BNA

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:23.450
for three-month contract.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:28.550
Well, six years later --
Actually five years later,

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:29.930
Mike Bloomberg bought
the company.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:34.310
I had quit his company, moved
here, and he bought the company.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.950
And the new vice-president came.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.440
I was talking to him
and I told him, listen,

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.050
I have a great relationship
with the Bloomberg company.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:43.830
Mike has done this for me.

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.700
I've also drafted a book.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.260
So here it is.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:52.390
I gave him the draft.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:56.870
The story that I heard
after that is I think

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:00.960
about four months later this guy
was flying back from New York.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.570
He sent me an email saying,
Dawit, I need to talk to you.

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.700
I have some interesting
to talk to you.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.880
And I said, okay.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.180
I wanted until four.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.480
He didn't come.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.780
It was late.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.080
So the next day I
walked to his desk

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.600
and I said, what's going on.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.100
And his name is Joe Breda.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.740
He's now the president
of B. Law, Bloomberg Law.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.840
He grabs me -- We
went to his office

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:26.000
and he said Mike Bloomberg
was talking about you.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.200
I said I haven't talked to this
guy for more than seven years.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:36.420
How did he end up
talking about me.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.060
Joe Breda said that he was
presenting to Mike Bloomberg

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:45.480
and his senior management team

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.660
and apparently Joe
Breda forget a datapoint

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.190
that he couldn't remember.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:55.250
So Mike was trying to make
him feel at ease and he said,

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.660
listen, I remember
everything from my childhood.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.310
How can you, you know, he was
trying to make him feel at ease

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:05.790
and in the middle he said,
except I forgot this guy's name.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.090
There was one guy.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:08.390
We gave him money.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:12.520
He went to Eritrea but
couldn't remember his name.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.270
And Joe Breda told him, I
know who you're talking about.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.570
He's like, no, you don't.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:17.870
How can you know, you
just joined the company?

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:19.170
He said his name is Dawit Habte.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.470
He said, yes.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:21.770
Where is he?

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:25.110
He's like, he's working for you
through BNA and he has written,

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:31.730
he has drafted a book you
may be interested in reading.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:35.950
And Breda told me he was
going to send my name to Mike.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.010
I said don't do it.

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:43.530
I will send him a thank
you note and I said, Mike,

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.790
thank you so much for
remembering because we all live

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.550
in each other's memory.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:54.270
And that is the most
precious place we all have.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:58.270
And if this guy could put my
name somehow in his [inaudible]

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.240
by not remembering
it, and he said,

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:02.150
well I'll stop by
when I come to DC.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.170
Stop by when you
come to New York.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:05.810
Listen, you are paying
for my flight.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.110
You are paying for the hotel.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.220
So I might as well
go and say hi.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:15.980
And that is how -- So I can
only take credit for writing it.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.560
The rest is so much
positive coincidence

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.820
that is completely
outside of my control.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.320
And as you probably would
realize reading the book,

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:31.330
most of my life is outside
of my control, a lot of --

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:35.350
The only thing that I might
have done right is I hold

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.750
on to people.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.050
I hold on to friendship.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:41.120
I don't let it go.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.510
Yes, sir?

[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:10.380
Yes. I think if I understand you
correctly you are asking me have

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:16.910
I taken into account the
publications and books written

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:21.020
by Eritreans who are
professional historians.

the history of [inaudible]?

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.850
&gt;&gt; Dawit Gebremichael
Habte: There is no dispute

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:32.450
when it comes to the
history of Eritrea.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:37.350
In fact, I intentionally avoided
mentioning them in my book

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.260
and I'll tell you why.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.690
Because I am Eritrean.

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:45.330
I am presenting the Eritrean
view and I have a responsibility

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:48.740
to show publications and
historical references

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.880
that are written
by non-Eritreans.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.040
What is that?

No, no. I'm agreeing with you.

I'm not arguing with you.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.730
I'm not arguing any of them.

[ Inaudible Audience Comment ]

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:13.060
Okay. Okay, let me
try to elaborate

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.050
and then you can correct me.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:22.970
The side of history that I have
presented is the human cost,

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.270
the human cost.

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:28.830
What I'm saying is
Eritreans have paid day in,

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:34.380
day out for decisions that are
made without their consultation.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.340
And this goes back, it
doesn't start in 1950s.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.640
I just gave a reference.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.380
It goes back to the Italians.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.290
It goes back to the
building of Suez Canal.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.280
Once Suez Canal was built,

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.460
the Pandora's box
opened in that area.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.460
Eritrea literally became
a pawn in the chess game

00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:00.160
between the East and the
West and people suffered.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.660
Their survival was
a simple mechanism

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.060
of taking care of each other.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:12.710
That is the whole point I've
tried to make in this book.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.010
Fair enough?

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:19.450

to others.

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:21.340

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.510
Yes?

[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:49.770
Yes. Helen is asking me I have
spoken about what the book is.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:56.300
Can I also elaborate or speak
about what the book is not.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:06.600
The book is not your typical
memoire in that majority

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.420
of the memoires that are
written for self-promotion.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.720
I have done this.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.740
They become a resume of the
individual who is trying

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.560
to accomplish something.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.170
My accomplishment is simply
to tell the human history

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:24.730
of Eritrea and also the humanity

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.740
that I encountered
throughout the short life

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.800
that I have lived so far.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.890
So it is not self-aggrandizing.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.960
That's why it's called
"Gratitude in Low Voices."

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:44.450
It's not self-promotion and I
may take credit for doing C,

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:48.500
but A, B and D are
done by someone else.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.280
Most of it completely
outside of my control.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:58.110
So it's not -- And it's
not an autobiography.

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.320
The gentleman, he
mentioned a few books.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.670
All those books that
he mentioned are

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.970
actually autobiographies.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:04.500
They are not memoires.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.360
Memoire has a timeframe.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:13.690
It describes an event, a time
and it's not from the beginning

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:17.530
of life to end of life of
somebody's accomplishments.

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:20.440
What it is not?

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.150
Yes, it is an inspiration
because I wrote it

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.600
because I needed inspiration.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:33.310
So you might read about my
experience in the refugee camp

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:39.450
and some nights walking through
the forest of southern part

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:44.160
of Ethiopia which I have never
been before that but it's not

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.960
for you to feel --
It doesn't portray

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.510
for someone to feel
sorry for me.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:54.330
It basically gives a perspective
and actually it's presented

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:58.070
in such a way that might
have made me who I am.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.560

Do you have some kind of diary?

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.830
I did take notes.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.210
The day that I left
home for some reason --

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:04.330
We have this calendar it's
called [foreign word].

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:07.140
It's a small calendar.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.500
I left home with that calendar.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:16.540
So starting from the 5:00 a.m.
we went to the airport to fly

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.060
to [inaudible] and we didn't
catch the morning flight.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:22.480
So we had to take the
evening, the 6:00 pm flight.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:27.130
Starting from that, going
through the southern part

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:31.200
of Ethiopia, the
forest and Kenya,

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.410
through all that life I
was actually taking notes.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:41.490
That [foreign word] I still have
it and amazingly the benefit

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:44.600
of that [foreign word]
was it completely took me

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.310
out of my physical presence.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:54.530
Every time I went from my --
There were about seven of us.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:58.030
I went from the group
and started writing.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:00.450
I was going away from the --

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:09.990
I basically I was transforming
mentally to a different place.

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:16.280
So that made all the
suffering nonexistent.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:23.690
And one of our colleagues
actually did tell me that,

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:26.960
Dawit, why you even bother
to write this nonsense?

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.150
Aren't we're going
to die anyway?

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:30.900
Why bother?

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.870
And my answer was
simply so what.

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:37.400
I will be dying writing.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.640
So what's the point.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.870
In terms of remembering
my childhood,

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.850
especially my childhood
activities

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:55.030
and the treasure is I'm
extremely fortunate.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.560
I have people like
Daniel sitting right here.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:03.660
We got lost when we were
six or seven years old

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.160
in the city of Asmara.

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.570
So I have many of them and we
meet every day, every weekend,

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.860
every month, every Saturday we
have a get together for Gejeret

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:16.160
and what I did was after I wrote
it, I doubled checked with them

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:20.510
and they gave me feedback
where yes, this is accurate.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:22.130
You may have missed this.

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:28.640
That number you are wrong
because they give me names.

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.290
So I was able to
get that information

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:35.560
from my childhood friends.

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:41.480
For the other personal stories
of the people, I actually went

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.970
and interviewed all of them.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:57.980
Mebrahtu Negusse, [inaudible]
who was my angel who came

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.820
from heaven to actually,
until six years old,

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:04.940
until six grader -- Until I was
in sixth grade, I didn't know

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.400
to use dictionary and
until I met that guy,

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.530
his children showed me how
to use dictionary and how

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.880
to even they even showed
me what a library was.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.690
For him, I knew he
came to Boston.

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:18.640
So I went, I drove there.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.800
We spent three days
and nights interviewing

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.220
and then getting all
the facts that I needed.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.610
And after I wrote it,
I sent it back to him

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:28.960
when we back to Eritrea.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.530
He reviewed so I did go back --
I did interview a lot of people

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:39.300
because again, this is personal
story and it has to be accurate

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.050
and it has to have
proper context.

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:46.510
&gt;&gt; Maybe one more.

00:45:46.510 --> 00:46:13.950

&gt;&gt; Dawit Gebremichael
Habte: Yes.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:20.650
You are asking me to give
some context to the title

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:26.950
and also describe to you why
"Gratitude in Low Voices."

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like the title.

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:31.860
I like the title of the book.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:39.250
I'm not sure what
you meant by it.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:40.550
&gt;&gt; Dawit Gebremichael
Habte: Yes.

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:41.900
Okay. It actually
came from the book

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:47.560
and I am trying --
Yes, on page 36.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:56.600
Usually when I came home from
school with my test results,

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:01.950
mom would say, "Son, how
did you do this time?"

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:07.510
From her tone, I could easily
tell that she was concerned.

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:11.660
Mom would start searching
from sticks marked with x

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:14.960
in red pen on my exam papers.

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:21.790
At times she would count two or
three x marks out of 20 or 30.

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.950
Once she finished
counting the x marks,

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:31.110
she would straighten her head
and say, "Son, what happened?

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:33.940
Were you sleeping in class?"

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:37.490
No, [foreign word],"
I would respond.

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:39.010
[foreign word] is my mom.

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.410
"Look, I got seven correct,"

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:45.350
I would protest while
selectively placing my finger

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:48.180
on the questions I
answered correctly.

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:52.190
"Of course," mom would say,

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:55.030
"why else would you
go to school then?

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:57.340
I don't think you
understand my question.

00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.580
I'm asking you if
you were asleep

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.320
in class half of the time.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.220
Otherwise, how could
you miss this many?

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:09.870
But [foreign word], the others
got a lot more wrong than me.

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:13.760
This is a good grade,"
I would protest.

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:19.240
"Those are not kids,
son," my mom would say.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:23.100
Our exchange would continue
with my mom pulling me close

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.020
to her for a warm hug.

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:32.300
This time though, this is when
I brought an award from school.

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:35.910
I was first from my first
grade so I brought an award.

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:37.210
So this is the time.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:45.110
"This time though mom's tone was
more of excitement and elation.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:50.110
Grace be upon all you saints
for delivering my prayers

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.490
to our father in heaven.

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:56.400
Thank you, Saint Mary, for
watching over my family.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.490
Thank you, [inaudible],
for this day.

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:04.680
The gratitude of my mother would
continue in low voices for me

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:10.920
to hear until tears starting
wailing up in my mom's eyes.

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:15.180
Mom then looked at me with
a big smile somewhat trying

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.320
to hide her emotions.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:23.930
Mom's low voice and her broad
smile were the most powerful

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:27.860
expressions of love and
compassion no amount

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:30.600
of words could express.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:37.820
That's where the gratitude
in low voices came from.

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.510
Thank you so much.
