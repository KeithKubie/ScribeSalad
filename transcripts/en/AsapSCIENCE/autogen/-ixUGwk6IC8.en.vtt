00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.200
 Politicians blame video games for some of the violence in the world, 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.320
 Since the top five games currently deployed are sniper and shooting games, 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.700
 Will the game become reality and aggression on the ground? 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.100
 Do video games make you aggressive? 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.260
 One of the most critical criticisms against video games is that it motivates the child to be aggressive, 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.540
 In this type of unconscious stimulation, the stimulus affects the reaction of another stimulus, 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.980
 For example, when I say "yellow", the words that remember the fruit name, 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.940
 It is likely to say "bananas." 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.520
 This led scientists to conduct a study, 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.500
 Where participants chose a game from one of two games, 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.660
 The first game is driving and avoiding collision, 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.100
 While the second game is a mouse escaping from a cat, 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.200
 After the end of the game, based on the concept of stimulation, 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.220
 Scientists assumed that players would be able to classify game-related forms 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.880
 And quickly on the ground. 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.280
 So the players looked at different images such as: bus image and dog image, 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.580
 They were asked to classify them as "vehicles" or "animals" 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.420
 Those who played the "car" game were slower in choosing the "vehicle" category, 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.200
 Those who played the game "cat" were slower in choosing the "animal" category, 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.680
 In fact, those who played both games had a slower reaction, 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.680
 This explains the occurrence of negative stimulation, 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.720
 It is science and its strange interpretations, 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Unlike the old (8-bit) games, 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.200
 The designers of the games are now able to produce wonderful designs, 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.960
 So another criticism, 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.680
 That the more realistic the game, the more the concept of aggressive behavior 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.980
 To study this concept, 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.120
 Players have chosen one game of combat (Kombat), 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.740
 The characters are simulated in the first game through procedural stirring (Rachdol Fezix) 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.200
 The movements of the skeleton of man, 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.520
 This means a realistic simulation of death. 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.900
 In the other game, the scenes were not real to die, 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.020
 This was followed by the measurement of aggressive behavior by testing the "word-linking" 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.160
 In the real game of death, there is no rise in aggressive behavior. 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.720
 Often in current research, there is no connection between video games and aggression 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.560
 One of the broad analytical studies has shown the positive side between games and aggression, 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.820
 Criticizing the ineffective laboratory aggressive tests, 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.680
 Tests such as: measuring brain waves or heart beat, 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.000
 Which do not necessarily prove a real aggressive behavior. 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.480
 In the past, where there is a relationship, it is negligible 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.100
 Criminals who study mass murder claim that the relationship between games and violence is a myth 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.300
 In fact, in 2011, the Supreme Court ruled America 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.740
 That there is no evidence of a relationship between violent games and aggressive behavior 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.120
 Unfortunately, we all know what happens after a crime, 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.180
 Violent video games are charged and criticized, 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.480
 In fact, this distracts attention from the main causes of violence. 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.400
