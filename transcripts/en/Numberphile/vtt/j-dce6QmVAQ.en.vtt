00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.160
Okay, let's talk today about the Kakeya needle problem.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.189
Let's say that we're in the plane, and we have an arena in the plane.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.029
Someone hands us a pole of size one meter.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.160
That's the needle, we'll make it a pole. Our job is to move the pole around in the plane,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.250
not necessarily

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.199
just simply turning it, but maybe sliding it and turning it and doing tricky things, but always keeping it inside the arena

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.679
so that at the end of whatever we do, the pole has turned by a full

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.280
360 degrees. And the question is, how small can we make the arena?

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.100
Brady: "The first thing I thought was that the minimum size would be a circle with a diameter of one."

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.360
Yes?

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.420
Brady: "I'm wrong."

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.280
You're wrong. Kakeya had a guess, and that works, and that beats a circle.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.869
I would like to show you how you can make a very strangely shaped arena with,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.099
with an area of, let's say, less than one one billionth of a square meter.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.689
inside which the one meter pole can be turned through a full 360 degrees.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.220
That's the Kakeya problem. Imagine that I'm given an arena,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.669
and I'm given a pole, and the pole has a face at one tip.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.429
No matter which direction you pick out, I can somehow place the one meter pole

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.309
inside the arena so that the face is facing in the direction that you provided for me.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.239
Okay. Now we'll see that that is not the same thing as the full Kakeya problem,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.549
because maybe as the direction

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.990
varies smoothly,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.229
maybe the pole would have to jump around.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.180
Okay. So we will not worry about that at first, and our, our arena will have the defect that the pole will in fact have

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.839
to jump around. In this version of the problem the pole is just supposed to be a line, a line segment, with zero thickness.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.639
So, in the first version, let's take a very thin slice of

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.639
of pie, so here is, here is a circle, and here is, here's a slice of pie,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.390
whatever, a sector. Let's say that this angle is

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.279
theta, let's say this radius is five. The area of the sector is

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.230
proportional to theta. So, the exact constant doesn't matter. Let me pretend that the area is, let's say, a thousand

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.930
times theta. I didn't tell you in which units I measured theta, is it degrees or radians or whatever.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.999
The exact value of this constant doesn't matter at all. I'm going to say it's a thousand. The other thing

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.309
I'm going to do is to scale the problem up.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.440
Let's say the pole is one meter, and then I think of this as a map of the real thing, and there's a scale, and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.540
the scale is a billion to one, or let's say N to 1 where N is enormous. On the map

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.380
I can turn a pole of one meter size. In the real world, I could turn a pole of N meters size.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.740
Whatever the area is of

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.969
the region on the map, the area in the real world will be

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.339
N squared times as big, because it's N times bigger this way and N times bigger that way.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.420
So if I don't do anything very clever, if I take a circle

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.249
or if I take Professor Kakeya's idea, if I think of that as a map

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.809
and I scale it up by a factor of N, for some very large N,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.079
what I should expect to see is to be able to turn

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.869
an enormous pole of size N inside a region of area N squared.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.399
But what I'm going to show you is a way to turn a pole of,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.610
of length N

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.640
inside a region of area N,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.940
rather than N squared, that's much smaller.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.980
It's smaller by a factor of N, and so whatever I have done in, in the enormous real world,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.700
I will scale it back to the scale of the map, and then I will be turning a pole of size one

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.000
inside plane figure, a very weird one, of area one over N. And since N

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.300
is as big as I please, the area of that weird arena will be as small as I please. So I'm turning an N

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.230
long pole inside something whose area is going to be proportional to N. And if I can do that I will win.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.450
This is all based on a

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.030
simple simple construction.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.130
Let's say this is a triangle. Let's say it has a horizontal base, so I'll draw a horizontal line here.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.350
Let's bisect the angle, and now let's,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.370
let's take

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.060
a slightly higher line, like the horizontal line like that,

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:38.289
extend that line, and that line, and then from here and here, I will move parallel to this angle bisector.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.540
There are a lot of triangles in this picture. Let's, let's look at them. First, first,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.749
there's let's say, this one connecting the black dots.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.959
Then there is this one connecting the red dots.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.790
If you slide those triangles, what you get is it a slightly bigger

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.629
copy of the triangle you started with. It's similar, but slightly taller.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.769
Let's say this is k meters. K is very big. This is, let's say, 1 meter. Inside the original triangle,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.889
I could slide, certainly, a pole of length k. In the two new triangles, I can

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.769
slide a pole of length k plus 1.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.389
But, if I try to do that, there will come a moment at which I have to use magic or something.

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.629
So I can move through the same range of angles as before, but I'm only adding a little bit of area.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.630
I'm only adding two ears.

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:33.219
This length here is 1, so I don't want to work out the full derivation, but I think it's plausible that,

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.740
that these lengths here

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.239
are no bigger than 5. The total area of the two ears,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.820
according to our formula for the, here for the area of a sector, these two ears have area

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.800
something like

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.010
1,000 times the total angle of the ears. And what is that total angle?

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:01.329
Well, that's one half of the angle of this guy, because we bisected the angle, and so it's like

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.810
500

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.829
times the angle at the tip of the original triangle.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.789
Now let's repeat the construction. Let's say this is 45 degrees.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.389
This is maybe, I don't know, 1 or 2 or 3, it doesn't matter.

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.739
Let's say this height is 1. Let's mark off a bunch of horizontal lines all the way up to N.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.810
Now, look at this triangle,

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:24.429
and do what we were talking about before to it. Let it grow a pair of ears.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.299
Now we've got two triangles. Draw a pair of ears on each of those.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.350
Now we've got four triangles. Draw a pair of ears on each of those, et cetera.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.450
Keep on going N times and at the very end you have 2 to the Nth power

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.649
triangles, each with angle 45 degrees

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.538
divided by 2 to the N at the tip, because each time I grow a pair of ears,

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:51.009
I double the number of triangles, but I halve the angle at each triangle.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.380
Brady: "Okay, that's a monster you've made, there."

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.380
That's a monster. Notice that inside the arena,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.780
I can turn a pole of length N,

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.830
but, there is a problem. I have to do this magic jumping. Never mind,

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.609
we'll fix the magic jumping later. So we can turn a pole of length N.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:17.109
Fine. Now, what's the area of the arena? Let's start with our original triangle. It has whatever area it has.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:24.039
11, I don't care. It grows a pair of ears. We decided that the area of the pair of ears was something like

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.079
1,000 times the angle at the tip. Now notice that at the Nth stage there are 2 to the N

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:35.259
triangles, each one with an angle 45 degrees over 2 to the N. At the very last stage, each ear

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.849
has an area of, let's say, a thousand times this number, but there are 2 to the N of them.

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:45.459
So, altogether the total area of all the ears that we've added at stage N

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:52.569
is a thousand times 45 degrees. Okay? Because the 2 to the Ns cancel when you multiply. Well that was also true with the N

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:58.989
minus first stage and at the N minus second stage. At every stage, there are some tiny angles, and

00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:03.909
a huge number of them, and they add up to 45 degrees, and therefore, at

00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:11.919
each stage of this construction, you added a total of, let's say, area 1,000. There were N stages of the construction.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:18.309
And so the total area of all the ears at all the stages of the construction is like a thousand times N.

00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:23.349
Plus the 11 that we started with, which is irrelevant. Okay? So,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:30.099
That's, now remember, our goal is to beat N squared and we've done it. We've got a thousand times N.

00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:32.708
We take this weird picture, and we,

00:08:34.069 --> 00:08:39.879
we scale it down, making a tiny map with a scale of 1 meter on the map equals N

00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:44.589
meters here, and we have produced a geometrical figure whose area is

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:50.880
something like 1,000 divided by N, in which we can turn a pole of length 1.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.660
After you scale it down, this very weird arena would fit comfortably inside a square of radius, let's say, three,

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:02.410
of side length three, or a circle of radius three or four, so,

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:07.120
so, so far, we're not going into deep space, we,

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:12.279
you know, we went very far away, but we were turning a very big pole, and after we scaled it down,

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.500
it's not so it's not so big anymore,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.919
it just has a tiny area. All right, so now we're going to solve the jump problem.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.969
So again, the magic jumping is that from time to time, we will, we will find ourselves

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:27.820
here, and we would like to be facing the same direction, but in a different place, and so we will just jump,

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.439
and that's what I'm calling magic jumping. So we have to do that a finite number of times. All right.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:38.079
So we have, never mind what the arena is, but the arena includes a pole of length 1, and

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:45.039
we would like to move it to another location so it has moved, but it, its direction has not changed, it is

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.859
parallel, going to change the direction slightly.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:53.800
Let's call these, both of these angles theta. We're going to make theta very small, and we'll see how small in a minute.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.040
We have had to

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.159
turn the needle through that little slice of pie, and through that little slice of pie.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:07.209
And we decided that the area of one of these things, if this is of length 1, the area of each of these guys is

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.800
maybe something like 1,000 times theta. And there are two of them, so there's

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.100
2,000 times theta. Our two guys are facing

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.620
very very slightly different directions, and we slide these needles until

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.000
they meet. So here, let's say, is something of length 1, and

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:30.880
here is something of length 1, and if we turn this guy by theta, and we turn this guy by theta,

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:35.229
then this angle is maybe 2 theta or something like that.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:41.829
Now how much area did it take to slide? Well, zero, because these are just line segments.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.690
Maybe it feels weird to have a line segment as part of our arena.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:52.690
We say its thickness is T, and, and this distance is, is, whatever it is. This distance is D.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.410
Then we have simply two

00:10:54.410 --> 00:11:01.930
rectangles of thickness T and distance D. Now before I decided to thicken this guy, I could calculate what D was in terms of

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:07.629
theta, and so once I have done that, I take, I take T to be so small

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.410
that D times T is, let's say, smaller than theta.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.590
So I know what D is, and it's gonna be very big, because the two,

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.010
the two poles are almost parallel, and they're going to have to go a very,

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.400
very long way before they meet, so this D is a very big number,

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.399
and this angle theta is a very small number, so this is big,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.400
and this is small, and so this T is gonna have to be real real real small for this to happen. Never mind.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:36.340
We just pick T that small. So now what is our region? We have, let's say, we have this slice of pie,

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.720
we have

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.709
this slice of pie from the previous constructions,

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.450
we have our very long but extremely thin rectangle here and here,

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.510
and finally, we have a slice of pie of length 1

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:56.590
that enables this needle to turn until it's facing this way. You have to build a bunch of them every time you want to make

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.580
one of these magic jumps.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
[sliding noise]

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:08.770
Okay, and that's it. Well, now we want to travel through the full 360 degrees. And so again

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.260
we simply rotate it, and put them together, and that's it.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.260
Brady: "How would you describe this shape? It's, like, just a series of tiny ears, like"

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.830
Yes, yes.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.989
So it's tiny ears growing out of tiny ears, growing out of tiny ears, and as, as you

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.729
grow away from the base, the ears get tinier and thinner. The problem has an interesting history.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.520
Kakeya posed the problem in 1917.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.140
At the same time, the Russian mathematician Besicovitch

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:42.160
discovered the set with ears and saw that, that there was a segment

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.210
pointing in every direction, or in every direction within one quadrant.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:52.210
He was in Russia in 1917, so various other events were taking place, and his discovery did not become

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:58.359
known to the outside world for a long time, and the connection with Kakeya's problem was,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.860
was slow to be realized. The mechanism to get rid of the magic jumps was discovered by

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.540
a Hungarian mathematician named Pál.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.200
Brady: "I imagine if we were doing this in the real world, this would be a time-consuming process."

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.250
Yes.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:21.160
Somebody once wrote about this problem, that a person trying to turn a long pole in a dense forest could appreciate

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.430
this problem.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:30.020
...for 2,000 years people played with the ruler and compass, and worried about that.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.900
And then something amazing happened, it got connected with the rest of mathematics. That often happens in mathematics, when,

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:42.859
when a problem gets connected to something else, it becomes accessible. Actually, this fell to a prodigy,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.560
a pimply 19 year old, Carl Friedrich Gauss, in 1796...
