good performances but there's so many
other questions that cross the desk in

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220
other questions that cross the desk in
 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.890

terms of personnel and planning and
 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.140
terms of personnel and planning and
programming and and if I if I have to

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150
programming and and if I if I have to
 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.820
programming and and if I if I have to
think about everything at once nothing

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830
think about everything at once nothing
 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.260
think about everything at once nothing
really gets done that well so whatever

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270
really gets done that well so whatever
 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.620
really gets done that well so whatever
it is I try to do it and not worry about

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630
it is I try to do it and not worry about
 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.050
it is I try to do it and not worry about
the other things because I really

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060
the other things because I really
 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.810
the other things because I really
hopefully realize that whim if I've

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820
hopefully realize that whim if I've
 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.980
hopefully realize that whim if I've
taken care of one thing well then i can

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990
taken care of one thing well then i can
 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.480
taken care of one thing well then i can
let it go and move on to the next thing

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490
let it go and move on to the next thing
 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.630
let it go and move on to the next thing
so i try not to multitask actually

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640
 
 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.969
 
I'm pretty good at keeping my

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979
I'm pretty good at keeping my
 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.680
I'm pretty good at keeping my
concentration on stage and and today in

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690
concentration on stage and and today in
 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.000
concentration on stage and and today in
the performance there was a moment where

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010
the performance there was a moment where
 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.730
the performance there was a moment where
I almost lost focus and it was I don't

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740
I almost lost focus and it was I don't
 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.900
I almost lost focus and it was I don't
know if it was my fault or not but

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910
know if it was my fault or not but
 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.360
know if it was my fault or not but
anyway I turned to pages in a very in

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370
anyway I turned to pages in a very in
 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.400
anyway I turned to pages in a very in
the Gruber trumpet and show it's a very

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410
the Gruber trumpet and show it's a very
 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.690
the Gruber trumpet and show it's a very
very complicated piece and it was

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700
very complicated piece and it was
 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.130
very complicated piece and it was
actually the most complicated section

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140
actually the most complicated section
 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.710
actually the most complicated section
the most dangerous section to lose lose

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720
the most dangerous section to lose lose
 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.870
the most dangerous section to lose lose
your place if I messed up I probably

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880
your place if I messed up I probably
 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.220
your place if I messed up I probably
wouldn't have been able to get back on

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230
wouldn't have been able to get back on
 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.540
wouldn't have been able to get back on
so it was a really scary moment I wasn't

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550
so it was a really scary moment I wasn't
 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.949
so it was a really scary moment I wasn't
really thinking as I turn the page of

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959
really thinking as I turn the page of
 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.750
really thinking as I turn the page of
them and this particular piece is very

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760
them and this particular piece is very
 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.400
them and this particular piece is very
important to turn the pages really well

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410
important to turn the pages really well
 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.320
important to turn the pages really well
at the right time and of course only one

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330
at the right time and of course only one
 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.390
at the right time and of course only one
one leaf at a time I i usually am able

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400
one leaf at a time I i usually am able
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.680
one leaf at a time I i usually am able
to stay really in the in the moment and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690
to stay really in the in the moment and
 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.190
to stay really in the in the moment and
in the performance and if I'm tired

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200
in the performance and if I'm tired
 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.860
in the performance and if I'm tired
that's that's when I tend to lose my

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870
that's that's when I tend to lose my
 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.770
that's that's when I tend to lose my
concentration I I I sometimes think well

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780
concentration I I I sometimes think well
 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.720
concentration I I I sometimes think well

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.650
me I think about them a lot and I'll go
through an entire concert and I'll think

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660
through an entire concert and I'll think
 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.330
through an entire concert and I'll think
oh I didn't think about my kids once

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340
oh I didn't think about my kids once
 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.190
oh I didn't think about my kids once
during these last two hours

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200
 
 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.089
 
I think being well-prepared helps you

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099
I think being well-prepared helps you
 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.750
I think being well-prepared helps you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760
focus i think i like to go into a
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.650
focus i think i like to go into a
rehearsal or a concert knowing that i

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660
rehearsal or a concert knowing that i
 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.229
rehearsal or a concert knowing that i
know how it's going to go not that i

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239
know how it's going to go not that i
 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.030
know how it's going to go not that i
know exactly how it will play out or how

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
know exactly how it will play out or how
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.000
know exactly how it will play out or how
will feel musically or artistically but

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010
will feel musically or artistically but
 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.300

enter a situation without doing adequate
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.759
enter a situation without doing adequate
preparation and that means focusing

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769
preparation and that means focusing
 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.890
preparation and that means focusing
beforehand but also creating the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900
beforehand but also creating the
 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.380
beforehand but also creating the
situation in which it's possible to be a

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390
situation in which it's possible to be a
 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.870
situation in which it's possible to be a
hundred percent focused in the moment

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880
hundred percent focused in the moment
 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.800
hundred percent focused in the moment
and you know I I my wife laughs when I

to do is to show up being less than
 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.540
to do is to show up being less than
prepared and that's that's the one thing

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550
prepared and that's that's the one thing
 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.230

you can control you can't control what

happens externally but you can control
 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.300
happens externally but you can control
your level of preparation and so that

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310
your level of preparation and so that
 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.770
your level of preparation and so that
gives you confidence and that makes it

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780
gives you confidence and that makes it
 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.360
gives you confidence and that makes it
