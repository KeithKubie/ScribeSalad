00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.770
Hello, YouTube users,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.600
I'm here at Davos,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.940
attending the World Economic Forum.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.800
The recession of the world economy

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.500
has certainly affected Korea as well,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.400
but we hope to see a turnaround

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.700
in the latter half of the year.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.200
We're promoting the Green New Deal Policy,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.400
which should create more jobs and

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.500
increase the chances of a favorable turn

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.000
with regards to the recession

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.400
once it is successfully adopted.
