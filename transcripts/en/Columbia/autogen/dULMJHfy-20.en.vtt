organization that is all but human it is
subhuman when then you try to humanize

01:14:50.469 --> 01:14:50.479
subhuman when then you try to humanize
 

01:14:50.479 --> 01:14:52.659

01:15:07.249 --> 01:15:09.159
mistakes that the West has made is in
the failure to recognize for example

01:15:09.159 --> 01:15:09.169
the failure to recognize for example
 

01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:13.239

bravery his his egalitarian ISM and
 

01:15:19.159 --> 01:15:22.000
bravery his his egalitarian ISM and
things like this so if

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:22.010
things like this so if
 

01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:23.890
things like this so if
you do that to your enemy even though

01:15:23.890 --> 01:15:23.900
you do that to your enemy even though
 

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:25.060
you do that to your enemy even though
you want to capture and kill him and

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:25.070
you want to capture and kill him and
 

01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:27.880
you want to capture and kill him and
sure says that we wanted to capture and

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:27.890
sure says that we wanted to capture and
 

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:31.510
sure says that we wanted to capture and
kill him then at least you've humanized

01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520
kill him then at least you've humanized
 

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.030
kill him then at least you've humanized
them then at least you're not talking

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.040
them then at least you're not talking
 

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:36.730
them then at least you're not talking
about an animal or a monster and that's

01:15:36.730 --> 01:15:36.740
about an animal or a monster and that's
 

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:38.230
about an animal or a monster and that's
what's happened in the dehumanization

01:15:38.230 --> 01:15:38.240
what's happened in the dehumanization
 

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.810
what's happened in the dehumanization
processes on both sides when we were

01:15:40.810 --> 01:15:40.820
processes on both sides when we were
 

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:44.110
processes on both sides when we were
dehumanized it was done because of the

01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.120
dehumanized it was done because of the
 

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.930
dehumanized it was done because of the
differences that people were told that

01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:46.940
differences that people were told that
 

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:49.210
differences that people were told that
we had and therefore it was easy to

01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:49.220
we had and therefore it was easy to
 

01:15:49.220 --> 01:15:52.300
we had and therefore it was easy to
torture us but when you humanize

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:52.310
torture us but when you humanize
 

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:55.420
torture us but when you humanize
somebody it becomes much harder than to

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:55.430
somebody it becomes much harder than to
 

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:56.800
somebody it becomes much harder than to
do all the things that you do to them

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:56.810
do all the things that you do to them
 

01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:59.830
do all the things that you do to them
and then it's easier if you humanize

01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840
and then it's easier if you humanize
 

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.870
and then it's easier if you humanize
them to also bring them into an

01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:01.880
them to also bring them into an
 

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.270
them to also bring them into an
engagement process so that you can bring

01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:04.280
engagement process so that you can bring
 

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:07.210
engagement process so that you can bring
an end to the conflict somehow you were

suggesting earlier essentially a
conceptual failure failure language how

01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:12.980
conceptual failure failure language how
 

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.680
conceptual failure failure language how
does one go about changing that language

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:14.690
does one go about changing that language

that task we often talk about language
 

01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:23.770
that task we often talk about language
we often talk about the use the misuse

organizations but doesn't mention states
whereas previous ones mentioned states

01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:12.440

you can see now you can go to the
average American and he will say jihad

01:17:33.370 --> 01:17:33.380
