00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.160
- [Instructor] What we see here is known

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.470
as a trophic pyramid,
and the word trophic,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.330
in a biology context, is
referring to food relationships.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.610
So one way to think about this,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.460
it tells us who is eating whom,
and who is producing energy,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.510
and then who is able to
leverage that energy.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.790
So the base of a trophic pyramid,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.517
you have your primary
producers, primary producers.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.930
These are often known as autotrophs,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.083
because they're able to
take energy from the sun,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.960
so sun's energy, and nutrients
that are available to them,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.860
and store some of that energy as biomass.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.510
And biomass is just a fancy
word for the actual substance

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.080
of the organism that is
inherently storing energy.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.380
When someone tells you that that piece

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.760
of food has a certain number of calories,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.400
that's because there's
energy stored in it.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.820
Calories are a unit of energy.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.730
And so, let's just say, if you
were to take a square meter,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.020
if you were to average on
a per square meter basis,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.700
these primary producers
in this environment,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.700
let's say they're able to
store 20,000 kilocalories

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.960
per square meter per year.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.650
What's interesting
about a trophic pyramid,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.260
it helps describe, well, okay,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.410
that energy's stored as
biomass, what happens then?

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.090
Well, then you could go to the next level,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.010
and you could view these as your primary

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.300
or first-level consumers.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.660
So first-level, well, I
could call them level one

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.660
or primary consumers,
these are the organisms

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.090
that would eat the primary producers.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.650
But not all of that energy gets restored

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.110
as biomass in these organisms.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.590
In fact, there is a lot of loss.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.570
On average, when we look at ecosystems,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.270
it tends to be only about 10% makes it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.060
from one level of our
trophic pyramid to the next.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.100
So at this level, on a per,
on average, per square meter,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.920
instead of 20,000
kilocalories being stored

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.340
as biomass per year, you'd
only have 10% of that.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.730
So it might only be 2,000.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.680
2,000 kilocalories per
square meter per year.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.300
So notice, you have that drop-off.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.110
And then you could go to
the next level after that,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.930
you could view these as
the secondary consumers.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.490
These are the folks who might
eat the primary consumers,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.120
the first-level consumers.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.890
You get another 10%
drop-off, so you would,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.470
or I should say, a 90% drop-off,
only 10% gets transferred.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.470
So about 200, 200 kilocalories
per square meter per year.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.040
And it keeps happening, the
folks who eat those folks,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.760
well then, you've dropped off
at this level right over here.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.180
You could call these the
third-level consumers,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.653
or sometimes viewed as tertiary consumers.

00:02:47.372 --> 00:02:50.593
This would be about 20 kilocalories

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.210
per square meter per year.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.350
And this doesn't mean that
every square meter will have

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.520
exactly 20 kilocalories of biomass of,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.150
let's say in this example, snake.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.930
It just means that if you
were to look at the biomass

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.940
of snakes, and you were to average them

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.670
across this ecosystem, the surface area,

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.140
then you might average
about 20 kilocalories

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.510
per square meter per year.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.330
And then you get to the
top of this pyramid.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.610
And this, you could view as
your level four consumer.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.560
You could view this as,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.130
since they're at the top of the pyramid,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.400
this is sometimes known
as the apex predator.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.180
But every stage here, you only are able

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.110
to transfer 10% of the biomass.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.630
So here, you have two kilocalories

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.920
per square meter per year.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.810
And what's useful about
this, it helps us understand

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.420
what an ecosystem can support.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.650
It can support a lot of biomass
of our primary producers,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.970
but it can support very little biomass

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.820
of our apex predators, and that's why,

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.610
if you were to go into the forest,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.980
you would see very few apex predators.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.420
If you were to look at the apex predators

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.320
and you were to think about their biomass

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.180
in terms of kilocalories, and
spread it over their region

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.750
where they have to find
food, it would be much lower

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.340
than the average biomass
per square meter of,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.970
say, the grass and the trees.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.370
Now, an interesting thing is, well,

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.770
where is a lot of that
energy getting lost to?

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.430
Well, in a lot of cases, these
organisms are moving around.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.160
They have to do things,
they have processes

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.770
in their own body, and those
things all generate heat.

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.210
So even plants, even plants generate heat.

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.080
So all of these characters
are, there's some energy

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.940
that's being released as heat.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.140
Also, when these players die,

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.310
they are decomposed by other organisms.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.480
So all this biomass, it's
either just going to die,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.570
or it's going to get eaten,
but even when it gets eaten,

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.220
all of the energy doesn't get transferred.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.870
Some of it stays in the
undigested material,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.408
which we refer to as poop, and so,

00:04:44.408 --> 00:04:48.780
those dead bodies, that
dead biomass, or this poop

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.230
that still contains energy,
is going to be fed on

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.250
by what we call decomposers, decomposers.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.360
And they really break
things down into nutrients,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.740
which then can be consumed
by the primary producers

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.450
as they utilize the sun's energy

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.320
and keep the cycle going after that.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.550
Now, one interesting
thing to think about is,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.050
what if there are
changes to the ecosystem?

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.430
What if, for example, a
nearby volcano erupts?

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.120
And that volcano, let me draw that,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.600
it's a fun thing to draw,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.870
that volcano erupts and
ash goes into the sky,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.840
and all year it's just really gray.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.540
What do you think would happen?

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.850
Well, the sun's energy that's
able to hit the surface

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.770
of the earth in this area
would go down by a good bit.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.890
And so, if that went down by a good bit,

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.910
then the primary producers
might not be able

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.780
to store 20,000 kilocalories
per square meter per year.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.010
It might go down to 2,000 kilocalories

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.110
per square meter per
year, and in which case,

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.150
you'd drop to a zero off of all of these.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.020
So instead of 20,000,
it might go to 2,000.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.300
Instead of 2,000, this would be 200.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.760
Instead of 200, this would be 20.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.970
Instead of 20, this would be two.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.053
Instead of two, this would 0.2.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.620
And so, something like
the loss of light energy,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.750
even though this apex predator doesn't

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.320
directly photosynthesize, a
lot fewer of them are going

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.240
to be able to be supported
in that ecosystem

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.490
if you have a lot less
energy stored at biomass,

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.200
at the primary production
level, because there's just less

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.670
of sun's energy to be able
to be stored as biomass.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.170
There could be other things
that happen in the ecosystem.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.510
Let's say that some
pesticides get introduced,

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.430
and some of these level one
consumers start dying out.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.100
Well then, you might have less
of the transfer of biomass

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.720
from the primary producer level

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.320
to the primary consumer
level, which, once again,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.270
might affect these other
levels of the trophic pyramid.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.430
So this is an interesting
thing to think about.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.390
Ecosystems are these really complex,

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.730
intertwined things, and one impact

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.580
at one area could have
far-reaching consequences

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.530
throughout the entire ecosystem.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.100
It's also interesting to think

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.990
of ecosystems as energy transfer.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.810
Energy's coming from the
sun, and it's being cycled

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.170
through this ecosystem,
through this pyramid.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.630
Some of it gets stored as
biomass and gets transferred

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.910
to other forms of biomass, but
a lot of it gets lost as heat

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.770
as these organisms' cells go
through different processes.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.010
The organisms are running around,

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.003
living their life, doing whatever.
