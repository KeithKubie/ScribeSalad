1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.240
I thought before going into today's topic,

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.810
I will give you a five minute summary of what happened last time.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.000
So you guys are saying,
look,
uh,

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.910
it looks like you got carried away with this thing.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.130
We just want to know what we need to become good doctors.
Okay,
so just tell us.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.740
So he had a doctor or the lawyer.

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.650
I've had really strong students in my class who had nothing to do with any of

8
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.360
the sciences,
physics or chemistry,

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.000
which of course a great pleasure for me to know.

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.220
So if you go far into your life's mission at what should you know from the last

11
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:38.100
lecture?
Here's the main point.

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.870
The law of conservation of energy is a powerful concept that I told you survives

13
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:50.370
even the quantum revolution.
So it looks like we may have scraped the system,

14
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:53.700
something called the total energy with the kinetic energy,

15
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.810
which is always one half MV square and potential energy,

16
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.420
which depends on the location of the object.

17
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.990
And it varies from problem to problem depending on whether they're connected

18
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:08.520
with spraying or gravity and so on.
In one dimension.

19
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:13.500
We could always get set the potential energy for any force that dependent only

20
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:14.334
on location.

21
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.780
The trick was to go back to the work,
enter the theater them,

22
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.150
but just applies Newton's laws and say is the change in Kennedy get energy of

23
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:24.984
the body?

24
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.210
Is the work done by the body and that work we defined to be this?

25
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.960
Then the sum of all of this on the left hand side would be the tended candidate

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.550
energy.
On the right hand side.

27
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.970
This will become the integral of f from x one two x two and if f really it's a

28
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:49.470
function of x amount of also velocity loss of calculus tell you,

29
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.740
you may write this integral as a difference of two numbers.

30
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.440
Then you rearrange the expression to get k one plus you want,

31
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.510
you want to shorthand for you have x one is kid too plus youtube and that means

32
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.380
the energy he wants to begin with energy at the end.

33
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.410
If that is the frictional force,

34
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.130
then in these integral you break it up into two parts.

35
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.150
The part said you'd do a spring and the part due to friction,

36
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.690
the part due to a spring will integrate to give you this,

37
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.010
then you will still have the part due to friction leftover.
In that case,

38
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.310
that is silver look like k one k two plus you two minus k one plus you one

39
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.850
instead of being zero will be the work done by friction.
Um,

40
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.380
we write it symbolically this way,

41
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:44.310
but the frictional force is not a function of x alone,

42
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.280
but if you knew which path you're taking and which way are moving,

43
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.780
you can do that integral.
You want to do this in higher dimensions,

44
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.780
in higher dimensions.
What I found out was that if you want that,

45
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.940
the chance of Canada energy to be the work done than what you had to do was to

46
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.100
write this expression,

47
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.570
which was a shorthand for Fx Dx plus f y the y.

48
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.520
So you take a point and you go to the neighboring point.

49
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.450
That's the work done and this work done with cooktop so that it was a change in

50
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:23.320
Kennedy energy.
Then you'll say,
okay,
let me take a finite path.

51
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.430
Starting with some point od one and going through some point our tube.

52
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.180
Then I add up all the changes,
the lefthand side,

53
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.630
his kid to minus k one and the right 10 site.
Is this integral?

54
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.070
This is always true.
This will never be wrong.
Yes,

55
00:03:43.071 --> 00:03:44.480
the restatement of Newton's law,

56
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.290
the problem will be can be right this integral here as a difference of two

57
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:55.040
numbers.
One depending on the starting 0.1 depending on the ending point.

58
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.030
Is this possible?
I have to say question mark.

59
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.210
If it's possible you're done because you're back to right in k one plus you want

60
00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.200
to skate to bless you too,

61
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.770
but I tried to convince you that it's not always going to happen so let's

62
00:04:11.841 --> 00:04:15.830
understand why it's not always going to happen.
It is not enough.

63
00:04:15.831 --> 00:04:19.640
It is integral to say started r one and Gore to art too.
In fact,

64
00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:23.300
if I just said find the integral of the work done by the force,

65
00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:25.520
but in an odd one and r two you will have to tell me.

66
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.520
You'll have to ask me something.
You agree?

67
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.850
What will you ask?
In addition,

68
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.490
besides just saying started out when and ended our too.

69
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.113
<v 1>What happens?</v>

70
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.280
<v 0>You will ask what path did you take and unless they specify the path,</v>

71
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.720
you cannot do the integral because you don't know what contour you want to draw.

72
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.900
Therefore the answer in general depends on the path,

73
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.760
but this right hand side does not.

74
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.550
So if you pick the same two end points and you ready that path in this one right

75
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:56.590
answer,
it doesn't change but it's not hard to imagine.

76
00:04:56.591 --> 00:05:00.880
The lefthand side would be different.
That foot in general,
this will not be true.

77
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.570
So even though there's a relation between work done and increase in Kennedy,

78
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.870
Kennedy,
you will not get a law of conservation of energy

79
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.870
unless this is true.

80
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.810
Then I said that is still a hope because we can in fact manufactured forces,

81
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:20.470
but with this is true.
The manufacturer of the force,

82
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.710
you pick any function,
you have x and y that you like.

83
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.610
Then define a new force who is x component is minus that did have it to of you

84
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:34.240
with respect to x and it was white component.
Just the minus,

85
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:36.430
a bit of it to you respect and why.

86
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.840
Then you got to go back and look at your notes and see that if you take f.
Dot.

87
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:41.674
D are now,

88
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.580
you're just adding the change in you and when you go from start to finish the

89
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:46.161
tour to change,

90
00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:49.630
you will in fact be the change in you from start to finish and warm depending on

91
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.464
how you got there.

92
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.530
So you're basically what you're doing is in the x y plane,

93
00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:58.040
you are defining a function.
You have x,
which is lake a height.

94
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.640
You define the force in a clever way so that f.
Dot.

95
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:04.400
The art is the change in the height as you march.

96
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.130
So you can start at any point on the mountain,

97
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:08.660
go to any of the point of the mountain.

98
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.730
If you're only keeping track of the change in height,

99
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.810
you're going to get the same answer no matter how you got from here to there.

100
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.420
So you start with the potential and work out a force and that force will then

101
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.740
obviously give an answer that's path independent and the potential associated

102
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:28.580
with the force is the function you began with.
In other words in this problem,

103
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:33.581
then k one plus you one will be kid two plus youtube where you as the same guy

104
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.720
you began with
so you can get a lot of conservation and energy in that case.

105
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.550
Then I told you without proof that this is the only way it can happen.

106
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.133
In other words,

107
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.070
we all agree that if you got a force from a potential by taking derivatives,

108
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.570
it does the job,

109
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.320
but I'm saying every force who is integral is independent of path.

110
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.230
We'll always have as his ancestor a function,

111
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:00.540
you and the x component of the force will be the extent of it to,

112
00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:04.340
of the PR function and why it will be the way that that's not obvious,

113
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:07.010
but in other words it's clear,
it's sufficient,

114
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:11.180
but it's also necessary so every conservative force is the date of it to have

115
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:15.530
some potential in this fashion.
Finally I said,

116
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:19.760
if someone comes and gives you a force and says,
is it conservative or not?

117
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.980
Either you can think in your head and try to guess that function you have,

118
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:28.880
which this f is,
they did have active in this fashion.
If you succeed,

119
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.530
you know it's conservative.
If you fail,

120
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.000
maybe it's not conservative and maybe you are not clever enough in finding that

121
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:35.834
function.

122
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:41.090
So here is a recipe that works for all of this recipe is take that force,

123
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.140
take the d by d y of Fx and competitive the d by d,

124
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:51.860
x of F Y and if they're equal,
it's a conservative force.

125
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.280
That's the summary of last lecture.

126
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.060
How much detail you want noise entirely up to you.

127
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.760
Okay,
so now,

128
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.290
so I'm going to do a,
this is rescue doubled from last time,
so I'm going to

129
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.810
basically hide that.
If you want,
he can take a few moments writing it down,

130
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.010
but you understand the point.

131
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:23.240
No point is that are in fact if you think about his family,

132
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:27.140
miraculous that that our forces in nature so that the work done by them doesn't

133
00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:28.580
depend on how you got from a to B.

134
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.920
Even more interesting is that all the fundamental forces that we know,

135
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.050
gravity,
electrostatics,
uh,
even the strong force,
weak force,

136
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:42.560
every fours that we know to the extent can be described by a force happens to be

137
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:47.020
conservative.
So it's not that we are hung up on some rather exceptional case.

138
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.780
Nature is kind enough that all the forces are conservative.
Now,

139
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:53.720
friction is a little tricky.
You might say,
well friction is not conservative,

140
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.120
but friction is not microscopic force a friction as it grows.

141
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.160
Average way to describe things at some real fundamental level.

142
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.080
Every forces,
in fact conservative.
Anyway,
gravity is conservative.

143
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.513
And then

144
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.120
<v 2>uh Huh.</v>

145
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.000
<v 0>The electrostatic forces conservative also.</v>

146
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.090
So if envy is steady conservative systems,

147
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.280
we're starting something fairly general.

148
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:23.770
So today I go to one of the famous conservative problems,

149
00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:25.810
which is the gravitational interaction.

150
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.320
So the situation was as follows,
at Newton's time,

151
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.200
you know that corporate and Akers proposed that the way to think about our solar

152
00:09:38.201 --> 00:09:40.660
system is to put the Sun at the center

153
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.330
now,
so hit us copper Nicos is picture.

154
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.340
Here's the sign here at various planets.

155
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.023
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

156
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.640
<v 0>you have to agree.
That's very remarkable.
Okay.</v>

157
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.420
First of all was remarkable because that was a period when you does not publish

158
00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:02.250
or perish,
but publish and perish.

159
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.120
It's not a good thing to come out and say what you thought and you still did

160
00:10:06.121 --> 00:10:10.260
that.
Even independent of the social risk.

161
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.770
How did anybody figure this out?
Because even today,

162
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.340
even when I know this is true,
I look around,

163
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.270
it doesn't look like this at all to my eyes.
So on a good day,

164
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.930
I flatter myself into thinking I could have maybe discovered this.

165
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:29.250
I discovered that there is no way I would've done this.
This is really amazing.

166
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:30.084
Go out and look,

167
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.990
because what you're saying is if you look at our solar system from far away,

168
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:37.920
it's going to look like this.
That's fine,
but what does our vantage point?

169
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.760
We're sitting on third rock and we're going around and we somehow think we are

170
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:47.880
at rest and everything is spinning around the opposite way and to deduce from

171
00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:50.820
that chaos.
This is simple pick that is quite remarkable.

172
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.130
You got a lot of points just for saying this is what's happened.
That was a big,

173
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.430
it was properly called the corporate American revolution

174
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.740
after the corporate again revolution people that said take the data.

175
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:08.240
We get with this as the center and transcribed it with that as a center and plot

176
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.760
it.
So the person at Tyco,

177
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:16.560
Brian was a rich guy who had his own lab and he studied the solar system and

178
00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:21.561
Kepler was an assistant who caddied on the word for 40 years,

179
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.250
40 years.
He studied this problem.
Then he published his answers.

180
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.570
I got to tell you,
all of you for going into science,

181
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.770
I would urge you not to publish every 40 years.
Okay,
you're tired,

182
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:40.380
you're going to get a job,
you're not going to get a phd,

183
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.760
not going to get a post doc.
You will be a 70 year old poster if you do this.

184
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.010
So the climate is very different now.

185
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.160
Even though we are a lot more money for science.
I don't think we have science.

186
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.920
You have money for science,
have such long vision.

187
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.020
The only example that comes to my mind is a work by Ray Davis who look for solar

188
00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.910
neutrinos for about 30 years.
And fortunately the,
his reputation was so strong,

189
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.010
finding agencies kept him going.

190
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:11.410
It looked at neutrinos from the sun for 30 years to be really sure that that was

191
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:12.244
a problem.

192
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.210
And he confronted the theaters for the problem and the problem subsequently got

193
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:17.740
resolved.
But by in large,

194
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:21.730
people publish not a paper in 30 years,

195
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:25.330
but rather the goal is 30 papers a year is more what we want to do.

196
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.110
But you've got to realize that we're not much smarter than our ancestors.

197
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.700
And the fact that possibility that we have 30 excellent ideas a year is very

198
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:37.420
unlikely.
So I have to admire somebody like Kepler,

199
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.840
who after 40 years gave us something that is really solid gold because that's

200
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:45.820
what triggered that.
What set Newton on the right path.

201
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.550
So that are three laws of Kepler.
Okay.
So three loss in 40 years.

202
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.360
It's still better than congress had his,
what he had.

203
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:02.310
The first law is all planets going around the sun on an elliptical orbit with

204
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:06.220
the sun as the focus.

205
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.940
I'm not going to write all the words and take me forever to write it.

206
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.430
I'm just saying elliptical orbit.

207
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.170
And you guys can get the precise texts from any source you like.

208
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.710
But I have to remind you what elliptical orbit means,
right?

209
00:13:20.711 --> 00:13:24.250
So everyone has to know what an ellipsis.
So you draw a circle,

210
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.340
you'd take a thumbtack,
you stick it into your table,

211
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.280
you take a string form a loop like that.

212
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:35.260
Put a pencil here and keep the pencil tight and walk around keeping the
distance.

213
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:38.500
You get a circle
for an ellipse,

214
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.940
you take two thumbtacks and you take a string like this,

215
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.850
keeping that length plus that length constant and you move keeping the string

216
00:13:48.851 --> 00:13:52.750
tight and the shape you produces the ellipse.

217
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.830
And these are the two focal points,
f one and f two

218
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.340
ellipsis,
an egg shaped circle.

219
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.460
And if you want to get the circle back from the Ls,

220
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.000
you've just moved the two focal points to a single point and you will get the

221
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:07.834
circle.

222
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.910
That's a circle as only a single number are the radius characterizing it.

223
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:20.460
The LFC has what's called a major access and a minor axis and major access to a

224
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:25.930
and a,
it's called the semi major axis,
which is that this.

225
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.980
So do you know how you can get an ellipse way?

226
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.630
The Greeks were studying ellipsis where they come from.

227
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:36.933
<v 1>Yes.</v>

228
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:44.620
You have one that's in your reflection and you use the plane as the section sort

229
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:51.630
of cut through Easter called cones at different angles.

230
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.830
The uh,
outlined,
uh,
east,
uh,

231
00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.740
cones.
These kind of sections will be elliptical,

232
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.480
<v 0>that'd be ellipsis circles.
There'll be various famous John Metric figures.</v>

233
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.820
I think for our purposes,

234
00:15:06.821 --> 00:15:09.160
even if it took a single cone and you cut it or some angle,

235
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.930
that would be an Ellis,
that's where the Greeks were studying this.

236
00:15:13.931 --> 00:15:16.810
But you need a second phone call and for other things.
But for now,

237
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.830
if you slice a cone parallel to the base,
you'll get a circle at an angle,

238
00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:22.960
you'll get yellows.
So that's the first statement.

239
00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:28.450
The second statement is the following.
If you

240
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.660
pick one planet and it's there today,
right?

241
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.530
You wait a week there and you wait another week,
it's there.

242
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:45.150
You join these two lines and you call that the area swept out by the planet in

243
00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:51.000
the first week.
Then in the second week areas area,

244
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:55.360
notice that certain area intercepted by the two radio vectors and the arc along

245
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:56.194
which you move.

246
00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.760
And Kepler said the rate at which the area is web cloud,

247
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:05.410
let's dad to be a shorthand for how much areas covered in a certain time.

248
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.580
So you take the area swept or divide the Delta t and he said that's a constant.

249
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.890
And the third result
is that,

250
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:25.760
let me see the square of the time it takes the planet to go around the sun

251
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.190
divided by the cube of the arbiters size.

252
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.090
It's the same for all planets.

253
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.483
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

254
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.850
<v 0>that's it.
These are the three laws of Kepler.</v>

255
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.223
<v 1>Yup.</v>

256
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.610
<v 0>But you don't need calculus to do what I just said.</v>

257
00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.780
Calculus says,
take the limit.
Delta t goes to zero.

258
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.290
You've dealt at ps one day or one month.
It really doesn't matter.

259
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.730
Take a planet like Pluto.
I'm going to keep calling it a planet because I'm,

260
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.600
I'm attached to Pluto more than to the some of the newer guys,

261
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:19.050
you wait one month,
you see how much areas covered than wait another month.

262
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.600
You would still find it's true.
In fact,

263
00:17:21.601 --> 00:17:25.500
it happens to be true even if it's not infinitesimally you can read even finite

264
00:17:25.501 --> 00:17:27.270
periods,
but this is the limit.

265
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.793
<v 1>Yup.</v>

266
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.480
<v 0>That lots of deviations</v>

267
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.123
<v 1>because</v>

268
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.430
<v 0>no,
Oh,
okay.</v>

269
00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.250
That are lots of connections to Kepler's laws.
First of all,
Kepler's law.

270
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.070
If we really observed with very carefully,

271
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.090
none of these things will actually work.
First of all,

272
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.900
planets are not moving just around the sun.
They have the pool of other planets.

273
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.850
Secondly,
a Newtonian law of gravitation,

274
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:03.390
which we'll study today,
has gotten modification from Einstein's theory,

275
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:06.000
which also modify the orbits.
In fact,

276
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:09.900
the truth is the planners don't follow close orbits at all.
But at the ellipse,

277
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:14.130
instead of starting out this way and staying this way forever slowly rotates.

278
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.800
And that's called the precision of the orbit.

279
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.570
And the one of the biggest mysteries was mercury had a precision.
In other words,

280
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:25.680
the orbit was not closing,
but,
uh,
like a Rosetta stone.

281
00:18:25.681 --> 00:18:30.000
It is doing this,
not at this rate,
but very,
very slowly.

282
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.440
The majority of that precision has fully understood by the ethics that I

283
00:18:34.441 --> 00:18:38.900
mentioned to you,
namely the fact that other forces on it,
Jupiter particularly,

284
00:18:38.901 --> 00:18:41.220
is very massive planet.
You cannot ignore this effect,

285
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.370
but still there is a tiny part that was missing,

286
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.790
which is 43rd degree of an arc percent.
Very,
very,

287
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:50.850
very small deviation left unexplained.

288
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:53.460
And the general theory of relativity filled in that gap.

289
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.100
So the answer is every lie I told you long back,
we'll receive corrections,

290
00:18:59.101 --> 00:19:02.010
but they usually very small.
Anyway,

291
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:04.890
this was the data that was given to Newton.

292
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.830
So Newton as you know,
uh,

293
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.930
was sent home from college because that was a plague and he went and lived in

294
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:18.010
this old village and he was contemplating this issue because he had already by

295
00:19:21.301 --> 00:19:23.220
this time invented the loss of motion.

296
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.330
And I think it also invented the basic ideas of calculus.

297
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.360
That is some debate about who got there first.

298
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:35.160
But there was no debate about what happened next.
So Newton said,

299
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.800
okay,
I'm going to understand planetary motion.

300
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.200
And so are you.

301
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.880
So you guys have been terribly disappointed that after all the work you put in,

302
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.320
you're still doing inclined planes and police and whatnot.

303
00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:53.070
So today we're going to make a big leap because today you're going to understand

304
00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:57.300
how planets move around the sun.
That's the mega problem,
right?

305
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.830
The little ams you put in the equation and not massive or pulley or a plane,

306
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:03.810
but massive Jupiter mass of the sun.

307
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.840
So you're doing something of cosmological proportions and you don't need to know

308
00:20:10.231 --> 00:20:13.020
too much more to do that.
Okay?
You're almost there.

309
00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:15.120
So I'm going to just tell you the one missing thing.

310
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.500
So what Newton had done is to realize that in order to understand motion of

311
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:25.614
bodies,

312
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.880
you have to associate a force with acceleration and rock with mass.

313
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.140
That was his contribution.

314
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.760
If you think it's forces that cost of velocity,

315
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:40.350
you look at a planet going around the sun and the velocity is pointing in

316
00:20:40.351 --> 00:20:44.160
different directions at different times and you have to ask what can possibly be

317
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:48.730
propelling the planet in this loop?
You don't get any definite advancer.

318
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.230
On the other hand,
if you calculate the acceleration of the planet,

319
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.660
take the simple case where the planners going on a circle,

320
00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.910
the acceleration at every instant points,
stewards the sun,

321
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.100
okay?
That's how,
that's where it's important.

322
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.790
Understand what forces are doing.
Forces are causing acceleration.

323
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:14.650
So Newton had already showed us and we have done many problems and a body

324
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:17.320
accelerates.
That's the reason for it.
Well,

325
00:21:17.321 --> 00:21:19.390
all bodies are accelerating towards the sun.

326
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.630
It was fairly clear what the reason is.
The reason is the sun,

327
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:28.050
and you then postulate a force that's exerted by the sun on the planet that

328
00:21:28.811 --> 00:21:33.100
bends it into a circle.
And your job is to find out that force.

329
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:34.750
What's the nature of the force?

330
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.660
So it is again here that Newton decided

331
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.380
that the force that

332
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.940
bends the planets around the sun is the same as the force that bends the moon

333
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:55.750
around the earth.
It was known by then.
The moon is also going around the earth.

334
00:21:55.751 --> 00:21:58.300
So let's look at that problem.
So here's the earth

335
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.150
and here's the morning and is going on two years

336
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.670
now the moon is accelerating towards the earth and that's something we have

337
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:10.690
learned in this course.

338
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.000
Then he had us,
the famous apple also accelerating towards the earth

339
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.390
and Newton decided that the cost behind both the forces is a new force,

340
00:22:25.391 --> 00:22:29.590
the force of gravity,
the same thing that pulls the apple as what pulls the mall.

341
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.660
So we have to now ask what is the nature of that force?

342
00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:38.603
<v 2>Okay,</v>

343
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.600
<v 0>you're going to write a formula for the forest first.</v>

344
00:22:41.601 --> 00:22:44.150
Let me look at the magnitude.
The direction is very clear.

345
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.600
It is directed towards the center of the Earth,
so I won't write that down.

346
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.710
Later on,
I will write you a formula with vectors.

347
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.820
Symbols in it so the vector will point to at the center of the earth.

348
00:22:52.821 --> 00:22:54.080
But let's look at the magnitude.

349
00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:58.810
If you take an apple here of mass m and you call big game,

350
00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.390
the mass of the earth near the earth,

351
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:07.070
we all know the acceleration of a body is constant.

352
00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:12.050
Therefore it can happen only if the force depends on the mass of the APP.

353
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.120
This force is going to depend on various things.
I'm going to write the formula,

354
00:23:17.121 --> 00:23:19.930
but one thing,
it depends on,
it's got to be proportional.
Massive yaffle.

355
00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.800
That's because then if you divide by n to get a,

356
00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.870
the mass drops out and you understand the fact that everything near the earth

357
00:23:29.871 --> 00:23:31.280
falls at the same rate.

358
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.780
The only way that can happen is if the forest depends on the mass of the apple.

359
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.390
You agreed that that m belongs there.
Okay.
If it doesn't belong there,

360
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.750
if you have something that depends on m square for or does it depend on Mrr,

361
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:50.330
you have a problem.
If the forest doesn't depend on the massive doll,

362
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:55.580
suppose the force on everybody near there.
It was a constant force than we need.

363
00:23:55.581 --> 00:23:59.270
Divide by mass.
You find that heavier objects that have a smaller acceleration,

364
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.180
but that's not what you find.
So that's perfect.

365
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:05.060
And precise cancellation on the mass of the object,

366
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.030
all things fall at the same rate.
So I know I need this am here.

367
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.550
What else do I need?

368
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.080
You notice that from the third law of Newton,

369
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.300
if there's a force on the apple,

370
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.690
the apple must exert a similar force on the earth.

371
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.880
So if you take an example in which here's the earth and here's the apple,

372
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.090
that's a little am sitting there.

373
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.140
But imagine the Apple's getting bigger and bigger because the formula is not

374
00:24:33.141 --> 00:24:33.974
going to change.

375
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:39.170
Make it bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger until it looks like the apple is

376
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:43.600
that big in the earth is that big?
Then you will have to agree that,
uh,

377
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.080
from that point of view,

378
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.540
you should also have the mass of the earth here playing a symmetric role.

379
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.160
So these two masses have to be there.

380
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.400
But then what else should I have there?
I mean,

381
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.230
what are the other variables in the problem?

382
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:02.983
<v 2>Yes,</v>

383
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.930
<v 0>the distance between them and I don't know what the distance dependence is,</v>

384
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.170
I'm going to say that some function of the distance between them

385
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.980
so we don't know what the distance is.
All right,

386
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:22.100
so let's find the acceleration of the apple that happens to be the mass of the

387
00:25:22.741 --> 00:25:23.574
earth.

388
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.170
This function with our calculated to be the radius of the earth.

389
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:38.220
Then you go to the moon and you ask what's the acceleration of the moon?

390
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:40.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

391
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:45.280
<v 0>It's the mass of the Earth Times the same function of the radius of the lunar</v>

392
00:25:45.281 --> 00:25:46.114
orbit.

393
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:55.270
Does anybody know how far the Munez?
Any guests?

394
00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:59.170
You know,
how far this make a wild guess.

395
00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.103
<v 2>Okay.</v>

396
00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:08.330
<v 0>Million Miles.
Not Bad.
Uh,
but not quite there.
Any other guests?</v>

397
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.790
Yes.
Pretty close.
At 238,000 miles.

398
00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:18.020
So that squatter of a million miles,
so million's not bad.
Okay.

399
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:21.740
If you make an estimate is off by a factor of Pi in physics it's fine.

400
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.430
But if you say 10 miles or something,
then we should have a talk.

401
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.690
We should have a very long talk after class.
Okay,
so that's correct.

402
00:26:29.691 --> 00:26:34.640
So this guy is 240,000 miles just to be simple.

403
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.100
The radius of the earth.
How bout that?

404
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.300
<v 2>Yes.
Yes.</v>

405
00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:44.170
<v 0>Uh,
how bout</v>

406
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.920
<v 1>in good old fashion?
Miles?</v>

407
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:52.783
Three times

408
00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.390
<v 0>10 to the six would be a million miles.</v>

409
00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

410
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.270
<v 0>Okay.
Anybody have a quick answer to how many miles?</v>

411
00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.680
What's the circumference of the earth?
Okay.

412
00:27:06.681 --> 00:27:09.230
Then you can do the math and find out the radius.
Okay.

413
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.980
Two is like six radius is 4,000 miles.

414
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.070
This is 4,000 miles.

415
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.880
This is 24 to 40,000 miles.

416
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.160
Look,
I know that we should work with meters and kilometers,

417
00:27:25.161 --> 00:27:27.530
but like the rest of you guys,
once they get on the freeway,

418
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.020
I'm watching how many miles per hour and driving,

419
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:34.520
not meters per second because I have no idea what?
55 miles per hours.

420
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.880
So we do use a lot of British units.

421
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.960
If you go by installation at home depot,
it's in BTUs per slug,

422
00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:46.850
per pound for something,
right?
So we still do that.

423
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.780
So in some sense you wonder why you had the war of independence if you're still

424
00:27:50.781 --> 00:27:54.410
using those units.
Because that's about the worst part of the whole system,

425
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:59.240
but we still use it.
So my brain is split.
When I do physics,
uh,

426
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.650
I use the metric system.
When I go to home depot,
I use the home depot units.

427
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.180
All right,
so here is the two accelerations.

428
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:13.340
Let's take the ratio of those two numbers.
Now,

429
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.430
Apple's acceleration,
all of you guys know,
right?

430
00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.990
It's the one thing we know from day one,

431
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.070
9.8 meters per second square acceleration of the moon.

432
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.750
How am I going to find that?

433
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.010
So I need an idea on how to find the acceleration of the moon.

434
00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.610
Anybody from this corner of the room on the top,

435
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.380
how do I find acceleration of the moon towards the yard?
What do we do?

436
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:39.580
I have to know.
Yes,
very good.

437
00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.090
That's what all I wanted from you.
We'll fill in the blanks,

438
00:28:43.091 --> 00:28:48.091
but it's v squared over R and artists this quarter of a million miles and v is

439
00:28:48.491 --> 00:28:51.010
the orbital velocity.

440
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.100
But you may not know the orbital velocity of the moon,
but you know,

441
00:28:54.101 --> 00:28:56.890
it goes around every 28 days or something,
right?

442
00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.010
So philosophy is to pay out over 28 days.

443
00:29:00.011 --> 00:29:02.530
Put it in the second you get some acceleration.
Yes.

444
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.770
Yes.
Right,
exactly.
In fact,
if not a circle,

445
00:29:08.771 --> 00:29:10.000
it's much more complicated.

446
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:13.510
So in this calculation will assume everything is a circle.

447
00:29:13.511 --> 00:29:15.730
It turns out to be not so bad even for planets.

448
00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:17.920
So if you do the v squared over R,

449
00:29:17.921 --> 00:29:22.921
you put the numbers in and you find the acceleration of the apple is 3,600 times

450
00:29:23.981 --> 00:29:28.930
more than the acceleration of the moon.
On the other hand,

451
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:34.830
you find the apple and the moon radio [inaudible] our factor of 60 apart.

452
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.030
The moon is 60 times as far from the center of the Earth as the apple.

453
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.870
And you look at 60 you look like 3,600 right?

454
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.560
You don't have to be a Newton to figure out what's going on.

455
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.970
The News at four write down this great formula.

456
00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:00.510
Do you understand now that that r squared or have you get the r square again?

457
00:30:00.511 --> 00:30:05.511
It's pretty remarkable because it's gotta be an r to the power 2.01 and you

458
00:30:05.561 --> 00:30:06.311
would certainly not,

459
00:30:06.311 --> 00:30:10.390
no you're wrong because these numbers are not known that well.
Newton just said,

460
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:13.030
look,
let me take the nearest integer power.

461
00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.910
It looks like close enough to one over r squared happens to be one over r

462
00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:19.870
squared is a fantastically good approximation to the law of gravity.

463
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:24.970
So we would also quite fortunate there the laws of gravity didn't have to be

464
00:30:24.971 --> 00:30:29.710
that simple.
Okay,
so now are we done are,

465
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:31.270
should I do something else to this?

466
00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.733
<v 1>Pardon me?</v>

467
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.100
<v 0>Uh,
this is the force I need.
What else?
Now</v>

468
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.900
I get one.
If you have to put your hand up and take a stance.
Yes,

469
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:48.770
you have to say something constant.
A constant,
right.
Why do you need the cons?

470
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.150
<v 1>Um,</v>

471
00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.670
because if you just work five that we had on the board and we probably wouldn't

472
00:30:52.671 --> 00:30:55.340
get exactly that answer.

473
00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.240
<v 0>Very good.
Yes.</v>

474
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:58.810
<v 1>Look at the units.</v>

475
00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:04.880
<v 0>Okay.
Units don't match.
Right?
So if some kid call ice,
it comes to you and says,</v>

476
00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.560
I got this new law of gravitation.
I would say go back and fix your units.

477
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.680
Units don't match,
but not only that,

478
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:17.120
I think some of you had another objection that if you took a the mass of the

479
00:31:17.121 --> 00:31:20.150
earth and mass of the moon,
I'm the apple and divided by the radius,

480
00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:24.080
you will get a number that won't agree with the force of gravity near the earth

481
00:31:24.081 --> 00:31:28.570
as we know it.
So the point is when the function is proportionate,

482
00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.290
all these things that is always a proportionality constant and the constants,

483
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.280
one of the purposes of the constant is to make the dimensions commode,
right?

484
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.970
Others to make the values come out right.

485
00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:43.190
Cause I got to make sure that veneer play it to an apple near the earth.

486
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:48.380
I put the mass of the apple,
let's say divide by the apple,
this whole thing,

487
00:31:48.381 --> 00:31:49.430
what should it be equal to?

488
00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.720
It's got to be 9.8 do you understand that the acceleration of the apple near the

489
00:31:55.971 --> 00:32:00.500
earth has to be 9.8 if I put the radius of the earth you,

490
00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:04.880
it's better be 9.8
so you pick a number of GE,

491
00:32:04.881 --> 00:32:09.881
which is some number six times 10 to the minus 11 and the unit four g are some

492
00:32:11.601 --> 00:32:13.250
number times,
uh,

493
00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:18.140
Newton meters square or kilogram square.

494
00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.960
That'll make the units come out right?
So that's called the big g.

495
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.520
That's the gravity.
This is alive.

496
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.960
Universal is a universal gravitational constant am almost ready to write down.

497
00:32:31.461 --> 00:32:34.130
Now the great Newtonian law,

498
00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.700
Great Newtonian law says F is equal to m m over r squared.

499
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.210
But these are two objects,
have mass,
little lemon,

500
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:50.840
big began at a distance are from each other,
but it's not yet the vector.

501
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:55.510
This is just a number.
So I want to say that if this is one masters,

502
00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.480
here's the other mass.

503
00:32:56.481 --> 00:33:00.080
I want to say this one feels safe force towards the center.

504
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.790
So let me take the earth to be the center here.
I want the force on the moon.

505
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.400
I want to vector pointing towards the center,

506
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:11.600
so I know one vector that's pointing away from the second vector which is the

507
00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:12.770
position vector R,

508
00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.770
but if I divide that by the length of the position vector are,

509
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:23.480
I think all of you know in a factors to understand this vector has linked one

510
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:26.390
and points away from the center,

511
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.340
but I wanted to be pointing towards the center and that is then

512
00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:37.520
the force of gravity on the moon or on the APP or any object.

513
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.460
If I'm thinking of one fixed object like the earth,
this the force on the apple.

514
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.370
If you think of two objects of comparable size,

515
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.980
you will have to say the forest on one do or the other.
Okay,
but new right,

516
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.823
the formula.

517
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.980
Then you got to make sure that the force one one is pointing to the other one

518
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:57.020
and force on that guy is pointing towards the sky,

519
00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.680
so that is no universal symbol for all those things.

520
00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:03.980
I will write it in the simple case where we imagine that the center,

521
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:08.270
some massive object like the sun and something tiny going around it.

522
00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:11.150
Then the center of coordinators has chosen to be at the center of the massive

523
00:34:11.151 --> 00:34:13.220
object.
This is the forest on the little guy.

524
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:16.220
This is the law of gravity.

525
00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:21.440
It's called the law of universal gravitation because it's really a universal,

526
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.090
you've got to realize that was a tremendous leap of faith to believe that the

527
00:34:26.091 --> 00:34:30.850
laws that are operative near the surface of the earth also apply to the moon and

528
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:35.720
also apply to the planets.
This was the year of 6,100 and something,

529
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:38.720
you know,
that was witchcraft and people at all kinds of superstitions.

530
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.630
People are not even thinking in scientific ways that a lot of illusions about

531
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:46.580
what they haven't sort of made off to believe that made up of similar stuff and

532
00:34:46.581 --> 00:34:49.490
controlled by the same laws.
That's very obvious now,

533
00:34:49.491 --> 00:34:51.800
but it was very far from obvious in those days.

534
00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:56.750
It's a tremendous leap of faith and luckily for us that leap of faith is

535
00:34:56.751 --> 00:34:58.820
justified because the laws of gravitation,

536
00:34:58.821 --> 00:35:03.710
in fact the laws of physics that we did use near the earth seem to work all over

537
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:04.700
the entire universe.

538
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:09.020
If you've seen pictures and Nova where we are in the scheme of things,

539
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.400
we are in a very tiny part,

540
00:35:10.401 --> 00:35:14.810
the universe sampling a tiny volume over the tiny period of time.

541
00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.280
But we apply those equations to the far end of the galaxy,

542
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:23.530
the far end of the universe and going all the way back to big bank

543
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.200
and be predict the future fate of the universe.

544
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:32.200
So we assumed that the laws that we discover here now or ballot everywhere and

545
00:35:32.901 --> 00:35:36.800
at all times so far that seems to be true and that's the big break for us.

546
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:40.320
But for that you really couldn't do anything if the last year discovered today

547
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:42.630
are not valid tomorrow you cannot make any predictions.

548
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:48.030
So it's another unwritten benefit we got.

549
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:51.440
I mean an unspoken offers a great benefit that the loss you find are universal,

550
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.590
but somebody had to stay,
you know,
stick his neck out and say it.

551
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.130
This is one of the first occasions.

552
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:01.300
So now you're going to apply this law to understand what Kepler did.

553
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.200
Okay,
so what do you have to do to do what capital did?

554
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:10.330
So we are going to consider the motion of a planet.
I don't the sun.

555
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:14.220
Let's put the sign here.
That's what the planet here,

556
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.470
the planets at their location are.

557
00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.280
You go back as usual to the only equation in town.
Hey,

558
00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.960
f equals m a no.

559
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:29.440
F I told you has to be deduced every time,

560
00:36:29.441 --> 00:36:34.441
but painstaking experimental data without that ethical time is useless.

561
00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:38.710
If you don't know what's on the lefthand side independently,
let me repeat again.

562
00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:43.410
You don't say the force on the body is Amy forcing the body's dude with spraying

563
00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.810
due to gravity.
Do the charges,
whatever.
You have to do some work to find this.

564
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.490
Then you put it into that equation,

565
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.420
but let's put in here the right hand side of Newton's life can be written once

566
00:36:52.421 --> 00:36:54.580
and for all.
The two are.

567
00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:59.230
Now I'm writing d to auto with Dt square because I'm living in two dimensions.

568
00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.900
Now on the left hand side I have this new result,

569
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.950
g m m four what?
R squared times.

570
00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:08.860
I'm going to use a symbol of our hat,

571
00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.920
which is very common or anything with a hat on it.

572
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.350
It's the set of unit length pointing in the direction of the regular vector are.

573
00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:17.823
So if you want,

574
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.800
if art is the position vector of an object whose length is our our head as a

575
00:37:23.951 --> 00:37:24.784
little guy

576
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.560
who's length this one and with the points in the radial direction,

577
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.540
so this is your equation.

578
00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.560
Then a problem in calculus to solve the equation and everything Kepler said

579
00:37:38.561 --> 00:37:39.400
should come out of that.

580
00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:43.480
You should find planets like the moving elliptical orbits.

581
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.660
You should find the area swept out as a constant.

582
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:50.270
Did you find a square of the time period is proportional?
The Cuba,

583
00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.990
the Arbid sites?
No.

584
00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:57.110
If I give this to us and the homework problem in the class,

585
00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.660
I dare say it will be very difficult for most of you.

586
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.880
I don't know what kind of background do you had?

587
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.370
You have done some calculus but it's not easy,

588
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:08.540
but remarkably Newton also solve this problem.

589
00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.970
Even now when I teach in physics 400 and something for advanced mechanics,

590
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:18.590
it takes a while to know how to solve this equation is one thing to write it

591
00:38:18.591 --> 00:38:21.650
down.
Other thing to actually solve it and get the hell out of it.

592
00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:27.120
So Newton did that too,
so it's really amazing.

593
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.560
That's why he's such a giant.

594
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.750
You have to step back to that period in time and ask what did the one person

595
00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:35.350
accomplish over the period of board five years?

596
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:41.320
So that was how physics has always done.
Somebody looks at the data,

597
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:46.240
sometimes summarizes the data in the form of certain phenomenal logical facts

598
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:50.410
like the laws of Kepler that somebody else has to like a theoretical person has

599
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:54.580
to figure out what does the underlying rules of this game right to the

600
00:38:54.581 --> 00:38:57.670
mathematical form and solve the mathematics and Betty fight.

601
00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.260
Just imagine that you wrote this equation but you couldn't solve it.

602
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.550
What you'd be saying would actually be correct you.
In fact,

603
00:39:07.551 --> 00:39:08.990
I found the correct law of gravity,

604
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:12.460
but you can never be sure it's right because you cannot find the consequences of

605
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.800
your equation.
That is not unheard of.

606
00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:20.240
That's happening in physics today,
for example.
That is the theory of quarks.

607
00:39:20.241 --> 00:39:24.560
The quarks are attracted each other by a certain mechanism.
We know,

608
00:39:24.561 --> 00:39:28.430
we know the underlying force law and from that we are supposed to find the

609
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:32.360
understand the existence of all particles like protons and neutrons and so on.

610
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.680
We do not yet have a way to show without any doubt that the underlying equations

611
00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:44.000
imply the phenomenon that we see when we applied it to the problem of quirks,

612
00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.990
but putting it on a big computer,
we have fairly certain that's correct.

613
00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.020
That would be like solving Newton's laws on a computer,

614
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:54.380
but what Newton did was done solid on the computer,
but solve it analytically.

615
00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:59.090
So quite often in the past,
whenever the theory is accepted,

616
00:39:59.091 --> 00:40:02.270
it's because the consequences can be worked out and compared experiment.

617
00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:05.870
But you could be in a position where you have the right theory in the right

618
00:40:05.871 --> 00:40:10.370
equations,
but you cannot solve them anyway.
This one happens to be solvable.

619
00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:15.800
If I change the forest lot to one over art at the 2.1 then it's a different

620
00:40:15.801 --> 00:40:16.634
story.

621
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.080
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

622
00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.220
<v 0>Anyway,
so we want to solve it,
but we cannot do the ellipse.
Okay.
It's too hard.</v>

623
00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.620
So we're going to do the circle.

624
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:29.440
We're going to take arbit to be circular and we're going to apply this force a

625
00:40:29.441 --> 00:40:32.780
lot of that and see what we can get.
So let's do that.

626
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:37.100
We can ask ourselves,
can have planets have a circular orbit

627
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.500
of radius?
Are

628
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.570
we go back to f equals m a and now you guys had expert on the right hand side.

629
00:40:44.571 --> 00:40:48.680
Now we are assuming the planet moves around the circle.

630
00:40:48.681 --> 00:40:53.681
That constant velocity at constant speed we want to ask can set an orbit exist.

631
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:58.460
You're always allowed in any equation to make an assumption and plug it in and

632
00:40:58.461 --> 00:41:01.730
see if it works.
If the left hand side and the right hand side,
Matt,
you win.

633
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:04.070
Nobody will ask you any more questions.

634
00:41:04.071 --> 00:41:07.610
So we are asking for a modest goal.

635
00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.320
Can I find an orbit of a planet going around at constant speed around the sun on

636
00:41:12.321 --> 00:41:16.400
a circle?
Let the constant speed BV than MMA.

637
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.400
Everyone seems to know is MV squared over R

638
00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.970
and is pointing towards the center.

639
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.870
That's we should be equal at the force pointing towards the center.

640
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:32.150
And Newton has told us what the forces at g m m over r square.

641
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.120
Everybody understand.
Now the left hand side is the effect.

642
00:41:41.121 --> 00:41:45.800
The right hand side is a cause.
If for spending a rock spinning it on a circle,

643
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:47.930
that also is an acceleration toward the center,

644
00:41:47.931 --> 00:41:51.170
but the string is providing the force and you can work out the force of the

645
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.940
spring of the string here.

646
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:57.320
It's the unseen force of gravity from the sun reaching or the planet and pulling

647
00:41:57.321 --> 00:41:59.870
it in.
Newton tells you the formula,

648
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:05.360
the dues from Ted Estriol and lunar observations now applied to planets.

649
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:11.370
Okay,
so this is something that should make you very happy because this is a very

650
00:42:11.371 --> 00:42:15.640
simple application of ethicals handmade,
but you're describing planetary motion.

651
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:20.840
So these are all masters of big guys,
the earth and the sun.

652
00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.830
So let's cancel the R and I get canceled.
The mass.

653
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:26.780
That's very interesting.

654
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:32.040
So that says v square are equal to GM.

655
00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:34.580
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

656
00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.640
<v 0>it says,
yes,
you can have a circular orbit.
Okay.</v>

657
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:41.600
Any radius you like provided you move at the speed,

658
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.430
satisfying this equation.

659
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.300
And as long as you satisfy the equation,

660
00:42:47.301 --> 00:42:50.720
I don't care if the thing that's spinning is a satellite or a potato because the

661
00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:52.060
mass of the object drops out.

662
00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.960
So the condition for orbit is independent of the object orbiting again,

663
00:42:56.961 --> 00:43:01.610
due to this cancellation of the mass in both sides.
All right,

664
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:05.570
so this is all we can get out of Newton's laws.
And let's go back to the Kepler.

665
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.210
Is the orbit possible?
Well,

666
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:12.140
if you say an ellipse circle as a special case of the LMC of shown circular

667
00:43:12.141 --> 00:43:15.920
orbits are possible,
how about equal areas in equal time?

668
00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:20.300
It's obviously true in this problem because it's going at constant speed.

669
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:24.350
If it goes that far in one week and go that far in one week and everyone can

670
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:26.390
tell the area swept all this constantly.

671
00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.250
So the only thing left to knock off as a third assumption,

672
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.280
the third observation of Kepler involving the time period.

673
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:36.800
So I do the simplest thing.

674
00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:41.300
I said the velocity of this planet is to buy our divided by the time period.

675
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:47.020
I put that in here and I get four Pi r squared,

676
00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:52.240
r cubed over t square is GM or I find art cubed over t square is equal to

677
00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:00.200
eliminate a t squared over r Q because that's how capital wrote it.

678
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:06.940
This says t square divided by r cubed is equal to four Pi square over GM.

679
00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.510
So that's another result you got right away.

680
00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.810
That's the third result that the time period ended.

681
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:24.520
The orbital radius here is what the Newton do.

682
00:44:24.521 --> 00:44:26.470
That's went further than Kepler.

683
00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.880
Can you tell me what he did that's really beyond heavy,

684
00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.400
just verified Kepler's laws.
I'd be gone a little beyond that.

685
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:35.843
Yup,

686
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.680
exactly right.
Let me repeat what he said.
Kepler said t square a cube.

687
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.860
This the same thing,
but he didn't tell you what the same thing is.

688
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:52.260
What does the constant,

689
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:57.410
well now we know that constant to be for dawn to Oliver's Pi on two Oliver's m

690
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:04.310
massive earth and g and mass of the sun and g is the universal constant of

691
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:07.710
gravitation.
So you calculate the value.

692
00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.320
Similar thing happen in atomic physics.
Uh,

693
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.920
a high school teacher called bomber was studying the spectral lines coming out

694
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:21.240
of an atom and they were coming out at different frequencies and he said all the

695
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:24.040
frequencies you'll ever see coming out of an atom local,

696
00:45:24.041 --> 00:45:28.380
like some number times one over one into their square times,

697
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:33.390
one over different integer square.
He didn't know what the number was,

698
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:35.220
but it's some constant,
I mean,
he knew the number,

699
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:38.040
but he didn't know he knew the number,
but he didn't know where it came from.

700
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:42.690
And Board had this final theory of the atom.
It had the exactly this form,

701
00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.291
but this,

702
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:46.770
we're just not simply a constant and you put ended involved pie and the electric

703
00:45:46.771 --> 00:45:48.390
charge and the Planck's constant everything.

704
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.260
So bomber did four bore what Capitol did for Newton.

705
00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.670
It's the condense a complicated data into some simple forms so that the

706
00:45:56.671 --> 00:45:59.940
theorists can have a go at it.
Then once you got the right answer,

707
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.850
it's really beautiful how everything fits.
So we know this is right.

708
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.420
Okay.
This is called a theory.

709
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.500
By the time physicists will call something a theory there,

710
00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:12.320
pull it to a lot of tests.
Okay.

711
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:17.330
It's not to be casually used and you have the right theory.

712
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:21.060
You can make a lot of predictions.
You can have a theory.

713
00:46:21.061 --> 00:46:24.720
The planners go around the sun because some angels are flapping their wings and

714
00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:26.040
I say,
where are the angels?
You say,
well,

715
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:28.830
part of the theory is you don't see them.
So very good.

716
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:32.760
What's your next prediction?
Tell me when the next eclipses.

717
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.150
Tell me if the meat you're headed for earth is going to hit or miss.

718
00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.780
Is this comment going to reappear or is it a one sharp thing?

719
00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.810
If you cannot answer any of that,
you don't have a theory.

720
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.340
You have an interpretation of past data that coincides with past data that's

721
00:46:47.341 --> 00:46:51.570
worth nothing.
Okay,
so here's an example of how to do it right.

722
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.910
Okay,
so

723
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:59.640
this thing has got enormous power.

724
00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:04.770
It tells you if you find another planet,
you find a new planet tomorrow.

725
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:10.170
If you know how far it is,
I'll tell you what a year is in the planet.

726
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.830
I'll tell you how long the planet takes to go around the sun because t squared

727
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:18.270
over r cubed is known to me.
So if that planted this at a certain distance,

728
00:47:18.271 --> 00:47:22.350
I can tell you the time period or if I see it going around the sun and I know

729
00:47:22.351 --> 00:47:26.790
it's going to complete the evolution in 240 years,
I can tell you how far it is.

730
00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:31.810
So that's another power of the,
okay,

731
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:32.733
so now

732
00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:39.100
you can do variety of problems using this formula.
They're all plugged in check,

733
00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:41.890
but I'll just mentioned one and most problems are like that.

734
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.160
Everything's going to be plugging into this formula.

735
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.270
But one interesting example is the following.
So here's the earth.

736
00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.910
I'm here and I wanted to watch a tennis game being played there.

737
00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.500
I have radio waves,
but you know,
radio waves cannot go through the earth.

738
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.720
They can only travel in straight lines.
And the answer to that,

739
00:48:02.721 --> 00:48:06.170
but I think all of you know,
is to have a bunch of satellites,
uh,

740
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.950
three of them in particular forming a nice triangle.

741
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:13.780
And if you can talk to this satellite from where you are,

742
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:18.430
that satellite with the help of the other two can always at any other points you

743
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:21.340
want this bit bouncing off.
Okay.
You bounce off this,

744
00:48:21.341 --> 00:48:22.870
you can go there and you can hit this guy.

745
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:26.560
So if you have three satellites,

746
00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.180
they can help you connect any point on the earth to any other point by

747
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.580
reflecting off the satellites.

748
00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.120
But the important thing is the satellites better be where do you think they are?

749
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:40.210
They're constantly moving it on.
It doesn't work.

750
00:48:40.211 --> 00:48:43.600
So what do you really want is what's called geosynchronous satellites.

751
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:48.250
The satellites.
Remember if I look at the earth from the top,
it is spinning.

752
00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.110
This is the North Pole and you're spinning.

753
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.240
Therefore these satellites should be rotating around the earth once every 24

754
00:48:55.241 --> 00:48:57.760
hours.
Then if they're on top of your head today,

755
00:48:57.761 --> 00:49:02.410
there'll be on your top of your head all the time,
right?

756
00:49:02.411 --> 00:49:05.020
So the time period of the satellite as 24 hours,

757
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:09.460
then the only question is at what altitude should I launch them?

758
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.440
You go to this formula,
put in 24 hours,
right it in seconds,

759
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.700
you will get the radius.
And once you got the radius,

760
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:22.810
this equation will tell you at what velocity they should be put into orbit.

761
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:26.770
That's it.
That's how you put the geosynchronous satellite.

762
00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:31.060
That's a simple example of applying the formula.
I won't give other examples,

763
00:49:31.061 --> 00:49:34.780
but they're always going to be finding t from mater.
Finding our from tea.

764
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:39.340
Sometimes you'll know are sometimes you will not take

765
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.080
any question about this.
Okay,

766
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.210
now I'm going to come to the question of energy.

767
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:56.230
I never do.
You have a new forest.

768
00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.590
You can talk about the law of conservation of energy.
So I want to ask myself,

769
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:03.860
what's the potential energy I can associate with the gravitational force?

770
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:06.740
I can ask myself,
is it even a conservative force?

771
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:12.560
So let's take the problem in two stages.
First of all,
if you're near the earth,

772
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:18.560
everything falls down near the earth.
If that height is y,

773
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:24.130
then the force of gravity is minus m g with Jay,

774
00:50:25.401 --> 00:50:29.750
but Jay's unit veteran,
that direction,
the potential energy is then AMG.
Why?

775
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.950
And everybody can check that.
You could take the minus the white Ditto to this.

776
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:34.784
You get the force.

777
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:38.510
That's the potential energy and therefore when a body's falling in near the

778
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:39.380
surface of the earth,

779
00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:45.230
we may assert that one half Mv Square plus m g,

780
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.260
let me call it height instead of y.

781
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.230
Let me call this coordinate eight instead of white.

782
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:55.670
I don't think it matters too much.
That is the total energy.
That is a constant.

783
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.820
We applied at the other day,
the roller coaster's going up and down,

784
00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:05.270
speeding up and slowing down.
It's just that this number will not change.

785
00:51:05.271 --> 00:51:08.180
That's the roller coaster changes.
The height,
the speed must change.

786
00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:09.460
Keeping this number constantly.

787
00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.940
What do you know this formula is an approximation near the earth.

788
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.240
Be One.
Apply it globally

789
00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.100
before going the global problem.
Let me remember one more thing.

790
00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:28.990
That g is equal to g m over r e square

791
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:35.340
because when you apply Newton's law to the surface of the earth,

792
00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.900
you better get this number g when you apply it to something near the year.

793
00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.640
By the way,
Newton took a long time to publish this law of gravitation.

794
00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.350
Does anybody know why he was holding back for a long time?

795
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:51.990
Have you heard of anything?
Yes.

796
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.900
<v 1>Um,
was uh,</v>

797
00:51:55.050 --> 00:52:00.050
in the controversy over the discovery of the calculus with lightness and then I

798
00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:02.970
convinced them later on,

799
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:05.780
<v 0>uh,
Edmund Halley may have convinced him to publish,</v>

800
00:52:05.781 --> 00:52:10.160
but it was something else that is bothering Newton.
Yes.

801
00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.093
<v 1>Here's a free,</v>

802
00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.830
<v 0>he is afraid of criticism.
Uh,
maybe,</v>

803
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:20.250
but that was not why he held back.
Yes,
very much.

804
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:22.010
Pardon me.
I'll sit down.

805
00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:23.740
<v 1>Good,
great.
Awesome.</v>

806
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.630
<v 0>No,
but look,
many applied it by the way he applied it to everything.</v>

807
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.230
So let's steal motion.
The behavior of tides.
Everything seemed to work.

808
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.930
That is one further assumption that you make.

809
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.230
When I wrote the one over our East Square,

810
00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.310
I said the distance of the APP and from the earth is that,

811
00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:45.330
and maybe it should be just the two meters from which they release it.

812
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:49.800
Somehow he knew you have to measure the distance from the center of the earth.

813
00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:56.010
So it is not clear for the purposes of gravitation.

814
00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:57.961
Another words.

815
00:52:57.961 --> 00:53:01.890
Originally Newton had a law of gravitation between two point objects,

816
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.670
namely the point like the distance between them and ambiguously the distance

817
00:53:05.671 --> 00:53:07.980
between the points and he got this law,

818
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:13.620
but in the end he wants to apply it to the earth and the apple,

819
00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.000
they are close enough for you.

820
00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:18.150
You cannot pretend the earth look like a point from where I am.

821
00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:20.970
It looked like a big fat thing.
You cannot say it's point like,

822
00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.530
so what you really should do is buy there to the tiny pieces each of at this

823
00:53:25.531 --> 00:53:26.880
point like pine,

824
00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:31.881
the force on each from each chunk of the earth using this law and added up.

825
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.170
And if you're lucky,

826
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:38.610
it will look as if all the pull is coming from one point at the center carrying

827
00:53:38.611 --> 00:53:39.600
the Untied Massive Year.

828
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:44.940
So what branch of mathematics do you have to use to get that result?

829
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.823
Yes.

830
00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:48.293
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

831
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.080
<v 0>Uh,
what branch of mathematics?</v>

832
00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:57.590
What can calculus calculators had it been invented?
No.

833
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:01.280
So he had to then invent integral calculus also.

834
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.150
So you know if he felt that no one around him was doing any work,

835
00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.860
probably justified because they just dumped the whole thing on his kid and said,

836
00:54:09.861 --> 00:54:10.850
why don't you do integrity?

837
00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:15.440
That's why it took him a long time to verify using integros that the fear

838
00:54:15.441 --> 00:54:17.930
behaves like a point particle at the center.

839
00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.740
He knew it works because all these numbers couldn't be on.

840
00:54:21.741 --> 00:54:24.050
The coincidences are not coincidence.
He believed it worked,

841
00:54:24.051 --> 00:54:28.460
but he had not found a way to show it.
That's what held back publication.

842
00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.640
Okay.
That's another rare behavior.
Okay.
Anyway,

843
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:36.170
I come to this problem and I say I want a plate not near the earth,

844
00:54:36.171 --> 00:54:40.810
but arbitrarily far
near the earth,
the forces minus mg,

845
00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.550
but far from the earth,
many,
many miles away.

846
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:48.970
The forest is really what we wrote here is minus G M M over R squared times r

847
00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.060
unit vector in the radial direction.

848
00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:59.520
First thing you can check is that this is actually a conservative force.

849
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:04.230
I'm going to give this to you.
I don't have time to do that.
In other words,

850
00:55:04.231 --> 00:55:06.870
write this capital r hat if you like.

851
00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:10.680
What's an r divided by one more out in the bottom you don't care.

852
00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:14.550
And that can be written as minus g m m

853
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:17.100
times.

854
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:22.100
I times x over r cubed plus j times wire would argued,

855
00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:29.190
right.
I just wrote the vector art in terms of x and y.

856
00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:32.830
So the x component of this force is x over our cube.

857
00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:36.710
The why is why you would argue artists just square root of x squared plus Weist

858
00:55:36.711 --> 00:55:37.544
with,

859
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:39.620
<v 2>yeah,</v>

860
00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:42.800
<v 0>so maybe you can tell me what should I do to check to this?
A conservative force</v>

861
00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:53.620
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

862
00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.780
<v 0>yes,
I will repeat what he said.
That's the correct answer.</v>

863
00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:59.180
I mistake the x component of this.

864
00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:03.880
Take the white parts a little bit to the white component of this digging x

865
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:04.670
partial derivatives.

866
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:08.360
You guys should do that when you take the date of it to have something like one

867
00:56:08.361 --> 00:56:09.194
over r cubed,

868
00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:14.220
you should first take the art data to of r cubed and then take the x derivative

869
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:16.520
of art.
The way using the chain rule of calculus,

870
00:56:16.521 --> 00:56:19.370
you will find the to agree so we know it's conservative.

871
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:21.100
That's the power of the rezone.

872
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:25.660
All you have to do is guess potential could have led to this force.

873
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:31.480
So I say,
okay,
let's put the sun here.
Let me move along the x axis.

874
00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:35.380
The force along the x axis look like mine is g,

875
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.450
m m o what?
X squared,

876
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:41.560
because x is just are you feel moving in this direction the other direction?

877
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:43.900
That's our,
but let me just move along the aesthetics.

878
00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:48.940
I asked myself what function has the property that minus the did it,

879
00:56:48.941 --> 00:56:53.560
but to have that with respect to x,
looks like this.
That's,
that's a Mickey mouse.

880
00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:58.370
Countless problem.
It just minus one over the X.
Okay,
they do.
I do.

881
00:56:58.371 --> 00:57:01.000
A minus one over x is minus one over x squared.

882
00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:07.030
That photo exes are in general,
the you that you want for gravitation,

883
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:08.760
<v 2>it looks like this.</v>

884
00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:18.220
<v 0>So gravitational potential energy for problems arbitrarily far from the center</v>

885
00:57:18.771 --> 00:57:21.340
of this mass.
Not near just the surface of the earth,

886
00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:24.770
but wherever you go in any gravitation problem,
this is you.

887
00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:28.620
<v 2>Okay?</v>

888
00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:32.040
<v 0>You can check that if you took this you,
that's what I'm telling you guys to do.</v>

889
00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:33.810
If you really care that I missed something

890
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:37.740
<v 2>that'd be positive.
No.</v>

891
00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:44.220
<v 0>Let's see if you took the art a little bit about this one or what artists are</v>

892
00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:49.690
the minus one bit of battle,
Make It plus one over r square.

893
00:57:50.850 --> 00:57:53.190
What do you really supposed to take?
Minus they did have it,

894
00:57:53.191 --> 00:57:55.600
two of you and that it be the right thing.

895
00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.220
So this is the potential energy.
This will be negative.

896
00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:02.480
<v 2>Okay,</v>

897
00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.490
<v 0>so what I'm a claiming,</v>

898
00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:08.120
I'm claiming that if you've got the sun and you got some other planet moving

899
00:58:08.121 --> 00:58:11.060
around it,
the fallen quantity will not change.

900
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:16.210
Which this one half MV squared minus G M M over R is a constant.

901
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.273
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

902
00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:33.010
<v 0>No,
take an object moving near the earth.
I gave you a different rule.</v>

903
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:34.510
I said near the earth.

904
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:41.430
Why did I say the rule was the constant is one half Mv Square let's MGH

905
00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:47.050
can,
are they going to do looks right?
Potential energy looks really wrong.

906
00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.680
That seems to be two definitions of potential energy.

907
00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:52.840
They don't even agree in sign.

908
00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:59.380
So what's going on?
What's the way out of this

909
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:03.310
problem?
I mean,
do you have any idea?

910
00:59:03.850 --> 00:59:04.990
<v 2>That's good.
Can you buy it?</v>

911
00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:12.530
<v 0>Uh,
big g.
You mean our little g little g by the problem.
Oh,</v>

912
00:59:12.531 --> 00:59:15.590
that's not a bad idea.
Suppose I do that.
That's a very good idea.

913
00:59:15.591 --> 00:59:16.490
So let me write that.

914
00:59:16.491 --> 00:59:20.650
A G M m over r e squared.

915
00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:24.950
Time's sakes.
That's a good plan.

916
00:59:24.951 --> 00:59:29.900
But do you notice this cannot possibly equal that because that's negative,
right?

917
00:59:30.350 --> 00:59:31.183
This is positive.

918
00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:37.500
Any way to reconcile this?
Yes.

919
00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:41.930
<v 1>Well,
differences because the first one is for different values of force,</v>

920
00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:43.340
while the second one is assuming

921
00:59:43.930 --> 00:59:47.080
<v 0>constantly.
I agree,
but no one doesn't.</v>

922
00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:50.770
The Cotsen the certainly it's true that near the earth we treat it as a
constant.

923
00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:55.540
But if at the formula balance for every distance and I specialize it to the

924
00:59:55.541 --> 00:59:59.950
problem near the earth,
it's gotta agree with the problem near the earth.
Right?

925
01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:03.100
The bigger formula should embrace our enclosed a smaller formula

926
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:09.613
<v 1>equal.</v>

927
01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:14.880
<v 0>Yeah,
I will do that.
In other words,
I grant you,
I'm willing to put Ari he here.</v>

928
01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:16.493
Right?

929
01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:20.100
But that is no way this expression and this can match because they're not even

930
01:00:20.101 --> 01:00:22.350
have the right side.
You don't even have to think more than that.

931
01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.700
They cannot be great as they are.
Yes.

932
01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.200
<v 1>Maybe kind of explain agent</v>

933
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.830
<v 0>no.
Eight is the number of meters above the ground.
You put the number in.</v>

934
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:38.330
Look,

935
01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:42.770
most of your escape routes don't work because you're trying to get a positive

936
01:00:42.771 --> 01:00:44.330
number two equal a negative number.

937
01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.890
Yes.
Thank you.

938
01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:56.910
I didn't know I was going home for lunch because I was not going to proceed

939
01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.800
because I got the right answer.
The right answer is when you define a potential,

940
01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:06.480
there is a freedom to add a constant to the definition of the potential.

941
01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:07.950
You can look at every theater.

942
01:01:07.951 --> 01:01:10.800
I'm everything I derived including the stuff I hidden under the board.

943
01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.600
You want minus youtube is what enters everywhere.
The change in Kennedy,

944
01:01:14.601 --> 01:01:17.640
Kennedy is you want minus youtube.
Therefore,

945
01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:23.520
one has a freedom in defining the potential to add a constant and what has

946
01:01:23.521 --> 01:01:27.780
happened is the person working with this potential and the person working with

947
01:01:27.781 --> 01:01:32.070
this potential have not taken the same reference point.

948
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:37.170
This person working near the Earth said,
let me choose for convenience.

949
01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:41.850
The potential at height equals zero to be zero because that's a natural point

950
01:01:41.851 --> 01:01:46.780
for me.
What about this person here?
Yup.

951
01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:52.830
He's saying potential is zero at infinity because when you're doing celestial

952
01:01:52.831 --> 01:01:56.070
mechanics here,
there's one object,
other objects of various distances.

953
01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:59.070
Infinities rather interesting point.
You go infinitely far from it,

954
01:01:59.071 --> 01:02:02.740
no potential energy.
So there are two of them differ by a constant.

955
01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:08.010
That's the reason why and the constant can easily overturn a quantity that is

956
01:02:08.011 --> 01:02:10.380
negative and bring it up to positive values.

957
01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.300
So except for that constant,
once they add a certain constant,

958
01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.560
everything should work out.
So I will show you that it does.
Okay.

959
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:24.810
Then everything will be fine.
Maybe there are two ways to do it.

960
01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:27.990
I'm in two minds on how to show the two ways.
I'll try one method.

961
01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:34.860
Let's take the answer that's valid for all distances,
right?

962
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:36.540
That's the seller still formula.

963
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.440
Forget all the constants it looks like minus one over r.

964
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:44.310
You agree some blahblahblah constant divided by R,

965
01:02:44.311 --> 01:02:48.360
so it's a graph that looks like this.
It blows up to minus infinity,

966
01:02:48.361 --> 01:02:52.020
even Argos to zero and it goes to zero when our ghost infinity.

967
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:58.440
This is the formula for you,
for the person who saves you a zero and infinity.

968
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:03.780
Now let's look at the formula in the neighborhood off the surface of the earth.

969
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.050
Here is where we are most of the time.

970
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:09.583
<v 2>Okay,</v>

971
01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.040
<v 0>so if I shift my zero to here,</v>

972
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:18.680
<v 2>okay,</v>

973
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:23.450
<v 0>then by design I made you to be a zero on the surface of the earth that let me</v>

974
01:03:23.451 --> 01:03:27.200
also measure the new coordinate this way called h,

975
01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:31.880
which is the radial distance away from the Ari.
This is Ari,

976
01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.740
this odd d plus h.
Then I blow up this box.

977
01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.330
What do you find?
I blow up the box with my newly shifted origin,

978
01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:45.740
hit his age.
And here is the potential energy looking like a straight line.

979
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:51.810
And if you're lucky,
the slope of this rate line should be what?

980
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.640
What should it be?
The slope.
So we can reconcile everything.

981
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:03.680
If a function is a straight line,
it has a certain slope.

982
01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:07.190
What's the wave coordinator?
Slope Times the x coordinate.
Yes.

983
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:11.510
Not g yes mg.

984
01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.650
If it's AMG you for,
that's a slow MD.

985
01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.500
At times h would be the function you're drawing.
Right?

986
01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:19.760
So that's all I have to show you.

987
01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.120
And I will show that that's what happens then we're set.

988
01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:27.140
So let's take the master formula for the potential energy.

989
01:04:27.141 --> 01:04:31.580
Right at g m m this applied to a distance

990
01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.750
near the earth.
It's our plus h.

991
01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.180
That's what we're trying to do right now.

992
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.530
So he must side that expression as mine.

993
01:04:44.531 --> 01:04:47.920
His g m m over R,

994
01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:50.650
<v 2>yeah.</v>

995
01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:52.640
<v 0>Times one plus h over our</v>

996
01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:59.530
that it just in the writing of this,
and you can write that.

997
01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:03.490
I'm sorry.
Uh,
apologize.
Do you know what's wrong with what I wrote?

998
01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:06.640
This is not our plus h.
What should I be really putting here?

999
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:09.010
Radius of the earth,

1000
01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:11.320
so I don't know how you're going to connect it in your notes,

1001
01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:14.980
but this really should be radius of the earth everywhere.

1002
01:05:14.981 --> 01:05:18.310
Here I want to be at a height eight about the radius of the year,

1003
01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:19.780
so I put that here.

1004
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:26.250
Then I write this as minus G M and a over the radius of the earth times one plus

1005
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.710
h over radius of the earth.
The power minus one.

1006
01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:39.900
I just bring the downstairs or the upstairs.

1007
01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.140
Then remember the wonderful Formula I told you,

1008
01:05:43.141 --> 01:05:45.390
you guys have to know this one plus extra,
the end.

1009
01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:48.510
It's approximately one plus annex.

1010
01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:52.470
If x is very small x's here,
the height over the radius of the earth,

1011
01:05:52.471 --> 01:05:53.670
which is obviously a tiny,

1012
01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:59.120
so I can approximate that and I get you equal to minus g m m over R e times one

1013
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:11.240
plus g m m over r squared times eight.

1014
01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.193
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1015
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:21.900
<v 0>This is the potential energy at the surface of the earth.</v>

1016
01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.170
For a guy who thinks that zero to infinity,

1017
01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.200
this is the change in potential energy.
When you move a distance [inaudible].

1018
01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:34.790
Therefore,
if you calculate u of h minus,
you have zero,

1019
01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.740
you would cancel that term,

1020
01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:42.160
then you won't get the same answer as the person using this formula.

1021
01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:47.180
That's really important to understand how these two are saying the same thing

1022
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:52.100
that is best understood.
In terms of the graph that I've drawn for you,

1023
01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:56.060
you shift your origin to one place and you also shift the uh,

1024
01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.760
zero potential to one place.

1025
01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:04.350
Now for the circular orbit,
what's the energy?

1026
01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:11.980
It's one half MV squared minus G M M over R,

1027
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:20.580
but we know that one half Mv Square,
uh,

1028
01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:23.910
is v squared is equal to Mv Square.

1029
01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:28.260
It's a centrifugal force made the centripetal force that for you can write that

1030
01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:32.160
as g m m over r

1031
01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:35.880
minus G M M over r.

1032
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:40.950
You find the answers then minus the potential energy over to,

1033
01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.440
or I'm sorry,
[inaudible] over to r minus the kinetic energy.
In other words,

1034
01:07:46.441 --> 01:07:51.330
if you combine these two terms,
you get minus g m m over to our,

1035
01:07:55.590 --> 01:07:56.423
<v 2>okay?</v>

1036
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:58.440
<v 0>So for a particle in a circular orbit,</v>

1037
01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:03.630
the kinetic energy is exactly half the magnitude of the potential energy in the

1038
01:08:03.631 --> 01:08:04.710
total energy is negative.

1039
01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:12.150
Okay?
So I want to close with one very important results.

1040
01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:15.740
So whenever you see a celestial body,
here's the sun.

1041
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:19.940
You see some sellers steel thing moving around,
you can compute the total energy.

1042
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:24.350
The total energy is negative.

1043
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:29.480
That object is bound to go on orbiting the sun.
It can never escaped infinity.

1044
01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:33.090
The total energy is positive.
It has a,

1045
01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:37.010
it can go to infinity and zero is the borderline case.

1046
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.270
So why is it that the total energy is negative?

1047
01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:43.130
The body can never run off to infinity.

1048
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:47.730
Can anyone think of a contradiction?

1049
01:08:47.731 --> 01:08:52.050
You would have a body of negative energy founders sell foot infinity?
Yes.

1050
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:55.970
<v 2>I mean,
look,
people have to get energy to go to infinity,</v>

1051
01:08:58.290 --> 01:09:01.860
<v 0>not infinity partner sell energy.
Zero.
What about candidate candidate?</v>

1052
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:04.560
Some positive number,
right?

1053
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:08.010
But his initial energy was negative and you cannot change it.

1054
01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.650
So if you've got totally negative energy,

1055
01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.940
you cannot be found wandering around infinity because I'd infinity if you're

1056
01:09:14.941 --> 01:09:18.690
moving around,
you got positive candidate energy,
no potential energy,

1057
01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.960
and the energy was origin,
really negative.
You have no business being there.

1058
01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:25.710
So objects with negative energy will never escape.

1059
01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:29.190
So if you saw a comment you want them to,
if we'll come back again,

1060
01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:32.940
find the candidate plus potential.
If it's positive at one comeback,
but negative,

1061
01:09:32.941 --> 01:09:35.250
it's strapped.
That's the dividing line.

1062
01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:39.270
So if you're near the earth and he wanted to shoot something,

1063
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:42.780
you can pick it in any direction you want.
Supposed to start shooting them up.

1064
01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:46.170
They go to different heights and one day you don't want it to come back.

1065
01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:47.461
You can ask yourself,

1066
01:09:47.461 --> 01:09:51.750
how fast do they fight a gun so the bullet never comes back?
Well,

1067
01:09:51.751 --> 01:09:55.830
you should fight it so that it can go to infinity.
When it goes to infinity,

1068
01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:58.470
you want it just manage to get that.

1069
01:09:58.471 --> 01:10:01.500
It's going to go to in front of these staggered and fall down while it's got no

1070
01:10:01.501 --> 01:10:05.530
candidate and it didn't finity.
He's got no potential energy.
Infinity.
Therefore,

1071
01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:08.400
the stored energy should be zero.
Therefore,

1072
01:10:08.401 --> 01:10:13.230
what you should do at the surface of the earth,
you're one half Mv Square,

1073
01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:18.570
minor,
g.
M,
m.
O.
What on Earth should be zero?

1074
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:22.380
Are these two numbers should be equal or canceling the mass.

1075
01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:26.480
You'll find some formula,
which is v squared equal to g,
m,

1076
01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:29.360
two G,
m.
O,
r,
r.
E.

1077
01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:36.000
So depending on the mass of the earth and gravitational constant radius of the

1078
01:10:36.001 --> 01:10:39.180
earth,
you'll get a velocity that's called the escape velocity.

1079
01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:41.310
When something is fired with escape velocity,

1080
01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:45.660
it will just about make it infinity.
You want to be really short,

1081
01:10:45.661 --> 01:10:47.490
it doesn't come back and give it a little extra speed,

1082
01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:51.630
little less it'll Arbor the they just won't go away.

1083
01:10:53.410 --> 01:10:56.120
All right,
so I want you to think about,
uh,

1084
01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:01.100
what you've learned because if you can now go and read articles,
for example,

1085
01:11:01.101 --> 01:11:03.500
you heard about dark matter,
I'll just say one sentence about dot.

1086
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:06.080
Anybody heard about dark matter?
Okay.

1087
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:10.100
Most of the universe seems to be made out of stuff we cannot see.
Okay?
You,
me,

1088
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:12.470
we don't add up to anything very small percentage.

1089
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:15.540
How do people know that is dark matter?
You cannot see it,

1090
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:18.780
but do you know it's there?
How do you know it's there?

1091
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.980
You know it's there because our galaxy or any galaxy has got matter.

1092
01:11:22.981 --> 01:11:23.671
You see and matter,

1093
01:11:23.671 --> 01:11:28.671
you don't see the draw an orbit around the galaxy going all the way around the

1094
01:11:28.831 --> 01:11:32.130
galaxy.
You can treat the entire mass of sitting at the center.

1095
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.880
Then you can use your gravitational formula via square artists,

1096
01:11:35.881 --> 01:11:38.730
the enclosed mass.
If you go further out,

1097
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.020
you should find you're not enclosing any more mass because the mass is all what

1098
01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:43.854
you see.

1099
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:48.270
But what we find is as the orbit gets bigger than the galaxy be square are keeps

1100
01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:52.680
on increasing.
So the mass and close is increasing,
but you don't see that.

1101
01:11:52.681 --> 01:11:56.850
So we know that is mass,
which is not visible to visible observation,

1102
01:11:57.270 --> 01:12:02.270
but every galaxy galaxy seems to have this halo of dark matter that,

1103
01:12:02.501 --> 01:12:05.460
so we estimate the mass and it beats all the known mass.

1104
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:08.190
But you can do that using just this calculation.
