00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.770
right it appears which basically means
if something's in the upper right hand

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:11.780
if something's in the upper right hand
 

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.840
if something's in the upper right hand
corner it got very high reviews and a

an interesting project something in the
lower right-hand corner got a lot of

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320
lower right-hand corner got a lot of
 

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.830
lower right-hand corner got a lot of
reviews and they were all shitty so it's

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:20.840
reviews and they were all shitty so it's
 

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.830
reviews and they were all shitty so it's
a way to take a lot of material and

of this digital sanctuary that I

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:37.360
of this digital sanctuary that I
 

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.930
of this digital sanctuary that I
mentioned at the end would that maybe

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:39.940

for a walk in the sanctuary you can put
 

00:54:43.449 --> 00:54:45.420
for a walk in the sanctuary you can put
a leash around that rabbit but if the

so that's that's the approach i would
 

00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:57.329
so that's that's the approach i would
take toward that problem it's another

take toward that problem it's another

and then give you those evaluations and
 

01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:15.910
and then give you those evaluations and

more than me and I I don't know in my

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:35.210
more than me and I I don't know in my
 

01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:46.850
more than me and I I don't know in my
experience that that system has worked

01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860
 
 

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:51.840
