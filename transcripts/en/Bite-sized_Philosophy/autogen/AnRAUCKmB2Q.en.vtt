learn that is in rough-and-tumble play

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829
learn that is in rough-and-tumble play
 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.100

then you have to say look you know
 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.840
then you have to say look you know
that's you can't do that and it's like a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
that's you can't do that and it's like a
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.000
that's you can't do that and it's like a
dance in a sense you know when you're

wrestling with a little kid and you have
 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.570
wrestling with a little kid and you have
to let them win very frequently because

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
to let them win very frequently because
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.789

otherwise they don't they don't continue
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.320
otherwise they don't they don't continue
the game and you can tell that because

I mean you can throw them in the air and
 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.780
I mean you can throw them in the air and
catch them and they think that's just

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790
catch them and they think that's just
 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.609
catch them and they think that's just
great you know and but partly what

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
great you know and but partly what
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.080
great you know and but partly what
you're doing is you're extending their

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
you're doing is you're extending their
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.149
you're doing is you're extending their
body in all sorts of ways and getting

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
body in all sorts of ways and getting
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.789

them to learn in an embodied sense where

them to learn in an embodied sense where
 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.100
them to learn in an embodied sense where
the limits of that where their limits

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110
the limits of that where their limits
 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.539
the limits of that where their limits
are and where the limits of other people

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
are and where the limits of other people
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.520
are and where the limits of other people
are and that's embodied and children who

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
are and that's embodied and children who
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.230
are and that's embodied and children who
haven't have that man they're just so

awkward it's unbelievable you know they

they don't have an embodied sense of it
 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.679
they don't have an embodied sense of it
and they can't tell the difference

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
and they can't tell the difference
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.389
and they can't tell the difference
between what hurts them and what doesn't

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
between what hurts them and what doesn't
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.819

you know because often a young child if

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
you know because often a young child if
 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.289
you know because often a young child if
they're startled they'll start to cry

they're startled they'll start to cry
 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.389
they're startled they'll start to cry
and then you can say well you know that

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
and then you can say well you know that
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.859
and then you can say well you know that
didn't hurt and then they'll notice oh

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
didn't hurt and then they'll notice oh
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.240
didn't hurt and then they'll notice oh
yeah that didn't hurt and they'll stop

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
yeah that didn't hurt and they'll stop
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.749
yeah that didn't hurt and they'll stop
crying

but if they haven't had their limits

but if they haven't had their limits
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.060

tested they'll cry and anything

that's not good because if you cry under
