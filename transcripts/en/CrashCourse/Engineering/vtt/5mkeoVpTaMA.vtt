00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.919
In 12th century Italy, a tower was under construction
in the town of Pisa.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.060
The design was for a beautiful, freestanding
bell tower in the finest romanesque style.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.740
But as construction of the third level began,
something went wrong: the whole tower began
to tilt.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.720
And by the time it was finished, everything
was noticeably leaning to one side.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.480
Thankfully, the mistake was seen as charming
by visitors.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.289
And eventually, it turned into a global icon
and tourist attraction.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.410
But for the Civic Tower in Pavia, which was
built around the same time, structural problems
led to a fatal collapse in 1989.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.500
The next year, a team of Italian engineers
was formed to prevent the same fate in Pisa
6while maintaining the tower’s iconic tilt.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.740
For both buildings, the problem wasn’t just
above the surface.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.580
It had to do with the support of the foundation
underneath.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:49.740
And since modern structures can be many times
larger, the stakes are much higher – you definitely
don’t want a leaning skyscraper on your hands!

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.740
So to keep things standing tall above ground,
you need to look at what’s going on below it.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:04.680
[Theme Music]

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.380
Civil engineering is about creating the infrastructure
we need for the places we want to live.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.680
Roads, bridges, tunnels and ports all require
planning to build, and maintenance to keep
working safely and efficiently.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.060
And infrastructure supports vital networks
like water and power supplies.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.540
In fact, the US National Academy of Engineering has
made repairing and improving infrastructure one of its
grand challenges for the 21st century.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.220
And as we learned in Pavia, a structure that’s
going to last needs to be on a solid foundation.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.620
And that’s where geotechnical engineering comes in.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.060
At least for now, the infrastructure we build
is connected to the ground.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.320
Even the sturdiest, most well designed building
won’t last if the land supporting it isn’t up to the task.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.500
So geotechnical engineers spend a lot of
their time investigating the rock and soil that
structures are gonna be built on.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.280
As well as building on top of the ground, engineers
often dig into it, like for a harbor or a dam, or tunnel
through it, as in the case of underground train tracks.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.540
In each of these scenarios, you have to
consider how the ground’s characteristics
might affect the structure’s stability –

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.960
a consideration the designers of the
Tower of Pisa overlooked!

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.580
We’ve seen before how forces like crosswind
and the weight of the materials can affect a building.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.700
Many of the same lessons apply here.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.500
The foundation of a structure is the part
that actually connects to the ground and
transmits forces to it.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.680
So that might be columns or walls that extend
into the ground, for example.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.400
And they’re as much a part of the structure
as the bits we can see.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.780
To stop a building from falling over, sinking,
or snapping, it needs to be supported through
its foundation by a reaction force.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.760
In other words, the soil needs to resist the
force transmitted through the foundation.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.740
Soil might seem pretty straightforward.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.320
After all, it’s just dirt, right?

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.980
But, in reality, soil is one of the most complex
environments engineers work with and it comes
with a lot of variety.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.360
Just like other materials and fluids, soils and even
rocks have mechanical properties that make them
suitable or unsuitable for building on top of.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.880
If enough force is applied, the ground itself
can shift and change shape in intense ways.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.600
The capability of the surrounding soil to
withstand those forces is its bearing capacity:

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.940
how much force can be transmitted over a given area
without causing the ground to drastically change shape.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.420
Just like a solid material, soil can actually
undergo failure in the mechanical sense!

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.900
At that point, it no longer fully supports
the structure, which is what happened to the
Leaning Tower of Pisa.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.220
The foundations of the tower weren’t deep enough
to support it after it reached a certain height.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.080
That meant the stress applied by the tower’s
mass was bigger than the soil’s bearing capacity,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.400
which ultimately shifted the ground
and tilted its foundation.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.600
Bearing capacity is tricky to calculate, but essentially it
depends on both the depth and design of the foundation
and the qualities of the soil that you’re building into.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.900
Since you usually can’t control the soil,
you need to understand it and build a foundation
that accounts for any potential problems.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.800
The main property you’ll be interested in
is shear strength.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.880
As the foundation applies the load to the ground,
the soil redistributes the force, creating tension
throughout the region around it.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:03.129
Just as we saw for materials, everything has a
certain internal resistance to shear stress – the
kinds of forces that act in opposite directions.

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:09.720
There are other kinds of stresses to consider,
but shear stress is the most important because
it’s the one most likely to lead to failure.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.520
Layers of soil that push past each other can
quickly stop supporting a structure’s foundation.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.720
The shear strength is the measure of the shear
stress the soil can tolerate before it reaches failure.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.680
The higher the strength, the more stress the
soil can resist before it finally gives way.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.140
It’s one of the biggest factors that
determines the bearing capacity –

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.720
you generally want the soil to be as strong as
possible to ensure as much stability as you can.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.540
The trade off is that stronger soil can sometimes
be a little tricker to excavate in the first place.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.460
And some structures, such as bridges, have
to be built in particular locations.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.340
So you often have to work with whatever soil
happens to be there!

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.860
The key to understanding the strength of a
particular piece of ground is that soil isn’t
one homogenous thing.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.600
Instead, it’s best to consider soil as a
collection of tiny grains of rock and leftover
organic matter from living things.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.440
The exact materials differ between soils,
but in geotechnical engineering, the focus
is on the size and shape of those grains.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.880
That’s where the soil gets its strength
or weakness from.

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.930
It helps to think of the concept of viscosity,
which we encountered in fluid mechanics.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.200
When the soil undergoes shear stress, the
friction between the layers of soil helps resist
the stress and give it solidity.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.340
One of the causes of that friction is that
the grains interlock with one another and
resist any change to their arrangement.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.340
If things do move, there’s the added friction
of the particles rubbing together.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.620
Both of these contribute to the shear strength.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.940
Separate from friction is what’s called
cohesion, or the tendency for smaller particles
to stick together, like in modeling clay.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.120
In fact, it’s often tiny particles of clay or silt
that are responsible for cohesion in soil.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.879
So the more clay it contains, the stronger
it will be.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:47.720
The size and shape of the grains, and the cohesion
between them, are just some of the properties
geotechnical engineers use to estimate shear strength.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.060
The full picture would take into account all
the complexities of the soil,

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.460
including its mineral composition, moisture levels,
and the size of the grains themselves.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.879
Not to mention the fact that strength isn’t
constant throughout the ground.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.680
It can be radically different for buildings on
opposite sides of the street, or even at different
depths under the same structure.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.900
So you’ll want to be sure to do a detailed
analysis.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.020
That will guide you in designing a foundation
that provides the bearing capacity needed for
what you’re trying to build.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:19.580
In 1990, a year after the Pavia tower collapsed,
the Italian government set up a team of engineers
to tackle the problem of Pisa’s bearing capacity.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.200
In the weak soil underneath the Pisa Tower,
three-meter deep foundations weren’t enough
and the tilt was slowly getting worse.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:33.720
After trying different approaches, engineers finally
weighed down the side of the tower opposite the tilt with
lead and removed some of the soil from that side.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.100
In doing so, they managed to sink the
foundation a little further into the ground,

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.480
increasing the contact area between it and
the soil, and improving the bearing capacity.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.360
The shifted weight of the tower even
compressed the soil at its foundation,
actually improving the soil’s strength!

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.420
Now it’s thought that the tower should be
safe for at least 200 years, all while retaining
its iconic lean.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.420
While that’s great news for Pisa, other parts of
Italy are prone to a different ground-based problem.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:03.980
Because of fault lines in the Earth’s tectonic plates,
regions in Italy are susceptible to earthquakes, like other
areas across the world.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.500
In 2016, a powerful quake caused devastating
damage to the buildings in central Italy.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.460
Protecting against the effects of earthquakes is
exactly the task seismic engineering is there to tackle.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.700
That’s why these people are often known
as earthquake engineers.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:23.640
While they share many techniques with geotechnical
engineers, seismic engineers have to worry about what
happens when the ground itself starts moving.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.860
A violent movement can subject the foundation
of a structure to a load larger than its bearing
capacity can handle.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.900
Worse still, the soil might undergo what’s
called liquefaction,

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:39.000
in which loose, sandy soils lose virtually all
their strength and behave like a liquid, which
spells disaster for anything built on top!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.960
In addition to modeling the soil like
geotechnical engineers,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.780
seismic engineers have to break out the full
toolkit of statics and dynamics to understand
the whole structure.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:54.220
In fact, because the effects of an earthquake
are tricky to simulate, seismic engineers often use
what’s called finite element analysis.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:08:00.120
They use computers to model every piece of
a structure and predict the exact stresses
and strains each piece might feel.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:08.260
Just to be sure, scale replicas of entire buildings are
often built and tested on oscillating platforms to
demonstrate the real, physical effects of an earthquake!

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:14.600
While destroying a model bridge might sound
fun, the goal is to test designs and see where
faults arise, so they can be made safer.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:23.360
In combination, geotechnical and seismic engineers make sure that structures remain standing tall from top to bottom when they encounter stress at their foundations.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.300
In environments dense with infrastructure, like cities,
it’s a critical job for the safety of everyone nearby.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.280
And this means we can continue to enjoy the
Tower of Pisa for centuries to come.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.540
In this episode, we looked at geotechnical
and seismic engineering.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.640
We learned how structures connect to the ground
and transmit loads through their foundations,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.180
and how those foundations need to provide
a high bearing capacity.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.990
We also saw how properties of the soil, like
shear strength, affect bearing capacity.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:57.580
Finally, we considered what happens when the ground
experiences stress from seismic activity and how
seismic engineers work to counteract those effects.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.840
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll engineer
ways to get from one place to another!

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.800
