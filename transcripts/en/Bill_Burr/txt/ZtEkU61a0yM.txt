Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn? It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, February 5th, 2018 what's going on? How, how are you doing? I'm actually doing pretty good after a super bowl loss. Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles winning their first super bowl championship bubble. The first one, first one's the best one. Um, if my team hadn't lost, I would have gone online or something like that just to watch grown men crying in Philadelphia over sports, which is one of my favorite things ever. Um, I remember when the Patriots won their first one. I was actually at the game, haven't gone previously to when we lost the fucking bread five Bruh. Let me took off his helmet and ran down the field.

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       I bet it's age and cried on that play. We're going to make so much money. Look at him. He's so adorable. Um, have you seen a picture of his Dick Lately? No. Um, I just remember when when we, uh, kicked that field goal and we won and I've got to say we, by the way, people go, oh, well you will know the field. Yeah, well I get shit when my team loses. All right. Whenever your team wins, people go, um, you weren't playing, but if your team loses, then they gon fuck you guys. You guys lost, so suck a dick. All right. We lost just today. Anyways. Um, yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:01:40       I remember when we kicked a field goal to win the fucking thing and everybody by, but he tackled each other. And I got up, there was this guy just standing. They was just standing like tears in his eyes. Like he was going to fucking start crying. And my eyes met his and he was looking at me. It's a weird, to this day, it's still wear this moment that I've had with another male. I could see if we were at a fucking funeral of Jesus Christ, you know, man, the fuck up. And I also remember, um, if I was in Philadelphia, I would want to hear from that guy. One of my favorite things this year and the football season was when, um, dad, when Carson Wentz went down and that eagles fan called in the radio station and started breaking down crying to the point, he freaked out the radio host, he called up, he was like sort of complaining that all of a sudden he's just like,

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       when's it going to help happen?

Speaker 2:          00:02:33       No

Speaker 3:          00:02:38       fucking radio is, it's going like buddy, buddy, you're crying for hours. It was great. It was just fucking great. So I would love to hear that guys follow up colleagues probably crying even more. So

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       I really wish when I finally saw the eagles win the Superbowl, that they, they weren't playing my team so I could have enjoyed it more because is something

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       as a sports fan that I really enjoy because there's only two, two fan bases that I just wish, wish eternal misery on. And that's the Yankees because I have to the same way they do it with red sox fans and the Montreal Canadians. Other than that, you know, if you, I, you know, I wouldn't ever wish that, you know, a fan base never got to fill a championship. So congratulations to you guys. All right. Now having said that, um, I've had the dead Don Henley Song in my head this whole morning just thinking about the game because there's always that fucking devastating shock when your team loses. And the song I woke up hearing today for whatever reason, was don Henley's last worthless evening and I was walking around the kitchen. I was just singing. That was the worst Farc in defense that I've ever seen do.

Speaker 3:          00:03:56       That was the, you know, it was an exciting game, but if you really look at it, that was arguably the ugliest fucking Superbowl I've ever seen. It was like both teams were in a fucking prevent defense. The entire game. That was a fucking Superbowl people. There was two punts the entire game and no socks, unless you call the call 'em count the Brady fumble, which I don't know how that works if you slapped a ball out and then you tackle the quarterback if that's considered a sac. Um, I heard them kind of alluding saying this was the first sack of the game. I was at a Superbowl party, which I usually don't do, but I got a kid now. Um, and I went actually, you know, I had a good time as a bunch of kids running around, throwing balls and all that stuff and I was being the lunatic sitting in the other room by myself trying to watch the game or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       But, uh, anyways, you know what's great about having a kid, you don't have to watch the halftime show. I would put her in the stroller and go for a walk. So I don't even know who played the halftime. I just kept walking by the front door and I kept hearing music and one of the music ended. I came back in and then somebody goes, hey, great timing. Great timing is like, Hey, you know, I've watched a few of these, watched a good 40 of them. Um, anyways, I've never seen like the defense was so fucking bad in that game. It was literally like, how did either one of these teams even make it here? I don't know if it was the weird match up or what. I mean, I don't know anything about the fucking eagles considering I thought that fucking Sproles guy was still playing.

Speaker 3:          00:05:32       Uh, but I did call it with the running game. I just didn't know was that fucking do that you got from the dolphins, whatever. Right. But I knew that that was going to be a problem. Um, yeah. I don't know what the fuck happened to the eagles, but I will tell you the New England patriots, the game this season where I went like, oh boy, oh Jesus. We went in at this year was when we played the Pittsburgh Steelers and we went down, we went down and we scored. The fucking game was over. There wasn't enough time left even with big Ben. And then we gave up a 90 yard screen pass. And the only reason why we won that game was because of that stupid fucking is it a catch isn't a catch that when he catches the ball here and he turns and starts running with the ball, we don't know if he has possession as he possesses the ball.

Speaker 3:          00:06:25       And reaches over the fucking goal line. I the, my number one thing I want them to fix in football is, is that fucking rule. Um, I don't remember there really being a huge, is it a catch isn't an a catch controversy before they fucked with that rule. So every once in awhile, you know, you try to make the game less controversial and you do dumb shit like that. Or even the Tuck rule, man, it was fucking stupid. That was a fumble. It's the stupid as well. He tucked it in. I don't know, but I don't know the rule book the way they do it. It's fucking dumb. And all you rate a France who are jumping up and down because of patriots fans said that that was a fumble. Go watch the fucking roughing the passer call that you guys got back with old Kenny stable and Ray Hamilton jumping in the fucking air that gave you a goddamn Superbowl.

Speaker 3:          00:07:14       Okay, so why don't you take off your fucking rocky horror picture show scary rate of costume and shove it up your ass. All right. And sorry. Still a little upset that my team lost tack and fucking Raiders fans who are about to become the most profitable fucking franchise. Um, in the moderate and NFL era era. The second they go to Las Vegas, they're going to do so well in Las Vegas. This is my prediction that I'm going to say the rams who will eventually moved to Reno or Laughlin Nevada or some shit. Right. So anyways, getting to the game, that was the ugliest fucking game collectively of team defense I've ever seen in my fucking life. I don't remember seeing a punter the whole game. I haven't looked at the stats, you know, cause my team lost. So you know, you go on fucking radio silence, I'm not going on social media cause not one eagle fan talk to any fucking shit.

Speaker 3:          00:08:11       And I already looked at my feed last thing, so he was like, good fuck it, don't all this shit. It's like where was that before the game when you're green, knees were fucking shaken. Um, I think there was two punts, no sacks other than I guess that Brady thing that they count that as a sec. Okay. If you told me before the fucking game started, I'll just say, cause I don't know what happened. I'll say the eagles punted once and the fucking patriots Panto wants you just told me. All right, you're not going to sack nick foals once and the eagles are only gonna punt once and you'll have one turnover. I'd be like, oh boy. Oh, this is going to be ugly. We're going to get the living shit kicked out of us. And I bet

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       if you told Eagle, I mean, what the fuck? What the fuck happened? Or the eagles difference.

Speaker 4:          00:08:59       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:09:02       I thought they were going to kill us. I was like teaches this fucking team looks like those giant teams. So they've got that great front for, they've got to fucking running game. They're going to fucking make Brady move and we're going to Google. You'd be frustrated at punting and all of that shit and then they're gonna have the running game chewing up the fucking clock. Um, it was still a great game. Uh, and I know there's a bunch of Patriot fans whining about that trick play. Who by the way Chris Collins worth just couldn't get over that play golf. They kept going back towards this guy [inaudible] I caught him clay. So, well history, it's like you mean the one the patriots just ran five minutes ago.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       You see that at least five times a fucking year in the NFL regular season. It wasn't like this unique trick play. And if you watch college football, you see it about 40 times a year. It's just the standard fucking play now I guess illegal formation is if there's, you need six guys on the line and the eagles had five and there was one guy cut hair back. So I dunno if you want to say that's illegal formation. I'll tell you this with the defense played yesterday and they, if they actually called that the eagles would have scored in the next fucking play. Alright. That'd be one thing. If we were actually stopping them, I would actually look at that and be like, well wait a minute. Blah blah blah, blah blah. You know, my buddy said something funny. He goes, you don't have to Patriots scored on that and we actually won the game.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       They would be calling it a formation gate for the next three fucking years, which is hilarious. We probably would've lost a draft pick because of that play, but there's no fucking way, um, on any level I would ever take that victory away from the eagles state. They totally, they won the fucking Cape. I write that in a B. This is how bad the difference was. Even on the last play of the fucking game, they still had to give the eagles fan base of fucking heart attack when they batted the ball all around in me that there was like three patriots that had a shot at the balls as it was like hanging in the air. Um, just a really a weird, weird fucking game. But, um, I can say this, I am really happy for, uh, for eagles fans and the city of Philadelphia and I know that I, I will always be sort of connected to that city as if I fucking hate them.

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       I don't, I never did. It was just, I had a bad show. I was in Philly and I went after the shit that you loved. But I, I really, the only time I ever really hated a Philadelphia team was when the Celtics and sixers had that great rivalry. But other than that, you know what I mean? We're in the AFC. You're in the NFC. We were in the Adams Division. You are in the Patrick's division. I actually used to like the flyers back in the 80s, because I liked fights and I remember rooting for them. I think they played Edmonton, I forget who they played, but they were going to lose the game. And out of nowhere, Ron Hextall had an absolute shit fit and for, I've never seen a goalie

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       do this. Just skated out of the crease and started fighting somebody just completely spazzed out, ran out, skated out, I should say. Um, but after awhile I couldn't become a flyer. I couldn't stay a flyers fan because they reminded me of how I was living my life where it's like, well, this worked fucking 30 years ago. Let me, uh, let me keep trying it. Every year. You know, they kept trying to beat their way to the cup cause at one and s because at one I'm a cup at 74, 75 and then they continued to do it well into the two thousands. Um, so anyways, what else did, I made a couple of notes here. Uh, I think that was it. I think that was it. Um, anyways, but this one, it doesn't hurt the way those giants one's heart. Um, this one is just a, this one just kind of sucks, but anyways, congratulations.

Speaker 3:          00:12:55       That's fucking great. So now the Philadelphia Eagles in the last 10 years, the Philadelphia team at the city of Philadelphia has won a world series and they won a Superbowl. So now they need the flyers. It's 76 is to win, which I don't know how the fuck that's going to happen. So, um, anyways, there you go. There's my Superbowl chatter. Once again, congratulations to the eagles fans and, uh, you know, patriots, feds, he has his, here's the positive that you can take from it. All right. The team 100% over achieved this year. All right. Not Having Edelman the whole year, haven't Gronk concussed and Brandon hooks, cooks, I should say hooks. Brandon cooks essentially knocking himself out of the game. I've never seen anybody do something like that. When he peeled back, I literally yelled, what the fuck is he doing? I've never seen a guy peel back with the ball and be looking the wrong way and get himself knocked out of the game.

Speaker 3:          00:13:59       They should have been like Benny Hill music playing. I don't know what the f I think he was so surprised he was that open. He didn't know what to do with the, he is like, he had his own public park to himself. Um, anyways, he, here's, here's your, uh, as patriots fans, how you can get past this. Um, just be happy, you know, every, every time the Patriots win the Super Bowl, you know, when you really think about it, you know, have you ever gotten a ring yourself? You don't get a ring. All you have to do is now go out and buy a championship tee shirt and get a subscription to sports illustrated. So it's nice, you know, to avoid that expense. Um, anyways, so there you go. And now the worst feeling ever, almost as bad as your team losing the fucking super bowl is, uh, the football season is officially over.

Speaker 3:          00:14:53       No College, no pro, no Canadian, no nothing. MMM [inaudible]. Whatever you got march madness coming up. Formula One starts next month or whatever. But um, anyways, congratulations on the Patriots on a great season. And, uh, once again, congratulations to the [inaudible], you're super bowl champion Philadelphia fucking eagles, man. Who would have ever thought, um, now wait a minute, let's go around the league. So who's left? We all know that Cleveland browns and they certainly didn't take a step towards wanting one this year, but you never know. Sure. They got a bunch of draft picks. Let's go run a league patriots. Obviously if one giants, obviously if one jets, one Superbowl, three eagles, if one Pittsburghers one ravens have one, Washington is one, the Carolina Panthers. Oh, in too,

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       uh,

Speaker 3:          00:15:51       Tennessee titans lost to the rams and one of the great super bowls of all time. All right. And they never wanted us to Houston Oilers. They didn't want an AFL title. I believe the first year Jacksonville Jag was never one. So there's, there's three teams that have never won. MMM. And the brown sets for,

Speaker 5:          00:16:15       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:16       Bengals never one. That's five lions. Never one. That's six. Dolphins have one. Tampa Bay's one. Atlanta never one. That's seven. I'll shut this. A lot of teams left. New Orleans is one.

Speaker 5:          00:16:31       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       Okay. All right. Moving on up. And Minnesota Neville one bears have won.

Speaker 5:          00:16:37       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:38       Kansas city chiefs one. So go for cowboys. Have one. Houston Texans have never one has nine Broncos have one. Arizona cardinals. Never one. That's 10 San Diego challenges. Never one. Jesus Christ. This is really saying about how many dynasties has been in football.

Speaker 5:          00:16:59       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:59       The rams never won. Fuck raid is if one 49 is of one Seattle of one I probably missed a team or two there. So 12 teams, seven one 20 teams have,

Speaker 5:          00:17:15       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:17:15       Well I guess you know something. If when the Patriots, we say the Steelers have one six patriots at one five 49 is one five and cowboys have one five that's 21 of the 52 Superbowls. Right. They're spread out against with just four fucking teams. Giants got four. So that's 24 packers have four, that's 28. So that's one for like six teams of one 28 of them. Well, I guess it kind of makes sense then. So I guess there's really no shame at this point, you know, having never won a fucking Superbowl and considering like a lot of those teams I mentioned, we're expansion teams like the panthers, Texans and fucking Jag was, um, all right, you go and now the goddamn season out the window. And I have to be honest with you, uh, I am really fearful, you know, with Tom Brady going to be turning 41 here that it might be a long, long time before we ever get back to another one.

Speaker 3:          00:18:19       Uh, if we don't get back next year because, uh, I'll never forget, you know, everybody talks about Dan Marino who, uh, undeservingly gets all this shit for having never won a Superbowl. I mean, the game had passed his coach by, he never had a running game. He never had a defense. He still did. What he did. Was he supposed to tackle people too and come up with the fucking game plan. The man would literally throw per 6,000 yards a season if the rules of pass coverage where the way they they are. All right. Now that guy went to a super bowl in his second year, I believe in 1984 not only did the dolphins never get back during his career, they've never been back period since then. So that was 34 fucking years ago. Dan Marino was 23 years old. He's now 57 that's how fucking nuts this is. So I'm telling you right now when Brady and Belichick leave,

Speaker 6:          00:19:19       mmm.

Speaker 3:          00:19:21       You know, I'm going to be 50 years old. If we go through what the dolphins go through, I will be 84 years old, still waiting for them to get back. So I don't take any of this for granted because there's a lot of patriot people hate the pages. Go you guys, you must have thought he would be exciting anymore. It's like, no dude, it's fucking unbelievable. I'm trying to enjoy every second of it cause I always think, okay, this is the last time we're getting back. Thank God we won. This is the last time we were getting back off. Fuck, we lost this is the last time. Oh, we lost again. Oh we won. We won again. Now we've fucking lie. Yeah, I dunno. I Dunno. It's fucking, uh, you know, and for all you Patriot haters out there, I mean you're really supposed birds.

Speaker 3:          00:20:01       He said it best. He goes, it's like you're literally watching something you be probably never going to fucking see again that level of dominance. But, um, I do understand, you know, if you love you fucking team and I'll let shit, but uh, anyways, I uh, we had definite, I don't know where we are on the run. We're definitely in the final 10% of it. And I don't know if that was the last tip that we shall see. We shall definitely see. But you know, here's the thing, if they, if they never get back again in 34 years, so they do either way, I'll be sitting there watching cause I have nothing better. Um, okay. What is that 20 minutes in? All right, let's read a little bit of fucking advertising, shall we? Shall we all right. And don't

She speechless after that loss, right? There you go. There's a Mama. Can you say hi? Can you say hi buddy?

Speaker 1:          00:28:52       You can wave. Hi. Hey, who played the halftime show yesterday? Justin Timberlake. Oh, it was Justin Timberlake. Oh Shit. I should have watched that. I was pushing her up and down the driveway, having a grand old time. All right. Hi. All right, let's stop. Stop trying to show off here. Let me, let me finish my podcast here. All right. Come on. Say Bye. Bye. David showed a quarterback's wife that much since, um, Kurt Warner, you know, although she was a Brunette, so there goes that theory. All right. They're stupid. Pompom hat on. You're in an indoor stadium. All right, Bill, don't be a better douche. All right, I want congratulations to Nick Phil's wife. Um, I was hoping that the Patriots were gonna kick the shit out of the, just so I could have seen

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       the sports headlines, you know, and if, if nick falls through like three interceptions, they would've said Nick folded, but it didn't happen. Um, alright. Formula One, let's get to the questions here to see. Oh No, I gotta tell you about my show in Reno. So, uh, I wanna thank everybody that came out in Reno, even the dose that tried to interrupt my show and have a youtube moment. Um, I, I fucking love that city, man. I had such a great time. I went up there and I worked my buddy Rick Dalea, who we started out together, um, way back in Boston in 1992. I think he may be started like a month before we tried to figure out who started before, but I always remembered seeing him and, um, you know, seeing a friend, you know, Jesus Christ and we were, were, I've known him for 26 years.

Speaker 3:          00:30:34       I've actually known him longer than the age where you're at, when we met each other. So it was, you know, just all the stories were coming out and when he brought me up, the actually made a reference to this fucking hell Gig that we did. Nick's comedy stop where I started. Um, they, I remember that was such a big deal to work at that comedy clubs, just a legendary place. It was the house that, you know, Steve Sweeney and Don Gavin and all those guys built. And um, we were both, you know, no name comics, just pass being open. Mike hers had started hosting and like, you know, outside rooms like Dick Doroty rooms and all of that and um, read Rita from, Nick's called us up to do a private gig for Nick's comedy stop and I couldn't believe it. I was like, oh my God, things are finally starting to happen.

Speaker 3:          00:31:29       And you know, mean to Leah found out, you know, we were working with each other, which should've been a red flag right there going like you, they called you to all my God, they believe in us. Right. That should have been a fucking red flag right there because both of us should have been opening for somebody who knew what the fuck they were doing. But instead we show up. It was the fishermen's faced in the north end of Boston, which is the Italian section, or at least it was back in the day. I don't know what, what goes on there now. Everything, the prices, they just driven every, every, any, any sort of like culture has been removed, which is why I like going to be so-called B, c and d level cities because there's still that unique vibe there. Um, you'll go there and see stuff that you don't see in every other fucking city.

Speaker 3:          00:32:19       Um, you know, the same 10 fucking corporate chains in whatever, um, everybody walking around with their Instagram look on their face, you know? Um, so anyways, we show up to this cake. It's outside, literally in the fucking streets. They tell this story last week, I can't remember. And it was like a fucking band on stage when I'm on hits your eye like at a pizza pie that so high. Right. And all the Italians and sitting there singing and you're really just see, feel this great sense of family, tradition and culture. And now you've got these two pasty faced, you know, at least Rick was half Italian. You know, I'm fucking German, Irish just standing there with my fucking fire engine, red hair. So dalea goes on, nobody has any idea what's like, it's fucking guys I got now we've got a little comedy Babababa [inaudible] and people like, what the, what the fuck is this guy talking about? And then delete it goes on stage.

Speaker 7:          00:33:18       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:33:19       Trying to smile through probably the biggest panic of his life. And I remember wanting to laugh at him, but I couldn't because I knew I had to go on next or whatever he was feeling I was about to feel. But at least for me it was going to be worse. Cause we, at least before he went on stage, he had fucking hope. Like, well maybe this'll be good. But when I saw Rick go on stage, I had confirmation that this was not going to be good. And I just remember him just fucking interrupting this great fucking party, which is so many of the early standup gigs, you know, just interrupting something that everyone was totally enjoying and they really don't need you. And then they don't know that you're coming up there and then you go up there and they're like, what the fuck is this?

Speaker 7:          00:34:01       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:34:03       All I remember was when I went on stage bombing and just looking up and seeing all these old Italian ladies like hanging out the window, just looking down at us like, like, what the fuck is this? And just afterwards, I forget, we probably walked out of there. There's no subway stop or he walked over to our cars.

Speaker 7:          00:34:25       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:34:27       I don't even remember what, anyway, it was great to work with him. But, um, I was in the middle of my set having a great time and I do this bit where I make fun of the troops a little bit, you know what I mean? And it's not even, you know, it's not even fucking remotely, it's like a fucking hilarious bit. The first time I did it, I did it at a VFW to make sure that, you know, the way I was doing it, I did in front of the troops, they were all fucking die in laughing. I mean those guys say that lost their legs over there and shit and they was still laughing. They love the fucking bit. So I do the bit there, you know, and I've moved on from the bit and at this point I'm making fun of Isis and all of a sudden this, this guy walks all the way up from the back of the room.

Speaker 3:          00:35:05       And fortunately the chairs were like, where he couldn't get all the way up to the front. He starts yelling at me, pointing at the stage, go hah, show some fucking spat. It's what he started seeing. I'm trying to have his fucking youtube moment, you know what I mean? And I was like, what? Show some respect for what he's going to know. So in one of those fucking things like, yeah, I love the military is just so fucking off limits now that who support the truth you, you just have to constantly be blowing the military that you can't even make fun of somebody in the Navy who all he does is swab the fucking decks and it's getting a standing ovation walking through the fucking airport. I've done that fucking pit in front of so many troops. They've all found it funny. It's fun.

Speaker 3:          00:35:53       You know this fat fuck. Oh my God, I went off on that guy show. So why don't you show some fucking respect and lose some weight. You fat cunt for your fellow Americans for every time you get the middle seat on a flight and you fat fucking man tit spill into the other. But I'm so fucking sick. I'm so fucking sick of everybody being so Goddamn fucking offended at comedy shows and just making the whole moment about themselves. You fucking mouth breathing chimp, Jesus fucking Christ. If you can't fucking see through the fucking whatever that fucking expressionists see the forest through the fucking trees with all of this shit. I just can't fucking help you. And considering all the shit that I had said up until that point, I didn't show any remote respect for anything. Every fucking subject. That's what kills me.

Speaker 3:          00:36:49       I blamed women, perceptual harassment. That's how I started my fucking show. Where was the risk? Where we're the fuck was he during that one fat fucking cunt? Oh my God. I was so fucking mad at that guy. I hated that security escorted amount. I appreciated that they did that thinking that I wanted to, I wanted to talk to that guy for the rest of the fucking show. Walks all the fuck way up. You know, he was waiting for his Oprah round of applause when I told him to go fuck himself. Everybody left. I can't believe that. You know, that's the classic thing at like a comedy show that usually ends up on the fucking Internet. Um, you know what I mean? That self righteous fucking Douche bag. You know what I mean? Where everything else that I set up to that point was so fucking ridiculous and absurd.

Speaker 3:          00:37:43       And then that's the one that you're going to take fucking seriously. Like, what kind of a fucking moron. And so saints, he's gay guys like, did you really think I'm anti my own country? You dumb fuck. And when you guys come out to my show, when you see the bit, okay, it's so fucking pedestrian. It's ridiculous. I want to even know when I did the fucking bit at the Vfw, the troops came up to me and say, can't we say that to each other? But this fucking guy had to fucking, you know, take his hair out of his ponytail, tossing it around and come and have as big fucking head, Roland moment. Ah, fucking kill yourself. I hope you fucking have a heart attack. You fat fucking cunt. You when it was was, if he didn't like the bit than heckle me, the fact that he came up there and he's like pointing at me, yelling at me like he's like, I'm his kidneys fucking dad.

Speaker 3:          00:38:40       Anyways. Anyways, let me, let me just fucking plow that, that other than that, the Gig in Reno was fucking awesome. And I got to be telling you that that was actually more upsetting to me than watching my team fucking lose the Superbowl. Um, all right. Anyways, here we go. Let's get into the questions here for this week. The Formula One, oh by the way, or Billy's getting in is continuing with his getting in fucking great shape, man. Um, I've made it, my goal is, you know, turning 50 in June, you know, two years of doing stand up comedy and trying to get a positive out of a negative five people showed up. What do I do here? Do I give in to the fact that this five people or do I make those five people, which they brought another 50. You know what I mean? You get when you fucking, I dunno, when you're in this fucking business, the greatest thing about this business, unless you knew somebody when you got into it, most people get into it and they don't know anybody and they have no idea what to do.

Speaker 3:          00:39:40       Um, and they're standing out in the street in broad daylight, in the Italian section of Boston eating your Red Dick. I mean, if you don't figure out a positive mindset, uh, you're really not gonna, you're not gonna fucking, you're not going to survive. So I'm turning 50, which, uh, I used to take was going to be devastating. I'm actually really excited to try to get myself in the best shape I've been in, in by about 20 years. So, um, I'm trying to get down to my, uh, basically the way I was at when a, in the shape I was in when I started. Now I'm obviously gonna fall short because no matter what I do, I'm still fucking about 30 years older. But, uh, that's not what it's about. It's about going for it. And I'll still, you know, so anyways, I have a weight that I want to get into my fucking shoulder.

Speaker 3:          00:40:32       The rotator cuff feels great. Um, and I finally have been able to get a regimen between all the information that I've gotten over the last year. Um, and I've put together a program that that is, is, is really fucking working for me. And I have to tell you, you know what I did the other day, other than taking my beautiful daughter to the park on the swing, which I think I'm going to do again today, it's my favorite thing ever is she was on the swing and um, I was able, you know, once I got the swing going, cause I'm, I can finally lift my right arm over my head. I been able to take my shirt off, um, with both, I've had to take it up with my left hand. I'm able to take my shirt off with, with both hands in like over a year and a half, which is really fucked up my closing bit.

Speaker 3:          00:41:22       Everybody, you know, cause I really tried to get sexy in the end, you know, um, I was actually able to reach up and hold onto like the bar above the, and I made sure I didn't put any weight on the arm all the way. It was obviously my feet were still on the ground and I just gave it a little bit of a fucking stretch. And it was just this tightness but not pain. Cause what happens, I found anybody else go into this shit is, is when you have an injury like that, you get into this PR protective, like, um, the way you hold yourself. And it's fucking crazy man. Like having that put my hand above my head for over a year, like I can't physically do it anymore because those tendons don't get stretched than all this fucking Shit just, I dunno, grows over it or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:42:13       They just, it's weird. It feels like it doesn't feel like pain. It's like there's a doorstop and I just see, or a governor, I just can't go any further. So, um, after doing all these other exercises, I end with that and it feels tremendous. It was funny, I was doing that while watching the Superbowl. Then one of these others, patriots fans was laughing at me like, dude, you're really getting into this game. And I was like, no, no, sorry man. I'm just fucking working out my, uh, shoulder. Um, so anyways, uh, I hope that helps anybody out there that has set that, that issue. So I'll actually be able to work out. But the great thing is I've discovered bands working out with bands, um, you know, in a door jam and all that, which is really going to help me on the road. And I think I'm done with the weightlifting for a long time.

Speaker 3:          00:43:00       That's kind of what got me into this year's of weightlifting and not doing enough back exercises. And the front part of my body was way stronger than the back and it pulled my shoulders forward and one of them came up and then I, you know, was bench pressing and just the bones, I don't know that, that the rotator cuff tendon just rubbed on it and got inflamed and then I was just fucked. And it's really something that if I, if I, if it ever happens again, I'll be able to get out of it and like, you know, six to eight weeks by just didn't know what to do. I thought, oh, this will work itself out. And then they just became all fucking glued up. So anyways. Um, and have you ever gone through anything just remotely physical like that to finally just be able to fucking take your shirt off a brush your teeth, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:43:48       Or put the shaving cream on my head when I go to shave my head. I always had to put it in the left hand, you know? Um, I'm fucking mess. All right, here we go. Formula One, everybody a, they had Billy the red face con. I've been a longtime listener for about 10 years now and the podcast has always been a great break from the drudgery of everyday life, especially back in my university, the university days. Okay. I'm done blowing, you know. Anyways, my grandfather, father and I are all car lovers. That's great. I remember falling Formula One closely as a kid when shock villa, new and Michael Back

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       in 1997. I'm so pissed. I miss that because everybody tells me I miss the great days of Formula One. Uh, listening to you get into Formula One had me thinking of getting back into it myself. With that in mind. I decided to buy myself an early birthday present and bought tickets for the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona for this upcoming season for my old man. And I do, that's the shit I'm trying to go to two races a year, so I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do. It's either going to be Mexico City in Brazil or if I do some tour dates over in Europe, I'll just book end and with the race, um, we shall see. Obviously Mexico City is deceivingly far away from, uh, la. Like I always picture that it's just south of Los Angeles cause you know, you just go south and you're in fucking Tijuana. Let me look that up. Where the fuck is it? Ah, you know what? I got to hold the microphone here. Can I, can I do this? Do I have this ability? Uh, here we go. North America. I see a map. Here we go. Come on. Come on. Slow Internet. All right, clicking on it. Oh yeah, it's like south of like fucking Houston or New Mexico or something like that, right?

Speaker 4:          00:45:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:00       All right. Where do we go? There's Australia with the fuck am I all right? Zooming in. I really should've hit pause. Oh yeah. Mexico City is like south of San Antonio, so it's like flying all the way to San Antonio. It's like basically flying all the way across in and all the way south again for almost the same distance. It's probably, yeah, the equivalent of flying to like Tampa or something like that. But then Brazil, if I go to Brazil, I mean that's all the way you always, I used to think of when New York, when my buddies used to go to Brazil, that they were flying due south and the two south actually would get you into like Peru on the western side of South America. Um, I would love to go down there too. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:48       yeah, maybe I'll do that. And then other would actually be done with all the races on this side of the world. Uh, who knows? That's such a cool thing that you're doing, doing that with your dad though. Anyways, uh, plowing ahead. Um, I know you like the Air India team. I also liked the uh, Williams Martini team. I just liked the colors and I don't want to pick a perennial powerhouse like Mercedes or Ferrari. So my question is, which team race or did you enjoy watching? Most by father and I are going to pick a team to root for during the upcoming season to make our father son weekend a little more fun. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:47:26       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:47:26       who did I like? I actually, uh, Daniel Ricardo is probably, you know, the closest to a Louis Hamilton. And I would also say I really liked, uh, uh, cheese. I'm so new to the sport and I haven't thought of the name of that guy. Uh, oh, I know in, in his teammate there, his teammate was a fucking maniac. Hold on a second. I've got to make sure nobody switched on a team. Let's see. Red Bull racing team, that kid who's like 20 years old.

Speaker 4:          00:47:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       Uh, drivers. Here we go and keep my seat. He switched teams. Max for staffing was really fun to watch. Um, I would say out of the youngest of the young drivers, he's probably the best. Um, I don't know if he's still on the team. These guys seem to jump around like free agents and then it's all about getting on the Ferrari and the Mercedes team, which, you know, two seasons in is getting a little boring. So I would like to see somebody else, uh, when you know, so, uh, I at Max for staff and I guess that's, that's what I would say. I would say that and I'm, I'm, that's such a great thing to do. I'd never been to Spain. That's amazing. I am going to be doing a Gig, I believe, to celebrate my 50th birthday. I believe it's coming together over in Europe.

Speaker 1:          00:48:52       Uh, I'm going to go, I think I might be doing a gig somewhere in England and then, uh, um, be with my lovely wife and beautiful daughter and maybe we're going to go to France again. I'll try to polish up and some of my French, but I'm, if there's any races over there, you know what, you've inspired me. I'm going to talk to my, the guy who books me today and I'll be like, we gotta, we gotta figure out, you know what Formula One race is going on over there. Cause I gotta add that 50th birthday and go to a formula one race over in Europe. Man, that will be sick. Um, right. More Formula One's shit. Formula One grid girls. Hey Billion Wallace and big fan from Glasgow, Scotland, uh, Formula One just announced that they're getting rid of the grid girls because they feel this custom does not resonate with our brand values.

Speaker 1:          00:49:41       And clearly is it odd with the modern day social societal norms? Same things has happened with the darts and it's looking likely for boxing and UFC in the future. Are these probably, are these probably ugly feminists doing nice looking girls out of a job or are they doing the right thing? All right. I don't know what the fuck I kind of know what you're trying to say. What are your thoughts? Cheers and go fuck yourself. You can't, um, yeah, that's just all, you know, lip service, no pun intended. It's just bullshit. You know what I mean? And you know, I think it's all bullshit. Here's the deal to say this custom does not resonate as to say it's clearly, is it odd with modern day social norms? It isn't. It's a,

Speaker 3:          00:50:37       it's 100% at odds with with the public horseshit.

Speaker 7:          00:50:45       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:50:45       Political correctness, which all political correctness really is, is being phony. You know what I mean? It's just it just denying what you're really feeling, denying what you really want to say, denying what's you're really fucking thinking. That's why comedians seem so fucking outrageous. They always say, Oh, you're saying the things that people take, but I'm afraid to say it. They're not afraid to say it. They say it in their cars. They say with their friends, they say, and at home, you know I'm not, I'm not talking about being a racist fucking moron.

Speaker 7:          00:51:18       All right.

Speaker 3:          00:51:21       They're basically trying to say that men do not enjoy looking at beautiful women. This is against the societal norm that people do not gravitate towards beauty, both male and female. Like if you're a good looking guy, you're not going to have your pick of the litter. When it comes to women. Yeah. And vice versa. Like if you're a beautiful woman that's, you're not going to have to fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       you know what I mean? The, I mean, you could look at it and like a negative way. I always thought that because it was outside of this country that I always thought that they had a better way of presenting beautiful women. That it wasn't just like that Hooters vibe that we have here.

Speaker 3:          00:52:00       Does it look this tick by tick between those knockers, you know, the ugly way that we fucking do everything over here, you know?

Speaker 7:          00:52:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:52:10       I just, I think what that is is they probably got enough crap from these women's groups and they just don't need the headache. So, um, and I also feel that a lot of, you know, when they say the, you know, you're exploiting women and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I think there's a lot of truth in that. I don't think it's, it's that way with this. I think that's adds, you know, what are they doing? What exactly are they doing? Are they fucking, you know, twerking and all that shit. It's just a beautiful woman walking around with a ring card. That's it. You know, getting attention in a very safe fucking way. I mean, what is the fucking problem? You know? And I do know that, you know, the way a guys can't handle a good looking guys fucking Jack down at the end of the bar, you know, a better looking.

Speaker 3:          00:53:03       The guy was fucked a good food [inaudible] to go fight him. You know, women do the same. The

Speaker 1:          00:53:09       thing with the better looking woman that comes walking into the bar, they fucking hate him. That's, that's it. So I think it's pretty fucking childish. However, Formula One is on ESPN and you know, ESPN used to be great but now they kind of ruin everything. So I'm going to blame them. They are, they obviously with too fucking stupid to keep well boxed in who was, was phenomenal at his job. Um, I dunno. So yeah, I think that's all the whole thing is it's fucking dumb. And eventually there's going to be a backlash. God forbid there's a beautiful woman walking around on stage God for fucking bed and guys are like excited by it, like you know, in fucking whistle in a little bit. Who gives a fucking, who cares? You know what I mean? This is my problem with feminism is that all the corrections are made for them, which is really kind of putting it out there as if that women don't need to adjust their fucking behavior in any ways when it comes to men, you know, and feminists get to speak in these unbelievable like broad, no pun intended, blanket fucking statements, but guys cannot.

Speaker 1:          00:54:23       You know what I mean? I'll speak in some blanket fucking terms for men. Hey, how about sharing your own fucking money? How about you buy around every once in awhile? I bet when you go through a fucking divorce, you try to do something fair and try and instead of trying to take every fucking last dying you possibly can, you greedy cunts. Oh right, we're moving on to the next one. No, they don't need to adjust that at all. They don't need to adjust any of their fucking behavior whatsoever. They don't do anything wrong whatsoever. I tell you right now, if women died that much sooner than men, you don't think that there would be a study. You don't think that there'll be a fucking ribbon. You don't think some way that they would blame men on some level that women die that much earlier than, than, than men.

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       If it was that fucking way, I don't know. I think that that's why guys are so funny is because nobody gives a shit about us. They really don't. You know what I mean? They just don't. Anything that happens to a guy's [inaudible] songs, all I have to be a subsidy him. Right. That's it. That's the level of support we have for one another. Um, alright. Deported father dear Billy Justice. Uh, two and a half years ago, my father was deported to Mexico. He had been in the US since 1978 since he was 13. My family struggled without him financially and emotionally. It's been very rough. I must've been brutal. He's healthy and not dead, but he can't be with us. Yeah. That's got to go, man. It's fucking brutal. It's been very frustrating and words can't describe it. Uh, I'm getting married in a few weeks and he wasn't able to be at the wedding everyday.

Speaker 1:          00:56:00       I see people criticized Trump and can agree with their reasons for doing so. But my father was deported under Obama. My family knows three other people who are also deported under Obama. My white friends think they're good people because they liked Obama but never looked to see what was happening. Um, they didn't care then, but they care now. It makes me feel very mad because it feels insincere and lazy. As a white man who seems fairly progressive, can you tell me why this is? What would you suggest? I say to them, it's an emotional thing for me. So it's hard to choose the right words. Congrats on your child. I have two nieces and it's really the greatest thing to watch them grow. Uh, thank you. Um, what can you say to them? I, it depends on how open minded they are. Um, people who are really into politics, which means they 100% watch CNN or Fox News all fucking day, as if they're getting some sort of fair and on bias newsfeed.

Speaker 1:          00:57:03       You really can't say anything to either one of them. Uh, I mean, there are a lot like sports fans where, uh, I try to see, you know, I try to, the best I can to see Bo's, like I could legitimately be happy for eagles fans. You know what I mean? I can legitimately look at fucking Derek Jeter and say, that guy's fucking great and I can set aside my hatred of the Yankees are my wanting for my team to beat the eagles yesterday. But, um, you know, it took me a long time to get there. Um, so I dunno, I mean, no one, the way I was wired, I would just walk right up to him. Bj, you know, just so you know, you're fucking angel there. Obama, you know, who for some reason gets no shit whatsoever. I mean, it probably doesn't hurt that he went, that his presidency was between two of the fucking, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:57:59       Two of the biggest fucking dip shits I've ever seen is fucking, did I say dip shy? And so that, cause, trying to think over the fucking word, I could sing and not be too fucking offensive, but think that I'm a fucking lefty here. 100%. Which you know, most of the times I am, but I mean, yeah, keep full. We Shantay and forgive me, hey, you're not getting full. We again, when after that and then this guy who fucking tweets all the time, and then before that you had a guy shoving cigars in his fucking people's twats I made, I'll tell, you know, it's been really rough since the first George Bush who actually had the, you know, well we, we, we, we pushed Saddam out of Kuwait, didn't go into fucking Iraq and was, was, was strong enough to push back against the fucking corporations. Say, hey look, this is not what we were doing over here. We accomplished our mission and we're going home. That's it. You know? So it's been a long fucking time. So I think that there's a, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:59:03       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:59:04       does the thing with Obama, at least he wasn't Bush or Trump, uh, kind of thing so that people have a hard time seeing them. And I think he gets handled with kid's gloves in the media, you know what I mean? They, they, you know, every image of him, he's like kayaking or fucking play in highly and all of this shit, like the joke I was doing in my act like it looks like an erectile dysfunction ad and they're really kind of ignoring that, that guy for all the hope that he said and everything. And I know that that job is, you know, well, I don't know, like literally no, but I, I understand that it's an incredibly difficult job. And they always say, if you can get one thing done, which he did, he did get Obamacare through. So I guess it was, uh, and achievement.

Speaker 1:          00:59:49       But I have to tell you, as someone who does lean left to watch him go on tour now was $70 million a tour dates to go talk to a bunch of fucking bankers and corporations, you know, and all of that. And, and just, I dunno, it just, it's as far as the way I read that, that's just those corporations washing their bribe money. Like we got you in office, you did what we wanted you to do. Now come talk to us for an hour and we'll give you a nice six figure paycheck and we'll all do it. And then you can be worth over a hundred million dollars like the Clintons, like the bushes and all, like, it's so fucked up that none of them get called out on that. It's like the bushes, the Clintons, the Obamas. It's like you guys dedicated your life to public service and the presidency is the highest paying job, which now is like a half a million dollars a year. If you do two terms, you're going to grow stops. You're going, what does that 500 times fucking eight. What is that? That's 4 million bucks. And somehow they, they, they all, they're buying giant houses and they all end up being worth nine figures.

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       Um, and everybody just looks the other fucking way. I Dunno. So I maybe, maybe there's someone within your group that is understanding enough and can see both sides of that. You know, like if I said what I just said about Obama to a Trump person, they will be like, they would be going fucking bananas. But then if I even remotely suggested that Trump seemed a little emotionally unstable and that it's really doing the country a disservice to be tweeting in arguing with people on social media, like a seventh grade girl. I don't even fucking respond to people on Twitter when it comes to occasionally I do. But this is supposed to be the leader of the free world, trying to get a Trump supporter to admit to how pathetic and embarrassing that is. I mean, that's just kind of the world that we're in right now.

Speaker 1:          01:02:01       But maybe one of those Obama supporters. Maybe you could, um, you know, I dunno. But then also we live in such a fucked up world. I'm going to believe that you're actually Mexican and you wrote this and that. You're not some white person that wrote this shit because they hate Obama. I have no fucking idea. You never know. There's no way for me to vet. So, um, if what you just said was true, uh, that is horrific. And I understand what you're saying, uh, about Obama because, you know, I, I think the best thing he had was he could deliver a speech better than Bush or Trump, but a, at the end of the day, I even know the, you know, the needle kind of lean more left when he was in office. Did the ship stayed on course, if you know what I'm saying. Um, and that what I'm wearing right now, I want that guy from Reno to come walking into my fucking Romeo heck shows the respect.

Speaker 1:          01:02:55       Alright. Boyfriend's best friend, a dear Billy boy lady here. Oh, here comes some red shoe diaries. Shit, I been seeing slash dating my best friend for almost a year now. And we love listening to your podcast together. It's almost, it's absolute. It's going absolutely fucking wonderful. Except the one thing, oh, well this the one and a completely different direction. I thought you to say you ended up banging your fucking boyfriend's best friend. All right. Okay. Um, it's going absolutely fucking wonderful except for one thing is best friends sent him pictures of naked slash f slash half naked girls from Instagram to him. Uh, we recently became long distance, so I'm not sure of the frequency still, but before I moved away, he did it almost daily. My issue is one, his best friend girlfriends complain to me about it instead of taking it up with him and I tell her, I tell her to just talk to him way, way, way. I don't think there's too many fucking pronouns in here. I don't know who the fuck you talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:04:09       Oh, his best friend's girlfriend. So the girlfriend of the guy sending the pictures complains to me about it instead of taking it up with him and I tell her to just talk to him. And number two. It's actually hard to take that advice because I don't want him to think I'm trying to control his life. Some of these pictures are actually girls that they know and not just pictures from the chive or the code of man. I don't even know what that is. My question is, do I have the right to be heard about out about this? Well, are you heard about this? Yes. I'm going to say yes. Are you a free person? Yes. As much as they'll let you be. So I would say, yes, you do. If so, how do I bring this up to them? I've lost over 30 pounds over the course of us seeing one another and frankly thought it, it would stop, but it hasn't.

Speaker 8:          01:05:03       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:05:03       that's not why I lost the weight, by the way. Did it for myself. Okay, well that was weird. The, I thought Dobbs sent you were stressing out or thanks for the advice and kindly go fuck yourself. Ah, well that's great. First of all, you got yourself in great shape. You know, it was getting a standing ovation right now you're, you're fucking vital. Saw your major organs are loving you as we live in a world now where everybody's a hero, including overweight people. You know what I mean? I'm telling you right now, uh, if your finals were standing in an airport, you got off a plane that they would not be giving you a fucking round of applause. I'm staying in shape is the greatest fucking thing you could ever do for yourself and you fucking deserve it. All right? And fucking stop playing the victim and do something about it. And Mit to the fact that you're the one with the hand shoving that fucking cupcake down your fucking throat. I'm sorry, I'm getting off track here. Um, I would actually, I absolutely bring it up with them. That's completely fucked up. If that bothers you, you should say something and that, um, that other, the guys sending the photos as being completely disrespectful to you and you and your boyfriend.

Speaker 7:          01:06:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:11       You know, he's happy in a relationship. Why the fuck is he doing this shit? Maybe he's jealous. Maybe he's a moron. I have no idea. I would absolutely bring it up to him and just say it the way he said it. Like, you know, this is something that's bothered me for a long time.

Speaker 7:          01:06:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:06:27       I, you know, this is so weird. I actually think if you don't get emotional but you don't like cry and do the woman thing, which literally freaks most guys out. Or maybe I'm super imposing. Most guys with the way I feel like when a woman starts crying, I just started thinking like, oh Jesus Christ, here we go. Is it now? How do I, how do I argue my side now? When you as an adult or actually crying about this right now?

Speaker 7:          01:06:52       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:06:53       Then I'm a pushover. Okay. Cause anytime my daughter cries, that's it. I'm done. And my wife's just rolls, rolls their eyes at me just like she's not even crying. She's whining bill. And I'm like, I night boy, fuck am I supposed to do?

Speaker 7:          01:07:05       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:07:07       I would just matter of factly just say, you know, that really hurts me. And um, but I didn't want to bring it up to you cause I didn't want to seem like a Nag. But I'm just letting you know that that really bothers me and I don't think it's right. And just imagine if we turn the tables and one of my girlfriends was sending me pictures of guys with their dicks out every day. Like how would that make you feel? Okay. I'm not saying you have to stop doing it. I'm just telling you that it bothers me. Just put it on that and let him make the fucking decision rather than comment. Cause I can say it. Tell you as a typical fucking guy, if you come out

Speaker 9:          01:07:47       talk to you. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07:53       All the guys singing it was like, oh my God, Oh my God, how to fuck. I mean I understand that women are more emotional, but when you fucking do that and a lot of ways it's not fair to the guy because there's no way you can argue with another adult that is literally breaking down crying.

Speaker 7:          01:08:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:12       Okay. I've been in relationships and I've seen crying, you know, talking to me about something to this level crying. And I'm thinking in my head like, I haven't seen people crying like this at a funeral. So it really takes away your ability to argue your side if you have a side. And that causes resentment, you know, not to mention the fact that women can cry on cue. I swear to God, I feel like some of the time it's a money manipulation tactics, but if you are able to just just say it and just say, I don't want to be a Nag. And I'm not saying that he has to stop doing it, I'm just letting you know that it really bothers me. And then if it was going the other way and I was getting Dick pics sent to me every day, I don't think that you'd be too thrilled.

Speaker 1:          01:09:00       And then just let them deal with that and they'd be like, I'm not going to say anything else about it. I'm just letting you know. All right. And then let him fucking deal with it and see what he does. That would be my advice. All right. Girlfriend has higher sex drive than me. Um, all right, dear Billy. Fuck nuts. That reminds me of that classic Louis Ck joke to me at a time when he was dating a Nymphomaniac and she, and she kept going, let's do it again. Let's do it again. And it goes, and she was really just backing into me and it really fucking hurt. And I wanted to say, Hey, can you stop banging back into me before your rip my Dick off you fucking psycho. But instead I said, hey, take it easy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:49       Uh, all right. Girlfriend has higher sex drive than me. All right, dear Billy. Fuck nuts. I started dating an old girlfriend from high school after 10 years of being apart. Oh. Like, well, when Harry met Sally, right? I'm now 26 and she's 27. We've been going steady for about seven months. I love you. You separate. Go and stay in the skies like an old soul. And everything has been great up until around Christmas where the problem began. To give you some background, I work from seven in the morning. Uh, she doesn't go to work until five in the afternoon and gets out at one.

Speaker 1:          01:10:25       Oh, you got to work at seven in the morning. He didn't tell me when you stopped though. Um, she doesn't drive, so I have to pick her up every night. He only day we have off together is every other Saturday. By the time we get back to my place, I'm completely exhausted and pretty much falling asleep while she's wide awake and usually wants to have sex. Recently my sex drive has plummeted. Yeah, but you're not getting any sleep. It's gonna and I can tell you that having a kid now, and that's totally true to sex in your relationship. It just takes such a backseat. You kid goes to sleep and it's like, hey, we could hook up or we could get like 50 minutes of sleep and sleep. At that point it's like gold. Um, anyways, um, recently my sex drive has plummeted. Not because I don't find her attractive or because I don't care about her, but I'm just drained of energy. After working 50 hours a week with maybe four hours of sleep every night, and after about five months of sex every other night, it starts to feel like a chore. Sometimes I've been turning her down lately. Uh, this has caused a lot of arguments and fights in the past two months. That's probably because she doesn't know why.

Speaker 7:          01:11:36       You know,

Speaker 1:          01:11:37       guys, you know, generally speaking, our horn dogs in any, you know, you could be in the middle of the fucking having chemo in the, in your girl be hey, you all, you fucking do it, you know, banging or where you stand up with that fucking dripping your arm. Um, I feel like she doesn't respect my desire to get some rest and I've suggested sex in the morning, but at that point she's already pissed at me.

Speaker 7:          01:11:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       All right. Well if you communicated it

Speaker 7:          01:12:04       and

Speaker 1:          01:12:06       she's still not willing to work with you, then she's kind of being immature here. Uh, she seems to think I don't care about her and that when I tried to suggest maybe sex a certain amount a week, like three of four, she gets mad at me and that she always wants tasked to initiate it. Uh, I've been trying to be more consistent with being sexually available and more affectionate lately. Like visiting her on lunch break and getting her small glyphs like flowers to show that I care. But the problem is still here. Yeah. Cause this is all you're not communicating

Speaker 1:          01:12:37       when we do actually have sex. Sometimes it's just boring for me because I'm not in the mood or I really don't have the energy to do anything but lay there. I really love this girl. I don't want to lose it due to something like this. Do you have any advice for my problem and when we, when we come back, you bald ginger ball bag. Um, I would say this, you guys need to sit down and have a talk and just say, just say everything you just said to me. This is the problem with most relationships is people in it say the things that they should be saying to each other to other people and then they expect the other person to be a mind reader. She has no idea that you know how tired you are. Just tell her and just tell her that you love her and that you're afraid that you've, that you're going to lose her and all of that type of stuff.

Speaker 7:          01:13:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:21       And just say the reason why I'm doing it not been in the mood is not because you, it's because I'm fucking exhausted. I'm like a Zombie. I'm getting four hours of sleep and um, and just tell her that it hurts you, that you're hurting her. So I really needed to clear the air and just sit down and clear the fucking air. All right. That's what the fuck I would do. Okay. That's the podcast. Once again, congratulations to your super bowl champion, Philadelphia Eagles. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:13:56       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:13:57       like I said, you know, I hope you guys know all the, all these, you know, I had one bad fucking show in Philly and everybody thinks I hate the fucking city. I actually loved the city other than the fact you have 58 one ways going to the left before there's one go into the right

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       and then another 58 going left and then 60 going right after that. It makes no fucking sense. Other than that, yeah. I really don't have a beef with you. Um, and a lot of times, you know, I wish that show happened in North Carolina because I would've just stood on stage making fun of them for losing the civil war and a, the fucking Charlotte bobcat's in a hornets at all. I would just make fun of all that, losing their fucking team and all of that. That's what I would've done. I just happened to be, I was actually in New Jersey. That's the funny thing about all of that. Um, all right. That's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves. Um, I will check in on you on a, what is it? Thursday. All right. See you.
