ALEX LEWIS: I love
swimming because it really

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.100
allows me to be
myself and just focus

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.390
on myself for
whatever time period

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.680
it is that I'm practicing.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.960
It's one of those few
activities where you're really

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.820
just thinking about every
single part of your body

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.980
and how it's moving
together in sync.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.540
I'm Alex Lewis in
the Class of 2018,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.210
majoring in computer science
with a certificate in society

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.840
and technology.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.990
I started swimming when
I was six years old.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.770
I was always like spending
summers like around lakes,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.610
oceans, stuff like that.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.080
Swimming is an escape.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.770
Every coach I've had
has always told me

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.050
that you should come to practice
just thinking about swimming.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.340
And it's just you
focusing on your stroke,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.570
focusing on yourself.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.830
Swimming really provides
that escape for me.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.660
COACH: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.410
Sprinters, start
filling your lungs.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.970
There is no air on number one.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.220
ALEX LEWIS: I think there
is definitely a relationship

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.510
between swimming and academics.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.190
I think swimming forces you to
manage your time efficiently,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.170
be on top of your work,
to stay organized.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.790
Swimming is -- the sport
itself is -- it's very physical.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.170
And it is entirely you pushing
that mental barrier of getting

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.460
through something challenging.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.060
And that is completely
relatable to the way I've

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.020
been approaching my schoolwork.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.610
I think it's made my life
at Princeton much easier --

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.530
just both of them
compliment each other

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.180
and have taught me lessons that
I've been able to use in both.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.670
I think if I
stopped swimming, it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.120
wouldn't make me
a better student.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.050
My best grades and my best
work is done when I'm swimming.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.540
It's the same thing,
basically, from here, just

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.410
on a smaller scale.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.110
Like ignore that.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.350
I'm majoring in computer
science because I

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.720
think it's something I've been
just -- technology has just

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.230
always fascinated me
since I was a little kid.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.820
I think my certificate,
society and technology,

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.800
which is through the Center for
Information Technology Policy,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.810
really like opened up my
eyes to the kind of policy

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.450
viewpoint of computer science.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.370
The most interesting
class I've taken

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.640
was called "Data
Structures and Algorithms."

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.890
Every lecture, they focus on
how that like topic that you're

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.600
learning for that day is being
used in some relevant standing

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.480
in the world today.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.750
Princeton has taught me
to swim for something

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.950
greater than myself.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.090
And I would say that's what the
Princeton swimming experience

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.330
specifically is about.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.370
You know, we see each
other on the pool deck.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.950
You just notice that
there's something

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.410
different about
the Princeton guys.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.550
And it's that we
really are having fun

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.420
and that we're doing
it for each other.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.670
It's been really
special to have that.
