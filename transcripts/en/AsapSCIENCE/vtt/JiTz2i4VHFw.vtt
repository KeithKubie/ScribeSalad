00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.854
You may not realize it but your

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.078
brain actually processes information in two very distinct ways.

00:00:05.186 --> 00:00:06.552
Like when you look at this photo,

00:00:06.665 --> 00:00:09.358
you instantly know she has blond hair, is visibly angry,

00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:11.227
and likely has some choice words to yell.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.959
Without any effort you experience fast thinking,

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:16.979
but if you look at the following problem something different happens.

00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:19.855
Sure, you immediately know it's a multiplication problem,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.725
and you knew you could solve it if you had the energy

00:00:21.872 --> 00:00:22.478
but didn't.

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:23.435
If you do try,

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:25.555
your muscles will tense and your pupils will dilate

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.922
and you heart rate will increase.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.331
Now, you've experienced slow thinking.

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:31.590
These two systems of fast and slow thinking,

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.251
dictate much of our perception and reaction in life.

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:35.834
Take these  lines for example,

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:37.531
it's clear that they're different lengths,

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:40.476
but if you measure them, they're actually the exact same length.

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:43.782
Even now that you know, system 1 or your fast thinking,

00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:46.766
can't stop seeing the illusion because it acts automatically.

00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:48.601
Similar effect to seeing here,

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:49.679
which figure's the largest?

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:51.657
Again, they're all the same size,

00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:53.490
but the suggestion of perspective in depth

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:56.728
causes your system 1 to interpret the picture as three-dimensional,

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.320
even though it's on a flat two-dimensional surface.

00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:01.764
It's making quick work of the available information,

00:01:01.871 --> 00:01:04.614
and so your conscious system 2 or slow thinking

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:09.324
must compensate after the fact and choose not believe your intuition or instinct.

00:01:09.473 --> 00:01:11.049
Wanna see your system 2 in action?

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.812
We'll show you a string of four digits,

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:16.157
you read them out loud then add one to each of the original digits.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.050
If the card reads 3795, the correct response would be 4806.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.531
We'll then go to the next card and you'll do the same, followed by the next card.

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:26.969
Ready? Go!

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:49.634
Few people can cope with more than four digits,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.176
but even harder is add 3.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.906
The interesting bit is that though your pupils would have dilated

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:57.859
you often become effectively blind when you fully engage system 2.

00:01:57.932 --> 00:02:00.158
Did you notice the color of the text change?

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:04.173
Or how about the fact that the numbers completely changed when I put them off to the side?

00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:05.848
Listen to the following puzzle.

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:08.509
A bat and a ball cost $1.10.

00:02:08.653 --> 00:02:10.666
The bat costs $1 more than the ball.

00:02:10.706 --> 00:02:11.955
How much does the ball cost?

00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:15.800
Chances are,  your system 1 intuition was yelling 10 cents

00:02:15.947 --> 00:02:18.854
But this appealing system 1 answer, we know, is wrong

00:02:18.968 --> 00:02:21.446
In fact, the correct answer is 5 cents

00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:25.573
Even if you worked out the correct answer, you likely thought of 10 cents along the way

00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:29.705
System 1 is trying to work out an answer as quickly and seamlessly as possible

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.282
Which is extremely beneficial in everyday life

00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:35.202
If every activity required full mental effort

00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:36.352
it would be exhausting.

00:02:36.563 --> 00:02:38.760
But, knowing this allows us to understand that

00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:41.061
not all of our first impressions are correct.

00:02:41.207 --> 00:02:44.654
How many animals of each kind did Moses take into the ark?

00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:47.062
So few people detect what is wrong with this question

00:02:47.172 --> 00:02:49.290
that it's been dubbed the Moses illusion.

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:52.468
In fact, Moses took no animals, Noah did.

00:02:52.474 --> 00:02:57.411
Again, our brain invests as little resources as necessary so that things run quickly and smoothly.

00:02:57.557 --> 00:03:00.467
Because Moses is not abnormal in the biblical context,

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:06.145
System 1 unconsciously detects an association between Moses and ark and quickly accepts the question.

00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:09.883
In a similar way, System 1 generates context without you knowing.

00:03:10.034 --> 00:03:12.185
Reading each of the following may seem fairly simple

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.211
ABC, Ann approached the bank, and 12 13 14

00:03:16.393 --> 00:03:20.235
But your brain actually interpreted these ambiguous statements without you ever knowing

00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:24.962
You could have read it as A 13 C or 12 B 14

00:03:25.108 --> 00:03:27.449
But your brain created the context unconsciously

00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:31.470
Also, you likely imagined a woman with money on her mind walking towards a

00:03:31.723 --> 00:03:32.516
building with tellers

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.312
But if the sentence before this was:

00:03:34.497 --> 00:03:36.073
they were floating gently down the river.

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:40.460
The entire scene would've changed because 'Bank' would no longer be associated with money.

00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:45.534
Without an explicit context, System 1 quickly generates one based off similar experiences

00:03:45.674 --> 00:03:50.997
In this case, you've likely visited more banks than rivers and so the context is resolved accordingly

00:03:51.172 --> 00:03:53.489
This ties into a context called "Priming"

00:03:53.603 --> 00:03:55.070
For example, if I said "Wash"

00:03:55.178 --> 00:03:56.867
How would you complete this word fragment?

00:03:57.013 --> 00:04:00.327
Most would see soap, but had I just shown you the word "Eat"

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.267
you'd be more likely to see "Soup"

00:04:02.448 --> 00:04:05.540
In this way, both "Eat" and "wash" prime your thoughts

00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:09.313
Though system 2 likes to think that it's in charge and knows what's going on

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.112
The truth is that priming effects

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.096
even been shown to affect and modify behavior

00:04:14.243 --> 00:04:17.978
These arrive in system one and you have no conscious access to them

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:20.677
If you'd like to learn more about the thinking system in your brain,

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:22.793
Check out the book "Thinking Fast and Slow"

00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:23.767
by Daniel Kahneman

00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:25.809
Which covers it in great detail

00:04:25.934 --> 00:04:27.783
I'll put the link in the description which you can check out

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.156
