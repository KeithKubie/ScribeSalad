00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:07.006
MIKE: Dani is sending us to Ken
and his sons, Rod and Randy.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.610
Just like his sons, Ken was born
and raised in this little town.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.946
So they bought an
old building downtown

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.447
to store all of the stuff

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.583
they've collected
over the years.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.718
MIKE: Hey-hey!
ROD: Howdy!

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:20.353
MIKE: How're you doing?
ROD &amp; RANDY: Good.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.654
FRANK: Who's Rod
and who's Randy?

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.089
RANDY: I'm Randy.
FRANK: You're Randy.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.290
ROD: I'm Rod.
MIKE: This is Rod, Frank.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.425
FRANK: You're Rod.
How're you doin', I'm Frank.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:26.426
Nice to meet ya.
MIKE: Nice to meet you.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.228
So Danielle said
something about

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.497
your father wanting to
downsize a little bit,

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.198
but he wasn't ready to,

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.800
like, sell everything.
ROD: Right.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.301
He's 83...
MIKE: Okay.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.303
ROD: ...and he still has
a passion for it, but...

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.438
MIKE: Is he still buying?

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:39.606
ROD: If we let him!
MIKE: Yeah.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.007
[laughter]

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.542
ROD: Well, I had some
heart-to-heart talks with Dad,

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.878
and I said "Dad, my kids are
wondering what they're gonna

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.913
"do with my stuff.

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.248
"Not even to mention,

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.883
"what are we gonna do
with all your stuff?"

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.151
FRANK: Frank.
MIKE: Hey, I'm Mike.

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.619
Very nice to meet you.
We appreciate you having us.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:54.087
KEN: Good to know you guys.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:56.423
MIKE: So these guys were saying
that you got your buddies still

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.891
coming out and
hanging out down here.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.727
KEN: Oh, yeah.
That's what I like about this.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.529
They can see when I'm here.
MIKE: Yeah.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.297
FRANK: Oh, there you go.
KEN: And they'll stop in,

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:07.033
and that's when we have
our bull sessions, you know.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.034
MIKE: Oh, yeah.

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:09.102
FRANK: Reminisce
about the old stuff?

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.437
MIKE: Bull session.
[laughs]

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.938
MIKE: Are these guys you went
to high school with and stuff?

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:13.306
KEN: Oh, yeah.
MIKE: No kiddin'!

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.574
FRANK: That's cool.
KEN: They're still here in town.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:18.077
KEN: I raised my family
in the antique car hobby,

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.345
or whatever you
want to call it.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.615
And they've grown up from
riding in the rumble seat

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.784
to driving their own cars.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.086
KEN: My dad was a builder
here in Brady,

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:30.323
and I grew up working
off of his trucks.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:33.393
And we supplied gravel for
this building when I was a kid,

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.828
and I didn't do
a whole lot of shoveling...

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:36.196
MIKE: Oh, when they were
pouring the floors in here?

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.497
KEN: Oh, yeah.
MIKE: No kidding.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.265
MIKE: Ken remembers when this
building was being built,

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:43.436
which is pretty cool because
now it houses his collection.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:47.841
KEN: I've amused myself now for
30 years with walking people

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.375
through this and explaining.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.845
FRANK: Now, this is
a really cool moto-meter.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:53.880
KEN: That's an early Model A.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.483
FRANK: What I like about this
is most of them,

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.818
you have to unscrew.
KEN: Yeah, it's a flip top.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:00.553
FRANK: This one you would
screw on, but look at that.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.455
You can just open it
right up to fill it.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:05.124
KEN: Do you know what
that little round hole is?

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.392
In the front of that?

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.393
FRANK: This little round,
in the back here?

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:09.329
KEN: Yeah.
When it's on the car...

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.497
FRANK: Um-hm.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:12.665
KEN: At night, and you're
at the steering wheel,

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:16.636
if you look through that hole,
into your headlight pattern

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.571
out there on the ground...
FRANK: Okay.

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.274
KEN: ...you can see if that red
temperature thing's coming up.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:22.842
MIKE: Oh, so you can see
the temperature at night.

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:23.943
FRANK: Well, I gotta ask...

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:27.347
Is this something
you would sell?

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.582
â™ª

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:31.918
KEN: Uh...
I'm gonna say yes.

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.520
FRANK: It's a beautiful piece.
KEN: Yeah.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.656
FRANK: Um...

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:38.191
300?

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.426
KEN: You talked me into it.
FRANK: Alright, you got a deal.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.794
[laughter]

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:46.199
KEN: I'm very much interested
in passing this stuff on

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.903
to somebody that knows
what they're doing.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:52.972
MIKE: The beauty of raising
your kids in a small town

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:56.342
is that they get to have
the same experiences

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.978
that you had:
going to the same school,

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.980
cruising up and down
Main Street,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.149
knowing a lot of
the same people.

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:07.520
The ripple effect of Ken's life
really resonates with his boys.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.556
RANDY: Hey, this was a fun day.
MIKE: Appreciate ya.

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:11.257
KEN: None of us know
how long we're gonna live,

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.593
and that doesn't make a bit of
difference in the world except

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:16.796
I'm not ready to go yet
'cause I got a lot to do!

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:17.864
[honks horn]
FRANK: Take care, man!

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.365
ROD: So long, guys!
