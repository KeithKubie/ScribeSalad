00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.898
First, why don't we talk about NumPy.

00:00:01.898 --> 00:00:04.340
NumPy has built-in functions for

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.720
a lot of basic tasks you'll perform while doing statistical analysis.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.140
So examples might include calculating the mean, median, or

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.990
standard deviation of an array.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.070
For example, let's say I had an array of all of the integers ranging from one to

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.159
five, called numbers.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.410
Technically, NumPy arrays are different from Python lists, but

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.590
performing these operations on a Python list like this will cast it

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.180
as a NumPy array behind the scenes.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.420
So let's not worry about it too much.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.791
If I wanted to find the average of this array of numbers,

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:37.230
I could simply type numpy.mean(numbers).

00:00:42.452 --> 00:00:44.800
We see that it returns that the mean is 3.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.890
As we know is the case.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.787
Similarly, if I want to find the median, I can call numpy.median(numbers).

00:00:56.995 --> 00:00:59.567
Finally, if I wish to know the standard deviation,

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:01.619
I can just call numpy.std(numbers).

00:01:04.638 --> 00:01:07.824
These are just a few of the functions that make it easier to analyze data when

00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:08.440
using NumPy.
