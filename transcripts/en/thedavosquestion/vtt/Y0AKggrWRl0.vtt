00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
&gt;&gt; One of the most exciting things I'm looking
forward to in the next 5

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.219
to 10 years is the development of cheap, affordable
education which can

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.849
be delivered by, brought back by Internet,
by mobile phones, by many

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.400
different techniques to the masses of the
world, particularly in the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.770
emerging economies.
Countries like India and China, which need

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.960
affordable education very,
very badly.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.420
And yet the cost of that education today and
the way it's delivered, is

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.860
completely outmoded.
It's not in sync with technology; it's not

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.309
in sync with the [INAUDIBLE]
most importantly it's not in sync with the

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.110
way people would want to get
educated.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.329
So can we deliver education?
Can we deliver skills development at $50 a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.059
course?
Can we deliver better courses at $100 a course?

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.149
Can we deliver graduate programs at $500 a
course?

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.300
That development is happening.
A lot of people are working on it.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.580
They're working on both content and delivery
and cost.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.920
If we can get it down to that affordable level,
I think it will be one

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.699
of the most exciting developments the world
could ever have.

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.390
Because it would transform the way more of
the world thinks, and it

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.440
will make them become a lot more inclusive
with the rest of the world

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.529
economy.
