00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.410
&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.
With the rapid increase of, uh, population

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.090
and typical growth, waste
is becoming a serious problem, a major concern

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.520
for most of the urban
areas in developing countries.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.909
Today, [inaudible], municipalities, and local
bodies, with their

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:25.849
limited resources, simply cannot handle this
huge amount of waste and,

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.039
uh, a major portion of this waste, almost
50 percent, remains

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.430
uncollected in the roads, drains, and low-lying
area and it is

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.080
creating new health environmental problems
in the city as well as

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.860
creating greenhouse gas and also it is creating
 -- causing diseases in

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.600
the city.
So I present most of the cities are focusing

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.600
 -- municipal city --
municipal bodies and cities are focusing on

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.910
end of the par solution
which is focused on collection, transportation,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.470
and crude dumping and
they're not solving the problem.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.159
What we should do: I am a social entrepreneur,
I am from Bangladesh,

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.590
I think if you look at this as a problem it
is very expensive to solve

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.770
but we are saying that waste is not a problem,
it's a resource and if

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.159
you look at waste as a resource you can solve
this problem.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.389
We cannot look at waste as a problem, a developed
country like us.

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:37.600
So in Wisconsin we developed a model where
we can recycle all work --

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.979
a huge amount of organic waste -- almost 80
percent in the west

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.029
developing country -- we can convert it into
fertilizer compost as

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:56.320
well as we can harness the carbon trading.
It's a new parallel and, uh, almost the -- we

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.139
can harness investment
from developed country to developing country.

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:09.039
So the model we have developed we can, uh,
use collective waste in

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.480
partnership with the community and also recycle
it with Arabic

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.060
technology which reduces -- which does not
create any greenhouse gas

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.720
and, uh, it can then -- with this kind of
technology you can help

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.000
more municipalities with finance, technology,
and we can, uh, have

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
partnership -- improve the partnership because
right now in developing

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.570
country there is no partnership between the
municipal government and

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.890
the people.
So in this project we are trying -- we are

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.750
improving the partnership
between the people, beneficially, and the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:51.940
cities as well and we think
that this kind of, uh, project can improve

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.570
the situation dramatically.
Right now we're working in 26 cities -- Bangladesh

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.790
and this idea is
being implicated in Sri Lanka, in Vietnam,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.610
and very soon Pakistan and
Egypt people are training to [unintelligible]

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.620
this model.
So I think I believe in 2008 to all the developing

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.780
countries -- to all
cities of the developing world can harness

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.601
this carbon financing using
our model and if they can use this kind of

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:27.130
model in their city it can
improve their situation and we can reach the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.340
minimum development goal.
Thank you.
