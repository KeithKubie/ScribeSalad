00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.499
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here on a couch with
Vi Hart and Henry from MinutePhysics.

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:11.459
Now, of all the people on this couch I probably
have the least famous hands, but the most

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.339
hairy.
So here we go.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:20.379
My hand, a mouse trap and how about a phantom
at 3,000 frames a second.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.720
Let's do this.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.600
The  slow-motion looks fantastic.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.800
But right now I'm in Dallas visiting my sister
and for some things you can do online now

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.100
guys, check these out.
First of all, instead of watching a guy solve

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.520
a Rubik's Cube with his nipples,
have some fun frolicking in Meow-Mania.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.240
And if it's not cute enough for you, Ponycorns
is a game written and voiced by a small child.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.440
But if you're not a fan of Ponycorns, well,
try it anyway, because YOLO.

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.460
The game.
BrandonDSmithTV showed me this simple little

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.950
platform that truly investigates the
"You Only Live Once" philosophy.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.009
And for an even darker challenge,
check out "Ebony."

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.240
I love these things.
Clever puzzle sites that require you to think differently.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.520
It gets quite challenging, so good luck.
And relax by enjoying some 3D panoramas from

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.909
the air.
Choose a spot in the sky and then use your

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.609
keyboard and mouse to look around.
Or feel around with your hand.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.840
Your sticky hand.
Bryt9 brought me here.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.850
And don't forget the other Coke sitelets,
like this one, where you can tease a bottle

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.659
oh, so close to some dominoes.
Now, you can also do experiments in these

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.799
virtual worlds with Little alchemy.
I've got an app like this on my phone, but

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.520
your browser can play too.
Drag and combine elements to see how many

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.479
new things you can create, combine in creative
ways to generate them all.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.560
And if you're sick of fast Internet, 
reminisce with dialupsound.com.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.220
Says-It makes things say whatever you want.
I particularly enjoy the concert ticket, the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.490
warning sign and the gas station sign.
Let's take a break from making things and

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.140
watch Neave[.com].
He's got amazing things I've covered before,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.300
but SmartWentCody brought his TV to my attention.
It's weird, curiosity-peeking clips that change

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.040
for your pleasure or whenever you click.
But for a bigger cute factor, be like MinecraftTurtle

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.200
and watch this Ustream of kittens.
They're kind of tired now, but in the morning

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.550
they're super fun.
Oh and this inverse grapher will turn whatever

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.700
you type into some equations that graph it.
But let's talk lines.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.420
Here's a 3D line flying game where you control
the direction and the shape you leave behind.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.610
Make knots and coils and use your previous
path as an obstacle course for your future.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.580
Okay, this is something that I love.
Have you ever tapped the melody to a song

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.200
with your finger on a table, for instance,
and asked a friend to guess the song, only to

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.880
find that by listening to the tapping alone
your friend cannot even come close to guessing,

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.690
while in your own mind it seems obvious.
Well, psychological studies have been done

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.550
on this phenomenon and it turns out that the
big difference is knowledge.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.200
The fact that you know what melody to expect
makes it difficult for you to understand why

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.550
the task is so difficult to others.
Now that said, Bored.com has built this.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.080
Songtapper.
A machine that is learning how to understand

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.740
tapping with a space bar.
Check this out.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.860
I'll tap a song.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.420
Not bad.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.600
Let's talk about something that's off-lying.
The Moon.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.280
How big is the Moon in the sky?
What sized coin would cover the Moon if held

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.819
at arm's length?
Funny enough, the Moon is a lot smaller in

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:26.319
the sky than you'd think.
Different visual illusions that we still don't

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:31.090
quite understand influence how big we perceive
the Moon to be in the sky, but in reality,

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.979
the size of the Moon in the sky is only about
the size of a hole punch in a piece of paper

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.379
held at arm's length.
That's tiny.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.180
Alban brought up Sinuous, which lets you relax
as you mouse around as a line that must avoid

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:52.139
dots while acquiring shields and other goodies.
And share your mouse-moving skills like Josh

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.939
with this Swedish armed forces game.
You're added to a team of real people and

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.900
given a colour.
Here I'm the red cursor and the other ones

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.150
are other people playing at the same time.
Then complete tasks in order to help your

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.430
team mates.
[Voice:] Which colour was the shape?

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.969
[Voice:] Correct, yellow.
[Voice:] Status increased.

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:18.769
Make a mistake and they suffer.
Finally, a very special long DONG for you

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:21.699
guys.
An entire list of every single DONG I've ever

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.539
covered in an episode of DONG.
We've put them all in one place, check all

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.240
of those out.
Watch all the previous episodes if you haven't

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.659
already.
And I will be at Comic-Con later this week.

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.139
I hope to see some of you there.
I'm on the Dark Matters panel on Friday.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.240
And as always,

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:36.269
thanks for watching.
