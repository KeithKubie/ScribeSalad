00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.200
Jamie wants to know the
volume of his gold ring

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.950
in cubic inches.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.850
He gets a rectangular glass
with base 3 inches by 2 inches.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.820
So you see that here, the
base is 3 inches by 2 inches.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.150
And he fills the glass 4
inches high with water.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.010
So you see that over here,
4 inches high with water.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.060
Jamie drops his gold
ring in the glass

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.970
and measures the new height of
the water to be 4.25 inches.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.170
So this is after the
gold ring is dropped.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.030
What is the volume of
Jamie's ring in cubic inches?

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.750
Well when you start with
this water right over here

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.980
and you add his ring, whatever
that volume is of his ring

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.510
is going to displace an equal
volume of water and push it up.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.070
And so the incremental
volume that you now have

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.960
is essentially going to
be the volume of his ring.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.965
Well what is the
incremental volume here?

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:49.340
Well it's going
to be the volume.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.782
If you think about going
from this before volume

00:00:51.782 --> 00:00:53.240
to the after volume,
the difference

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.760
is the base stays the same.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.560
It's 3 inches by 2
inches, the difference

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.920
is-- to make it a little bit
neater-- the base is the same.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.040
The difference is the height.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.510
The height now is 4.25 inches
after dropping in the ring

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.740
So the water went
up by 0.25 inches.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.444
Let me write that, 0.25 inches
is what the water went up by.

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:22.860
So we could just
think about, what

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.860
is this incremental
volume going to be?

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.690
So this incremental
volume right over here,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.090
that I'm shading in with purple.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.210
Well to figure that out
we just have to measure.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.800
We just have to
multiply the length

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.420
times the width times
the height times 0.25.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:51.360
So it's just going to
be 3 times 2 times 0.25.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.497
3 times 2 is 6,
times 0.25, and you

00:01:57.497 --> 00:01:59.580
could do that either on
paper or you might be able

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.455
do that in your head.

00:02:00.455 --> 00:02:04.730
4 times 0.25 is going to
be 1, and you have 2 more

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.430
times 0.25, that's
going to be 0.5.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.850
So this is going to be 1.50.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.530
And we multiply it inches
times inches times inches.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.130
So this is going to be
in terms of cubic inches.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:24.980
1.5 cubic inches is the
volume of Jamie's ring, which

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.410
is actually a pretty sizable
volume for a gold ring.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.470
Maybe he has a very big finger
or he just likes to spend,

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.880
or I guess is his,
whoever bought him

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.950
the ring likes to
spend a lot on gold.
