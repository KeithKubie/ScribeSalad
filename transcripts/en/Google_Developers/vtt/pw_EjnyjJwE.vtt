00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.170
EDEN SHOCHAT: So I'll
start off with a bit

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.300
of a personal story
about GeekCon.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.560
So it's a conference, three days
and you build useless stuff.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.630
But that's the most basic
thing about GeekCon.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.610
And some three years
ago, which means my son

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.480
was four years old.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.520
He came in for the
closing session.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.190
And in the closing
session we had laser show.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.570
I actually created
the laser show

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.450
by taking and dismantling
a speaker and putting,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.140
instead of the
membrane I put a glove.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.630
And on top of the
glove I put a mirror,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.170
and that mirror would fluctuate
as the sound came out.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.590
And that turned
into a laser show.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.310
And to date, every time I
mention the word GeekCon,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.740
my son Ofek basically
admirers me.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.397
That's the one thing that
he remembers three years,

00:00:54.397 --> 00:00:56.730
since he was a four-year-old
which, generally, you don't

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.180
remember anything from when
you were a four-year-old.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.680
Right?

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.849
So if I take a step back, my
job-- I'm a venture capitalist.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.740
In a way, it's the
best job in the world.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.691
I get to give people money in
order to pursue their dreams.

00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:10.190
Right?

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.930
And still, the most creative
people from all of these, I

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.740
wait for one thing every year.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.934
And that one thing is
this Geek's conference

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:18.850
I'll talk about today.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.540
And I'll talk about
three different things.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.362
I'll talk about, the
first one, is, what is it?

00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:25.320
That's the first thing.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.950
The second thing is, why do
we still do it after 10 years?

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.260
And the third thing is my
hope that people sitting here

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.390
will create one yourself.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.230
And how can you do it?

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.240
So how do we run GeekCon
and how do we make it work?

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.850
So the first way to
learn about GeekCon

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.400
is through something-- it's
a project that never existed.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.890
The person doing it
never intended to do it.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.440
The guy doing it is now
an MIT Media Lab rat.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.940
He came in to do something
completely different and then

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.200
he saw a bunch of equipment
and what you don't hear--

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.160
and we've tried to debug it--
is that he was playing popcorn

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.380
on something that just didn't
exist three days before.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.690
And this is not the kind of
project that GeekCon but it

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.690
just happened by itself.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.602
So if I look at this.

00:02:13.602 --> 00:02:16.510
This is a post from Facebook
just from yesterday,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.060
people trying to think what
kind of project will they do.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.940
So this is a guy called
[INAUDIBLE], and he's thinking,

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.400
do I do a 3D sand
castle printer?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.620
So he's saying, I don't
want to build castles

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.390
with my kids every day so let's
do a 3D printer that does that.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.274
Remember, three days.

00:02:32.274 --> 00:02:33.440
That's the whole conference.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.606
This is what he wants to do.

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:38.881
Option number two is to
have no fire fireworks.

00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:39.380
Right?

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.402
So he would do 3D
printing and fire off.

00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:42.860
And he's asking
for people to vote.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.390
And obviously, the third option,
that's kind of boring, right?

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.550
Dominoes robot.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.430
But it's the kind
of work that people

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.990
do before they go into GeekCon.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.410
We are three months
before the conference,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.100
and these are some of the
top suggestions that people

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.640
are offering right
now for GeekCon.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.950
So the first one is
a two meter diameter

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.800
ball that has a camera
on it that is stabilized

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.960
and it goes out
and badges people.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.890
Useless, right?

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.560
But that's exactly
the kind of projects

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.500
that we're looking for in
building for those three days.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.830
Other projects, physical
Digger-- so having robots

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.631
run around try to
replicate what Digger was.

00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:23.880
Anyone actually played Digger?

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.240
Anyone is old enough
to play Digger?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.050
Nice.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.970
So why not do it with robots.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.470
Right?

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.660
That's the kind of spirit that
we have in people doing that.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.510
So a few projects.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.560
The first one, how
do you flower plants?

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.630
How do you water plants?

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.210
You go ahead and
just water them.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.920
But that's not what
GeekCon people do.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.700
What they do is build a
quad copter as a platform,

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.490
have water to it, image
recognition, so it finds

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.260
the plants below it,
and when it finds,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.760
it actually sends
water their way.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.620
This is the kind of projects
that people are doing.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.880
This is a urinal.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.040
It's a repeat pattern in GeekCon
where people actually control,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.790
in this case, a computer game.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.681
You can imagine how.

00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:10.180
Right?

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.346
And again, useless projects.

00:04:11.346 --> 00:04:14.390
And I'll talk a lot about that.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.589
Third thing is, this is a
meta builder of race cars.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.040
And what I mean by metabuilder,
it builds race cars

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.360
by building something that
builds race cars-- remote

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.870
controlled-- with vegetables.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.584
So it actually builds these
kind of race cars by itself.

00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:34.000
You give it a
potato it will build

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.820
a potato based race car driver.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.077
You give it a tomato
it will build this way.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:39.660
And the bonus points,
it will actually

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.830
drive power with a vegetable.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.930
That's actually
from two years ago.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.180
So smart, crazy
stupid, who does that?

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.330
That's Tesla that would
be the ideal GeekCon

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.130
participant, right?

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.490
And at the day it's one person,
finding that one person,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.830
that's crazy enough in
order to build something

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.500
that will make a difference.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.960
In this case, fun.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.460
Right?

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.160
But will make a difference.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.380
These are the change makers
that we're looking for.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.460
So process wise,
how this whole thing

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.470
comes to bear is
thinking, what if we

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.090
find 200 people like that?

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.030
200 people who are smart crazy
in order to build something.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.130
So step number one,
find those people.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.945
We're based out of Israel.

00:05:23.945 --> 00:05:26.207
GeekCon is now a
worldwide conference.

00:05:26.207 --> 00:05:28.540
So it used to be just a bunch
of Israelis playing around

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.560
for three days.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.660
Now, people from India,
Singapore, Germany, Great

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.710
Britain, US they're all
coming in order to build that.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.220
So now it became a very
big international event.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.040
What it was not just
a few years back.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.135
Take technology lovers and
put them in a single place

00:05:47.135 --> 00:05:48.510
in order to create
useless stuff.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.830
And why is that important?

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.750
Why is useless important?

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.624
Because people are much more
creative when they do that.

00:05:55.624 --> 00:05:57.040
When you tell them
you will not be

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.590
judged according to what you do
but you will be judged as how

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.500
cool that is, how does it defy
kind of technology barrier

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.850
and go ahead and
build something.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.020
So this is what GeekCon
has become, right?

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.850
You take like-minded
people and you tell them

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.170
they will not be judged.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.910
What do you think this is?

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.110
It's people fighting on
top of rubber platforms

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.780
that direct them to the
people next to them.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.930
So like go karts.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.740
Do you remember the game?

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.190
But this is the Geek
version of go karts.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.450
You take and you basically tell
people, yeah, you can build it

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.480
and you'll be appreciated
with only one rule.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.250
So never mind what
your pedigree is.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.620
Doesn't matter if you
were CTO of somewhere,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.330
doesn't matter whether
you have done an exit.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.560
The only thing we
care about is that you

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.230
have to have a project.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.900
So the whole thing
starts now, about,

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.040
for 2014 where we send out
a request for proposals.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.800
So in the proposals
we basically say,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.520
the only thing that
we'll check is do we

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.100
believe that you can actually
do it and is the project crazy.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.660
And applications wise, there are
about 400 people, 400 groups,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.960
different groups, that
send in applications.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.060
And we can only except
about 40 of them.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.250
So you can imagine
the level of extreme

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.470
that people go to when
they talk about projects.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.460
The rolling ball, one example.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.790
But the more interesting
one is just two years ago

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.980
someone was playing
orchestra with puppets

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.910
by controlling it with
a Microsoft Connect.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.330
So these are the
kind of projects.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.705
And it's really
beautiful, right?

00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:38.520
It's absolutely useless
but it's beautiful

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.330
because you're actually
controlling a bunch of puppets.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.450
I love it.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.759
So no project, no entry rule.

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:46.300
Actually there
there's a second rule.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.000
This is the useless projects.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.340
And really a third rule, because
the third most expensive part

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.340
of GeekCon is insurance.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:54.840
Right?

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.375
So the first is, we
provide accommodations--

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.270
it's three days--
that's accommodations.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.326
The second thing is coffee
throughout the 72 hours.

00:08:01.326 --> 00:08:02.450
And the third is insurance.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.780
And can you guess why?

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.510
The kind of projects.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.280
So three years ago we fired
off a missile by mistake.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.730
And how do you
file off a missile

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.650
by mistake is if you
strap it to a surf board

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:19.390
and that surfboard tilts then
you'll get a missile launch.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.340
And that about doubled our
insurance rates for the year

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.340
after that.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.395
So accepting differences
of the different people

00:08:26.395 --> 00:08:27.520
and promote to the extreme.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:36.070
So in this case, can you
imagine what this is?

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.621
Trampoline.

00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:41.120
Right?

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.990
But what can you do with a
trampoline that is interesting?

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.674
If you jump, your silhouette
becomes your login password.

00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:49.340
So if you want to log
into your computer

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.420
again you need to jump
exactly that same way.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.370
Now, the interesting
part with that

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.520
is that it's actually
fairly deep tech.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.490
In order to do this, you need
to have image recognition that

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.260
takes and hashes the
value of what is the jump

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.780
and what kind of
posture this person had.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.086
And then it actually
evaluates next time

00:09:09.086 --> 00:09:10.210
whether these are the same.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.530
So it's a login.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.540
It's well before the login
announcements by Google today.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.810
I think this is the next gen.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:21.390
So the guys behind it went
ahead and did gesture matching.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.590
It's one of the bigger
companies in Israel,

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.410
one of the top leaders
in gesture matching.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.868
And it came from
a useless project.

00:09:26.868 --> 00:09:29.590
It all started with that.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.290
We don't have enough
women participants.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.600
We're at about 15% and
we're constantly increasing,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.570
but this project was led by
Ifat, if I remember her name.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:45.250
And the basic project was, how
about we do a Breathalyzer.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.092
Breathalyzer, the
reason to do it

00:09:47.092 --> 00:09:48.800
is in order not to
have too much alcohol.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.850
But this is GeekCon
so it checked

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.080
whether you have enough
alcohol in your blood.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.710
And if not, it poured you drink.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.410
So highly successful, was one
of the more visited projects

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.420
throughout the period.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.710
You want cat pictures, right?

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.420
But it's not fun if
the cat isn't scared.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.650
So these guys actually
built image recognition,

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.460
finds a cat walks in,
make sure it's scares them

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.370
and if so it takes
an immediate picture.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.480
Not very animal friendly.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.260
By the way, if you have
questions or comments

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.640
or questions, don't make
it an American session.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.250
You can just fire off as you go.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.530
This project, again,
three days, and it

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.980
was a roller coaster
for cell phones.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.060
So what do you do before?

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.744
You'd record you
shouting and then

00:10:37.744 --> 00:10:39.160
it used the
accelerometer in order

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.090
to understand whether the
phone should be scared.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.050
And if it should be scared,
it used your own voice

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.150
in order to scream.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.480
So the cell phone was
the suffering part

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.050
but you were actually
doing the ride.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.420
And they built the
roller coaster itself,

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.380
the whole thing, in
the same location

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.270
at that same three days period.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.330
Superman simulator.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.660
So this is a terrain engine, a
military grade terrain engine

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.620
3D simulator that you controlled
by being suspended in mid air.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.574
And you had a
controller on your hand

00:11:12.574 --> 00:11:13.990
so you could
actually fly through.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:18.130
And the feeling was
really like a Superman.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.850
Mostly useless.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.014
Can you imagine what this is?

00:11:24.014 --> 00:11:25.430
So we don't have
insurance for sea

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.760
so this was actually
objectionable

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.130
as far as our insurance goes.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.570
But they just build
it in order to prove

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.870
that you don't need to have
a technology at all in order

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.020
to build a useless project.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.200
This is a wheel, right?

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.820
The way it's structured
within GeekCon,

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.820
it's a large space
because we want

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.940
people to be really
close to one another.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.920
And the things that
happen because of that

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.710
is, for example, you need
a capacitator, right?

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.200
You're a maker, you're a
hardware, but you didn't have,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.741
you didn't bring
something from home.

00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:01.540
So one event that
actually happened,

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.470
2:00 AM, someone says, who
has a 20 kilo-ohm capacitor?

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.850
Someone immediately
raised and they got.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.204
So that's why we
want the small space.

00:12:10.204 --> 00:12:11.870
And that generates a
lot of interactions

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.160
between the different people.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.007
But on the porch you actually
see the Mediterranean here

00:12:16.007 --> 00:12:18.340
and this is where the more,
the riskier projects happen.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.240
On this side.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.320
Like robots that run around.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.820
Right?

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.540
So that's where
we have them now.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:29.850
And the whole thing starts by
people joining in Thursday.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.460
So it used to be Thursday
night, it now is Thursday noon.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.480
And they pitch their projects.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.810
So you say, hey, I want
to build this drawer

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.580
and the drawer
will open and close

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.160
if you push down towards it.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.570
So you pitch.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.130
And many teams actually
dismantle that point and say,

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.720
hey, your project
is so much cooler

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.876
than mine so I'll just
move ahead and do that.

00:12:49.876 --> 00:12:51.750
That's Thursday,
that's what's going on.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.050
And by Saturday we're
actually doing demos.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:13:00.060
What happens in between
is things like that.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.700
This is a user generated dinner.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.750
What happens in the user
generated dinner by geeks?

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.590
A flamethrower, 10
meter flamethrower,

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.910
is used in order to
create creme brulee.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.940
So it's user generated.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.960
They do whatever.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.510
A quad copter goes
up above the barbecue

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.480
in order to supply the
air supply because you

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.260
do want to have
a great barbecue.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:24.320
So last year was
biological cooking.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.630
So anything that geeks do
then translates into food

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.580
and it ends with trying to
convince our families that they

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.010
gave up on us for three
days for a good reason.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.900
So people from either the
sponsors or luminaries

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.730
or people from industry
and definitely the families

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.290
try and understand
what is that we do.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.870
And that ends Saturday 3:00 PM.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.130
So we start Thursday
2:00 PM to Saturday 3:00

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.860
PM and all projects must be
completed within this time

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.610
period.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.920
Some people cheat by doing
some preparation in advance,

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.660
but everything is
done in three days.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.122
They are building by designers,
makers, hardware engineers,

00:14:05.122 --> 00:14:07.080
software engineers,
everything is built on site

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.670
in order to create that.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.760
And the whole thing
has been running

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.910
now-- it's the 10th year.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.540
And it's entirely
volunteer based event.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.810
So no one is paid in order
to do this weird thing.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.000
So this is the initial
team that started it.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.440
And this year we actually
have 30 volunteers.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.350
So this year is
GeekCon X. We wanted

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.320
to make it the biggest, baddest,
greatest projects of all

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.420
the time and so we
have a very big team.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.870
And how you do-- oh, by numbers.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.470
I didn't remember
having this slide.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.900
So 180 people.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.900
This year is actually
going to be 200.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.780
And the way we managed
to do that is people

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.940
actually volunteered
to come in in tents

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.770
and sleep in tents
in order to be

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.080
able to increase the
amount of people.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.420
52, it's now going
to be 72 hours.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.430
40 useless projects.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.600
We really like beer
so there's always

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.480
a local brewery
that supplies us.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.160
But the interesting-- and we
have pretty much all the time

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:05.810
coffee.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.620
But the interesting thing is
what's our goal in doing this.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.390
And the goal that we have
is 66% failure rates.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:15.560
So last year we failed because
we had a 50% success rate.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.480
And why do-- why do
you go for the 66%?

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.330
The whole idea of GeekCon, much
like other venues like that,

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.160
is building the infrastructure,
building the framework that

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.120
makes people so
much more creative.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:27.620
Right?

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.430
And the way to make
them more creative

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.820
is by telling them
we want you to fail.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.670
So there has been
projects like firing

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.950
down mosquitoes with lasers.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.760
And that half worked because
they mostly hit people.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.720
But that-- so is that success,
is that failure, we don't know.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.340
But it's pretty cool.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.650
So we really want to fail.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.350
And some people think
that we're less crazy

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.710
than we think that we are.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.931
So Google has been
helping us in many ways.

00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:55.430
But General Motors,
who would expect

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.580
General Motors to
sponsor a bunch of geeks

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.780
that try to useless stuff?

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.990
Face.com, a company I founded,
was actually born there.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.940
So that's one great impact.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.730
So we got to know
each other, people

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.550
get to know between teams.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.360
But that's a side effect.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.990
Interesting other
side effects is

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.110
conferences that get
built because of that.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.700
And in my mind, that's
my goal for this session.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.930
So GeekCon, again,
insurance we can't

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:26.112
bring people that
are younger than 18.

00:16:26.112 --> 00:16:28.070
So we are pressured by
some of the participants

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.790
in order to create
GeekCon for kids.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.870
One day events and those kids
build the most crazy stuff.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.244
Much more-- they are much
less burdened with limitations

00:16:37.244 --> 00:16:37.910
than the parent.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.480
So the kid thinks of the
idea and you suddenly

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.160
see everyone building into it.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.640
Which is awesome.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.670
TentTech, DrinkCon.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.690
DrinkCon is going to happen
for the first time this year.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.060
It's GeekCon for alcohol side.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.080
Think of sauna based on alcohol.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.710
Going to be interesting.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:57.620
We'll see.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.980
TentTech is taking
clean tech and doing

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.690
that in the same
spirit of GeekCon.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:06.869
So in the desert, two
days, build things.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.480
But built in that space.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:08.980
Right?

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.640
It's not things that
you bring in advance.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.089
Well, OK.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:16.920
Amdocs, a company
that was doing this.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.089
The Israel Defense
Forces has actually

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:21.730
copied off the
GeekCon model and they

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.844
have an event internal
for the intelligence corp

00:17:23.844 --> 00:17:25.760
and for Air Force that
they are doing in order

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.609
to build more creative things.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.540
And so we have done
that with Microsoft.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.690
So how can you do this?

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.100
It's pretty easy.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.860
It's a lot of work
but it's pretty easy.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.780
So GeekCon, in order to
have it up and running,

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.090
there was a spreadsheet.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.256
What a surprise, everything
is a spreadsheet, right?

00:17:43.256 --> 00:17:45.080
So first off, when
we started planning

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.840
for GeekCon X-- this is
this year-- we said, OK,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.239
what do we want to do?

00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:51.780
What are the principles
that we have?

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.750
We want bigger organizer
team, have it longer,

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.710
do two pre-cons meaning
conferences that

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.430
happened before in order
to help people team up

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:01.680
and build bigger projects.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.670
In order for them to
understand 3D printing,

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.320
in order for them
to do Oculus Rift.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.320
There's actually a project,
a submarine controlled Oculus

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.790
Rift control
submarine this year.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.890
And many ways, that's because
of those pre-con structures.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.910
So these are the principles.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.240
This is what we wanted to do.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.250
Bring in more women, get
internet to work finally,

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.854
tenth year, we've never been
able to do good internet

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:25.520
infrastructures.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.780
So these are the principles.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.920
Then we went off and said,
OK, so these are the teams

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.550
that we need.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.290
There are 30 teams that are
charged with tear down, set

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.810
up, projects, website,
pretty much anything that

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.420
needs to happen in order
to get things going.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.530
And you then find owners
for each of those.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.120
These are the volunteers
that now there

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.880
are 30 of them instead of
the four that we are usually.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.310
And then the how to.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.091
The file is actually
called How To.

00:18:55.091 --> 00:18:56.340
And these are all the to do's.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.650
And surprisingly, the amount
of to do's is very, very deep

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.960
before the event.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.079
And then the event
itself runs itself.

00:19:05.079 --> 00:19:05.620
In many ways.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.830
So 150 things that
need to happen.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.870
All the must items,
if they don't happen,

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.630
there will be no GeekCon.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.520
All the high items,
if they don't happen,

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.380
it will be a OK GeekCon.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.550
Medium, if you do the medium,
it will be an awesome GeekCon.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.170
And low, you never do.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.900
In startups, generally,
there is must,

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.140
muster and mustest
priority level.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.199
And the same with GeekCon.

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.490
And this is what's going on
in the event itself, right?

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:30.850
So very short.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:35.850
If you look before it's about
70 items, but during the event

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.620
it's basically, OK, let's
get the teams going,

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.590
give them rooms, make sure
they have a refrigerator

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.810
for the user generated
dinner, and the rest

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.590
will happen by itself.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.300
So the organizer team, most of
the stuff that we do is ahead.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.797
Just making sure the best
projects will be selected,

00:19:51.797 --> 00:19:53.380
that there will be
the infrastructure,

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.380
there will be a group
buy in case people

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.190
need to buy many arduinos.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:01.040
But otherwise it's running
pretty much by itself.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.450
If you want to do a GeekCon
yourself, best way to do that

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.390
is to experience
GeekCon by coming.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.890
Right?

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.370
So 18th to 20th of September.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.250
This is what's
going on in Israel.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.300
We already have a lot of
pressure in doing it in the US.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.330
Philadelphia
volunteered to do it.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.110
But basically anyone that
is interested in doing it,

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:23.910
it's a spreadsheet away
and talking with us.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.955
Thank you.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.830
Questions.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.280
Who's volunteering to do it?

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.680
That's in California?

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.284
Y Combinator.

00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:43.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:46.410
EDEN SHOCHAT: Awesome.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:47.880
So we have California going.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.850
Questions about the
how's it going projects?

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.140
What's what?

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.056
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.050
EDEN SHOCHAT: So how does
it start, you're asking?

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.760
So great example is
the Space IL guys

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:14.490
that will launch to
the moon in late 2015.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:15.370
Pretty much the same.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.828
Most of the projects
we see, people

00:21:16.828 --> 00:21:20.060
sitting in a bar, either
ex-participants or they've

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.100
heard of it.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.940
They start scribbling
things down,

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.200
they write the application.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.150
We usually try to help them
improve on the application.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.290
But that's a soul.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.270
All the soul of the project
is by the project owners.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:34.730
Our job as organizers
is to have an organized

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:38.850
chaos, to give them the stage,
give them the infrastructure,

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.310
help them meet the right
people, like minded people,

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.950
and make sure nobody feels
that they are judged.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.020
The number one
impact is make sure

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.670
that everyone thinks that
the crazier the better

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.690
and the more fun that's awesome.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.820
And people are generally
always thinking, oh,

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.260
does it have a business model
or what will be the next step?

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.709
And once they get rid of that
they build awesome projects.

00:21:59.709 --> 00:22:00.625
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.390
EDEN SHOCHAT: Oh,
how it started?

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.870
We were at some other
conference and we said,

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.420
we are not willing
to wait a year

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.310
before we see each other again.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:16.100
And that conference
was similar to Foo Camp

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.780
which was very
much about talking.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:25.050
And we said, fuck it, we want
to do things, and so we did.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:29.770
So first GeekCon
was with a budget

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.670
of 8,000 shekels
which is about $2,000.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.870
And it was done
overnight and 80 people.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.340
And really worked
great so we decided,

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.580
hey, let's do it
next year as well.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.870
So that's pretty simple.

00:22:45.782 --> 00:22:47.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.080
EDEN SHOCHAT: No.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.080
So great question.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.580
Is it always the
same people coming?

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:59.050
So the overhead in creating
a project is so big,

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.330
and you know that
no project no entry,

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:04.170
we take it very seriously.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.570
So you know that if you
come just to hang out

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.310
you will most likely not
be invited the year after.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.060
So that's a pretty
good leverage there.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:18.050
So generally what happens is
we have about a third repeat

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:19.240
from last year.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.780
It's now about
1,000 people strong

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:24.470
that went through the
event in multiple years.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.100
So about a third are the
same, 2/3 are coming out.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.990
And a lot of the work
that we do-- and look

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.090
at the responsibilities.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.900
So new recruits.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.470
That's one of the
top responsibilities

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.480
and one of the
largest teams if you

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.280
see because we want to bring
in new blood all the time.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.710
And it's important for us that
people have the fun in making.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.560
And that's why we actually make
sure that we have designer.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.930
We go to most design schools.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.540
We go to most engineering
schools, and we just pitch.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.044
Most of us have a day job,
and it's still something

00:23:58.044 --> 00:23:58.960
that we constantly do.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.920
Cool.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.600
Thank you.
