00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.570
Everyone will tell you that
cycling is good for you.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.000
It's a great work out.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.850
It's good for your heart and
lungs, as well as your legs.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.700
Unless something like
this happens.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.020
Accidents happen.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.880
And when lorries or
cars are involved,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.330
they can be very serious.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.730
But the outcome is not
determined by luck or fate,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.030
but by the laws of physics.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.870
Since people aren't going to
stop riding bikes or driving

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.470
cars, then we need to use those
laws of physics to try

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.000
and prevent injuries.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.540
You want to keep something
fragile, like my mobile phone

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.930
safe when you post it, a good
idea is to put it in a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.910
polystyrene box.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.840
Because any kinetic energy
coming from an impact gets

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.130
absorbed by the polystyrene,
which dissipates that energy

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.040
in terms of the defamation of
material, fracturing of the

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.840
material, heat, and as
you heard, sound.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.590
So that's exactly what
cycle helmets are.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.780
They're padding for your head.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.780
They've got expanded polystyrene
packaging, and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.850
they're designed to crush
and reduce the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.060
energy of the impact.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.560
Now, helmets are all tested to
stringent safety standards.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.750
But the standard tests have to
be simple and reproducible,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.060
and straightforward.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.170
And in helmet cases, they're
basic to the point of perhaps

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.860
not representing a real
cycle accident.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.060
One of the standard tests for
bicycle helmets is a drop from

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.930
a 2 metre height onto a flat
surface with a weighted head

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.530
inside the helmet.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.490
Now, we don't have a weighted
head at the moment, so we'll

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.940
make do with something
a bit more fun.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.855
So, let's see if our cycle
helmet tosses our test.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.780
I'm afraid in some accidents,
the balloon doesn't survive.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.430
Just goes to show you
that sometimes you

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.780
have to test reality.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.750
So the ideal way of testing the
effectiveness of a helmet

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.920
will be a randomised
controlled trial.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.030
You take people at random and
assign them to groups, either

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.610
with a helmet or without, and
then you make them have

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.590
accidents, and you see
which ones survive,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.575
and which ones don't.

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:58.220
But that's not really ethical.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.070
So the next best thing is to do
exactly that process, but

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.930
with a computer simulation.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.380
You can build the laws of
physics into a computer.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.050
You can make a model
of a person.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.900
You can make a models
of a bicycle.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.270
You can make a model of a
helmet, and then you can do

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.120
that experiment.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.440
And you can repeat exactly the
same accident under exactly

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.130
the same conditions with
and without a helmet.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.170
If we now look at the results
for what happened when a cycle

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.710
helmet wasn't being worn,
that's the red line.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.010
And you can see the cycle helmet
has done exactly what

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.660
it should do.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.910
It's dissipated the energy, so
that the acceleration peak

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.480
with the helmet, the green one
is much lower and broader.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.600
And in fact, only just about
comes up to the 300 G limit

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.280
that's set in the CPSC cycle
helmet standard.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.785
If you compare that to what
happened without the helmet,

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:49.050
you can see that there's an
enormous acceleration spike.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.200
And that's the head hitting the
hard ground directly, with

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.920
no chance of dissipating
the energy.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.120
By an ironic twist of fate, or
physics, if you like, I was

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.050
involved in an accident
in 2010.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.050
And that was a fantastic

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.630
opportunity to do some research.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.740
You have a lot of time in
hospital trying to work out

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.810
why you're injured
the way you.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.410
Why you've broken your neck,
but your legs are fairly

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.020
undamaged, that sort of thing.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.760
So once I got back to the
office, it was quite fun to

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.360
recreate the accident using
the simulation software.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.640
And this is something
fairly similar to

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.670
what would have happened.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.270
This is a rear impact with the
car doing 40 miles an hour.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.520
And you can see.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.162
It's quite lucky I don't
remember it.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.540
So now I have a pretty good idea
of what happened to me,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.970
and I'm absolutely confident
that my head helmet, in

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.750
sustaining all that damage meant
that I'm still alive.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.280
So if you are involved in an
accident, the best chance of

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.292
saving your life is to
wear a cycle helmet.

00:05:01.292 --> 00:05:05.590
And you won't catch me riding
a bike without one.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.840
It's just physics.
