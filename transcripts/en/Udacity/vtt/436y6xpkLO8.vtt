00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Finally, the general concept of a cause can be misleading.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
To think about the window shuttering, we said it was the ball. It's right.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But, it could also have been the window maker.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If the window maker had not made this particular window

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
then the window would not have shuttered

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and if the house builder had not built this particular house with the window in it

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
then the window would not have shuttered either.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
For a single effect, there can be multiple causes,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and all of these are valid according to our earlier definition.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This is where the concept of an actual cause comes in handy.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
An actual cause assumes and changes as little as possible, but it changes the effect.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If we think about the causes we have discussed, a ball shuttering the window

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
does not change much except for the window.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The window maker not producing the window makes of a larger different

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
because then we would have the house with one window missing

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
for quite some time, which would change a lot.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Parts of the house would get very wet for instance,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
would be cold or hot depending on the climate.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If the house maker had not built the house, the change would be even bigger.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, what you want is an actual cause

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that assumes and changes as little as possible, which precisely what the ball is in here.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
For debbugging the same hole, you want to have a cause

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that assumes and changes as little as possible but still produces the effect,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and that's precisely what delta debugging gets you starting with the general cause

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the entire input reproduces an actual cause namely a subset of the input

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in which everything is relevant for producing the effect.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Here's a quiz. I invoke the GNU compiler, and it crashes.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Which of these are general causes for the failure?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Is it me because no me, no invocation, no crash

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
or is it Richard Stallman, the founder of the GNU project

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
because without Stallman no GNU compiler no crash

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
or is it oxygen, without oxygen, no Richard Stallman, no me, no compiler,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
no crash, probably also no world as we know it, no computers,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
no electricity, interesting, or finally is it a bug in the compiler

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
because no bug no crash. Check all that applied.
