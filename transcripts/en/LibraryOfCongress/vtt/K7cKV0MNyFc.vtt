00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.050
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Hi everyone.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.170
Thanks for joining us this
afternoon to celebrate the birthday

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.150
of a very special writer,
Elizabeth Bishop.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.460
My name is Anya Creightney.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.760
Come on in.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.710
And I'm the Program Specialist for
the Poetry and Literature Center

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.490
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.230
I'm also a proud partner in
this series, representing

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.820
and celebrating the careers of many

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.390
of our most valuable
literary voices.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.300
Elizabeth Bishop is one of
those writers who shapes

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.330
and contours our world
as though it were putty.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.590
Her poetics are indelicate, yet
solid, earthen, yet water bound,

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.730
slippery, yet confidentially
precise.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.250
She is a poet with a
keen, unwavering eye.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.110
And lucky for us, she found
no scene too domestic,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.920
no folk too ordinary,
no object too small.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.510
So, perhaps it gives you comfort,
as it does many, to let Bishop,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.760
quiet and substantial as
she was, study the boundary

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.470
between the external
and the internal,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.740
the boundary between
border and flux.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.760
Absolutely, it is with
this excitement

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.660
that I welcome poets Jennifer
Atkinson and Vijay Seshadri.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.010
Both of whom will help us better
understand Bishop and her poetics.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.660
Each poet will lecture for
approximately twenty minutes.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.420
And both will conclude by sharing
excerpts of their own work.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.070 position:56%
And I should note that Vijay is
going to share poems, Bishops poems,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.130
here today and then read
poems of his conclusion.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.880
Jennifer Atkinson is the author
of five poetry collections.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.790
The most recent, "The Thinking
Eye," looks at the syntax

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.980
of our evolving world, paying
close attention to landscape,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.520
ecology, myth and memory.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.120
She is a professor in
the BFA and MFA programs

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.070
at George Mason University.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.190
Vijay Seshadri is the
author of three collections.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.410
The most recent of which
of the three selections,

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.230
won the Pulitzer Prize
for Poetry in 2014.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.180
He is a professor and the Michele
Tolela Myers Chair in Writing

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.640
at Sarah Lawrence University
in Yonkers, New York.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.880 position:56%
Lastly, our event will conclude with
a tabletop presentation of items,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.850
that you see here to my left, from
the Library's Bishop collection.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.210
And Mark Manivong here,
sitting here in the front row,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.570
is a curator from the Rare
and Special Book Division.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.200
And he will invite you all,
at the very end of the event,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.910
to take a look at the
items presented here.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.500
So, before I turn it over to
our poets here, let me ask you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.200
to turn off your cell
phones or anything

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.650
that could interfere
with the reading today.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.560 position:56%
And let me also say one little thing

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.070
about the Poetry and
Literature Center.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.060
We are the home of the Poet
Laureate Consultant in Poetry,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.840
who currently is Juan
Felipe Herrera.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.600
And we put on thirty
to forty programs,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.450
just like this one, per year.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.020
To find out more about
this series and others,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.420
please join our mailing list.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.980
And you can do so at
the back of the room.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.390
There is a clipboard
you can fill out.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.730
And without further ado, let
me turn it over to our poets,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.290
first of whom is Jennifer Atkinson.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.440
[ Applause ]

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.330
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Atkinson:
Thanks everyone for coming.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.770
And thank you Anya
and Matt and Mark.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.220
This stuff is amazing.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.580
You have to see this, if
you haven't looked yet.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.420
So, I'm going to talk a little
bit and then read a few, like,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.470
three, I think, of my poems.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.340
And I'm going to concentrate on
-- it was very hard to pick, like,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.430
which Bishop poem to
read, but to think about.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.670
But I picked in the end
a poem called "Poem."

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.260
Well, I'm going to start.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.240
Okay, I'll start -- you know,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.810
I'm sort of changing my mind
right now, while I talk to you.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.150
But no, I'm going to
go ahead with this.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.520
So, I'm going to go
ahead and read this.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.500
So, to celebrate Elizabeth
Bishop on her birthday,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.770
let's begin with a snippet
from one of her letters.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.330
Her witty, sharp, funny,
affectionate letters.

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.410
It's a description of a remarkable
birthday present that she received

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.770
at a party in Brazil, where
she was living at the time.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.790
She writes, "A neighbor
whom I scarcely know

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.370
because we have no know
language in common for one thing,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.450
came bringing me my
lifelong dream, a Toucan.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.200
The woman, who gave him and her
husband, are Polish refugees

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.580
and ran the zoo in Warsaw, I think.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.340
I never dreamed they'd
give me a Toucan.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.020
He eats six bananas a day.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.190
I must say, they seem to go
right through him and come

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.330
out practically as good as new.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.970
Meat, grapes, to see him
swallowing grapes is rather

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.890
like playing a pinball machine.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.410
And something I'd never known,

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.120
they sleep with their tails
straight up over their heads.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.880
And their heads under a wing.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.710
So, the silhouette is just
like an inverted comma.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.730 position:56%
I am calling him Uncle Sam or Sammy.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.490
He steals everything,
particularly something bright.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.960
But so far the favorite toy
is a champagne bottle cork,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.850
also from the birthday."

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.100
That story sounds just
like her, doesn't it?

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.380
The Polish refugees, who can't
communicate with her exactly

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.970
and whose sad story
she doesn't quite tell.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.220
The precise and strange
images, feeding the bird grapes

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.350
like playing a pinball machine

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.870
or his sleeping silhouette
like an inverted comma.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.270
And like the sandpiper
that famous Bishopy bird,

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.150 position:56%
Sam also keeps his eye open, looking
for something, something, something.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.860
Something bright to steal from the
random, incoherence of the world.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.960
Other sources may call
Bishop's pet bird Sam, a parrot

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.620
or say she named him in a moment

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.810
of chauvinistic patriotism,
thus the Uncle Sam.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.580
But the story I choose
to believe is the one

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.960
that says Sam the Toucan's name,

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.360
is an acronym for the three
qualities Elizabeth Bishop deemed

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.090
most important to a poem.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:41.260
Spontaneity, S, accuracy, A and
mystery, M. All or nearly all

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.820
of her poems exhibit Samminess.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.550
But because it's one
of my favorites,

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.560
let's look at the poem, "Poem."

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.020
You know it, of course.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.310
It's an Ars Poetica of sorts,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.600
though Bishop would never
use so grand a title.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.070
Even Marianne Moore's poetry, is
a step too close to pontification.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.850
Bishop sticks with "Poem."

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.220
It's up to us to generalize.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.710
She claims only that "Poem"
is a poem about a naÃ¯ve,

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.550
that is unstudied painting.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.820
She doesn't claim, though we might,

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.210
that "Poem" might have
something lasting

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.230
to say about the art of poetry.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:27.090
So, let me read it to you.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.910
It's in geography three.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:35.020
You can see a copy of that up here.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.680
"Poem." "About the size of an
old-style dollar bill, American

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.540
or Canadian, mostly the
same whites, gray greens,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.500 position:56%
and steel grays this little
painting, a sketch for a larger one?

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.990
Has never earned any
money in its life.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.700
Useless and free, it
has spent seventy years

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.700 position:56%
as a minor family relic handed along
collaterally to owners who looked

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.110
at it sometimes, or
didn't bother to.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:11.870
It must be Nova Scotia; only there
does one see gabled wooden houses

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.730
painted that awful shade of brown.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.570
The other houses, the
bits that show, are white.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.380
Elm trees, low hills, a
thin church steeple --

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.610
that gray-blue wisp -- or is it?

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.890
In the foreground a water
meadow with some tiny cows,

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.530
two brushstrokes each,
but confidently cows;

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.760
two minuscule white geese in
the blue water, back-to-back,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.280
feeding, and a slanting stick.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.310
Up closer, a wild iris,
white and yellow,

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.750
fresh-squiggled from the tube.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:55.780
The air is fresh and cold; cold
early spring clear as gray glass;

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.020
a half inch of blue sky below
the steel-gray storm clouds.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.220
They were the artist's specialty.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.910
A specklike bird is
flying to the left.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.370
Or is it a flyspeck
looking like a bird?

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:16.030
Heavens, I recognize
the place, I know it!

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.220
It's behind -- I can almost
remember the farmer's name.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.940
His barn backed on that meadow.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:27.140
There it is, titanium
white, one dab.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:32.510
The hint of steeple, filaments
of brush-hairs, barely there,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.860
must be the Presbyterian church.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.610
Would that be Miss
Gillespie's house?

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:43.150
Those particular geese and cows
are naturally before my time.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.850
A sketch done in an hour,
"in one breath," once taken

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.840
from a trunk and handed over.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.140
Would you like this?

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.680
I'll never have room to
hang these things again.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.070
Your Uncle George, no,
mine, my Uncle George,

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.090
he'd be your great-uncle,
left them all with Mother

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.390
when he went back to England.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:09.260
You know, he was quite famous,
an R.A. I never knew him.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:14.110 position:56%
We both knew this place, apparently,
this literal small backwater,

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:19.250
looked at it long enough to
memorize it, our years apart.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.650
How strange.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.530
And it's still loved,
or its memory is.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.630
It must have changed a lot.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.740
Our visions coincided --
"visions" is too serious a word --

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:37.430
our looks, two looks: art "copying
from life" and life itself,

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.660
life and the memory of it

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.310
so compressed they've
turned into each other.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.190
Which is which?

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:50.860
Life and the memory of it cramped,
dim, on a piece of Bristol board,

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.450
dim, but how live, how
touching in detail.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:00.810
The little that we get for free,
the little of our earthly trust.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:06.240
Not much. About the size of
our abidance along with theirs:

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.820
the munching cows, the
iris, crisp and shivering,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.710
the water still standing
from spring freshets,

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:19.000
the yet-to-be-dismantled
elms, the geese."

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.690
So, I'm going to look
at those Sam qualities.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.960 position:56%
Spontaneity is everywhere in "Poem."

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.130
The voice that speaks the
poem is itself as alive

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.680
as that shivering Iris, fresh
squiggled from the tube.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.760
As the speaker stops
and starts, asserts

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.100
and qualifies her assertions,
shifting in tone

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.330
from the parenthetical
aside, to the exclamatory.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:04.460 position:56%
From a collage bit of reported
dialogue, to a meditation on memory,

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:07.630
time and the intimacies of art.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:13.670
We feel as though we are hearing a
real person talking in real time.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:18.060
As if she's just there across
the table chatting with us.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.170
It's not chat, of course.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.050
Not tossed off or partially
considered.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.000
The poet has revised and revised,
toward that illusion of casual,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.410
off the cuff, in one
breath naturalness.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.020
It's an artificially
created naturalness.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:41.370
And artfully rehearsed spontaneity,
"Heavens, I recognized the place,

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:47.010
I know it," the speaker says,
as if she had just then realized

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.930
and is just now telling us.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:55.970
A just then, that happens over and
over, every time you read the poem.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:02.610
Hers is a spontaneity that endures
in the language of the poem.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:07.340
The next Sam quality, accuracy,
isn't just about sticking

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.150
to the facts, although Bishop
rarely veers from fact,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.080
in order to find some
kind of capital T, truth.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.550
Is there any such thing,
she might ask?

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.170
Her idea of accuracy isn't only

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:24.840
about the honest admission
of ugliness either.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.500
"That awful shade of brown,"

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:31.280
she says about her
beloved Nova Scotia houses.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.110
Nor is her accuracy only
for recalled details

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.580
like Miss Gillespie's
name or the size

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.000 position:56%
of American versus Canadian dollars.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.400
Bishop's accuracy isn't about
verisimilitude or realism, per say.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:53.110 position:56%
Although, sometimes a sort of
magnified, super realism may result.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.970
Her sort of accuracy is
in inherent in her precise

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.010
and uncannily strange images.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.810
A Toucan posed like an
inverted comma, say.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:09.750 position:56%
Or this passage in poem, "A
specklike bird is flying to the left

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.400
or is it a flyspeck
looking like a bird?"

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.580
These are accurate images
that show, in their accuracy,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.270
how weird the ordinary actually is.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.370
The size of things shifts

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.800
as that famous magnifying
eye finds its focus.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.790
A bird as tall and colorful as the
family size box of Froot Loops,

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.400
is compared to a tiny black comma.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.770
A painted gull, is compared
to a flying speck or a speck

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:47.280
of fly is mistaken
for a laughing gull.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.690 position:56%
In the precision and de-familiarized
strangeness of her images, "Heavens,

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:57.250
I recognize the thing," our
perspective shifts and aware

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.050
of our looking, we see with
sudden vividness and accuracy.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:05.750 position:56%
Although, sometimes the view is like
the one a suddenly giant Alice saw

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.570
through the wonderland keyhole.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:13.720
Or the one we see through the glass
in a Joseph Cornell assemblage.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.750
Bishop loved both, by the
way, Alice and Cornell.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.930
Sometimes her realism, as with
the trompe-l'oeil flyspeck,

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:29.450 position:56%
asks us to question the real, at the
same time as it seems represent it.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:35.520 position:56%
The last of the Sam the Toucan triad
of key poetic qualities is mystery.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.080
The one hardest to describe.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.680
But here's what I think it isn't.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.950
It isn't the dark murkiness
of imprecision.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.930
Or an answer withheld
until the who done it ends.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:54.210
Or some deep hidden meaning,
set down in Spark Notes.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.540
Bishop's mystery isn't
knowledge obscured

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.900
or withheld from us readers.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.140
It's not as something added
either, like a grating of nutmeg.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.690
Rather, it has something to
do with the way in "Poem,"

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.680
a very well-known poet

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.510
and an unknown outsider
artist, are connected.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.230
"How strange," she says.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.460
How strange that their
two looks should coincide,

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.730
compressing life and -- I'm sorry.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:26.090
And the memory of it, such that
they've turned into each other.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.060
Which is which?

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.170
Life or the memory of it?

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.110
The real or the language of it?

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.190
How strange art is.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.270
Listen again to the final lines.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.860
"But how live, how
touching in detail --

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.260
the little we get for free, the
little of our earthly trust.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.620
Not much. About the size of
our abidance along with theirs:

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.770
the munching cows, the
iris, crisp and shivering,

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.160
the water still standing
from spring freshets,

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.830
the yet-to-be-dismantled
elms, the geese."

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:10.910
Spontaneously alive in
voice, vision and language.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.620
Touchingly and ferociously
accurate in detail.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:20.430
And mysteriously simple,
the little we get for free.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:25.400
As birthdays remind us, it's
not much, these few years,

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.790
the size of our abidance.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:32.650
We are all of us like the green
and yet to be dismantled elms.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:38.560
At least part of the mystery
that animates a poem like "Poem"

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.780
or the "Sandpiper," "The
Moose," "Crusoe in England,"

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.740
all those great poems, is
the human connection we feel

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.800
to a somehow still
living greenish speaker.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.010
And the poet who gave her voice.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.400
It's the same mysterious
connection she feels

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.580
to the artist squiggling
paint from the tube.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.970
I think of influence like that.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.330
The greenish effect of connection.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.270
The connection you feel as you
read -- as your read -- sorry.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.260
I'm changing as I go.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:18.260
The connection you feel as you
read to a living presence there,

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:20.800
kind of beyond the
language in the poem.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.940
The person and the
maker of the poems.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.210
Heavens, I recognize you

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.540
in that sidestepped
rhyme, that formal reserve.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:38.500 position:56%
Or the way you made your sentence
sound so spontaneously off the cuff.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.290
Why not court that connection?

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.510
Why not listen and
accept its magnetic draw?

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.200
Far from feeling anxious

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.600
about Elizabeth Bishops
influence, I seek it.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.510
What the heck.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:56.700
And rather than wanting to copy
her or to outdo or supplant her,

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.570
as if I ever could, I hope
my work, all our poetry work,

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:05.660
helps her poetry, all
poetry, keep its green,

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.640
not yet dismantled Samminess.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.650
So, you'll hear for yourselves,
I'm about to read some poems.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.820
You'll hear if I've managed to
get anything Sammy into my poems.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:22.660
I'm going to read two
from the new book.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.310
The first of which is an
homage to my grandmother

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:33.710 position:56%
and also kind of sideways to Bishop.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:40.030
And my grandmother and Bishop
were about of a generation.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:44.330
Where's the poem?

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.830
They both were born in New
England and college educated.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:55.330
Which in that generation for
a woman was not that common.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.190
My grandmother kind of liked poems.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.280
She liked them especially
for other people.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:09.690
She thought everyone
should read them.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.570
But she loved wildflowers.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.260
That was her real passion.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.560
She would.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.690 position:56%
She's the first person who ever
said she thought I should be a poet.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.340
She gave me my first book
of poems that I ever owned,

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.090
which was the collected
Wallace Stevens.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.550
So, that's a pretty good one
when you're fourteen, you know.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.920
That's a place to start.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:35.310
But this poem is called
"Landscape with Blood Root."

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.110
"She demanded I pay attention.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.810
For example, to the
wildflowers we walked by.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:45.100
Not just the easy ones like Queen
Anne's lace or butter-and-eggs,

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:51.790 position:56%
but harder, stranger one's, trailing
arbutus, hepatica, dead man's pipes.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:56.330
To tell the truth, I didn't
always love, wholly, our walks

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.800
and her half stern,
half joking catechism.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.100
What's that?

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.440
What's that one called?

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.880
When she pointed to a flower I
couldn't name, we collected a sprig

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.500
to bring home to the other Bible.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.360
Her headstone heavy, precious,
we had to wash our hands first.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.410
North American wildflowers.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:22.630
She made it my work to count
the petals, assess the leaves.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.320
Seriated or smooth?

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.960
Lobed, alternate, waxy, downy?

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:34.310
Then keeping in mind the season and
context, field, slope, brook side.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:39.130
To page through my favorite
part and solve the mystery.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.350
We paired the real to the right
illustration and proper name.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:49.420
When I asked how a flower got
its name, why fleabane, cowslip,

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.050
Saint Johns, I thought it was wart

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:56.720
with an A. Some of
the stories she knew.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.660
Others I know now, she
made up whole cloth.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.830
And at least once, stumped
or who knows why now,

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.460
she asked me, why am I Martha?

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.300
Why are you Jenn?

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.310
She'd be saddened by
how much I've forgotten.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.540
Which celandine is greater?

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.670
Which blue aster is which?

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:22.060
And just where in the Cockaponset
Woods, her favorite pink white,

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:27.340
turning white, pink
turning white, arbutus grew.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.160
And perhaps grows still.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.220
I've not lost all together
though, her lessons.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.600
The habit of close attention.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.850
The pleasure of names and of
seeing in the actual sprig,

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.870
the guidebooks painted version.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:46.570
As well as the deep
harder, here to confess,

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:50.610
heart leaps of joy in recognition.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:54.270
As on an April wooded
hillside, when white,

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:59.390
gold stamen stars open among
the under rot, eight petaled,

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.520
from a basil rosette
of bluish lobed leaves.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:10.110
I can almost hear the name
in her voice, blood root."

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.240
This a brand new book for me.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.140
I've never read from it before.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:19.050
It just came out.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:23.380
This next one is called
"Landscape with Goats Eye."

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:29.380
And it takes place in India,
near Bodh Gaya, in Bodh Gaya,

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:34.040
where the historical Buddha
sat underneath the fig tree

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:39.940
until he reached enlightenment
or so the story goes.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.170
Landscape -- there's
a lot of goats there.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.380
"Landscape with Goats Eye."

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:50.960
"A page where the flipbook
of memories always opens.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.230
Or when thumbed through,
stutters and stops.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.540
The road is a pale dust track.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.610
The bullocks hoof beats muffled.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.690
Wooden cartwheels creek.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:08.740
On the horizon, the high fig
tree, fruitless in this season,

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.340
rocks with the jounce of the cart.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:17.050 position:56%
Through sleepy Bodh Gaya, a boy
rides his sloped shouldered buffalo,

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:21.530
past temples and t-stalls,
pilgrims and tourists.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:26.180
Among them, but refusing,
stubborn, the trees sacred shade.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.900
I buy bread and bananas
and feed the peels

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.810
and overripe bits to the goats.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:37.350
The dust is a variorum of tracks.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:40.030
The bullock's hooves beat steady.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.830
Wooden cart wheels' creak.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:49.770
On the horizon and overhead the
pale changeable cataracted sky.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:55.380
I set sweet rice aside on the
plate, practicing renunciation.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.610
Practicing restraint
or was it compassion?

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:05.410
And the goats bucked and
nudged, more than companionably.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:10.070
So much forgotten, but not that
goaty, cow licked, knobby head.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.350
The loose drape of her
ears and that fixed eye.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:20.450
A sliver of goat inscrutable gold
leaf, as if lifted from an icon

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:25.080
in the sky, barely
lustrous, sheer and creased.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:30.060
The road from the station is pale.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.890
The bullocks hoof beats.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.410
Weather chases.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.510
Wooden cartwheels creek.

Wearing froze in the dust."

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.740
And one more, a little
one, very different.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:53.330
I think still there's
some Bishop in it,

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.740
but not maybe as much as those two.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.710
This is from a book called
"Canticle of the Night Path."

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.920
And all the poems in it
are in the same rough form.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.460
That is, each has five things.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:13.500
Five couplets, five lines, five
sentences or five paragraphs.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:19.290
And it's about all that
they have in common,

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.440
but they're in alphabetical order.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.920
So, "Canticle of A"
is the first one.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.740
"An almanac of almost and
almonds amended accounts,

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.000
always askance, a slant.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.830
Ah, as chance would have it.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:39.170
An atlas at last of
aphorism and aftermath.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:45.650
Of master, oaker, mask and umber,
all had for an anaphoric song.

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:50.120
An archive of lives and
ghosts, haloed and halfcocked.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:56.730
A canticle of alpha to zed,
apple to zebra, aardvark to zarf.

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:02.640
A gospel of asters of ask her, of
azure assurance, not gone askew.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.560
And attar and atar
of roses and ashes.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.110
A Webster's of wishes.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.460
Word lists of what
if's and why not's.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.130
Wine cups kept ever brim full."

&gt;&gt; Vijay Seshadri: Well, I didn't
actually prepare any remarks,

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.050
which might be your misfortune

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:48.740
because I can ramble all
day about Elizabeth Bishop.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:56.870
And but what I'm actually
going to do is give you a sense

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.030
because Anya asked me to,
when we talked about this,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.140
of my relationship to her.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:10.700 position:56%
And I want to say first of all,
that I was one of the early adopters

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.080
of Elizabeth Bishop
before she became kind

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:21.180
of the agreed upon canonical poet

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.810
and you know the tong
wars of American poetry.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:27.490
The one that you know every
faction could say was a great poet.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.690
And you know that sort
of started happening

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:30.990
around the nineteen eighties.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:36.550
And I encountered Bishop because
of a very influential book,

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:39.570
when I was in an early reader
of poetry, was "Life Studies."

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.900
And of course, the great poem that
ends "Life Studies," "Skunk Hour,"

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.250
dedicated to Elizabeth Bishop.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:49.310
So, I knew the name, at a time
when she wasn't' very well read

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:55.190
in America and left out of major
anthologies and stuff like that.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.640
And she had kind of
had returned to America

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.680
from a long period in Brazil.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:06.170
And was trying to cobble
together a life up in Boston.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:11.260
And not many people knew about her

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.340
and things seemed to
have passed her by.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:20.240 position:56%
But she was always interesting to
me because of the Lowell connection.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.510
And because from sort of the
mid nineteen seventies on,

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.960
I worked in the fishing industry

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.990
on the West Coast, in
the Northwest Coast.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:32.540
And Bishop is of course, one
of the great maritime poets.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:36.500
And I had her book and I recognized
that immediately about her.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.940
And also the one connection
I had to literature

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.930
at that time was a
subscription to the New Yorker.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.730
And if you were a subscriber
of the New Yorker

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:53.360
in the nineteen seventies,
you would get the magazine

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.170
and I would read every week.

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:59.520
And every once in a while
a Bishop poem would appear.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.270
And these were the poems
in "Geography Three."

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:06.780
And they were kind of
masterpiece after masterpiece.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.800
I mean, they were just, you know,
it's a very, very small book.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.040
But you know about as perfect a
book of poetry as one can find.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.500
And I would read the poems
and be intrigued by them.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.930
I mean, I remember
a poem when it came

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:26.620
in the New Yorker and
"Crusoe in England."

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:33.010
And I can't remember the
sequence, but at a certain time,

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:41.120
in that period, the New
Yorker published the second

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.270
of Bishops two birthday poems.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:50.840
The first is one called
"The Bite," which is sort

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.640
of not necessarily
a favorite of mine.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:01.300
The second one is called "In
the Waiting Room," which I --

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.090
when I was teaching poetry, I
would introduce it to my students

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:09.740
by saying, this is the
greatest poem ever written.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.670
And then I would go on to say

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.490
that this is the greatest
poem ever written

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:17.440
because this is the greatest poem
that could possibly be written.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:22.040
Because it's about the absolute
limit of human experience.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.600
The thing that we recognize when
we recognize self and being.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:36.250
And that you know you cannot
aspire to a loftier subject.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.810
And you can never arrive at it.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.550
It will always slip away from you.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:45.580
And in fact, this is a
poem about almost arriving

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.260
at a certain fundamental
revelation, a certain enlightenment

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.870
and having it slip away from you.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:56.480
And so, I read this poem,
you know, when I was living

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.980
on the Oregon Coast
and it just dazzled me.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.750
So, this poet I had read,
who I thought was kind

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.700
of a good poet, you know.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:15.110
And I mean, who I had a lot of
respect for and had admired,

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:23.400
I think for a lot of reasons
that were adventitious, you know.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:29.730
She represented a kind of culture
that I regarded as authentic.

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:39.570
She was an embodiment of a certain
kind of down East, Anglo-Saxon,

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.520
non-conformism that
I recognized as kind

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.030
of a threat in American culture.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:50.880
She had, you know, what
Emerson famously called a

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.760
transparent eyeball.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.100
She just kind of, you
know, world reflected.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:33:00.810
I mean, when one reads Bishop
and sees the way she sees,

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:05.080
like you're always reminded of
that famous saying of [inaudible].

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:10.560 position:56%
And [inaudible] saying at one point,
"It is better to think than to do.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:15.760
Better to feel than to think,
but best of all nearly to look."

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.780
And she allows you to look and
look and look, inexhaustibly.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:23.630
And so, I recognize and
appreciated all of that.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:26.990
And I love the diction
and the natural tone.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.760
It connected me to other
writers, whom I admired,

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.660
in a kind of historical continuity.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.500 position:56%
Going back through Yeats to
Wordsworth, the conversational tone,

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.570
the commitment to prose order.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.250
All of those things I was
picking up because that was a time

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:46.490
when I was living in Oregon
when I was trying to make myself

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.910
into a poet, along with all
the other things I was doing.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:53.600
And you know and then I
came across this poem.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:34:03.880
And I realized that this person
who I thought was, you know,

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:11.760
a model of a certain kind of
literary virtue and a certain kind

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:19.590 position:56%
of clarity and simplicity and order,

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:24.730
was actually an incredibly
dramatically ambitions poet.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.150 position:56%
And I'll read "In the Waiting Room."

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:31.430
And then I will read kind

00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:36.730
of its companion poem,
"At the Fish Houses."

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:41.600
And this is the first
poem in "Geography Three."

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.180
"In the Waiting Room."

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.780
"In Worcester, Massachusetts,
I went with Aunt Consuelo

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.940
to keep her dentist's appointment
and sat and waited for her

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.580
in the dentist's waiting room.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.020
It was winter.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.220
It got dark early.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.190
The waiting room was full
of grown-up people, arctics

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:06.870
and overcoats, lamps and magazines.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:11.440
My aunt was inside what seemed
like a long time and while I waited

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.340
and read the National Geographic.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.090
I could read.

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.160
And carefully studied
the photographs:

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:24.290
the inside of a volcano, black, and
full of ashes; then it was spilling

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.840
over in rivulets of fire.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.890
Osa and Martin Johnson
dressed in riding breeches,

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:34.400
laced boots, and pith helmets.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:40.580
A dead man slung on a pole
"Long Pig," the caption said.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:45.680
Babies with pointed heads wound
round and round with string; black,

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.900
naked women with necks wound
round and round with wire

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.830
like the necks of light bulbs.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.840
Their breasts were horrifying.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.100
I read it right straight through.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.470
I was too shy to stop.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:08.030
And then I looked at the cover:
the yellow margins, the date.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:13.040
Suddenly, from inside, came an oh!

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:20.620
of pain, Aunt Consuelo's
voice not very loud or long.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:24.530
I wasn't at all surprised; even
then I knew she was a foolish,

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:25.980
timid woman.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.490
I might have been embarrassed,
but wasn't.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:34.510
What took me completely
by surprise was

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:40.370
that it was me: my
voice, in my mouth.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:46.680
Without thinking at all I
was my foolish aunt, I-- we--

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.190
were falling, falling, our
eyes glued to the cover

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:56.940
of the National Geographic,
February, 1918.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:03.650
I said to myself: three days
and you'll be seven years old.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.080
I was saying it to
stop the sensation

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:09.090
of falling off the
round, turning world.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.940
Into cold, blue-black space.

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:18.880
But I felt: you are an I, you are
an Elizabeth, you are one of them.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.410
Why should you be one, too?

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:27.040
I scarcely dared to look
to see what it was I was.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.840
I gave a sidelong glance --
I couldn't look any higher --

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:36.490 position:56%
at shadowy gray knees, trousers and
skirts and boots and different pairs

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:39.640
of hands lying under the lamps.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.700
I knew that nothing
stranger had ever happened,

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.760
that nothing stranger
could ever happen.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.530
Why should I be my
aunt, or me, or anyone?

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:56.840
What similarities boots, hands, the
family voice I felt in my throat,

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.040
or even the National Geographic

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:03.790
and those awful hanging
breasts held us all together

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:06.840
or made us all just one?

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:13.010
How I didn't know any word
for it how "unlikely".

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:19.080
How had I come to be here, like
them, and overhear a cry of pain

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:23.790
that could have got loud
and worse but hadn't?

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:26.720
The waiting room was
bright and too hot.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:33.670
It was sliding beneath a big
black wave, another, and another.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:36.050
Then I was back in it.

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:38.030
The War was on.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:42.640
Outside, in Worcester,
Massachusetts, were night and slush

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:48.000
and cold, and it was still
the fifth of February, 1918."

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:11.930
So, that is about that moment of
recognition, that moment of being.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:21.470
That we arrive and arrive and
arrive at and always, you know,

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:28.440
seem to slip past at the
moment of our arrival.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.620
And it's interesting,
at the end of her life,

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.630
she goes back to that experience.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:40.730
Which is sort of -- and she
frames it in an interesting way.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:44.270
She frames it in the
context of herself.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.420
Because that experience
has many facets.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:52.900
And you know often when you look at
Bishop as a whole, you tend to sort

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.430
of see her as a --
either a Christian poet

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:01.160
in a post Christian world or a
post Christian poet, you know,

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.530 position:56%
still laboring in a Christian world.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:08.010
And there's kind of that constant
tension, that doubling of her sort

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.180
of spiritual consciousness.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:19.160 position:56%
And you know and at the end of her
life she seems to have freed herself

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.590
from the contradictions
that sort of defined

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:26.200
and fructified her
poetry throughout its,

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.540
you know, flowering in her life.

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.760
And just gets back

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:37.740
to an irresolvable existential
core and dilemma, you know.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:41.430
And that is not really true about
the middle part of her career.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:48.220
It's sort of -- that question
isn't sort of reducible.

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:52.390
That question of being, isn't
reducible in the middle part

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:57.030
of her career, to merely the
existential condition of the South,

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:03.230
but has all of this sort of
doctrinal fullness to it.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:06.420
And an example of that is the
next poem I'm going to read

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:11.130
"At the Fishhouses,"
which is sort of --

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.060
you know, I guess in a
way the companion poem

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.240
to "In the Waiting
Room" in some way.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:22.610
And you know, I mean, I
think she tends to sort

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:28.640
of recycle motifs throughout
her career because --

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.090
well, for one reason
because she worked

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:31.830
on poems for so long, you know.

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.000
I mean, I think "The Moose" was

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.920
around for twenty-five years
before it got finished.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.420
I think it's late nineteen
forty-eight that she takes that,

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:46.230
you know, that bus ride
that "The Moose" describes.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:50.460
And she doesn't publish that poem
until the nineteen seventies.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:58.820
So, there's a kind of constant
return to certain ideas and themes,

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.580
which reflects a sort
of a temporal reality

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.560
in which she was always living.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.060
So, kind of really interesting.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.430
And I think even "Poem" has a --

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:13.560
I think that painting is actually
mentioned earlier in her work.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.720
I can't remember exactly
where it is now,

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.660
but you know that painting
comes back again at the end.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.020
So, it's sort of, you know.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:29.140
And this is sort of the theme of
"In the Waiting Room," conceived

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:32.330
and understood from a different
point of view entirely.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:34.850
"At the Fishhouses."

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.830
"Although it is a cold evening,

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:44.390
down by one of the fishhouses an
old man sits netting, his net,

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:48.930
in the gloaming almost
invisible, a dark purple-brown,

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.830
and his shuttle worn and polished.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:55.960
The air smells so strong of
codfish it makes one's nose run

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.360
and one's eyes water.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:03.240
The five fishhouses have
steeply peaked roofs and narrow,

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:08.230
cleated gangplanks slant up
to storerooms in the gables

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:12.330
for the wheelbarrows to
be pushed up and down on.

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:17.670
All is silver: the heavy surface
of the sea, swelling slowly

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:22.380
as if considering spilling
over, is opaque, but the silver

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:25.180
of the benches, the
lobster pots, and masts,

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:28.160
scattered among the
wild jagged rocks,

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.540
is of an apparent translucence
like the small old buildings

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:37.580
with an emerald moss growing
on their shoreward walls.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.570
The big fish tubs are
completely lined with layers

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:47.420 position:56%
of beautiful herring scales and the
wheelbarrows are similarly plastered

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:51.050
with creamy iridescent
coats of mail,

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:55.680
with small iridescent
flies crawling on them.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.020
Up on the little slope
behind the houses,

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:04.720 position:56%
set in the sparse bright sprinkle of
grass, is an ancient wooden capstan,

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.770
cracked, with two long bleached
handles and some melancholy stains,

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:15.120
like dried blood, where
the ironwork has rusted.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.340
The old man accepts a Lucky Strike.

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:21.270
He was a friend of my grandfather.

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:25.080
We talk of the decline in
the population and of codfish

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.430
and herring while he waits
for a herring boat to come in.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:32.950
There are sequins on his
vest and on his thumb.

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.540
He has scraped the scales,
the principal beauty,

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.350
from unnumbered fish with
that black old knife,

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.420
the blade of which
is almost worn away.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:49.490
Down at the water's edge, at the
place where they haul up the boats,

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:52.920
up the long ramp descending
into the water,

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:59.180 position:56%
thin silver tree trunks are laid
horizontally across the gray stones,

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:06.050
down and down at intervals
of four or five feet.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:11.570
Cold dark deep and absolutely
clear, element bearable

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:16.240
to no mortal, to fish and to seals.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:22.050
One seal particularly I have
seen here evening after evening.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.720
He was curious about me.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:31.550
He was interested in music; like
me a believer in total immersion,

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.730 position:56%
so I used to sing him Baptist hymns.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:39.360
I also sang "A Mighty
Fortress Is Our God."

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.230
He stood up in the water
and regarded me steadily,

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:45.460
moving his head a little.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:49.340
Then he would disappear,
then suddenly emerge almost

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:53.400
in the same spot, with a
sort of shrug as if it were

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.630
against his better judgment.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:46:02.720
Cold dark deep and absolutely
clear, the clear gray icy water.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:07.090
Back, behind us, the
dignified tall firs begin.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:10.340
Bluish, associating
with their shadows,

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:14.580
a million Christmas trees
stand waiting for Christmas.

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:20.620
The water seems suspended above the
rounded gray and blue-gray stones.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:25.830
I have seen it over and over,
the same sea, the same, slightly,

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:32.240 position:56%
indifferently swinging above the
stones, icily free above the stones,

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.940 position:56%
above the stones and then the world.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:38.800
If you should dip your hand in,
your wrist would ache immediately,

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.970
your bones would begin to
ache and your hand would burn

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:46.970 position:56%
as if the water were a transmutation
of fire that feeds on stones

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:50.120
and burns with a dark gray flame.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:54.980
If you tasted it, it would
first taste bitter, then briny,

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:57.950
then surely burn your tongue.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:04.420 position:56%
It is like what we imagine knowledge
to be: dark, salt, clear, moving,

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:09.790
utterly free, drawn from the
cold hard mouth of the world,

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:15.460
derived from the rocky breasts
forever, flowing and drawn,

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:21.000
and since our knowledge is
historical, flowing, and flown."

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.550
She always starts out so
low, so even, you know.

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:46.240 position:56%
It's just kind of a -- and you never
quite realize how much pressure is

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.540
building up.

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.550
Because the control is
so magnificent, you know,

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:54.580
the kind of -- the
mastery of the sentence.

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.500
The commitment to like living
the poem along the sentence

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.840
and seeing its opportunities
and expanding it outward,

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.900
but at the same time, there is
this other narrative taking place

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:11.570
in her mind that, you know, of
which we are just getting tiny

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:12.870
little glimpses.

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:15.920
You know, we don't quite
understand what's going on,

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:21.000
but the way in which she sort of
continually shepherds us, you know,

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.180
further and further and further.

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:25.290
Until she can't go
any further, you know.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:27.710
I mean, in some sense,
she kind of always arrives

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:30.230
at a limit that's fundamental
in some way I think.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:32.670
And you know I think one of the --

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:37.900
you know, I think a part of it has
always, when I've contemplated her.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.240
And of course, I've
contemplated her a lot.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:48.490
She was a poet who freed
me, along with Auden.

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:55.730
When I was kind of in my sort
of early and mid-twenties,

00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:00.740 position:56%
freed me from the terrible burden of
having to write like John Ashbery.

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.110
Because he was sort of,
like, when I was a kid,

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:07.720
I was a hip young poetry
reader and literature reader.

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.610
And Ashbery was really cool.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:13.260
This was, like, before
"Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror"

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:16.470
when he was sort of a
New York coterie figure.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:21.000 position:56%
And all the hip literary kids I knew
came from New York and they listened

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.240
to "The Velvet Underground"
and they read John Ashbery.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.800 position:56%
And I thought I had to be like them,

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.210
but I couldn't quite
be like them, you know.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:31.860 position:56%
And but I recognized the distinction
of someone like Ashbery and I sort

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:35.170
of felt, well, you know, I
had to find another model.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:37.340
And Bishop came along and
she was really a lifeline

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:38.950
for me in that way, you know.

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:46.230
And I sort of felt, like, oh, yeah,
you know, this is really great.

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:49.050
And it seems in some
way unmarked by time.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.660
It seems like there seems

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.790
to be something perennial
about these concerns.

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:55.970
They will always be
the same concerns.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:57.270
There's some -- seems

00:49:57.270 --> 00:50:06.170
to be something absolutely
eternal about the allegiance.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.900
You know, the allegiance
to language at this level.

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:13.380
The kind of recognition that
language is sort of a living thing

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:16.620
and you have to get out of its way
and let it do what it should do.

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:20.840
And then, you know, the
commitment to the world,

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:25.510
especially the visual world.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:31.880
And the yeah, there's
something beyond these kind

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.890
of games we're playing.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:39.300
And also I think there's
a kind of historicity too

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:45.840
because Bishop was never -- she
never abandoned the romantic ode.

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.610
You know, she's like kind of
the person of her generation

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:56.980
who continued to write them, after
people like Roethke and Lowell

00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:02.130 position:56%
and Berryman sort of let them go and
started trying to do something else.

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:06.390
She was kind of committed to that,
you know, to that great series

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:10.770
of poems that begin, you know, in
the seventeen nineties and move

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:12.180
up to her and she managed them.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:15.510
She managed them very beautifully.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:19.180
So, she was very important to me
and it's great to come down here

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:24.650
and sort of be allowed to
celebrate her, you know

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:28.330
and thank her in some way.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:29.910
Well, she's dead and gone.

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:34.580
She's not listening to
us, I'm sure, positive.

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:41.690
Anyway, I'm going to read a poem
of mine and which is a recent poem.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:52.980
And I guess it's sort of -- it's
Bishop-like in a lot of ways,

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:57.050
but it's also a celebration
of sight.

00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:06.000 position:56%
And it's a poem about my mother, who
is very old and kind of, you know

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.650
and in distressed physical
condition now.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:19.580
And she also is, like Bishop,
is a strong and scrutable woman.

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.670
The poem is called,
"Your Living Eyes."

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:28.530
They wheeled you, your caregivers
did, to the picture window

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:31.360
to watch the birds
fretting at the feeder.

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:35.330
Then they forgot you
there and you forgot them.

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:39.180
A thousand years later, the
angel of death sidled in,

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.610
disguised as a little girl.

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:46.420
Clutching at her pinafore and
chewing the ends of her pigtails.

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:50.570
She had a look whose
vacancy was over rehearsed.

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:54.410
But I hear your interview
with her went well.

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:56.900 position:56%
I hear actually, that it went better

00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:00.430
than anybody could
ever thought it would.

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:05.970
She said, "beauty and
sadness are never far apart."

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:09.010
You said, "bullshit."

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:16.310 position:56%
She said, "some birds are real, some
are invisible, but which are which?"

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:19.940
You said, "back off, bitch."

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.410
She stared out the window.

00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:26.080
Her eyes narrowed,
but they didn't touch.

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:28.050
What was she seeing?

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:31.550
What was she saying to herself?

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:35.400
Do I know or do I care?

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.530
Enough with these impassive forces.

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:40.930
This one or that other one,

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:46.070
the one who gave you life,
you, who gave me life.

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:49.540
The yellow of the finches
is as molten as ever,

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.320
splashing on the holly bushes.

00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:57.910 position:56%
The moon, pale white inside the pale
blue morning, dropping its panicles

00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:02.330
of glass on the bright
grass, is climbing up.

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:05.420
But the sun is climbing down.

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:10.250
The world your eyes see is
the world as it really is.

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:14.040
And you and I are going
to live in it forever.

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:18.190
And we will hitchhike to
the painted hills together

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:20.440
and hop a freight back home."

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:23.510
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Mark Manivong: Good
afternoon, I'm Mark Manivong,

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.890
curator in the Rare Book and
Special Collections Division.

00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:44.960
First of all, I'd like to thank
our readers for being here today

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:47.500
and also the Poetry
and Literature Center.

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:50.150
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:52.080
I'd like to thank the
Poetry and Literature Center

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.330 position:56%
for organizing this wonderful event.

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:57.820
In addition to the
rare book collection,

00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:59.750
our renowned rare book
collection, The Rare Book

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:02.760
and Special Collections
Division, we also hold more

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.760
than a hundred special collections.

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.960
One of which is our Poets
Laureate Collection.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.250
Which is our attempt to
bring together all the works

00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:16.880
of the Poets Laureate in the United
States and have a repository here

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:20.880
at the home of Poet Laureate.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.510
Elizabeth Bishop, having
been a Poet Laureate,

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:25.730
is represented in this collection.

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:28.120
And I've brought together
several things

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.790
that she produced and that we hold.

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:33.170
The first of which
is the first edition

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:35.890
of her first book,
"North and South."

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:41.320
As well as the book that won
her the Pulitzer Prize, poems,

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:46.020
"North and South, A Cold
Spring, nineteen fifty-five.

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:52.610 position:56%
And in addition to just our, you
know, first editions and monographs,

00:55:52.610 --> 00:56:01.010
we also hold broadsides, chapbooks
and also bibliographical oddities.

00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:05.020
One of which is up
here called "The Fish."

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:06.720
And that's a broadside
that was produced

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.950
by David Eshee [assumed
spelling] of Seattle.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:12.930
He was a book seller
and an avid fisherman.

00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:17.780
And he decided at some
point to have a broadside

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:20.270
of her poem "The Fish," produced.

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:23.150
Mainly to distribute to
friends, but of course,

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:27.550
it was an unauthorized
copy of her poem.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:32.680
And when he approached her and
asked her to sign it, she refused.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:35.800
She did relent a couple of years
later, when he attended one

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.270 position:56%
of her readings and asked her again.

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.330
So, that's up here.

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:42.690
It's one of twelve
copies that were produced.

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:45.610
We're one of the few
institutions that hold it.

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:48.200
And we just acquired this,
so you'll be the first people

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.340
to see it up here.

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:52.750
So, that's all I have.

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:54.310
Please do stop up.

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:57.270
I have a list of works
exhibited at the end

00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:59.730
of the table, please help yourself.

00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:02.170
And feel free to ask
me any questions.

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:03.970
Thank you.
