00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.020
- [Voiceover] The Maclaurin
series for a function f

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.544
is given by, they give it
to us in sigma notation

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:06.883
and then they expand it out for us,

00:00:06.883 --> 00:00:08.551
and converges to f of x

00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:11.525
for the absolute value
of x being less than R,

00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:13.917
where R is the radius of convergence

00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:16.108
of the Maclaurin series.

00:00:16.108 --> 00:00:17.275
Part a.

00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:20.128
Use the ratio test to find R.

00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:22.645
So first of all, if terms
like Maclaurin series

00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:23.961
and radius of convergence

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.985
or even convergence or ratio test

00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:28.992
seem foreign to you or you
have some foggy memories of it,

00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:30.752
you might want to review
all of those concepts

00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:31.659
on Khan Academy.

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.155
We actually have multiple
videos and exercises

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:37.026
on each of these concepts on Khan Academy.

00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:38.281
But if you kind of know what it is,

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.086
I will give you a little bit of a reminder

00:00:40.086 --> 00:00:42.228
for the ratio test.

00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:47.139
So the ratio test tells us if
we have an infinite series,

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:50.022
so we go from n equals one to infinity,

00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:51.901
and each term is a sub n,

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:53.924
the ratio test,

00:00:53.924 --> 00:00:56.386
ratio test,

00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:59.782
says alright, let's consider the ratio

00:00:59.782 --> 00:01:01.307
between successive terms.

00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:05.002
So we could say the
ratio of a sub n plus one

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.262
over a sub n

00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:08.592
and in particular we want to focus on

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:11.938
the absolute value of this ratio.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.128
And this by itself, it
might not be a constant

00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:15.384
like we would see in a geometric series,

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:18.222
it actually might be a
function of n itself.

00:01:18.222 --> 00:01:20.671
And so we want to see the
behavior of this ratio

00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:22.395
as n gets really, really, really large,

00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:23.980
as we're kind of adding those terms

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.739
as we're getting close to infinity.

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:30.559
So we want to take the limit
as n approaches infinity here.

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:33.867
And if this limit
exists, let's say it's L,

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:38.700
and if L is less than one,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.813
then the series,

00:01:41.813 --> 00:01:45.923
the series converges.

00:01:45.923 --> 00:01:47.035
So what we're gonna want to do,

00:01:47.035 --> 00:01:49.203
and if L is greater than one, it diverges,

00:01:49.203 --> 00:01:52.380
if it's equal to one, it's inconclusive.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.083
And so what we want to do here is

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:56.422
we want to figure out the
absolute value of the ratio here,

00:01:56.422 --> 00:01:59.184
take the limit and then see

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:02.023
for what x values does that limit,

00:02:02.023 --> 00:02:05.113
will that limit be less than one?

00:02:05.113 --> 00:02:06.061
So let's do that.

00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.540
So let's first think about this ratio.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.483
So a sub n plus one

00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:13.713
over a sub n

00:02:13.713 --> 00:02:15.372
is going to be equal to...

00:02:15.372 --> 00:02:18.298
So if we put n plus one
into this expression here,

00:02:18.298 --> 00:02:19.505
we're gonna have...

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.084
so let me make this clear,

00:02:21.084 --> 00:02:22.594
So I'm gonna do a sub n plus one up here,

00:02:22.594 --> 00:02:25.622
so we're gonna have negative three,

00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:28.352
and I could write to the n
plus one instead of an n,

00:02:28.352 --> 00:02:29.861
and then minus one, so it would be

00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:33.134
n plus one minus one.

00:02:33.134 --> 00:02:34.947
Well plus one minus one is just zero

00:02:34.947 --> 00:02:35.933
so that's just the same thing as

00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:40.059
negative three to the n,
times x to the n plus one,

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.726
x to the n plus one,

00:02:42.726 --> 00:02:45.960
over n plus one.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.893
So that's a sub n plus one there.

00:02:47.893 --> 00:02:49.956
And a sub n, well that's just

00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:52.854
negative three to the n minus one

00:02:52.854 --> 00:02:57.135
times x to the n over n.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:00.470
So what does this right
over here simplify to?

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.787
This is going to be equal to,

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:05.415
well we could just say
this divided by that's

00:03:05.415 --> 00:03:06.971
the same thing as multiplying by

00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:08.922
the reciprocal of all
of this stuff down here.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:13.519
So it's negative three to the n,

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.007
x to the n plus one

00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:18.657
over n plus one,

00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:21.553
times the reciprocal of this business.

00:03:21.553 --> 00:03:26.399
So times n over

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.809
negative three to the n minus one,

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.775
x to the n.

00:03:31.775 --> 00:03:33.672
And so can we simplify this?

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.715
Well we can divide both the
numerator and the denominator

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.273
here by x to the n.

00:03:37.273 --> 00:03:39.494
So this divided by x to the n is just one.

00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:43.032
This divided by x to
the n is going to be x,

00:03:43.032 --> 00:03:44.771
or x to the first power.

00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:46.197
And we can divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:03:46.197 --> 00:03:48.476
by negative three to the n minus one.

00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:49.915
Well this is just going to be one.

00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:51.624
And if you divide negative three to the n

00:03:51.624 --> 00:03:54.104
by negative three to the n
minus one, well that's just

00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:56.276
going to be negative
three to the first power.

00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:58.084
So this is all going to be

00:03:58.084 --> 00:04:02.304
negative three x n

00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:07.244
over n plus one.

00:04:07.244 --> 00:04:08.923
So now let's think about what the limit

00:04:08.923 --> 00:04:10.859
of the absolute value of this

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.885
as n approaches infinity is.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.950
So the limit

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.550
the limit as n approaches infinity

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.356
of the absolute value

00:04:20.356 --> 00:04:24.016
of negative three x n

00:04:24.016 --> 00:04:26.716
over n plus one.

00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:28.858
Now some of you might
recognize if we focus on n,

00:04:28.858 --> 00:04:31.607
we have the same degree up
here, same degree down here,

00:04:31.607 --> 00:04:34.373
it's both n to the first,
so these are going to,

00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:37.144
the n over n plus one is
going to approach one.

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:38.365
And so you might say "Okay,
well this is going to be

00:04:38.365 --> 00:04:40.858
the absolute value of negative three x",

00:04:40.858 --> 00:04:42.589
but if you want to make
that a little bit clearer

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:44.470
this is equal to the limit

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.460
as n approaches infinity of,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.745
and I'll write it this way,

00:04:51.745 --> 00:04:55.098
so I could write the absolute
value of negative three x

00:04:55.098 --> 00:04:58.057
or the absolute value of negative
three x is the same thing

00:04:58.057 --> 00:05:01.827
as three times the absolute value of x

00:05:01.827 --> 00:05:06.015
times the absolute value of,

00:05:06.015 --> 00:05:08.816
if I divide the numerator
here by n, I would get one

00:05:08.816 --> 00:05:11.656
and if I divide the
denominator by n, I could do...

00:05:11.656 --> 00:05:14.619
if I multiply or divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:16.902
by the same thing, I'm
not changing the value.

00:05:16.902 --> 00:05:19.151
So if I divide both of them by n,

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.334
in the numerator I just get one,

00:05:20.334 --> 00:05:24.122
in the denominator, n divided by n is one,

00:05:24.122 --> 00:05:27.979
one divided by n is plus one over n.

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.191
And so this might be a
little bit clearer that

00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:32.509
as n approaches infinity,
well we don't know,

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.103
this doesn't deal with n.

00:05:34.103 --> 00:05:37.379
But this over here, one over
n is going to approach zero,

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.353
and so this whole thing
is going to approach one

00:05:39.353 --> 00:05:40.898
and so the limit is going to be

00:05:40.898 --> 00:05:44.246
three times the absolute value of x.

00:05:44.246 --> 00:05:47.529
And so remember, this series converges

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.757
if this limit is less than one.

00:05:51.757 --> 00:05:53.944
So converges,

00:05:53.944 --> 00:05:55.954
converges,

00:05:55.954 --> 00:06:00.294
converges if three times
the absolute value of x

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:01.758
is less than one.

00:06:01.758 --> 00:06:04.126
Or we could say the absolute value of x,

00:06:04.126 --> 00:06:05.995
just divide both sides by three,

00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:08.352
is less than one third.

00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:12.703
And so we have just found
our radius of convergence.

00:06:12.703 --> 00:06:16.066
So we could say R is equal to one third.

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:18.263
This Maclaurin series is going to converge

00:06:18.263 --> 00:06:20.689
as long as the absolute value of x

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.209
is less than one third.

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:28.021
Or we could say our radius
of convergence is equal to,

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:31.520
our radius of convergence
is equal to one third.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.473
So there you go.
