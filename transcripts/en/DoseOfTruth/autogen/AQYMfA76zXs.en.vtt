00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:12.325
 I wanted to ask you a few things about that. 

00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:16.700
 From the Big 5 personality theory research has been done into political differences. 

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:21.400
 This shows that liberals score high on openness and low on care. 

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:22.800
 For conservatives that is the other way around. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.700
 You can further divide care into orderliness and diligence with the Big 5 aspect scale. 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.700
 Orderliness is strongly associated with disgust. 

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:35.765
 Haidt: that sounds very Freudian. 

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:37.815
 Indeed, it sounds that way. 

00:00:37.815 --> 00:00:41.900
 But it also fits with your observations that, for example, conservatives keep their spaces tidier. 

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:45.065
 Haidt: And their meetings start on time. 

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:47.185
 Exactly, haha. 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.900
 So there seems to be a connection between political views and being open to new experiences, urge to explore, which you mentioned 

00:00:56.025 --> 00:01:01.500
 researching ideas and creativity, and little orderliness. 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.600
 And then I thought: why should political views be associated with these personality dimensions? 

00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:09.285
 These have relatively little correlation among themselves. 

00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:12.105
 Then I thought, and this is in line with your disgust work, 

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.555
 that it is actually about limits. 

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:20.300
 That seems self-evident after Trumps election campaign, in which he spoke about boundaries. 

00:01:20.395 --> 00:01:28.900
 But you could reasonably say that conservatives want to keep the boundaries between categories intact. 

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:31.955
 At every level of analysis. 

00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:42.900
 From the highest level of refinement in thinking to the physical level of the boundaries of rooms, cities, states, countries, everything. 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.500
 These limits must be stricter. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.300
 Why do they want that? There was an article in PLoS One a few years ago. 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.900
 It was staggering, as far as I was concerned, it should have been front-page news. 

00:01:54.095 --> 00:02:01.200
 The researchers had investigated the correlation in different countries and provinces within countries 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:11.200
 between the prevalence of infectious diseases and authoritarian political views. 

00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:16.000
 They found an enormously high correlation, something like 0.6. 

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:21.700
 For those unfamiliar with social science research, such a high correlation is never found. 

00:02:22.605 --> 00:02:23.105
 Haidt: Except in the case of heredity. 

00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:25.605
 Indeed, except in the case of heredity. 

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:34.300
 So they found that the higher the prevalence of infectious diseases, the more people tended to totalitarian, authoritarian political views. 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.645
 And then they ruled out the influence of the local government, 

00:02:36.645 --> 00:02:42.100
 for they wanted to know whether this belief in authority was imposed from above, or had developed from below. 

00:02:42.565 --> 00:02:45.365
 The latter turned out to be the case. 

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:50.100
 I approached this from two perspectives at the same time. 

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:55.305
 We have established the link between sensitivity to disgust and orderliness. 

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:57.700
 You can call this a fundamental component. 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.475
 Then I read the book of Hitler's table discussions. 

00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:07.600
 It contains the contents of everything Hitler said at dinner between 1939 and 1942. 

00:03:08.095 --> 00:03:11.215
 His spontaneous expressions. 

00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:18.900
 It contains many discussions of Jews and gypsies and all the people he tormented. 

00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:21.915
 But what's interesting: all his language is full of disgust. No fear. 

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:30.000
 Hitler's basic metaphor was that the Aryan race and country was a pure body. 

00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:33.445
 And that it was attacked by parasites. 

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:36.435
 Then I remembered what happened to the original Americans when the Europeans appeared and shook hands with them. 

00:03:36.435 --> 00:03:42.200
 95% of them died of chickenpox and measles within 50 years. 

00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:48.400
 So the subject of borders distinguishes conservatives from liberals. 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.000
 Conservatives say: what's new is potentially contaminated. 

00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:58.000
 Not so dangerous, that is different, that would be fear, but it is infected. 

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:03.500
 Liberals say: wait a minute, if you make the boundaries too firm, information can no longer pass through. 

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:06.415
 Haidt: Exact. That is the omnivore's dilemma. 

00:04:06.415 --> 00:04:11.500
 Right. And because we have a biological structure on which our cognitive constructions rest 

00:04:11.615 --> 00:04:19.000
 we approach abstract information, such as ideas, the same as food, or illness. 

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:25.600
 So we can find ideas invasive, or polluting, or contaminated. 

00:04:25.675 --> 00:04:28.815
 Haidt: I'm a big fan of George Lakoff's Metaphores We Live By. 

00:04:28.815 --> 00:04:34.800
 We use our body schemas to think about abstract things like politics. 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.900
 About what the policy on borders and immigration should be. 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.900
 A Canadian psychologist, Mark Schaller, and his colleagues developed a theory about this 'behavioral immune system'. 

00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:54.800
 Bacteria probably killed many more of our ancestors than lions, tigers and bears. 

00:04:55.045 --> 00:05:00.500
 So if you can protect yourself and your children against deadly diseases, you are the winner in evolution. 

00:05:00.515 --> 00:05:05.000
 Much depends on careful assessment of people: is he dangerous? Is she dangerous? 

00:05:05.995 --> 00:05:08.915
 That applies to sex and other interpersonal intercourse. 

00:05:09.105 --> 00:05:17.100
 So yes, our emotions and our physical interactions shape how we think and feel about things ... 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:26.000
 Even with the plague epidemic in Europe, which appeared when Europeans started traveling the world and brought rats that were infected. 

00:05:26.935 --> 00:05:29.425
 There you saw those forces at work at the same time. 

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:36.000
 The European expansion produced a great exchange of ideas from all over the world, that is globalization. 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.125
 But it also eradicated between 30 and 60% of the population.
