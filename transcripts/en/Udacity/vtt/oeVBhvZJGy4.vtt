00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.440
Alright. Now that you know what we mean about objects, fields, and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.560
records, you can get back to the Festival app with Samantha and Andy.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.710
&gt;&gt; Alright, cool. So we've made some progress, right? We added some fields,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.130
I guess, what should we do next?

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.960
&gt;&gt; So let's go back to the Cloudstock record that we

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.270
already created, and then add values to the fields we just created.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.820
&gt;&gt; I don't know if that makes sense. Cloud

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.620
stock. Okay cool, so right, that's awesome. So the

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.020
fields are there, they're not, they're empty I guess,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.100
that makes sense. Do I just hit edit I guess?

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.500
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.150
&gt;&gt; Alright, so let's give it a start date. How about November 29th?

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.960
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:50.130
&gt;&gt; Okay. an end date. Let's do like, December 1st. It's going to be a weekend

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.730
festival. Let's say it can have 10,000

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.500
people, and we haven't sold any tickets yet.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.930
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.430
&gt;&gt; All

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.310
right, cool. Now we've got our festival object. It's got

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.380
all these fields. I think of it in terms spreadsheets.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.880
I'm not a sales force guru like you are. so

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.330
how, what should we do in that sort of thinking?

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.290
&gt;&gt; So if we're going to think about it like a

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.640
spreadsheet, let's take a look on the a tablet. We have

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.760
our name, and so that's Cloud Stock, and we have

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.290
our start date and our end date, can hold 10,000 people.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.330
And we haven't sold any tickets yet. Womp, womp. Really

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.020
we have all of our fields here along the top.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.880
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.780
&gt;&gt; And this is our record that we created just now. But where does

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.420
attendees fall into this? Do we create

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.820
another column for that? What do you think?
