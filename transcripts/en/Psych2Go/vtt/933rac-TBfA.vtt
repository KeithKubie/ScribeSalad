00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.089
According to the World Health organization,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.369
Roughly 800,000 people commit suicide every year along with many more suicide attempts

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.200
Suicide is the highest leading cause of death for people 15 to 29 years old

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.019
second highest among ages 15 to 34 and third highest among ages 10 to 14

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.229
There are many factors that increase the Likelihood of suicide

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.110
Here are the three most common factors

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.580
number 1. Major Depression

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.480
Major depression affects people both physically and psychologically

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.380
It can cause painful body aches and impairs the victims ability to see cognitive solutions

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.079
This distortion of cognition causes people who commit suicide to believe the world would be a better place without them

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.470
number 2. Loss of control

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.859
Impulsive tendencies leads to a lack of control resulting in maladaptive behaviors such as substance abuse

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.180
impulsivity breeds fear and anxiety which causes people to believe suicide is the only action they can take to put an end to

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.369
maladaptive thoughts or behaviors

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.840
Number 3. overwhelming regrets

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.280
most cultures believe that making a mistake is a sign of failure

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.900
Also, some people internalize their mistakes to the point of believing they're beyond forgiveness

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.820
This may cause them to believe the only reprimand that would bring justice to the act they committed is suicide

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.999
Many argue that suicide is a senseless act

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.460
But one's cognition has the ability to make sense of the most senseless things, especially if they have major depression or impulsivity

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.540
Prior to the Act of suicide there is a process of negative thoughts that manifest in physical and mental pain

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.909
The Act of suicide is seen as cathartic for people who suffer from guilt

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.260
Understanding that suicide makes sense to the suicidal person is an important step to getting them the help they need

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.258
One Major sign of Suicide is withdrawal

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.339
Withdrawal can be linked to one feeling shame for thinking about suicide or believing their feelings aren't being heard or acknowledged

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.849
reacting to the signs of suicide without stigma or shame could be the key to establishing a dialog with a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.920
suicidal person and getting them the proper treatment
