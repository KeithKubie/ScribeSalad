00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.910
We're here with Nadya again, and

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.900
we're going to talk about
the stages of design sprint.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.130
But let's first talk about
what is a design sprint?

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.240
&gt;&gt; Well that's a great question.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.890
Design sprints started at Google
about five years ago, and since

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.820
then have become a powerful movement
that helps product teams at Google,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.630
our developers and companies in the
industry, solve design problems quickly.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.180
&gt;&gt; And
what are the stages of a design sprint?

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.960
&gt;&gt; So a design sprint always
starts in the planning stage.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.560
That's potentially
the most important one.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.810
The design sprint is run by
a person called a sprint master.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.010
We found that sprints that have
a designated person who's in charge of

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.540
the event, and in charge of the team
lead to much higher satisfaction and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.260
to be much higher deliverables.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.060
So we always want to have a point
person who is organizing.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.270
This could be the PM on your team, or
this could be your CEO, this could be

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.970
the designer, or it could be you,
regardless of whatever role you play.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.190
The role of the sprint master is first
to identify the challenge that the team

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.500
should be solving.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.820
If that is not clear, it's very hard for
anyone to make progress.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.210
Second, the role of the sprint
master is to assemble the team.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.110
We want to invite all the right talent,
and that's the most important part.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.650
If you don't have a team,
the sprint doesn't really happen.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.400
One of the benefits of the sprints
is that you don't always have

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.200
all the talent that you want,
but you can get them.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.090
Because the sprints are short,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.430
you can invite people who
are not from your team.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.270
So for example, if you and I are running
a sprint, and we didn't have a designer

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.720
or researcher, we could ask one of our
colleagues who is in another team or

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.590
another company, to join us for
two to five days.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.550
No one wakes up in the morning
hoping to have a boring day.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.410
And when you invite them on a sprint,
they usually say yes.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.850
And they have fun, and they help
you solve something quickly, and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.272
really benefit your team.

00:01:51.272 --> 00:01:54.438
&gt;&gt; And
what are the next stages after planning?

00:01:54.438 --> 00:01:58.475
&gt;&gt; Okay, so the design sprint framework
is based on the understanding of design

00:01:58.475 --> 00:01:59.104
thinking.

00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:02.407
So anyone who is a designer might
find these things familiar and

00:02:02.407 --> 00:02:04.670
very comfortable to practice.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.630
The good news is that if you've never 
practiced design, this is very,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.190
very easy to learn.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.990
Generally, there's six problem-solving
stages of design sprints.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.110
The first is designing the challenge.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.370
You have to do that.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.920
Once you have done with that,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.180
you start six problem-solving
ways of attacking this challenge.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.760
The first is to understand.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.520
Understanding a challenge is very,
very important.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.780
There's a great quote that I love
that says, first seek to understand,

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.240
then to be understood.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.350
Many teams fail because
they start attacking their

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.410
products based on the solutions
that they have in their heads.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.450
And they do not understand the customer,
the requirements and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.900
technology that they have.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.780
So what you recommend in sprint
is to start with lightning talks.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.810
You quickly want to hear from everybody
in the team that can represent 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.100
a particular perspective, and
generally the most useful are three.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.440
First, you want to hear
about the business goals.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.750
We believe that good
design is good business.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.120
And we always invite
the stakeholders of the business to

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.790
tell us about their objectives.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.770
In a startup,
that may be the CEO of the company, or

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.280
it could be someone who's
really in charge of revenue.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.060
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.760
&gt;&gt; It's useful to have them there.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.600
They can bring valuable perspective so

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.230
that the designers are not running
away from the goals of the company.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.740
Second, we want to hear
from the engineers.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.920
Designers and engineers go together
like peanut butter and jelly.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.270
You need them in the room, because,
if the designers create something that

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.660
the engineers cannot deliver,
it sort of doesn't matter.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.140
So the engineers are there to tell
us what is feasible right now,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.890
what is the code able to achieve?

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.760
And what are they able to do, sort of,
within the parameters of this sprint?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.630
So this is a business stakeholder's 
technology, what's missing?

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.840
Well, you can create a startup, but

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.780
you cannot create an audience if you
don't have a perspective of the user.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.720
So what's really important
is to bring a perspective

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.090
that tells the sort of potential
users of the product that we have.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.580
A lot of companies are not sure of
who their perspective user is, so

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.680
it's useful to invite the first
kind of ideas that you have about

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.300
who might this be impacting.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.680
And if you're not sure,
you can invite different groups.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.250
For example, if you're creating
a news app, you can invite people

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.150
who are news reader and
read the New York Times on paper, and

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.280
people who love reading
the newspapers on their iPad.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.640
And then people who don't
read the news at all.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.635
And by learning what each group needs,

00:04:31.635 --> 00:04:34.184
you're able to tackle 
a quite broad set of users.

00:04:34.184 --> 00:04:36.961
By hearing their opinions
in the beginning,

00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:41.712
reviewing user research that's relevant,
and talking to users directly,

00:04:41.712 --> 00:04:44.649
the sprint becomes so
much more well informed.

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:48.270
And the chances that they'll miss
something are so much lower.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.150
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.120
So we talked about understanding, and
we talked about planning before that.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.810
What is the next stage?

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.020
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.846
The design sprint in the series of
intellectual motions that allows us to

00:05:00.846 --> 00:05:03.462
open their minds and then focus again.

00:05:03.462 --> 00:05:08.226
We believe that we shouldn't just jump
through solution we should learn as much

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:11.353
as possible and
then focusing on the best choices and

00:05:11.353 --> 00:05:14.010
through that we end up
with better results.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.030
After the distant phase, which opens
everybody's mind, we have another phase,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.750
which is about definition.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.710
That is the phase that helps the team
understand what is the strategy they

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.890
want to pursue.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.720
So, at this stage, we tend to look at
the user journey that we want to take

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.290
the user on, so, for example, if we're
creating an onboarding flow, this may

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.160
look at the major steps along the way of
someone signing up for a new service.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.540
Or, if you're creating a new product,
this may take you from all the stages

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.140
that are key to someone learning about
your product, discovering it, the first

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.510
time they use it, the first time they
return, and what we wish to everyone is

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.250
that users become their master
powerful evangelizers, where they're

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.030
coming over and over to the product,
and they're really enjoying using
