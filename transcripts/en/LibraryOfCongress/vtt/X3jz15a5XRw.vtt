00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.820
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Hello, everyone.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.120
Welcome to the Law Library

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.460
of Congress's 2017
Constitution Day Program.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.750
Each year the Law Library
is happy to sponsor a talk,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.450
or somehow commemorate the event,
for the Nation's Constitution Day.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.500
My name is Jane Sanchez.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.400
And I have the honor to serve
as Law Librarian of Congress.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.360
It is my pleasure to welcome
each and every one of you today.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.720
Please note that today's program is
being live streamed on the Library

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.690
of Congress's Facebook page
and the YouTube channel,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.710
so all remarks including comments

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.520
and questions will be
captured on the video.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.280
Also, if any of you have cell
phones, please silence them now.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.550
Constitution Day, officially
known as Constitution Day

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.780 position:56%
and Citizenship Day, is observed
each year to commemorate the signing

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.500
of the U.S. Constitution
on September 17, 1787.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.500
Constitution Day recognizes all
who, excuse me, Constitution Day,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.840
and I quote, recognizes all who, by
coming of age or by naturalization,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.720
have become citizens, end
quote, of our great Nation.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.980
We can thank Senator Robert
C. Byrd of West Virginia,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.620
who included key provisions
designating September 17th

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.360
as Constitution Day
and Citizenship Day

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.980
in the Consolidated
Appropriations Act of 2005.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.730
Who said budget acts don't also
include something important?

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:15.260
The Act required all public
schools and governmental offices

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.950
to provide educational
programs in an effort

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.710
to promote a better understanding
of the U.S. Constitution.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.580
For the Law Library of Congress,
excuse me, for the Library,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.870 position:56%
the Law Library annually develops a
program or talk to honor the history

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.500
of the U.S. Constitution,
and the freedoms

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.860
that the Constitution grants
to all American citizens.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.700
The U.S. Constitution,
signed 230 years ago,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.230
has undergone many amendments.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.550
However, it remains the longest
surviving charter of government

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.390
to inspire democratic
ideals, and principles

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.960
of freedom throughout the world.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:08.360
In fact, in 1791, the Polish
Constitution was the first European

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.390
Constitution adopted after
the American Constitution.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.840
Established May 3rd,
1791, less than two years

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.400
after the U.S. Constitution, it
reflected the American ideals

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.620
of equality, federalism
and individual liberties.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.810
Ultimately it inspired democratic
changes throughout Europe.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.880
And now a little bit
about the Law Library.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.720
The Law Library of Congress, with
more than 2.9 million volumes

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.550
of American, foreign and
international legal materials,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.020
is often called upon
to assist countries

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.990
that are writing their
constitutions.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.970
For example, in 2016, we
provided legal research

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.020 position:56%
to the Sri Lankan Parliament as they
prepared to write a new constitution

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.480 position:56%
as they regrouped after a civil war.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.780 position:56%
Likewise, the Law Library has worked

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.520
with legislators in
emerging democracies.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.170
For example, we have
provided legal research

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.800
to the House Democracy Partnership,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.880
a commission of the U.S.
House of Representatives.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.850
So it is quite fitting that we
are hosting the Library's Annual

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.230
Constitution Day Program.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.050
Although we're a little
early this year

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.580
since it officially
is September 17th.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.210
And now I'd like to
introduce our speaker.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.590
We are honored today

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.230 position:56%
to host Constitutional Law Professor
Michael J. Klarman, the Kirkland

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.150
and Ellis Professor of
Law at Harvard Law School.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.970
Professor Klarman has won
numerous awards for his teaching

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.610
and scholarship in the
areas of constitutional law

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.250
and constitutional history.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.690
He has written a number of
books including "From Jim Crow

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.030
to Civil Rights: The Supreme
Court and the Struggle

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.310
for Racial Equality," which won
the 2005 Bancroft Prize in history.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.820
Today Professor Klarman will
describe how the Framers drafted

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.320
and ratified the Constitution,
despite many clashing interests.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.050
He has documented this in his
new book "The Framers' Coup:

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.570
The Making of the U.S.
Constitution,"

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.050
which is an Oxford University
Press publication, 2016.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.480
Professor Klarman's
book is available

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.750
for purchase just outside the room.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.430
At this time, please join me

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.510
in welcoming Professor
Michael Klarman to the stage.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:04.110
[ Applause ]

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Klarman: Thank you.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.910
Happy Constitution
Day almost, everybody.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.110
I bring you warm greetings
from Red Sox Nation.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.250
I've heard you have a
decent baseball team

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.550
in Washington this year.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.930
Hopefully, we'll see
you in the World Series,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.080
at which point I will cease
wishing you good luck.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.470
I'm going to talk about three
different, I'm going to talk

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.860
about two different things today.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.210
First, I'm going to give you
sort of three explanations

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.620
for why I thought this
book was worth writing.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.180
And then I'm going to tell you
three things about the book

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.770
that I hope hang together.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.160
So three reasons for writing this
book, which originally was going

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.350
to be something very different.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.410
There's been some terrific
scholarship written

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.340
about the origins of the
Constitution, ratification,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.030
the Philadelphia Convention.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.060
But nobody's actually told
the story in one place.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.180
So there's no place that
you could go to to read

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.590
within two covers a book about
the problems with the Articles

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.390
of Confederation, a book that talks
about the conflict over fiscal

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.600
and monetary policy in the states,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.610
talks about the Philadelphia
Convention, discusses the struggle

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.050 position:56%
over ratification, the differences
in ideas between the antifederalists

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.410
and the federalists, and
then the Bill of Rights,

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.730
which as you may know
came two years later.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.960
So one thing that I've
tried to do is I've tried

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.240
to condense a huge body of
scholarship into one volume.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.890
Second, I've tried to tell the
story to the extent possible

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.030
in the words of the participants.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.390
I did that both because I think
it makes the story more vibrant,

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.840
but also because I think
it enables people to decide

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.040
for themselves whether
they're convinced

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.640 position:56%
by the interpretations that I offer.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.280
It's only possible to do this

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.780
because of the extraordinary
documentary histories

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.220
that have been created in
the last 30 or 40 years.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.540
So people have literally
ransacked the world looking

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.070
for every newspaper article, diary
entry, piece of correspondence

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.620
that relates to the
making of the Constitution.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.220
And that stuff has been digitized
in the last 15 or 20 years.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.210
So it makes it possible
to do something

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.500
that would have been I think
almost impossible just a generation

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.830
or two ago.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.960
And then, third, and finally,
I've tried to put a sharper edge

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.220
to a story that's been
out there for a long time,

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.150
and that I basically agree with,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.360
which is that the Constitution
is a kind

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.760
of conservative counter-revolution
against egalitarian

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.700
and redistributed forces that
were set in motion or accelerated

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.650
by the Revolutionary War.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.620
So I'll say a little bit as I go
along about how exactly I'm trying

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.700
to put a finer edge on
that interpretation.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.720
But that interpretation I
don't claim any originality

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.020
for putting it forward.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.350
It's been around for a long time.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.580
And, as I said, I mostly
agree with it.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.150
Okay. So I'm going to now
talk about three points

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.450
that are made in the book.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.680
First of all, this first
point has two sub-parts.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.980
I apologize for this.

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.280
I'm a lawyer.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.590
I tend to think in
lots of subcategories.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.950
Two points to the first part.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.900
I'm going to tell you two ways in
which the Constitution differed

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.940
from what most people probably
wanted the Philadelphia Convention

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.080
to do, and certainly expected the
Philadelphia Convention to do.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.540
Those two different ways were
the Constitution is much more

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.700 position:56%
nationalizing, by which I mean
simply shifting power from the state

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.480
and local level to
the national level.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.940
And then second, the Constitution
is democracy constraining

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.820
or antipopulist.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.450
And I'm going to use those
as synonyms for one another.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.700
By those terms I simply
mean the people

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.110
who are writing the Constitution
don't want direct democratic

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.840
influence to be as powerful at
the national level as it's been

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.890
on the state level in the 1780s.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.040
Second point that I'm going
to try to explain how it was

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.020 position:56%
that the Framers in Philadelphia
were able to write this constitution

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.200
that was so different from what
most people wanted and expected.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.520
And then third, and to me in
some ways most interestingly,

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.980
how in the world did they get
the country to approve this thing

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.040
in what was a fairly
democratic process?

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.290 position:56%
Now to call it a democratic process
we immediately have to qualify that.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.490
It's not democratic from
our perspective today.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.360
Women weren't participating
in politics.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.880
Most African-Americans were
enslaved, even those who were free,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.890
not necessarily allowed to vote.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.140
Every state had property
qualifications,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.580
so people who don't own real
estate are not participating.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.680 position:56%
Doesn't sound that democratic to us.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.290
But situating it within
its historical context,

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.970
the United States had the
broadest suffrage of any country

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.360
in the world, probably
to that date in history.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.200
So it's fairly participatory
from that perspective.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.690
And the question is, why would
people ratify a Constitution?

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.430
One important point of which,
as I've already suggested,

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.350
was to take away direct populist
influence from the people.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.170
Okay. So I'm going to start

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.900
by briefly describing the
nationalizing features

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.280
of the Constitution.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.240
Then I'll talk about the
antipopulist features.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.730 position:56%
First of all, the Constitution gives
the national government virtually

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.700
unlimited taxing authority.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.660 position:56%
Now that doesn't sound that striking
to us, but you have to compare it

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.480
to the relevant baseline, which
is the Articles of Confederation,

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.350 position:56%
which was the document that governed
the country before the Constitution.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.420 position:56%
Under the Articles of Confederation,
Congress had no taxing power.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.480
It simply had a power to issue
requisitions, which are just

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.700
like they sound, they're
requests for money,

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.860
which the states might
or not comply with.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.160
Usually they didn't.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.110
And Congress had no coercive force
to ensure the implementation,

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.800
the effectuation of
these requisitions.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.100
Under the Articles there
had been proposed amendments

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.310
to give Congress a very
limited taxing power,

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.480
basically the authority
to impose import duties.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.660
But those amendments
have been defeated.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.280
So you're moving from no
taxing power to a proposal

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.310
for very limited taxing power to
the Constitution that provides

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.360
for almost unlimited
taxing authority.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.580 position:56%
Second point, the Constitution
authorizes Congress to raise armies,

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.360
create a navy, call state
militia into federal service,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.180
virtually without restriction.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.380
Now, again, you need to
compare that with the Articles.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:15.000
Under the Articles Congress could
requisition troops from the states.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.400
But, again, that was a request.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.270
And Congress could do nothing
if states decided not to comply

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.720
with such a requisition for troops.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.840
So now you have Congress
that can raise an army,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.000
not only during wartime, but
during peacetime, with no limits

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.300
as to number, no limits
as to duration,

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.510
no limits as to whether they have
to get a supermajority commitment

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.950
in both houses of Congress.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:43.460
That's an extraordinary shift in
power to the national government.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.630
Especially given at
the time they thought

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.080
that standing armies were
potentially very dangerous

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.440
to liberty, because the executive
might use a standing army not

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.840
to fight the enemy, but rather

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.410
to suppress political
dissidents, for example.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.090
Third, the Constitution gives
Congress unlimited authority

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.010
to regulate foreign and
interstate commerce.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.550
There was nothing like
that granted to Congress

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.700 position:56%
under the Articles of Confederation.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.300
Fourth, Congress has implied
powers under the Constitution.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.480
Under the Articles
of Confederation one

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.040
of the Articles expressly provides

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.420
that Congress may only
exercise those powers

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.580
that are expressly delegated.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.410
Whereas, under the Constitution,

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.280
the Constitution clearly
authorizes implied powers.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.690
So those of you who are
familiar with the Constitution,

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.820
Congress's powers are listed
in Article I, Section 8.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.280 position:56%
There's 17 specific grants of power.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.900
And then there's an
18th that provides

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.400 position:56%
that Congress also has the authority
to pass laws that are necessary

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.660
and proper to the implementation of
the other powers of the government.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.900
That is an explicit
authorization for Congress

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.220
to exercise implied powers.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.680
That was an intensely controversial
provision in the ratifying contest.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.690
It was agreed to at the
Philadelphia Convention,

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.720
virtually without dissent.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.870
Fifth, and finally, the
Constitution supplies a mechanism

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.060
for the enforcement
of federal supremacy.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.570
For example, a mechanism
that would enable Congress

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.940
to implement treaties which are
clearly within the authority

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.530
of the Confederation Congress,

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.720
but which the Confederation
Congress had no effective way

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.200
of implementing.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.260
Madison had proposed at the
convention one particular mechanism

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
for establishing federal supremacy.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.140
He would have given the
national government the authority

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.620
to veto any state law
that it felt like vetoing.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.720
Now that was too nationalist even

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.810
for this very nationalist
group of delegates.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.720
Instead they came up with
a three-part provision

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.300
for establishing federal supremacy.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.680
Part one is the Supremacy Clause,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.040
which is in Article VI
of the Constitution.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.850
It makes it clear that federal
law of any sort, the Constitution,

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.640
federal statute, federal
treaty is supreme

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.300
over state law to the contrary.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.010
Second, the Constitution
creates a federal court system.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.750
There were no federal courts

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.280
of general jurisdiction
under the Articles.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.230
Under the Constitution there is a
United States Supreme Court created

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.790
by the Constitution.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.990
And Congress is authorized,
but not required,

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.460
to establish lower federal courts.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.490 position:56%
So the idea was now you've got an
explicit grant of federal supremacy,

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.920
and you've got federal
judicial officials

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.920
who will enforce that
federal supremacy.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.280
And then the third provision
is a Substantive Rule of Law.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.810
It's in Article I, Section
10 of the Constitution.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.310
And it limits state governments.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.790
It says no state shall
make anything,

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.500
but gold or silver legal tender.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.610
And it provides that states
shall not impair the obligation

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.020
of contract.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.510
That was directly addressed
to relief legislation,

00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:01.220
economic relief legislation, paper
money laws, debtor relief laws,

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.790
which states had been passing,
a majority of states had passed,

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.750
in the mid-1780s in response
to a severe economic downturn.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.970
Modern historians, economic
historians regard the mid-1780s

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.980
as the worst economic period
in the country's history,

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.850
other than the Great Depression.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.350
A majority of states that
enacted relief legislation,

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.240
most of the Framers
regarded that legislation

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.350 position:56%
as almost an official form of theft.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.670
You were stealing property
from creditors,

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.800
redistributing it to debtors.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.080
And they wanted to suppress
that through the Constitution.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.930
But it's important, I think it's
worth taking note of the fact

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.900
that a majority of states had
passed these laws in the mid-1780s,

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.370
yet the Philadelphia
Convention unanimously voted

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.960
to suppress them in
the Constitution.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.060
That right there should
tell you something

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.950
about how unrepresentative
the convention was

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.410
of opinion in the country.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:57.710
All right.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.010
So those are the nationalist
provisions.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:03.240
Now let me turn to the antipopulist
provisions in the Constitution.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.510
The provision I just
mentioned is both.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:09.790
Article I, Section 10 is
both an antipopulist measure,

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.750
but it's also a nationalizing
measure, because it's now shifting

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.720
to the national level, the rule
that states are not allowed

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.400
to pass populist economic
relief legislation.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.650 position:56%
Other than that though, let me
mention a couple of other mechanisms

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.930
for ensuring that the national
government remains largely immune

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.520
from populist pressures.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.400
First were long terms in office.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.520
This is both relative
to the Articles

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.010 position:56%
and relative to state constitutions.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.590
Under the Articles congressional
representatives served one-year

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.990
terms in office.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:48.540
Under state constitutions the Lower
House of every state legislature

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.530
but one had annual terms in
office, or more frequent elections.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:57.370 position:56%
Two New England states actually held
their elections for the Lower House

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.060 position:56%
of the legislature every six months.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.710
A majority of states had governors
who served annual terms in office.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.340
Some state senates had
annual terms in office.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.350
As you know under the U.S.
Constitution congressional

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.060
representatives serve two
years, senators serve six years,

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.550
presidents serve four years.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.020
Most of the delegates actually
wanted to go even further

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:25.470
in extending the term in
office for state delegations,

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:30.100
not delegates from individual
states, for state delegations voted

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.610
at one point for lifetime
tenure for the president.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:34.930
There's a scary thought for you.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.490
Donald Trump as a lifetime
president.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:41.030
Many delegates wanted
senators to serve nine years.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:44.760
Madison favored nine years,
rather than six years.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.910
Hamilton wanted senators and
presidents to be lifetime-tenured.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.370
He thought that was the only way

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:54.180
that you could adequately
protect property rights

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.460
in a representative
form of government.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.290
They made concessions to
the need for ratification.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:05.020 position:56%
That's why they reduced the terms in
office to two, four and six years.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.690
Second, the Framers
adopted indirect elections,

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.070
both for senators and presidents.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.900
As you may know, senators were
elected by state legislatures

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.370
for the first 125 years
of the republic.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:22.520
That remained the case until
1913 and the 17th amendment.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.550
Presidents were, and still are,
selected by electors who are chosen

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.280
by a method specified
by state legislators.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.070
Today we assume that
means popular election.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.910 position:56%
That's not what the Framers assumed.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.000
And that's not what lots of states
did at the time of the founding.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.020
Rather state legislatures
would just choose the electors.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.320
It didn't matter.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.620
Nobody was voting for president.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.750
State legislators chose electors

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.340 position:56%
who then independently
deliberated and chose the president.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.720 position:56%
The reason for that is they
distrusted the people to play a role

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.280
as important as choosing the
nation's chief executive.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.090 position:56%
George Mason, who was an important
delegate from the state of Virginia,

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.050
said at the Philadelphia
Convention that, quote,

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:09.030
it would be as unnatural to refer
the choice of a proper character

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.680
for chief magistrate, meaning
president, to refer that choice

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.960
to the people as it
would be to refer a trial

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.190
of colors to a blind man.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:19.490
Think about that.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:21.880
Think about running for office
sometimes on that platform.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.360
Right? The people can't
possibly be trusted

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.380
to choose their chief executive.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.700
They'd be like a blind man
choosing between colors.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.160
The Framers also insulated
even the House,

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.480
which obviously was the most
populous branch, direct election

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.310
of congressional representatives

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.790
who would serve two-year
terms in office.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.740
But they even structured the House

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.950
so that it would be
significantly insulated

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.010
from direct popular opinion.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.050
First point is they created a very
small House of Representatives.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:55.630
That meant that individual
congressmen would be elected

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.390
by very large constituencies.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.690
Now not like today.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.230
Today a House member
represents six or 700,000 people.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:07.160
Back at the time of the founding,
it was more like 30 or 40,000.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.460
But you still need to compare
that to like a state legislator

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.990
in Massachusetts who might have
represented 14 or 1,500 people.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.810
So you're talking about the
constituency 20 times as large

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.340
for the House as it would
be for the Lower House

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.460
of Massachusetts Legislature.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:29.920
Right? Very large constituencies
over fairly large geographic areas.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.060
The point of that was twofold.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.500
First of all, they would ensure

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.190
that the quote-unquote better
sort would be elected to office.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.130
People who were well known,
had larger reputations,

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.810
were more affluent,
large property owners.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:46.710
They would be more likely to be
elected from large constituencies.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:50.500
And in addition the larger the
constituency the greater the

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.730
physical and metaphorical
distance between a representative

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.890
and that representative's
constituents.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.920
So the original house
was 65 members,

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.750
compare that to the Lower House
of the Massachusetts Legislature,

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.620
which was over 300 delegates.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.970
Three hundred for a
Massachusetts State Legislature.

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.740
Sixty-five for the entire country.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.090
Next point, along the
same dimension,

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:21.200 position:56%
the Constitution actually authorized
Congress implicitly to ensure

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.790
that the constituencies for
Congress were even larger.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:28.900
So Article I, Section 4 of
the Constitution provides

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:33.720
that Congress can change state
regulations for the time,

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.380
place and manner of
federal elections.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.760
That may sound complicated.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.300
But what they really had in mind,
or at least part of what they had

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:45.660
in mind, was that Congress could
say to a state legislature,

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.890
"We insist that you elect your
congressional representatives

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:53.170
at large, rather than by district."

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.690
So Virginia, for example, was by
far the largest, most powerful,

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.120
most important state at the time.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.460
The founding Virginia
had ten representatives.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.880
And today we assume they have to
be in district constituencies.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.310
You break down Virginia into ten
different district constituencies.

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:13.720
The Framers apparently contemplated
that Congress could and would say

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:18.330
to Virginia, "You need to elect all
ten congressional representatives

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.040
from the entire state."

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.660
That is, you give every
Virginian ten votes.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.140
Give them a list of people.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.690
And every Virginian votes
for every representative.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.210
That, of course, would be an
even more enormous constituency

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.720
where you would be even more likely

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.450
to get the quote-unquote
better sort elected,

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.360
and where they would
be even more insulated

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:41.580
from the direct supervision
of their constituents.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:46.910
Finally, the Constitution omits
provision for instruction recall

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.930
and mandatory rotation in office.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.510
Each of which I'll
mention in a second,

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.160
I'll elaborate on in a second.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.880
But the key point here
is under the Articles

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.360
of Confederation these
things existed.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.630
Under state constitutions
they often existed.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.090
But the Framers consciously
left them

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.390
out of the federal Constitution.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:08.120
Instruction is pretty
much what it sounds like.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.010
It's a mechanism that
allows constituents

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.050
to instruct their representatives
how to vote.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.770
It would be sort of a modern
analog would be referendum

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.390
where people actually get to
vote directly on legislation.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.830
They didn't have that, for
the most part, back then.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.540
But a New England town meeting
could say to its representative,

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.050
"We want you to vote this
way on raising taxes,

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.010
or that way on declaring
independence from Great Britain."

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.620
And if you didn't do what your
constituents had instructed you

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.100
to do, you'd be morally
obliged to resign your seat.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.460
The Constitution doesn't
provide for that.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.460
Recall. Under the Articles

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:49.460
of Confederation congressional
representatives served one year

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.760
in office.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.050
But during that year, at any
point, they could be recalled

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.880
by their state legislatures.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.180
So you can be sure

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.730
that congressional
representatives did the bidding

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.130
of their state legislatures,

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.480
or else they would be
immediately removed from office.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.690
The Constitution doesn't
provide that.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:10.410 position:56%
And mandatory rotation, which again
is just like it sounds, term limits.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:14.650
Under the Articles you could only
serve three out of every six years.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:18.230
After serving those three years,
you were rotated out of office.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:22.610
That's a way to prevent officials
from getting entrenched in office.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.670
Okay. The Constitution
avoids those three

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.370
democracy-enhancing provisions.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:32.910
And it includes these other
democracy-constraining provisions.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.040
And the reason why is
not really a mystery.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.640
It's because they want the federal
government not to be susceptible

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.830
to the populist political impulses
that have overwhelmed the states

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.450
in the mid-1780s, and they want
the national government to be able

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:52.480
to shut down state debtor relief
legislation, if any state tries

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.020
to pass it again going forward.

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.290
Okay. So that's the
first part of my talk.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:01.630
The second part is explaining how
the Philadelphia Convention managed

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:03.370
to do these things
that were different

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.410
from what most people
expected and probably wanted.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.800
One leading contemporary
critic of the Constitution,

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.620
I'm going to call them
antifederalists,

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.220
which is what they
were known at the time,

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.740 position:56%
the people who opposed ratification,
one leading antifederalists said,

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.440
and I think this is largely
accurate, quote, the democratic

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.970
and aristocratic parts

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.420
of the community were
disproportionately represented

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.920
in Philadelphia.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.230
And the question is why.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.000
Why were the democratic parts

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.320
and the aristocratic parts
differently represented

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.760
in Philadelphia?

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.030
Here are several discrete points

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.240
that together maybe add
up to an explanation.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.860
And when I said at the beginning
of my talk that I was going to try

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:47.080
to put a finer point on this
traditional interpretation

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.370
of the Constitution as a
conservative counter-revolution,

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.210
this is where I want to
put the finer point on it.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:56.470
I don't think anybody has
sufficiently explained why the

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.450
Philadelphia Convention
was so unrepresentative,

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.410
and then how did they manage
to convince the American people

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:04.950
to ratify something
that would deprive them

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.340
of significant influence
over the national government.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.880
So here are a few points.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.630
First, state legislatures
elected the delegates

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:16.830
for the Philadelphia Convention
in every state but one.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.670
In South Carolina the
governor picked the delegates.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.200
And Rhode Island actually didn't
send delegates to Philadelphia.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.340
But in the other 11 states
legislatures chose the delegates.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.130
And the question is, how did
they choose the delegates?

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:36.320
And the answer seems to be they
simply chose their most eminent,

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:41.230
well-known, large reputationed
citizens.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:45.800
So in Virginia they send George
Washington, they send George Mason,

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.170
they send James Madison, the
governor Edmund Randolph.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.890
In Pennsylvania they're going to
send, probably the most famous man

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.710
in the world, Benjamin Franklin.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.990
They're sending their
most eminent citizens,

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:58.490
people who have large reputations.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:01.010
The legislatures were
choosing people

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.530
who were well-known,
eminent citizens.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:07.620
And usually the way you would
acquire such a reputation is either

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.920
through having served

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:13.610 position:56%
in the Confederation Congress and/or
serving in the Revolutionary Army.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:17.060
A majority of delegates had served
in the Confederation Congress.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.560
And a majority of delegates had
served in the Revolutionary Army.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.300
If you think about it, both
of those are profoundly

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.160
nationalizing experiences.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.480
If you served in the Confederation
Congress, you're used to thinking

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.850
in national terms, rather
than parochial terms.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:35.640
And serving in an army that
creates a nation is a profoundly

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.580
nationalizing experience.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:40.470
You just fought and risked
your life to create a nation.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.590
And in addition many
people who served

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:47.090
in the Revolutionary Army actually
learned to distrust the states.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:48.700
For example, George Washington

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.990
or John Marshall, the
Great Chief Justice.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.710
Their biographers talk about
how their experiences serving

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.840
in the National Army, where
they saw the states often

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.960
as being obstructive, refusing
to ante up men, refusing to ante

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.490
up money, it turned them
into nationalists for life.

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.760
In addition these people
of large reputation tended

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.880
to be well-educated, fairly
affluent, large landowners.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.930
Those characteristics
correlate pretty closely

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:20.800
with not being a big fan of
populist influence on government.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.950
Second, the opponents

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:27.830
of a nationalizing antipopulist
project really had no reason

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:32.240
to mobilize in advance against that
agenda, because they had no reason

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.700
to suspect that that's what the
Philadelphia Convention would be

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.000
up to.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.310
It turns out that the agenda

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:42.030
of the Philadelphia Convention
mostly existed in the head

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.430
of one man, James Madison.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:46.230
Now that's not because
Madison was one

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:48.210
of the most eminent
people in Philadelphia.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:50.520
He was 35, 36 years old.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.700
He had served in the
Confederation Congress.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.050
He had served in the
Virginia Legislature.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:56.420
He was well-regarded.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.000
He was obviously quite brilliant.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.300
I think people liked him.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.040 position:56%
But he was not a formidable speaker.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:06.110
Often the reporter in a
legislative session had to write

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:09.350
down when Madison was talking
could not hear what he said.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.650
He was sickly.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.010
He did not have a commanding
presence.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.500
He was not large like George
Washington, Thomas Jefferson.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.940
Madison played a large role

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.840
because he was the best
prepared man in the room.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.670
One of the delegates who did
character sketches of the others

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.310
in Philadelphia, that's
what he said about Madison.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.840
Always the best prepared
person in any debate.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.470
Madison was the only one

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.720
who had spent the months before
the Philadelphia Convention

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:41.350 position:56%
systematically analyzing the history
of ancient and modern confederacies,

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.630
diagnosing the problems
that they tended

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.690
to suffer from, and
proposing solutions.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.350
So Madison did that.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.360
Then he came up with his
ideas for the convention.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.460
He coordinated among his Virginia
co-delegates telling them to show

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.310
up early in Philadelphia.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.660
They did arrive early.

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.590
And they spent a couple
hours every day talking

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.850
through their ideas
for the new government.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.280
They coordinated with the
Pennsylvania delegates,

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.500
conveniently all of whom
lived in Philadelphia,

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.950
so they were already there.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:14.550
And together these two large
states, the three largest states

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.980
at the time were Virginia,
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts,

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.450
so Pennsylvania and
Virginia they're there early.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.000
They're the two largest states.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.070
They're coordinating on a fairly
nationalist antipopulist agenda.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.200
And it gets introduced the
first day of the convention.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.970
It's called the Virginia Plan in
honor of the Virginia delegates.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:37.790
And it turns out that that
proposal was very nationalist

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.770
and antipopulist.

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:43.000 position:56%
Now Madison didn't win on everything
he wanted in Philadelphia.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.780
Indeed he lost on a lot of
things he cared a lot about.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.640
But obviously where you end
up depends on where you start.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.440
And they started on
a very nationalist

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.650
and antipopulist point
on the spectrum.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.730
Third, some appointed delegates,
about eight or ten of them,

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:01.610
decided to turn down
their appointments.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:05.420
Now some of them intriguingly,
like Patrick Henry of Virginia,

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.910
Richard Henry Lee of Virginia,
Samuel Chase of Maryland,

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.500
they actually became
leading antifederalists.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.500
They were appointed to the
Philadelphia Convention.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.800
They didn't go.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.310
And then they became leading
opponents of ratification.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.580
Now it's hard to know exactly why
they didn't go with some of them.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.220
We don't have any evidence.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.380
With others we have the
evidence what they said.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.680
But it's not entirely clear
that we ought to credit that.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.630
It's a fairly small sample size.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.420
So it's dangerous to
speculate and generalize.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.070
But I would simply offer what is
candidly a piece of speculation.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:41.230
One possibility is
these people didn't go

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:43.250
because they had very
little sympathy

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:47.100
for the mildly nationalizing
project they thought was under way.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.000 position:56%
They didn't have any interest in it.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.070
But they also didn't have any
reason to rally against it.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.690
But they didn't know
what was really going

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:58.740
on in Philadelphia was a fairly
revolutionary reform project.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.760 position:56%
And if they'd known about that, they
might have gone to fight against it.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.640
But they didn't know that
was what was going to happen.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.450
And they weren't interested in what
they thought was going to happen.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:07.750
So they didn't go.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:12.280
Fourth point, there was a decision
made by some delegates who did go

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.360
to the Philadelphia Convention,
didn't approve of its nationalizing

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.730
and antipopulist direction
to leave early.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.760
This is people like Robert Yates
and John Lansing of New York.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:27.280 position:56%
That when they left that deprived
the New York delegation of its vote,

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.850
because it left only
Alexander Hamilton,

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:33.180
who was the most nationalizing
antipopulist of them all.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.320
But under the rules one delegate
couldn't vote for his state.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.460
So once Yates and Lansing went,
that nullified New York's vote.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.500 position:56%
Luther Martin was another one of
these who left the convention early.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.360
And then became one of the leading
antifederalists in Maryland.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.380
Now you can understand
why they left.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.530
Their point was the Philadelphia
Convention was ignoring

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:53.830
its instructions.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.630 position:56%
It was doing something illegitimate.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.230
And they didn't want to confer
legitimacy on it by staying.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.160
But, of course, it's always a
very difficult choice to make.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.910
You can walk out and try

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:07.700 position:56%
to delegitimize the project you
disagree with, or you stay and fight

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.380
against it, and try to
make it less objectionable.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.680
They chose to leave.

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.350
And in retrospect, that
was probably a mistake.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:19.220 position:56%
Fifth point, the delegates made the
critical decision to close the doors

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.330
of the Philadelphia Convention.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:23.140
Now they had good reasons
for doing so.

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:26.250
Madison said later, and I
think this is probably right,

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:29.210
if they hadn't done this, they
might not have been able to come

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.850
up with any Constitution at all.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:36.900
But one effect of closing the
doors was it liberated delegates

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:41.550
to take very extreme antipopulist
and nationalist positions.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:45.580 position:56%
Positions that might have endangered
their subsequent political careers

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:49.500 position:56%
if they were making these statements
with the press in the galleries.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.290
And in addition, and
maybe more importantly,

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.600
closing the convention meant
that the antifederalists,

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.430
the people who were going
to oppose the Constitution,

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:02.810
actually were deprived of about
four months of rallying opposition.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.660
The convention was meeting from
about May 25th to September 17th.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.900
And if the antifederalists
had known what was going on,

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.890
they could have started immediately
organizing their opposition.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:18.010
But in fact they didn't know until
the convention unlocked its doors

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.940
and issued its report
on September 17th.

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.370
Last point along these lines, the
delegates made a momentous choice

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:28.550
in Philadelphia that they were
going to seize the moment.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:31.960
Leading up to the convention,
Madison is writing letters

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.860
to his Virginian compatriots, his
mentors, Washington, Jefferson,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.270
his friend Edmund Randolph,
who's the governor.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.300
Madison is airing his ideas.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.180
He's thinking through his
ideas by talking about them.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.670
And in his letters with
Washington they find

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:49.980
to their mutual satisfaction
that they agree

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:54.780
that the convention should
not pursue what they call

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.290
"temporizing expedience."

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.330
They actually want the convention
to do something more radical.

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:01.840
Go and write the best form

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.140
of government you think you can
get ratified, give up on the idea

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.360
of incremental reform, do
something more drastic.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.550
When Randolph introduces the
Virginia Plan, which he gets to do

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.340
because George Washington is
immediately appointed president

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:20.430
of the convention, that makes
Randolph the most senior Virginian,

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.460
he's the governor, he
introduces the Virginia Plan.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.340
And according to Madison's
notes, this is what he said.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.710
He, Randolph, would not as far as
dependent on him leave anything

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.470
that seemed necessary undone.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.530
The present moment is favorable

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:40.070
and is probably the
last that will offer.

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.370
So they went for broke.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:42.780
This was their last
chance to get the form

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.450
of government they really wanted.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.030
They were not going to pursue
temporizing expedience.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.150
They were going to pursue some
sort of more radical reform.

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.960
Always taking into account
that whatever they were to come

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.740
up with had to be ratified.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.790
So they did trim their
sails to some extent

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.630
to ensure a likelihood
of ratification.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.900
But they weren't just going
to make a few small changes.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.660
They were going to radically
overhaul the government.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.900
Okay. So how did they
get this thing ratified?

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.280
The third part of my talk.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.920
How'd they get this ratified
when it's so different

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.520
from what most people were
expecting and probably wanting?

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.720
The first point to note
is not an explanation.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.590
It's simply a point of emphasis.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:20.730
You shouldn't assume
this was inevitable.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:24.230
In fact it was a highly
contingent series of events

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:27.120
that enabled the Constitution
to be approved.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.050
It almost failed.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:33.290
Two states rejected ratification
before later changing their minds.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.510
That's Rhode Island
and North Carolina.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:39.730
New Hampshire, at its first
convention, probably was inclined

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:44.280
to vote "no," but the federalists,
the supporters of the Constitution,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.750
had deftly arranged for the
convention to be adjourned

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.630
when they saw they
were going to lose,

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.790
and they could come back several
months later and fight again.

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:56.130
And in addition in three
of the five largest states,

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:59.590
the vote was so close that
it's obvious it could have come

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:00.890
out the other way.

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:04.380
So in Virginia the vote
was 89 to 79 in favor.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.520
In New York it was
30 to 27 in favor.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:12.680
And in Massachusetts it
was 187 to 168 in favor.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.770
Those are three of the
five largest states.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:19.650
If one or two of them had
rejected the Constitution,

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:23.220
it's doubtful that the Constitution
could have successfully gone

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.930 position:56%
into operation, even if nine states,
which was the number specified

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.160
in the Constitution
to make it effective,

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.200
even if nine states had
ratified, you couldn't do

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.240
without Virginia and Massachusetts.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.740
Two of the three largest states.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.040
All right.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.800
So how did the federalists
manage to win this battle?

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.550
And the answer is, first of all,

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.370
they actually had a bunch
of built-in advantages.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:47.370
This is not a rigged system.

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:49.410
It's not scam.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:52.730
But it just turns out for
reasons that I'll elaborate on it,

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.480
wasn't entirely a fair fight.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.930
It wasn't entirely an
even playing field.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:01.240
First, the federalists' advantage
were advantaged by malapportionment

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:06.470
in some state conventions,
especially South Carolina.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:10.490
In South Carolina 20%
of the white population,

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:13.230
and remember obviously only
the white male population,

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.760 position:56%
and only those who own a significant
amount of land are voting,

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.840
although I don't want to make it
sound like it's as exclusionary

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.840
as it would have been in Britain
at the time, probably 50 or 60%

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:25.880
of adult males in South Carolina
could participate in the voting

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.750
for the Ratifying Convention.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.900
Twenty percent of the
population lives

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:33.190
in coastal areas along
the Atlantic seaboard.

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:37.620
Support for the Constitution
is very strong in those areas.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:41.760
And that 20% elects
60% of the delegates

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:45.230
at the Ratifying Convention,
because of malapportionment.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.080
Basically as the population
moved from east to west,

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.790
the legislature didn't
reapportionment, because people

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:54.030
who have political power tend not
to be altruistic in sharing it,

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.120
so this has been a story
throughout American history.

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:59.280
You get malapportionment as
people move either from farms

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.040
to cities, or from east to west.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.370
So a majority of the
population in South Carolina,

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.800
according to most historians,
oppose the Constitution.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.690
But because of severe
malapportionment,

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:13.290
two-thirds of the delegates

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.380
at the South Carolina
Convention voted in favor.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:21.220
Second, the press overwhelmingly
favored ratification.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:27.320
Ninety percent of Americans lived
outside of cities in 1787, 1788.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.900
But newspapers, for
obvious economic reasons,

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:34.700
were published almost exclusively
in cities where subscribers

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.970
and advertisers, the two economic
engines of the newspaper industry,

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:43.660
tended to be overwhelmingly
supportive of the Constitution.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.940
Any federalists, again
the opponents,

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:51.670
had a hard time even getting their
essays reprinted in many states.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:55.960
Aedanus Burke, who was a leading
antifederalist in South Carolina,

00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.220
complained that, quote, the
whole weight and influence

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:04.230
of the press was on the
side of the Constitution.

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:08.120
Only about 12 of the 90
newspapers then in circulation

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.140
in the country published
any significant amount

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:12.900
of antifederalist literature.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.710 position:56%
Right? So it'd be like today having
a debate about some political issue,

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:18.130
and you've only got Fox News.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.150
You've got nothing
on the other side.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:24.440 position:56%
Third, several conventions were
held in coastal cities where support

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:29.750 position:56%
for the Constitution tended to be
almost universal across class lines.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:34.090
So, for example, in New York we
know 19 out of every 20 voters

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.870
who was participating
in electing delegates

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:41.250
to the New York Convention,
19 out of every 20 voted

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.270
for a federalist delegate.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.650
This had an effect, this
overwhelming support

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:48.240
for ratification, in
these cities where many

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.490
of the conventions were held, had
an effect both inside and outside

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.800
of the state ratifying conventions.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.000
All of the ratifying conventions
were open to the public,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.240
unlike the Philadelphia
Convention, which was closed.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:06.120 position:56%
That means that the galleries tended
to be dominated by spectators.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.840
And, because these were cities,
they tended to be dominated

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:13.900
by federalist speakers, federalists
spectators, who were not shy

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.370
about voicing their opinions.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.850
So when any federalists
would get up to speak

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.930
in the Connecticut Convention,
they would be his staff,

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.420
they would be booed, people
would stomp their feet,

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.720
making it difficult
for any federalist even

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.600
to get their opinions voiced.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.810 position:56%
Outside of conventions, for example,

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:33.400
in South Carolina the
local planter elite,

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.550
which overwhelmingly
supported the Constitution,

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:38.880
which tells you something
about their perception

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.660
of the Constitution,
strong support for slavery,

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:46.280
they would hold open houses at
their homes during the duration

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.800
of the South Carolina Convention.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.550
They would adjourn to their homes

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.800
after the day's deliberations
were over.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.650
And you can be sure that they
were whispering into the ears

00:42:55.650 --> 00:43:00.570 position:56%
of the delegates positive things,
glowing praise for the Constitution.

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.440
Fourth point, fourth
federalist advantage,

00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.210
federalists just had an easier
time organizing their supporters.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.270
People in cities tended
to be federalists.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:13.660
People close to the Atlantic
seaboard tended to be federalists.

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:18.150
This is an era of very rudimentary
transportation and communication.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:22.050
People on the western frontier
tended to oppose the Constitution.

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:26.280 position:56%
People in backwoods' areas that were
removed from commercial connection,

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.020
remote from roads, they tended
to oppose the Constitution.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:33.900 position:56%
Even if you assume that federalists
and antifederalists were about equal

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.130
in number, which might be
about accurate to assume,

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:41.030
the federalists would simply have
an easier time organizing their

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.190
supporters than the
antifederalists would.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:48.130 position:56%
Fifth point, the "better sort" as
they called them, the well-educated,

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:50.180
reasonably affluent elite,

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.920
overwhelmingly supported
ratification everywhere

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.220
but in the state of Virginia.

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.130
In Virginia the elite was
actually split down the middle.

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:01.600
But in other states the elite
overwhelmingly supported

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.070
the Constitution.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:05.690
That was a big advantage
for federalists

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:09.850
in those ratifying conventions
where delegates were actually open

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.330
to having their minds
changed, which was some

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.370
of the conventions and not others.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:18.670
Backwoods' farmers could not quote
Cicero in the original Latin.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:23.590
They were often intimidated by
their oratorically more gifted,

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:25.580
better-educated opponents.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:29.710
For example, at the Massachusetts
Ratifying Convention leading

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:34.590
antifederalist, Amos Singletary,
complained of, quote, these lawyers

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.860
and men of learning and moneyed
men that talk so finely and gloss

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:44.020
over matters so smoothly to make
us poor illiterate people swallow

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.170
down the pill.

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:50.010
Right? Anti-elitism 225 years ago.

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:52.370
The last of the advantages
of the federalists,

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:54.370
and then I'll mention a couple
other points and I'll be done,

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:58.040 position:56%
and I'm happy to take some
questions, the genius of Article VII

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.930
of the Constitution was a huge
advantage for the federalists.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:08.570 position:56%
Nine states under Article VII could
put the Constitution into operation.

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.050
Although no state could
bind any other.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:16.270
Now under the Articles you
needed unanimous state consent

00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:17.570
for any amendment.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.830
And the Articles were
never successfully amended.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:25.700 position:56%
But under the Constitution once
nine state conventions had approved,

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.180
the Constitution would
be up and running,

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.200
the other four states would
be free to do as they like.

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.360
They couldn't be bound
without their consent.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:37.010
But they also wouldn't be part of
the country unless they ratified.

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:39.520
Now that was important,
because it might sound

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.960 position:56%
like it's preserving every state's
independent right to go its own way.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:48.560
In fact the pressure on states
ten through 13 was enormous.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.490
Once nine states had ratified,
the other states could be,

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.350
because they're not in the country,
you would have a new country,

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.930
they're not being guaranteed
military protection.

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:01.860
They could be subjected to
foreign trade discrimination,

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.760
because they're not
part of the country.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.060
So you could set up tariffs

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.670
against Rhode Island the
same way you're setting

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:08.730
up tariffs against British goods.

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:12.470
And, finally, they would be cut
out of any important decisions

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:15.270
that were made by the
first new Congress.

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:16.910
Once the new Congress met,

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:19.860
it was going to have incredibly
important decisions to make,

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:23.150
like where to place the
permanent national capital,

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:26.260
whether to adopt amendments
to the Constitution.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.750
And if you were not
part of the nation,

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.120
you wouldn't be participating.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:32.720
So as a practical matter
once nine states ratified,

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.180
the other four states
wouldn't have much choice.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.870
That turned out to be
critically important.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:41.140
And they just made it up at
the Philadelphia Convention.

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:44.200
Heading into the convention
everybody had thought,

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.000
because Congress had said
it and so had the call

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.130
for the Philadelphia Convention
said it, that anything proposed

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:53.330
in Philadelphia will have to
be approved first by Congress,

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:55.740
and then by all 13
state legislatures.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.170
And they just changed the rules,

00:46:58.170 --> 00:46:59.580
and saw whether they
could get away with it.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.010
And the answer was they could.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.850
Now the federalists also benefited

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.700
from some antifederalist
miscalculations,

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.220 position:56%
especially in New York and Virginia,

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.770
where any federalists
agreed to late conventions.

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:15.700 position:56%
The New York Convention, New York
and Virginia conventions didn't meet

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:19.270
until June of 1788,
which is nine months

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.160
after the Philadelphia
Convention had ended.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.460
I think they were calculating that
that would give them more time

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:29.630
to rally their supporters in
opposition to the Constitution.

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:33.110
But what they ultimately did was
they made themselves irrelevant.

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:38.020
By the time the New York Convention
was underway in late June,

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:42.410
New Hampshire had become
the ninth state to ratify.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:45.500
Then while the New York Convention
was continuing to deliberate

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.150
in the first week in
June, they got news

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:51.470
that the Virginia Convention had
been the tenth state to ratify.

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:55.320
And that just hugely changed
the calculus in New York.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.600
Previously the question was do
you like the Constitution or not?

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.180
Now the question is whether you
like the Constitution or not,

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.050
do you want to be part of a
new nation, which is going

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.540 position:56%
to exist whether you join it or not?

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:08.040
And, by the way, the nation's
capital was in New York.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.090
And they were going to
lose the capital obviously

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:11.560
if they didn't join the union.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.380
That was going to cost them
at least 100,000 pounds a year

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:17.490
in hard currency, which was
a lot of money back then.

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:21.290
If either Virginia or New
York had chose to go earlier,

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:25.590 position:56%
I think they probably would have
rejected unconditional ratification.

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:28.420
That would have undercut the
momentum that was being built

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:30.430
up in favor of ratification.

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:34.010
And it quite possibly might
have influenced later states.

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:37.730
Last important point I want to
emphasize, the federalists managed

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.600
to do one other thing that I
think was incredibly important.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.760
And this is something I learned
while working on the book.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.740
This wasn't something
I knew going into it.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:47.700
It was critically important
to their success

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:51.230
to keep intermediate
options off the table.

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:53.700
They wanted to force a
choice between the Articles

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:57.210
of Confederation, which most
people agreed were deeply flawed,

00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:01.910 position:56%
and the Constitution, which at least
half the country also thought was

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:03.640
significantly flawed.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.520
They wanted to deny people a
choice on the spectrum somewhere

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:11.720
in the middle between the Articles
and the vastly more nationalist

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.230
and antipopulist Constitution.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:17.800
Now the two most likely
ways to have arrived

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:22.930 position:56%
at an intermediate solution were
the following procedural mechanisms.

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:26.470
One was a demand for
antecedent amendments,

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:30.520 position:56%
meaning let's amend the Constitution
before it gets ratified,

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.340
rather than afterwards.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.630
And the other procedural mechanism
would have been let's hold a second

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.110
convention after the first.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:40.020
Now the antifederalists,
the opponents,

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.860
made pretty good arguments

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:46.090
for why these were sensible
procedural paths to follow.

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:48.680
The argument for antecedent
amendments was

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:50.310
pretty straightforward.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.520
"Who in their right mind,"
Patrick Henry said this

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.210
at the Virginia Convention,
"You'd have to be a lunatic

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:59.280
to sign a contract with another
party when that party then gets

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.240
to change the terms that
you've already agreed to."

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:08.230
He said, "That's like agreeing to
a Constitution with a vague promise

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:10.160
of subsequent amendments to come.

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.630
You should insist on seeing
the amendments in advance."

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:14.120
Which sounds pretty reasonable.

00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:18.330 position:56%
The argument for a second convention
was the country just had a big

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:23.280
debate on a Constitution that was
unveiled after a secret convention

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.210
and did not map on to
what most people expected.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:28.230 position:56%
We've now had a big national debate.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:30.490
People have told you
about their concerns.

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:33.580
Now let's go ahead and vote for
more delegates who can gather

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:36.480
up all this information,
go to Philadelphia,

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:39.560
and write a Constitution closer
to the intermediate position,

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.540
which is where most
Americans were at.

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:45.310
Federalists made legal arguments
against those procedural paths,

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:48.670
and they made practical
political arguments.

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:52.910
But I think the actual reason why
they opposed these alternatives is

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:57.350
because they understood there's
no way that a second convention,

00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:01.700
or antecedent amendments, would
allow them to preserve the core

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:03.700
of what they had done
in Philadelphia.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.670
And what they wanted was not
to get arrived at a position

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:08.640
that most Americans agreed with.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:11.940
What they wanted was to get the
Constitution they had written

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.520
in Philadelphia approved,

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:17.620 position:56%
because they thought this was what
was necessary for the nation's good.

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:21.250
Now in this regard, consider the
proposal that Randolph had made

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.360
to Madison before the convention.

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.830
Randolph, the governor of Virginia,

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:27.600
and Madison are corresponding
before the convention.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.380
Madison is playing with his ideas.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:34.360
And Randolph says in response,
"Whatever we write in Philadelphia,

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.150
we should submit it to the country
in a kind of detachable form

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:40.030
so people can approve
what they like,

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.300
and disapprove what
they don't like."

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.990
Madison was horrified by that idea.

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:46.810
And he ridiculed the notion

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:50.910
that ordinary Americans could have
informed opinions on something

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:55.220
as important as designing a system
of government to govern them.

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.560
This is what Madison said to
Jefferson later that year,

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:02.500
towards the end of 1787, quote,
in Virginia where the mass

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:05.660 position:56%
of people have been so accustomed to
be guided by their rulers on all new

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:08.500
and intricate questions,
the matter of whether

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:13.450
to ratify the Constitution
certainly surpasses the judgment

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:15.600
of the greater part of them.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.320
Another good platform to
run for office on some time

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.520
that most people are too
ill-informed, or not bright enough

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:23.370 position:56%
to actually participate meaningfully

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:27.920 position:56%
in deciding what governing structure
should exist at the national level.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.990
Okay. So to just sum
up in one minute.

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:33.350
The Constitution is more
nationalist, more antipopulist

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:36.620
than most Americans
expected, or probably wanted.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.660
The Framers took advantage
of the element

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.800
of surprise to get it drafted.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:46.190
Then they barely got it ratified,
benefiting from some circumstances

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:49.820
that proved advantageous,
some miscalculations

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:53.100
by their political
adversaries, and some luck,

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.470
portions of which they helped
to create for themselves.

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:59.180
Whether you agree with what
they did in Philadelphia,

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:02.990
whether you think it's legitimate
or illegitimate, I think you have

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:05.750
to stand back, and
express some admiration

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:07.190
for what they accomplished,

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:09.850
because the Constitution
genuinely was a kind

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:11.910
of coup against public opinion.

00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:15.420
This is not what most
Americans had bargained for.

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:17.040
So thank you very much
for your patience.

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.340
And I'm happy to take
some questions.

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:20.140
I don't know how much
time we have, but--

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:29.040
[ Applause ]

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.340
Don't be shy.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.300
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.600
Yes, sir. Over here.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.540
We've got a microphone
that's on its way over.

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:39.140
&gt;&gt; One thing you didn't
mention was the Bill of Rights.

00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:43.240
And that must have played a
big part in both the convention

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:47.530
and the eventual ratification,
or did it not?

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:50.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Klarman: So, yeah,
the Bill of Rights is tackled

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:52.560
in the last substantive
chapter of the book.

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.270
There is no Bill of
Rights in the Constitution.

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:58.080
George Mason proposed the
addition of a Bill of Rights

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.430
on the last day of the convention.

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:04.460
And he was seconded by
Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.710
But no state delegation
supported them.

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:11.020 position:56%
The federalists, during the
ratifying convention, had to explain

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.570
and defend the absence
of a Bill of Rights.

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:15.440
That was clearly the main,

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.830
of all the objections
the antifederalists made,

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:21.190
the number one objection was
there is no Bill of Rights,

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:24.240
there's no protection for freedom
of speech, freedom of the press,

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.530
free exercise of religion,
so forth, and so on.

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.910
The federalists had a number
of arguments for why a Bill

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:34.360
of Rights was actually unnecessary,
why they thought the existence

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.440
of a Bill of Rights
would be dangerous.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.030
I can go into that.

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:41.620
I think what I want to say
is actually it's not clear

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.630
to me whether they would
have opposed a Bill

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:46.840
of Rights had it been proposed
earlier in the convention.

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:51.880
But they'd been in Philadelphia for
four long, hot, contentious months.

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.460
And they thought this would
be opening a Pandora's box

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:56.840
to suggest a new topic for debate.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.400
So I think the other
delegates just said,

00:54:58.400 --> 00:54:59.860
"We don't want to deal with this."

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.730
It turned out to be
clearly a tactical mistake,

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:05.010
because this was the
principle grounds

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:07.280
of opposition to the Constitution.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:10.420
Madison became absolutely
critical to the Bill of Rights.

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.920
So Madison was running for office.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:16.430 position:56%
He wanted to be elected to the first
Congress from Central Virginia.

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:18.240 position:56%
He was from Orange County, Virginia.

00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.660
And Madison's constituents
included a large share

00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:25.390
of Central Virginia Baptists,
who had first-hand experience

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:26.690
with religious oppression.

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.390
They had been oppressed.

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:31.040
Many Baptist preachers
had been thrown in jail

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:34.640
by the Anglican establishment
within the previous decade.

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:38.200
These people couldn't understand
why Virginia had a statute

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.800
of religious freedom, but
there was no protection

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.520
for religious liberty
in the Constitution.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.090
Madison was encouraged by
his friends in the district.

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:48.350
He was actually running
against James Monroe,

00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:50.480
who had been a Revolutionary
War hero,

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.930
opposed ratification in Virginia.

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:57.360
And this is a district that had
been gerrymandered by Patrick Henry

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.060
to try to keep Madison
out of the first Congress.

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:02.590 position:56%
Madison had to go home and campaign.

00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:04.210
And promised his constituents

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:07.160
that if elected he would now
support a Bill of Rights.

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.320
Now that the Constitution
had been ratified,

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.890
he would support a Bill of Rights.

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:14.840
So Madison gets up in
Congress on June 8th, 1789.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.940
This is the first session
of the Bill of Rights,

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.700
first session of the new Congress.

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:21.640
And he says, "I'm proposing
amendments to the Constitution.

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.040
I'm proposing a Bill of Rights."

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.100
The antifederalists in
Congress are not interested

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:28.500
in the proposals that
Madison's offering.

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.460
What they want are
structural changes.

00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.790
They want to limit
Congress' taxing power,

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:35.670
limit Congress' military
powers, make the House

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:37.590
of Representatives twice as large.

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:39.090
That's not what Madison offers.

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:42.400
What Madison offers are
specific rights provisions.

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.700
A right against search and seizure.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.380
A right against cruel
and unusual punishment.

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:48.580
The antifederalists don't
think those are really robust

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.920
significant protections.

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.870
They want structural
limits on national power,

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:54.700
rather than rights' protections.

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:57.700
The federalists in Congress
say to Madison, "Okay.

00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:00.380
Now you've done your duty
to your constituents.

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.420
You need to sit down and be quiet,

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:04.090
because we have really
important things to do

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:07.350
like raising tax revenue,
creating the executive branch

00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:10.010
of the government, creating
the national judiciary.

00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:12.980
Why in the world should we
be amending a Constitution

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.400
when we don't have any experience

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.410
with whether it'll work
without amendment?"

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:18.980
So Madison gets neither
a positive reception

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:21.030
from the federalists
or the antifederalists.

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:22.330
He persists.

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:24.190
He makes arguments like,
"If we don't deliver

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:26.420
on what our constituents
were promised,

00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:28.090
nobody's ever going to believe us.

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:29.880
People who are unhappy
about the power

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:33.040 position:56%
of the national government are
going to believe conspiracy theories

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.360
about how it's never going to be
amended in ways that limit it."

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.660
And Madison persists.

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.230
And at the end of the day
he's able to get Congress

00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:43.760
to approve 12 amendments, which ten
are then ratified by the states.

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.520
And that's how we get
a Bill of Rights.

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.200
It is absolutely fascinating.

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:52.930
Neither side of the debate in
1789 actually cares very much

00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:55.970
about the rights' provisions,
largely because they think

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:57.420
of them as parchment barriers.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:01.430 position:56%
They think you can have all the nice
rights you want in a Constitution,

00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:04.790
but if majority opinion in
time of war or emergency wants

00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:07.470
to ignore them, then they
won't have any weight.

00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:10.480
And that's not what we think today,
because today we celebrate our Bill

00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.950
of Rights, and judges enforce them.

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:14.970
But in 1789 neither side seemed

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:20.470
to think this was a very important
change in the Constitution.

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:21.770
Yeah.

00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:23.070
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:27.670
&gt;&gt; Within a few years of the
adoption of the Constitution,

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:30.040 position:56%
most of the antifederalists had come

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.910
around to supporting
the Constitution.

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:36.050
And James Madison was
leading the opposition

00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:38.820
in Congress to the administration--

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:40.120
&gt;&gt; Michael Klarman: Yeah.

00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:44.060
&gt;&gt; And was more or less a minority
leader in many of the Congresses.

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:48.160
So I wonder if James
Madison would have seen this

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.150
as a greatly successful coup,

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:59.700
and whether the antifederalists
would have also rethought

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:01.000
the situation.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Klarman: Yeah.

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.600
That's a great question.

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.900
So I'm going to break
it into two parts.

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:06.200
The first part is what happened

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.830
to antifederalists'
criticism after ratification.

00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:11.980
And the second is what happened
to James Madison in the 1790s.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:15.290
So Gordon Wood, who's probably
the most eminent of the historians

00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:17.410
of this time period,
wrote an article called

00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:20.710
"Is there a James Madison
Problem for Historians?"

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:25.560
What exactly happened to Madison
between 1787 and the early 1790s?

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:29.230
So in answer to the first part the
antifederalists did pretty quickly

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:31.880 position:56%
give up their legitimacy complaints.

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.670
Those were a prominent
form of their objections

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:36.950
to the Constitution during
the ratifying debate.

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:38.470
This is illegitimate.

00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:40.300
There was no prep.

00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:43.150
There's nothing under the
Articles allowing a convention.

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:45.220
You've circumvented
the state legislatures.

00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:47.660
You've created special
ratifying conventions.

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:51.190
You changed the rule for a
ratification from 13 to nine.

00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:52.630
They argued it was illegitimate.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:55.600
After they lost, they
largely gave up that argument.

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.060
There are a couple possibilities.

00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:03.140
One possibility is the economy
was booming in the early 1790s.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:05.620
And the federalists and Hamilton
would have claimed it's actually

01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.320
because of the Constitution.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:10.020
People who are more dubious might
say it's because of the wars

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:13.100
in Europe between France and
Great Britain that opened up a lot

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.390
of demand for American
agricultural products,

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:17.430
and the United States
remained neutral in the law.

01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:22.000
Whatever the reason is though,
in times of a booming economy,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.840
people are maybe not as
interested in objecting

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.980
to the political arrangements
which exist.

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.180
So that might be one possibility.

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.880
The other possibility
is the Constitution,

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.560
and I'm fond of this one,
this is the one I'm drawn to,

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:39.390
the Constitution quickly proves
sufficiently indeterminate

01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:43.320
that the antifederalist types could
make the same arguments they had

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.350
made against the Constitution
within the Constitution.

01:00:47.350 --> 01:00:48.960
Right? So one of the
first debates is

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.720
over whether Congress can
charter a national bank.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.620
And Madison, who has now become one
of the leaders of the opposition,

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:57.910
says, "Congress doesn't have
authority to charter a bank.

01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:59.600 position:56%
There's nothing in Congress' powers.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.900
It can raise taxes.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.200
It can regulate commerce.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.500
It can fund armies.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.800
There's nothing about a bank."

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.990
But Alexander Hamilton says,
on the other hand, "Well,

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:08.290
Congress can borrow money.

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:11.080
Wouldn't it be convenient to have
a bank that could lend you money?

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.510
Congress can raise taxes and isn't
it convenient if the bank has notes

01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:17.130
that circulate that people
can pay their taxes in?"

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:20.510
And, so, they just disagree about
what the Constitution means.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.190
And that's happening
from the very beginning.

01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:25.420 position:56%
One of the first debates in Congress
is can the president remove the

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.120
secretary of state, or
whether the same Senate

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.820
that confirmed the secretary
of state has to play a role

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.680
in removing the secretary of state.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.170
That's a debate in
the first Congress.

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:38.830
1793, George Washington issues
a Neutrality Proclamation.

01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:41.760
Alexander Hamilton defends
that in the newspapers.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.520
James Madison attacks it saying
only Congress can declare war.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.750
So if Congress can declare war, why
can the president declare peace?

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:52.180
The Constitution turns out to
be sufficiently indeterminate

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:55.110
that the anti-federalist
types can go

01:01:55.110 --> 01:02:00.250
on making their same states'
rights' populist arguments

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:01.820
under the Constitution.

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.700
And indeed for much of the
period until the Civil War,

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.790
those people dominate the national
government, first under the guise

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:10.410
of Jeffersonians, then under
the guise of Jacksonians.

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:13.380
So what's the point of attacking
the legitimacy of a Constitution

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:17.560
when you can interview determine,
you can control its interpretation?

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.860
That's the first point.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.680
On Madison, you know, Madison
there is a real problem.

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.890
Madison seemed like a huge
nationalist since 1787.

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:28.080
He wanted national government
to be able to veto state laws.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.320
That's about as nationalist
as you can get.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.520
By 1798 Madison is arguing for
the power of a state legislature

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:37.800
to nullify a federal law,
as you know, in the context

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.480
of the Alien and Sedition Acts.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.040
Madison's writing resolutions for
the Virginia legislature saying

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.230
that a state audit be able
to nullify a federal law

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.240
that it thinks is unconstitutional.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.900
What happened to James Madison?

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.390
Historians have offered lots
of different interpretations.

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:58.380
The one that I'm most drawn to is
that Madison was only a nationalist

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:03.120
when he had in mind the state
debtor relief laws of the 1780s.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.940 position:56%
If states are going to be
redistributing wealth from creditors

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:09.620 position:56%
to debtors, Madison's a nationalist,
he wants to put a stop to that.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:14.080
Madison never signed on to
Hamilton's Mercantilist Program,

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.510
which Hamilton is going to execute
as secretary of the treasury.

01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:19.970
Madison doesn't think there
should be a national Bank.

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:22.490
Madison doesn't think the national
government should assume the

01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:23.790
state debts.

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:25.910
Madison doesn't think the
national government should

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:27.950
subsidize manufacturing.

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:30.950
That's exactly what Hamilton's
trying to put in place.

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:34.160
Madison is a Virginia aristocrat.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.900
The south literally
doesn't have any banks.

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.550
And now Hamilton's trying
to create a national bank?

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:41.650
Virginia has already
paid off its debts.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:44.930
Why should it support the national
government assuming state debts?

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:48.540
So Madison is representing
his constituents.

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:50.550
He's representing the
state of Virginia.

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:54.190
And I think genuinely he'd never
signed on to exactly what it is

01:03:54.190 --> 01:03:56.810
that Hamilton wanted to
do with national power.

01:03:56.810 --> 01:04:00.600
If there is one.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.010
I may have exhausted everybody.

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:04.310
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Okay.

01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:05.990

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:07.290

01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:10.950
