00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Uh, I think the issue of povertyis absolutely

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.160
crucial.
Unless you address global poverty then many

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.070
of the other issues that
people want to talk about don't get aaddressed

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.550
at all.
Umm, I am President of the Homeless World

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.320
Cup.
We, uh, involve homeless people from many,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.850
many countries, nearly 60
countries in the world, in playing football

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.020
and then use that as a way
of, uh, taking them away from on the streets

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.199
and being homeless and
we've found that to be quite success.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.230
Now, I think what we need to do is build on
the microproducts -- uh,

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.180
projects such as the Homeless World Cup and
they get help with, uh,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.370
the private sector, and government sector,
and try and create

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.550
something which is, uh, global in its, uh,
appeal and global in its

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.190
solutions.
Umm, I'm here at the world economic forum

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.430
and I think there is
generally a broad feeling amongst everybody

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.670
in all sectors that, uh,
something has to be done about poverty globally

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.619
but, umm, you know,
it's a question -- everybody's agreed poverty

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.310
shouldn't exist and
homeless shouldn't exist, how do we actually,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.749
uh, proceed, uh, tackle
from?

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:19.939
So what we try and do, therefore, I think
is important is to explain

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.889
things -- little projects like the Homeless
World Cup -- although it

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:27.039
is very, very effective is actually tiny in
the landscape -- is to try

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.599
and connect up all the little tiny projects,
learn from each other,

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.060
partner from each other, and then take the
whole thing to scale and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.729
defea t poverty.
You know, I'm a big believer in a hand up

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.740
rather than a handout and so
it's that type of, umm, philosophy that has

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.090
to run through any
solution.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.859
People living in the poverty kind of have
a solution at of their hands

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.000
and what we have got to do is create [unintelligible]
and just

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.439
[unintelligible].
