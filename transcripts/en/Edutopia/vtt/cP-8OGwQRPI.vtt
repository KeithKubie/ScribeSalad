00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:07.026
&gt;&gt;Christopher Pagan: We're going to
be taking a short survey again today

00:00:07.026 --> 00:00:09.166
to see how we're all doing.

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:12.556
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: At Garza,
the students can voice concerns

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:14.746
that they may have about their learning.

00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:19.396
Student surveys have a dramatic
impact on their ownership

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:22.566
of learning, and on teachers' practice.

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:32.156
&gt;&gt;It's so important for
students to have a voice,

00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:37.636
particularly in challenging subjects,
where it's difficult to take a risk

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:40.176
and say, "You know, I
don't really know one thing

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:42.006
that you've just said in Physics."

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:44.926
&gt;&gt;Kenya: By them asking for our
feedback, it kind of makes you feel

00:00:45.306 --> 00:00:46.276
like you have a voice, you know?

00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:47.756
Kind of makes you feel
a little bit important.

00:00:47.876 --> 00:00:51.746
&gt;&gt;Christopher Pagan: I was looking at my
students performance in my Physics class

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:56.116
and found that they just weren't
performing up to my expectations.

00:00:56.786 --> 00:01:01.576
So I developed a simple survey that
asked the students a few questions on,

00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:03.756
you know, "Why do you turn
in your homework late?

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:05.426
Or why do you always
turn it in on time?"

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:07.266
&gt;&gt;Kenya: Do we like the way he teaches?

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.906
Do we like the way he
demonstrates examples?

00:01:09.906 --> 00:01:12.726
Are we satisfied with our
performance in that class?

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:16.636
That was basically the purpose of the
survey, so he can know what to improve.

00:01:16.716 --> 00:01:18.396
&gt;&gt;Christopher Pagan: You can put
your name on it if you want to.

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:20.416
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:22.006
And remember, be honest!

00:01:22.486 --> 00:01:23.136
All right?

00:01:23.136 --> 00:01:25.206
If you're not honest,
we can't make changes

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:27.366
and we don't know how
to make adjustments.

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:30.766
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: He
got the information back,

00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:34.606
and those student surveys changed
and informed his instruction.

00:01:34.736 --> 00:01:37.456
&gt;&gt;Christopher Pagan: Some of the
students they were very strong

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:42.956
in the math, they wanted a little bit
more help gaining the conceptual ideas

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:47.486
and so I started to implement more
hands-on activities with the students.

00:01:47.796 --> 00:01:51.076
&gt;&gt;So what you're going to be doing is
trying to use the principle of resonance

00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:53.066
to calculate the speed of sound.

00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:58.406
&gt;&gt;Student: And so what we're
doing is we're recording the data.

00:01:58.406 --> 00:02:04.196
See how the tuning fork is 384 hertz,
and we measured the tube diameter,

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:06.766
which was 1.8 meters, and
we measured the length

00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:08.776
of the tube, which was 14.6 meters.

00:02:09.436 --> 00:02:11.406
&gt;&gt;Christopher Pagan: I
give them extra practice

00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:13.826
with homework problems, or pre-quizzes.

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:16.236
And so it helps the students
boost their grades

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:18.706
and I think it gives them
more confidence, as well.

00:02:19.186 --> 00:02:22.476
&gt;&gt;Kenya: I feel like I have
been learning more and kind

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:23.506
of getting the subject more.

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:27.926
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: So this year, we
did a student survey for all teachers.

00:02:28.326 --> 00:02:31.906
And we asked things like, "Do you
feel comfortable in this class?

00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:33.476
Do you trust the teacher?

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:35.676
Do I feel like I'm challenged?"

00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:41.966
And we got lots of meaningful feedback.

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:44.926
&gt;&gt;Cynthia Hess: One of the things that
I really took away from the surveys,

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:48.316
my students needed something different
from me than what they were getting.

00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:48.796
Come on in, guys.

00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:53.576
They were ready for something more
rigorous, and some of the answers were,

00:02:53.786 --> 00:02:58.406
"I wish she didn't feel she had to
hold our hands through tough things."

00:02:58.836 --> 00:03:01.066
That was really enlightening.

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:06.476
In terms of how it affected my teaching
practice, instead of reading something

00:03:06.476 --> 00:03:10.296
with them in class, and then guiding
them through and telling them what

00:03:10.406 --> 00:03:13.566
to look for, I might give them
something to read outside of class,

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:15.706
and they would tell me what they found.

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:18.916
&gt;&gt;Student: I think what she meant like
the color of the bags was like the skin

00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:21.216
of the people, and the stuff
inside was like your personality,

00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:23.156
what we've been through and all that.

00:03:23.226 --> 00:03:24.456
&gt;&gt;Cynthia Hess: Experience, good!

00:03:24.656 --> 00:03:26.646
&gt;&gt;Christopher Pagan: Though
we're all resistant to change,

00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:29.056
teaching has to be something
that's fluid.

00:03:29.056 --> 00:03:32.286
We always have to be
adapting to our students.

00:03:32.286 --> 00:03:35.696
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: I think this
process of getting the student voice,

00:03:36.016 --> 00:03:40.776
and acting upon the student
voice, actually builds their faith

00:03:40.856 --> 00:03:44.596
in the system here of learning,

00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:49.416
as they become more empowered,
they are more successful.

00:03:49.686 --> 00:03:51.956
&gt;&gt;Student: So there's a type of
language that was in the story.

00:03:52.156 --> 00:03:52.256
&gt;&gt;Cynthia Hess: Good!

00:03:52.256 --> 00:03:54.826
Anybody else want to share
their thoughts or opinions?
