00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.930
&gt;&gt; I'm Uta Francke. I'm a human

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.010
geneticist originally from Germany, as you can hear.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.740
And I'm a Emeritus Professor here at Stanford

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.730
and also a senior medical director at 23andMe.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.910
&gt;&gt; Tell us when you first fell in

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.850
love with genetics and when you started studying

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.260
and sort of your journey to where you are today as a, as a Stanford professor.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.468
&gt;&gt; I went to medical school in Germany and

00:00:22.468 --> 00:00:25.432
then I trained in pediatrics. I came to this country

00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:29.060
to train at Los Angeles Children's Hospital. And then

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.000
I had to think about what else to do and

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.720
what I really wanted to do was endocrinology because I

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.080
love biochemistry. I thought biochemistry was the best thing in

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.150
medical school. But I couldn't get in as a

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.860
foreign medical graduate. And genetics was just in the beginning,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.910
started to get interesting. It was just at the time

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.910
where it became possible to identify chromosomes by chromosome banding.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.220
And there weren't many people going into that

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.940
field which had a great advantage because as a

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.195
fellow at UCLA in, in human genetics I was

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:04.910
allowed to do anything. I could learn chromosomes, biochemical

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.300
genetics as well as the, the patients on

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.490
the wards where people said, oh, what is this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.610
my formation is it a syndrome, is it genetic,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.914
will it happen again. So, the training involved from

00:01:16.914 --> 00:01:21.980
the beginning, clinical genetics and then other sub-specialties of genetics.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.540
&gt;&gt; Were you able to interact in, in, in I guess, medical

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.390
school and beyond as you were sort of discovering the area that you

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.580
were sort of going to focus on for, for genetics? At the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.590
same time, were you able to experience the clinical side of genetics as well?

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.250
&gt;&gt; All the time. I was active in clinical genetics

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.930
for the last 30-something years.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.670
&gt;&gt; And what does that involve exactly?

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.150
&gt;&gt; Well, in pediatrics, you're mostly focused on children having problems. So

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.650
either children who inherit something or children who get very sick after

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.640
they are born because they cannot metabolize protein, there's something wrong in

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.500
their metabolism, or children who have certain birth defects. Children who don't

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.910
do well in school, who are late walking,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.750
who are late acquiring skills or have neurological

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.100
symptoms, seizures. So all kinds of problems that

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.530
people didn't know what is this. So there was

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.661
a lot of discovery to do. We found

00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:25.361
out that certain clinical phenotypes were associated with

00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:28.913
chromosomal duplications or deletions now that we could

00:02:28.913 --> 00:02:32.572
look at chromosomes in higher resolution. So, that was

00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:35.080
the first stage, so in the 70s, make

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.643
discoveries this way. And now of course whole genome

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:42.793
sequencing is applied to these children. And when

00:02:42.793 --> 00:02:45.684
nobody had, could figure out what caused their problem,

00:02:45.684 --> 00:02:47.513
you look at the whole sequence and you

00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:50.214
can find a change. And that's been very successful

00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:53.154
in the last couple of years since high, high-throughput

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:57.660
sequencing methods were developed. So, the exciting thing about

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.350
my own career is a two-way street, it's always been

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.670
two ways between the clinic and the laboratory. You see

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.460
somebody fascinating in the clinic and you bring samples to

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.340
the lab and you tell your PhDs, look, this is

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.640
what the patients look like and we have to figure

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.050
out what's going on here. And that gets everybody motivated.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.600
And you learn something in the lab. You find a

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.940
gene, like we found the gene for Rett syndrome and

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.170
then you can figure out, can we do anything

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.490
to help these patients now that we have the gene

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.350
we figure out its function. In the last few

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.060
years we spend a lot of time making mouse models.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.580
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.030
&gt;&gt; Because we looked at diseases that involved the central nervous

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.900
system and you can't go into a human brain and take a

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.220
sample. I mean some people have part of the brain removed because

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.250
of some medical indication and then of course you can get it.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.610
But what we did make mouse models because

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.350
the genome is very conserved between the human and

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.546
the mouse. And even though we're working with deletion

00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:01.550
syndromes, where part of a chromosome is missing, we

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.640
can define where in the mouse genome that part

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.750
is located. Its got the same genes in it.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.220
Take it out in the mouse and then you

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.640
have mice that you can study the development prenatally.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.380
Afterwards, take the brain, cut it up, look at what's going on.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.184
And this is what we did mostly in, while in this millennium

00:04:23.184 --> 00:04:23.500
[UNKNOWN].

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.630
&gt;&gt; What, what would you say is your, your general research subject?

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.600
&gt;&gt; There were too many to mention. I really started

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.240
out with whatever was possible to do at the time.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.990
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.550
&gt;&gt; You know I was in a way driven by technology that was being developed and I

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.030
saw where this technology could be applied to the,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.540
the problem. So it started with cytogenetics in the

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.670
area of banding chromosomes, that was in the 70s. And then biochemical

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.420
genetics, somatic cell genetics meaning that you can fuse cells from different

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.890
organisms and you can map chromosomes. So in the beginning of the genome

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.430
project we were very much invested in mapping genes to chromosomal regions.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.060
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.580
&gt;&gt; With the idea if you have a

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.560
gene that's been cloned and you know the function,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.140
you map it to a chromosome region where we

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.810
already know a certain disease gene has been mapped,

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.320
then becomes a candidate gene for this disease. And

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.120
that was a useful approach in the early 90s.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.900
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.308
&gt;&gt; And then as all these other

00:05:29.308 --> 00:05:32.124
technologies became available to study global gene

00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:35.830
expression patterns and doing mouse modeling. And

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.600
we then we moved to studying individual diseases,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.509
like Rett syndrome and Roberts syndrome and some eye

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.570
formation syndrome. And ultimately, I thought the deletion syndromes, where

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.520
you take out a chunk of chromosome and, would

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.280
be interesting because there are many different genes in there.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.713
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:54.713 --> 00:05:58.400
&gt;&gt; And which of these genes contribute to what part of the phenotype. I

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.850
found that fascinating. And that's was the project we're working on in the end.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.430
So it, it's a step-wise process of discovery that

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.655
makes use of the technology as it is being developed.

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:16.415
&gt;&gt; So is thinking about what you do as a career what

00:06:16.415 --> 00:06:20.655
do you think the future is for people who are interested in being

00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:26.335
clinicians and bridging the gap between you know, people and the research that

00:06:26.335 --> 00:06:30.177
can help them. Do you think there's going to be a bigger opening

00:06:30.177 --> 00:06:32.137
in, in, in the future for people who want

00:06:32.137 --> 00:06:34.209
to, who want to so do something similar to,

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:37.239
to what you're doing? Well there was definitely a

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:41.283
need and there are many opportunities. But the drawbacks are

00:06:41.283 --> 00:06:44.641
in genetics for example, we don't have enough people

00:06:44.641 --> 00:06:48.437
coming into medical genetics out of the medicine side because

00:06:48.437 --> 00:06:51.850
in genetics, you don't make any money. We don't

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.190
have procedures. We don't, don't stick tubes into people that

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.920
we can charge for. It's all cognitive. You

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.580
know, you spend a lot of time going through

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.370
complicated information, searching the literature, sitting down with the

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.760
family counseling them. You don't get reimbursement for this.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.920
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.700
&gt;&gt; And therefore it's not attractive, not if, not

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.780
for people who went to American medical schools and

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.670
to enter a career of a medical geneticist. So

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.240
we have a shortage and many of the most

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.450
successful people are foreign trained medical, medical doctors.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.990
So don't have to pay for their medical education.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.110
&gt;&gt; But we hopefully have a, a very

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.800
large international audience you know, participating in our course.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:32.860
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, mm-hm.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.960
&gt;&gt; What would you say to a student or a

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.373
life time learner who's watching and is really interested in

00:07:38.373 --> 00:07:40.870
this subject and may even be interested in thinking about

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.960
this as a career. What advice would you give them?

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.444
&gt;&gt; I mean I can only say this has been a lifetime

00:07:45.444 --> 00:07:48.687
learning experience to be part of genetics during those

00:07:48.687 --> 00:07:51.792
decades when everything developed and we are not done

00:07:51.792 --> 00:07:53.830
yet. I think it goes on and will be

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.620
even more exciting. There are many secrets in the

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.410
genome that are yet to be unraveled and both

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.450
PhDs and, and MDs should consider this. And then

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.820
genetic counseling, that's a whole new career path. We

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.040
have a training program here at Stanford for genetic counselors.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.280
It's a masters program because you don't have to have a PhD or an MD

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.000
to tell people, this is what we found in your sequence and this is what it

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.040
means. And these people are trained specifically to

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.040
do that. And we'll need a ton of

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.300
them, lots of them. So I want to encourage people to consider this as a career.
