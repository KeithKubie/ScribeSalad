00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.180
Welcome.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.660
I'm going to try to cover
the whole of the global

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.140
environmental crisis, the entire
globe, at a rate of

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.120
about 1 slide every
23 seconds.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.200
The idea for the Unconference
came from hearing about this

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.020
exciting new way of doing
conferences, that's happening

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.510
in sort of techie circles.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.250
I wanted to bring that
creativity and that idea of

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.890
listening to your
audience into an

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.420
event with young people.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.920
This is the problem you face
if we look at the world

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.640
population going back to when
humans appeared from

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.740
mitochondrial DNA, probably
around 130,000 years ago.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.150
We're wacking through at
an incremental rate.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.030
This is a staggering rate
of population growth.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.130
Why do we need science media
coverage in the first place?

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.540
Why do we need science out
there on TV, in the

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.020
newspapers, on the internet?

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.380
The fastest mass extinction the
planet has ever seen on

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.210
the fossil record.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.040
Probably by a factor
of 10,000 fold.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.000
And you're in the middle
of it right now.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.900
There'll be lots of kids in your
school like lots of kids

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.560
that I've encountered who
don't really want to do

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.580
science after 16.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.160
They're not really
interested in it.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.840
No matter how hard people like
me try to get them interested.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.400
They're not.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.690
So is it fair that we force
them to study science?

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.490
Are you really going to teach
those kids science?

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.570
Or are you going to build in
them a resentment towards

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.570
science because they were
made to study it

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.560
until they were 16.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.390
Does it really matter if the
public don't understand the

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.390
full nitty gritty of scientific
research?

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.830
And if it's all slightly wrong,
is it the job of the

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.610
media to be educating the
public in any case.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.970
Is that really their role?

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.290
In the next three years,
chopping down rainforests will

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.490
release as much carbon dioxide
as every single airplane

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.685
ticket ever sold since the days
of the Wright brothers up

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:42.190
to the year 2025.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.187
The problem with land mines is
they are a very cheap and

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:45.500
effective deterrent.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.480
You don't want someone to
go into a certain area.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.360
You lay landmines.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.690
You just scatter them
from an aircraft.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.620
You lay landmines.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.900
The first few people go in, they
get limbs blown off, and

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.120
they don't go in again.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.120
But it's not good enough
to just state

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.630
that science is important.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.030
You have to explain why.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.200
So your challenge this afternoon
is, you need to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.530
convince me that everybody needs
to study science because

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.830
I'm not convinced.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.810
Costs around 768 grams of CO2
per dollar spent on GDP.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.650
You've got to get that
down to six.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.730
Hooke's Law.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.600
Have you all done Hooke's Law?

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.650
All right, what's the point
of Hooke's Law?

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.490
You get some springs, you hang
some weights off it.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.890
It's probably incredibly
boring, right?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.590
And Hooke already did it.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.790
With most science there is
an ethical dimension.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.380
Look, just because you find
something fun doesn't mean

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.370
you're learning anything.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.200
The science is made
so simple as to

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.700
actually making it wrong.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.230
Adults, my generation,
have no solutions to

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.480
any of these problems.

00:02:44.502 --> 00:02:46.962
We have got so much knowledge.

00:02:46.962 --> 00:02:48.438
We have so many resources.

00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:50.420
Yet we still act like
stupid idiots.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.950
We import oranges from
South Africa.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.616
We don't have to look
after the Earth to

00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:55.248
make our lives easier.

00:02:55.248 --> 00:02:56.342
We have to look after
the Earth to make

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.000
our kid's lives easier.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.050
Our lives are going to
be much easier if we

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.730
don't look after it.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.542
If you want the genuine
information then you go read

00:03:01.542 --> 00:03:03.174
it from a journal, in
the first place.

00:03:03.174 --> 00:03:06.642
As opposed to getting it from
the main stream media.

00:03:06.642 --> 00:03:09.720
To simplify it so that regular
people can understand it.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.130
And it's not all
medical jargon.

00:03:15.772 --> 00:03:16.141
The problem with hydrogen is
that it's explosive, it's

00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:17.391
highly reactive.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.425
Surely this comes to the
responsibility of the person

00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:23.740
designing it, because they
could create a very silly

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.670
experiment.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.840
Even if you do have to simplify
something so that the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.880
general public can understand
it, that doesn't mean it

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.780
should be less accurate.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.420
L'Oreal was founded by a chemist
over 100 years ago.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.840
And so science is absolutely
fundamental to

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.720
everything that we do.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.600
The challenge with doing such
an unstructured event with

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.010
young people is that they're
not used to being given the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.346
floor in such an open way.

00:03:45.346 --> 00:03:47.250
And apart from anything else
that can be really daunting.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.880
So we've added in a little
bit more structure.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.490
If you can't hear what's going
on, do put up your hand.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.945
If 99% of people
think it's not.

00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:58.260
Then you've proven
that it's wrong.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.850
The challenge for us has been
learning how to do this

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.020
entirely new type of event as
we're going, using e-mail and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.150
Twitter with young people in a
live event has been a bit of a

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.030
steep learning curve for us.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.425
Well, not really...

00:04:09.425 --> 00:04:12.036
It fits a well known
stereotype.

00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:13.560
And it is largely true.

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:19.939
You see the sports personnel who
are on TV all the time and

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:21.059
they're not scientists.

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:22.050
They haven't done the science.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.200
You don't see the
science side.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.610
on the object.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.170
I say that it's more that
we've been made to feel

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.420
dependent on it.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.845
What about all the
medical devices?

00:04:30.845 --> 00:04:32.640
You've got all the equipment
in hospitals that use

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.785
electricity to save lives.

00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:35.330
You'd be going backwards.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.500
You would actually just go
back to being a caveman.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.520
No, I'm not saying getting rid
of all electricity, I'm just

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.361
saying that there are certain
things that we are really made

00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:43.550
to feel that we need, a lot
more than we actually do.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.010
We hope to feed back some of
the themes from the day

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.920
directly to Parliament to give
them a flavour of what young

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.540
people think of the answers to
the sorts of questions that

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.860
we've been debating today.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.110
You cannot get rid of basic
scientific literacy.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.810
We already have so much
scientific illiteracy in the

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.070
world and it's really
not helping.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.190
It's someone's job themselves to
question what they see and

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.830
what they hear and
what they read.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.160
And if people don't do that,
then it's simply a

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.410
free-for-all, anyone could say
whatever they like, especially

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.350
in the media.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.750
So that's why we want people
to be better informed about

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.780
science in general.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.890
And that's key, we thought about
critical thinking, that

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.820
needs to be compulsory to
everyone from earlier.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.210
Because it's difficult to get
work experience and not many

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.130
children are exposed to what
worker insights would be like,

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.200
it's quite hard to aspire for
a career which you really

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.900
don't have any information
about.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.070
If you look at how science
actually works, then you look

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.980
at the stuff on the GCSE
specification, they're

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.470
completely divorced
from each other.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.310
But the one thing we can do is
make sure that the kids, the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.680
younger generation, make the
choice that they really want

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.500
to, like make sure there's
opportunities to become

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.590
scientists, that is if they
want to become scientists.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.490
We want to make GCSEs a lot
more challenging to

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.350
differentiate between the real
future scientists and the

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.070
people who are quite good.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.710
The idea of a beef tax, which
despite unpopular opinion

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.730
based from people who like
steak, we think that this

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.100
would actually work
quite well.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.150
Because for a start, cows
produce a large amount of

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.640
methane and that contributes
to global warming.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.750
At the same time, there
are lots and lots of

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.370
other options for food.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.770
We want to be consistent with
the specifications.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.340
We only want to change them if
something has gone deeply,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.532
deeply wrong.

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:24.350
Because if you just
- Thank you.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.410
Sometimes when things like
polymers are discovered, it

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.070
creates whole new industries
which leads to millions of new

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.250
jobs eventually.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.440
It also leads to jobs outside
of science as well.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.850
If you're attached to the
government, you speak for the

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.810
government, it doesn't have to
be this huge negative thing

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.230
fighting global warming.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.795
It can be...

00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:47.490
It can mean maybe that Britain
tries to become the biggest

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.190
exporter of environmental
technology.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.290
We don't have to see it as like
a huge job that we have

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.130
to fight against.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.915
We can see it as a way to make
money and a way to actually

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.450
get richer as a whole
group of people.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.400
So you need to educate
people, and not just

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.840
young people, but adults.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.520
Because a point that we raised,
someone like Professor

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.160
Hugh Montgomery who is saying
that it's now our

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.450
generation's job.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.810
He doesn't have to suddenly say,
that's it, I'm not going

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.580
to do anything anymore,
it's your job now.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.070
You're still a generation, well
I'm looking at people

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.835
sitting lower down, that's still
very much prominent in

00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:19.690
everyday life.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.110
So everyone needs
to be educated.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.832
And that would largely now be
done through the media because

00:07:24.832 --> 00:07:26.580
we can't tell you all to
go back to school.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.265
Another main issue is
environmental investment.

00:07:36.907 --> 00:07:39.692
It's very different from
anything else we've ever done.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:42.390
It's hard to get a consensus
on anything.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.620
Very, very tough.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.790
I think it's worth the trip
down from Yorkshire.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.745
I can now see why politicians
have a tough time.
