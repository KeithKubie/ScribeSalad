00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.220
SPEAKER: Hero transitions
are a common UI pattern.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.280
They let the user know
that they changed screens,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.050
while keeping the focus of the
interaction front and center.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.770
Flutter has the Hero widget.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.750
It will automatically
create a Hero transition

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.290
between two navigator routes.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.810
Flutter will figure out where
the widget is in both routes

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.790
and animate the change
between locations.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.050
Let's say you want to use
a picture as your Hero.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.540
Put it on both the page routes--

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.090
the one that you'll
be transitioning from

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.790
and the one you'll
be transitioning to.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.440
Then, wrap the image with a
Hero widget on both pages.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.850
Add a tag.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.710
This can be any object.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.640
The important thing is to use
the same tag on both pages

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.300
so that Flutter knows which
Hero we are animating.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.250
And you're done.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.920
For best results,
make the widget tree

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.240
below the Hero widget
identical on both screens.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.960
Hero doesn't need to wrap
only images, of course.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.580
Experiment with Clips for some
really cool animation effects.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.910
For more info on Hero and
all the other widgets,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.680
head to Flutter.io.
