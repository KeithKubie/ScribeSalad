00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.710
Here's another way to visualize the

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.850
relationship between these different attributes that

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.440
I mentioned of performance, extensibility and

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.850
protection or safety. A DOS-like structure that

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.970
does not pay attention to safety or protection, needs the two attributes

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.830
of performance and extensibility. A micro

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.430
kernel based approach achieves protection and extensibility,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.630
but may have issues with respect

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.280
to performance. A monolithic structure may yield

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.050
good performance, has protection. But, it is not easily extensible. Now what do

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.230
we want? Of course we want all three of these characteristics in an operating

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.440
system structure. But can we have all of these three characteristics in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.540
an operating system? In other words, what we would like the operating system

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.570
structure to be such. That, we get to this, center

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.510
of the triangle that caters to all three attributes. Performance,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.410
Extensibility, and Protection. And the research ideas that we will

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.690
study in this course module. Is, looking at ways

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.540
to get to the center of the triangle so that all three attributes

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.160
can be present in the structure of the operating system. We will resume the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.260
course module with research approaches that have been proposed than that we will

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.450
cover in this course module that help us get to the middle of the triangle.
