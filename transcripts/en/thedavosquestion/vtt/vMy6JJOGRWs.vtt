00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
&gt;&gt; Well, as far as as what's being done for
the Middle East, right now

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.530
it seems like such a stalemate.
It seems like there are two steps back for

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.639
every step forward.
And right now, I don't feel a lot of optimism

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.340
that there's going be to
progress, certainly not through the conventional

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.930
methods.
That is to say, through the political pathways

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.830
that have been
entrenched in the negative approach for so

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.550
long.
But I do think at a grassroots level, there's

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.720
a better understanding of
the need to resolve this so that there is

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.110
greater stability.
And I do believe that resolving, especially

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.250
the Israeli/Palestinian
situation, will make a big difference to a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.700
lot of other areas around
the world.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.910
The whole Islamophobia and the negativity
that comes out of that, and

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.090
the sort of the radicalization of many Muslims
comes founded in that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.460
there seems to be an imbalance or an unfair
approach to the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.310
Israeli/Palestinian situation.
So I think there is hope at a grassroots level

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.280
of moving forward.
As far as the politicians, I think we have

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.350
a long way to go.
