Speaker 4:          00:05:58       of me. They definitely summed it all up, dude. It was brilliant. It was brilliant. That was brilliant. The funny thing about it is though, like if there was a way to authentically sell your soul, there wouldn't have to be any trickery involved in that. Like people would just do it. Some people would definitely do it. Well, there's people out there called bug chasers that are gay guys that are trying to get HIV. Trying to, yeah, I know. Trying to find sick guys to bang them in the ass. Yeah, they have bug chaser parties. What the fuck you just told me about this last time I hung out with them. Surreal Shit, man. It's real shit. Well, it's because apparently if you're gay and you are having unprotected sex, then there's this always this paranoia. It's kind of floating around you that you might have aids because isn't it?

Speaker 4:          00:06:47       I don't know that how it works. But when you get aids, it doesn't it take some time that show up or something. Like sometimes he doesn't show. It's a very, very complicated virus. It's a very controversial, you know, I've never heard, there's no major virus that I've ever heard anybody say is fake except for aids. Have you ever heard them? No one's ever said that. You know, I mean if you ever heard like the gonorrhea is fake. You've heard the, the AIDS is the only one that I've ever heard. Like this is not a real thing. Yeah, that's right. You can't get aids with a flashlight. And it's a tricky, it's a tricky one because yeah, we're sponsored by the fleshlight fuck a flashlight instead of letting people with aids. Fuck you. So you can get a bug. That's ridiculous. But, well, I did. The idea is that you have HIV first and that HIV causes AIDS, right?

Speaker 4:          00:07:29       That's, that's the, that's what they're saying. Yes. So it's, but how come it's not like one thing? Why isn't it like, you know, you, you get boom, you get syphilis areas, their syphilis. Why is it this tricky thing where you know, you, you know, you're, you're sick. Oh No. You know what I'm saying? Like you get HIV and the HIV becomes aids. It's like, aren't you dying of HIV then? Like what do you, I don't know why they do, they describe it in two ways. There is a thing that I saw how it, there's different ways to define whether you have aids cause there's a certain, isn't it like the eye you're with aids means is your immune system is broken down, right? Right. Does the in that, is that possible that you can get that from both the, from different things. So it's like what they're saying is HIV causes AIDS, but it's not the only cause of aids.

Speaker 4:          00:08:14       Is that where they're saying, well, I mean like maybe some other immune system breakdown type shit. Like there's other people that argue for like, there's a guy named, what the fuck is his name? Uh, he's uh, we'll, I'll look it up real quick. But to Peter Duesberg, Peter Duesberg, and he seems to be like this, like really credible biologists from the University of California Berkeley and he's got this crazy theory that aids isn't real and that what it is is a conglomeration of a bunch of other diseases and apparently he's been totally discredited. And you know, all the mainstream time Tiffin studies have pointed to know there is a very real connection between HIV and aids and this is very irresponsible what he's doing. But this guy's still deal in it.

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       Like you still saying it and he's got like all these papers that he's written on it. It's like it's such a weird fucking, you know that's a tricky ass topic made sure is. And it's tricky to cut through the, you know all the information sources you have about it. You have to think, okay, are these information sources that came from pharmaceutical companies, manufacturing drugs does happen. Oh hell yeah. I just read this thing that there is a famous book by an advertiser, I can't remember his name, but it's supposedly like the one of the old bibles of advertising. And he, he said that rather than just selling a product, don't be ridiculous. What you should do is create a demand, create the demand first and then create demand for something that doesn't exist yet. Create a mythology around the thing you're selling. So I'm kind of describing it in a clumsy way, but he said what he did is he started advertising and papers, um, pianos, no, not pianist.

Speaker 5:          00:09:52       He started in papers putting articles about how it's popular right now for families to, uh, be learning music and taking music lessons in their living rooms that, but he ran a piano company. So the idea was instead of just selling pianos flat out, he created this new thing in society and in the, in, in the, uh, Zeitgeists, which is that, you know, a really good family does have a piano in their living room. And so then people naturally decided to start buying the pianos. So in the same way with aids or with a swine flu or with, uh, you know, God, it's so funny to watch like the pharmaceutical commercials cause it'll be like some problem you've never heard of in your fucking life. Like do you have minor ankle inflammation or one thing I saw was like a, do you have particularly heavy bleeding on the 31st month of your menstruation cycle?

Speaker 5:          00:10:44       You might be a double heavy bleeder. You know, like they said, they come up with this thing in all of history. You've never heard of a double heavy bleeder, but like they just invent this thing. It just start selling the drug. And so, you know, thinking, I don't know, you're probably not a hypochondriac. I'm a bit of a hyper contract. So think if like you're a woman and you have noticed like a little more flow than normal, you're like, I might be a double heavy bleeder. That's a real quote. You're being serious. Yes sir. Yeah, that's true. The real costs. All you were just joking about the piano thing. No, but the double heavy bleeders, no, it's, that's not that scientific name for it. They have a different name for it, but it is. She fucking double heavy bleeder. They is the worst name for anything but it like a triple heavy flow. It's got a weird name for it. It's so ridiculous. But yeah. So aids, you know, this information you're getting, is this coming from Pharma pharmaceutical companies selling bullshit medicine or is it coming from actual scientists who weren't hired by the pharmaceutical companies to prove that their medicine is necessary? It's confusing you. Do you think there's that much corruption that they really get a chance to influence studies and findings as you really think there's

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       that much corruption? I think it's cynical to say that when you live in, it's an interesting idea though, right? Like how much corruption is there really? We know there's definitely some corruption. Well, they saved us from swine flu. I remember how bad that was. Such an industry, man. That's the tricky thing is you people don't understand like there are billions of dollars to be made and so the idea that someone would invent a disease, no, well that's ridiculous. I'm not going to invent a disease, but they might make a much bigger deal out of something that really needs to be. It's like, you know, all of the sudden, you know, it was a particular type of flu. It was connected to a pig and you know, some people died from it. Like it's a strong flow, but there's strong fluids every fucking year. People die from the flu every year.

Speaker 4:          00:12:37       Flues are terrible. Yeah. But it's a, that's a thing that's, you know, they all come from livestock. No, I didn't want, not all of them, but a lot of them come from birds and pigs and like that's where they come from. They come from, they come from our farm animals man. Fucking living together in, in, in, in terrible conditions. Yeah. I think it might be making that up. That's what it is. Because, I mean, if you look at some of the video of slaughter houses are like the really bad cattle farms. That's the 10th circle of hell there, man. So, so strange how we're evolving as a, as a being, but so we have disconnected our own personal lives from the murder of animals for food. Like the connection between eating animals and having food totally, completely removed. Like I know so many people that love cheeseburgers, but you say, hey, you want to go hunting?

Speaker 4:          00:13:26       And they'll look at you like, Oh fuck that are you are redneck? Yeah. What are you going to do? You're going to kill an animal. Like, oh my God. Like, you know? Yeah. The, the, the, they'll look at you like you're a piece of shit. Yeah, but they'll have bacon on there. Their cheeseburger. I love thinking it's a double murder sandwich. Cow and pig slaughtered, by the way, if you are like, if you run into someone who's a hunter, that negative stigma attached to being a hunter is, is pretty intense. It's like, Oh really? JETHRO, do you go out there and hunt deer out in the forest? You fucking barbaric man. And meanwhile you're stuffing your face full of mystery meat from Bhagwan yesterday. What the fuck it is. Yeah. Burger king meet. Yeah, it's, it's just, it is a very curious thing. And also the other thing of it and that, you know, I've, I've really, I've got Terrence McKinnon the brain right now because I've been reading food or the food of the gods.

Speaker 4:          00:14:21       Fuck man. Um, credible book now, incredible staff ideas behind it. So fascinating. The idea, the big one is the mushroom, the stoned ape theory for the folks who haven't heard us. We've talked to, and we've talked about this before, but turns for Ken, his theory was that the reason why the human brain size doubled over a period of 2 million years, it's like one of the biggest mysteries in the entire fossil record. And he equates it to the time where the climate changed and rain forest receded into grasslands and monkeys climbed down from trees and start experimenting with new food sources and they would flip over cow patties to find like bugs and beetles and shit. And like they do that today. And when they saw mushrooms growing in the cow patties, certain groups of these monkeys started eating these mushrooms and two things happen. One, it increased their visual acuity and made them be able to see much better. And then the other thing that happened is it made them horny. So here you have these better hunters because they can see things better. There are probably, they can throw things and they're more accurate and then they're horny. So they're going to fuck. And then of course, if they're eating plates of these fucking things, they're going to have psychedelic experiences. Sure. Even if you're a monkey, maybe. And if you have psychedelic experiences like every day, maybe it's just like, it's like a forced fed, you know, evolution thing.

Speaker 5:          00:15:36       Well, can I throw a crazy idea? He so, and he has a very scientific mind and I think he, I mean he hated mentioning the idea of Sa. Oh, he did. I don't think he hated mentioning about if you look at his live lectures, he always like at one point he said he would much rather look at what happened to him when he was in the Amazon and figured out the thing about the eating, I don't know the exact quote but he said um, he would much rather be able to call it psychosis then channeling because he was so anti the new age stuff and the new age movement. But if we kind of talked about this the last time I was on here and I don't think we ever like the answered it, which is the question is when you're having a psychedelic experience, are you just seeing a hallucination or are you tuning in with some higher vibratory, higher intelligence?

Speaker 5:          00:16:22       Some higher force of Mackinac talked about extra terrestrials and if you've ever been in on a psychedelic and sometimes you do experience something that you would think is extra terrestrial. So this is where it gets weird. You know how people say aliens like landed some ship and dabbled with the DNA of the apes and that's what caused the super evolution. What if it wasn't dabbling with the DNA the aliens did? What if it was the communication, like Mckenna said was coming through the mushroom. The way they were communicating with these apes that were eating them was like, oh wait, hold on. We've got some potential here. These, they have brains that could develop their kind of tuning into us a little bit. Let's start feeding them some information. It's like, imagine if some primitive species on some other planet found a transistor radio and they could kind of in some way understand the communication coming from it. They were still super primitive, but there's some way. Maybe there was a video thing on it and you could show them how to make a fire, like just hit Flint together. You can make a fire if you had the intention of like speeding up their evolution. Maybe it's the same thing, only happened organically, you know? Yeah. I would think the same. I would think that

Speaker 4:          00:17:28       more than the other way. I would definitely think that there'll be much more willing to travel that way than by ships. Why? Why do we think that? If we figured out eventually that we are all one thing, you know, if we figured out eventually that all life in the air and space and everything combined is all really connected in some sort of a, a strange way that we don't totally understand, but there's some sort of a connection. Well then these little like we're these spores, you know, these spores are all like they can go in a vacuum in space, they can travel in extreme cold and extreme heat. They can absorb radiation and not get damaged and they can travel from other planets. Like if, if a meteor hits a chunk of this planet can get knocked off and that gets sent flying into space and it lands on another planet and those spores, all of a sudden that we're in this rock get to give birth on this planet and just communicate with all the animals that are here.

Speaker 6:          00:18:25       That's it. That's the idea. That's the idea. Yeah. That they're trying, that they're a transmission devices of some higher intelligence and they're not causing your, I just am so over that notion that uh, hallucinating or being stoned as an artificial experience, you know, like, cause I, I realized like I was really high the other day and I was walking down the street and I was like, man, this is fucking beautiful. It's a beautiful day. I feel great. And then another part of my brain snuck in and it's like, yeah, but you're stoned. You're stone. This isn't real happiness. Real happiness can only come without the influence of a truck and that is such fucking conditioning. I realized, oh that's conditioning. This is a valid, perfectly normal, good experience. Yes. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:19:11       absolutely. And why, why is, why is it a good experience? I think one of the reasons is because your body is tuning in to this plant. I think marijuana in, in as the psilocybin has a plant intelligence. And I think when you absorb it into your body, it gives you something different. It's not just you because you, you what? You are flat. All right, you're a receiver. And when you put things into your body, there are certain things that you put into your body that have a very extreme result. A very, the, the, the, they bring about a very extreme condition. Mushrooms are one of them, right? Marijuana is one of them. We have to assume that there's, it's not just go, Whoa, you're just tweaking your brain. You're just screwing with your chemicals. Maybe, or maybe you're tuning in to another frequency, maybe allowing, you know, eating these mushrooms, eating marijuana, all this different shit that you do pay AOD. Maybe it allows you to just tune in to their frequency.

Speaker 6:          00:20:04       Yeah. And, and, and maybe it's not just, um, a real experience. Maybe it's a better, more advanced experience than whatever the normal non stone state of being is. I was just talking

Speaker 4:          00:20:16       sometimes, but sometimes not. I mean, when you, when you smoke like heavy, like oh Gee Kush type weed and it turns you into a moron. That stuff's not that good for the cause. But if you follow that, if you call it uses, you remembered the, hold on a second though. Do you remember the time we were all in Houston and we smoked Joey's we'd, yeah, and Joey is smoke sativas now. But back then he was smoking the deep indicas. This was 400 pound Joey. This was, he would go with the old g Kush dog visit. That's all I, that's all I roll with. And you, we smoked it. We were all in the car and we smoke Joey's and when we, when we got to the hotel room, we were all standing in the lobby going, what the fuck

Speaker 6:          00:20:53       can, can I, do you remember what happened before it got to the hotel room? No, cause it's the only time that's ever happened in my life. We went up train tracks. Do you remember that? We were driving on train tracks. Do you remember that? Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       You were on the very right and you were on the train check lane like Oh yeah. It was very confusing. Yeah. Yeah. We were fucking, thank God I was sober while I was driving. Yeah. Yeah. No, I know. But like just a weird wrong turn.

Speaker 6:          00:21:21       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:21:22       The real problem with that weed is that it is your fucking crushes your memory. Like you don't remember what you were talking about five seconds ago like we were standing there. Just be dazzled going, what the fuck man? What's wrong? And then somebody said it, I don't know who said it. We smoked Joey's weed and they were like, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       Oh shit. Yeah, I know that stuff is narcotic. That shit is cough syrup is narcotic. It is. And Cough Syrup. It puts you in this car. It feels like you're taking like, uh, they got that shake. It enters. Yeah. It's not good

Speaker 4:          00:21:55       people in leg, extreme pain, I guess. It's probably really good, but some of it is not good and you never know what the fuck you're going to get, man. You know, that's the thing, unless you're, you're going to a dispensary, unless you're like, you know, talking to the people that work there that are professional stoners, you know, you never know. What the hell are you going to get if you're just buying weed from some dude, you don't know. You get a Goddamn crap shooting your hands. You can get that coma weed.

Speaker 6:          00:22:16       Yep. Not to mention, I mean, well I guess it's true at all week, but it's like where did it fucking come from? Like I wish he could just see with every weed you could just rewind and watch from inception to like making it into your pocket. Cause it's such a funny journey that stuff has to take.

Speaker 4:          00:22:32       Marijuana is a fascinating plant. And what's more fascinating? The fact that it's illegal. I mean that's of course fascinating. But what's really fascinating is that it's one of the most useful plants in the world and it's illegal. Like just forget about the psychoactive effect just for nutrition and for use to make it a far superior paper, far superior cloth. And it's illegal to grow at eve. It's illegal to grow. Even the shit that is non psychoactive. Yeah. You can't even grow hemp. Like the stuff that can't get you high at all. You can't grow them

Speaker 7:          00:23:02       but what, but you think like him, you can grow in Canada and Canada's not like food school and crazy. Everyone's coming, you know, making a shitload of money on him. You know, went in it be like, I mean, couldn't we judge what hemp growing, you know, financial shit would be by Candace.

Speaker 6:          00:23:18       Yeah, but it's not really a not, but it's not based on logic. That's all thing. It's like the moment you think that.

Speaker 1:          00:23:23       No, he makes a good point. I mean, you know, it's not like they're, they're fucking never hear the lease oil barons. Right. Shit. Look at dollar Ham bitches and may box and shit and diamonds. It's bullshit. It's hemp empire bitches. This is how we roll here at him. Socks. Not that good and cognitive are way better, but is it really? Yeah. Try Him closer. Great. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:23:43       Can you give a a Chica hemp. Roz. She's going to have bloody nipples

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       at the end of this kind of stinky feet. What's good about him? It's stinky feet. You found out the girl that I had brought him like how bad your feet sweat. Great candle at your feet. Smell you stink. You little bitch. You the best candle. Fucking hippie bitch. The best candle collection ever though. Yeah. With your flower paint on your face.

Speaker 6:          00:24:02       Oh Man. What is that? Or the dragon fly on this fine. Oh, that old girl. Why do your feet stink? Wasn't it, wait, wasn't that a Donovan Song? Why do your feet stink?

Speaker 4:          00:24:16       Damn girl, could you imagine if you're living in the 60s when people just discovered like drugs and marijuana and the whole culture completely shifted. You imagine being a part of that time. You know, we kind of accept the fact that LSD has been around. Yeah. And we were in high school. We all knew some guy who fucked up. It took too much LSD. Now we imagine in the 50s man, from the 50 to the sixties what a giant transition that yes.

Speaker 6:          00:24:39       Straight after the forties right after that sweet Hoffman made that wonderful experiment in the laboratory and it exploded into culture. And then before the CIA could start trying to beat it back into the bottle, like, oh fuck, we gotta get this shit back in there. People are growing beards. Nobody wants to fight. But before that could happen when it was just billowing out and just Ginsburg was giving speeches in front of just thousands and thousand people, not Justin Bieber singing about bullshit, but some bearded gay dude reading poetry in front of thousands and thousands and thousands of people on acid and Timothy weary doing experiments with Rom Dawson. It was just this incredible moment. And then the fucking CIA got involved and the government got involved and all of a sudden that's when they started pumping shit into the zeitgeists where it's like, Oh yeah, Smoking Pot, Huh? It makes you lazy. LSD will drive you insane mushrooms. That's what communists eat. Who knows what it all is. But yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:25:38       all the shows that you're saying, they did this through what newspaper articles?

Speaker 6:          00:25:41       The Reagan administration. Look at what the Reagans did. Now it's 10 years after. It was like a, uh, it took, uh, it took some time. But this is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. It's like, oh,

Speaker 4:          00:25:51       really? So you think that like the sweeping act of the wood, the 1970s psychedelics, when when they made everything, whatever the act was that made Lsd, mushrooms made all that stuff scheduled ones. Yeah. So clearly that was because they saw there was a big culture shift that was a culture shift decision,

Speaker 6:          00:26:09       right? Absolutely. Yeah. You cause you can't, it's, you cannot successfully pull off the level of conditioning that is omnipresent in this country or in any tyranny. Uh, if people are taking psychedelics where they're communicating with some higher intelligence, whatever you want to call it, plugging into the plenum, uh, okay.

Speaker 4:          00:26:26       Murder even accelerating your mind to a higher frequency. That's the other argument that maybe it's not, you're not taking in an alien intelligence when you share a dog, but you're just pumping your own brain up. Like it's like taking caffeine. Does that give you a super intelligence? No. It just makes you accelerate. It makes you more, you, you have more, you know, you're, you're, you're getting amped up.

Speaker 5:          00:26:45       If you're on a site, it could be that. Imagine taking a powerful psychedelic and sitting down on your couch to watch your nightly Fox News and why I want a psychedelic. You see a Fox News reporter talk about someone who won the medal of honor and the Fox News reporter says he died fighting for our freedoms and Afghanistan. Now maybe if you're just some diluted alcoholic redneck in a trailer and somebody says, somebody died fighting for our freedoms already. Freedom is a very mysterious word, but someone's fighting for our freedoms and Afghanistan. Maybe you can hear that and be like, God damn it. I don't know how our freedom got to Afghanistan, but someone needs to protect it over there. But if you're on a psychedelic and you hear someone say that, you're going to be like, wait, hold on. What the fuck is freedom? What is freedom?

Speaker 5:          00:27:34       Is that something you can even really fight for? And Afghanistan? Wait, terrorists are supposed to be in Afghanistan. You mean that's the only place you can plan terrorist attacks and the rugged country of Afghanistan. You can't do that in China, Japan, Europe, France, any place where there's a hotel room with an Internet connection. Are you serious that we have to be over there fighting some s Cobra commander when in any part of the grid you can eat just a 12 year old with some fucking matches can do some pretty heavy damage to the infrastructure man. Are you seriously expecting me to believe that soldiers are right somehow in Afghanistan fighting offs, some kind of imminent threat that isn't anywhere else. Cause if I was a terrorist and there were a shitload of American train death machines in my country and I wanted to plan a terrorist attack without getting interrupted by machine gun fire, I'd probably just head somewhere else. Just get on a bus and go somewhere where I'm not going to get shot at while I plan my nuclear attack on the New York subway system.

Speaker 4:          00:28:35       So emotional right now. Wow. I'm sorry. I'm Sarah Pailin gave a speech. You Sarah Pailin recently. And in the speech she was talking about Pat Tillman cause she was like in Pat Tillman's town. She was talking about Pat Tillman. Uh, sacrificing his life for our freedom and you know, and she actually quoted that in a speech and it's like, it's really well known. Two things. One that Pat Tillman was extremely disenchanted with the military once you got in it and realize how disorganized it was, how fucking chaotic and fucked up it was to the point where some people on the Internet speculated that they even killed them on purpose cause he was talking to them, you know, let me know. That's probably Wacko talk. But it's just the fact that he was very vocal about it. And the second thing being he was killed by friendly fire. He was not killed defending the enemy and they tried to lie about it and they tried to lie about it for a long time and it eventually got out that he was killed by friendly fire. But they tried to make it seem like he died in this heroic attack. I know he was killed by an American and a cluster fighting for freedom. It's a cluster fuck man. These poor fucking kids, man, that you imagine being 19

Speaker 8:          00:29:42       being talked into doing this shit for a bunch of blood thirsty motherfuckers who just are trying to get whatever they're trying to get over there. Whatever the fuck it is, whether it's lithium, you know, whether it's, you know, minerals in the mountains that they use to make cell phones, whether it's 90% plus of the world's opium supply. 90 fucking percent. I mean, God dammit. Heroin is absolutely addictive. Okay? Yeah. People who try heroin get hooked. Heroin is everywhere. Okay, so you need to sell it. Someone's selling it. Who's selling it? I don't know. But 90% of it comes from this one place where we have to be to save our freedoms. Yeah. Like really? What the fuck man? Yeah. What the fuck? And that's, that's the thing, man. And that's what's so frustrating and it's not, here's the thing, I just want to say this. You can't criticize it because if you criticize it, you're a shithead. You don't appreciate the troops and what they're doing for you. And that's not the case at all. I just don't like the idea of these fucking people leading us in any direction where you need to sacrifice your life. Well, I don't believe it if I don't believe them.

Speaker 5:          00:30:47       Every time I meet anyone who's been in the military, they're authentically fucking good people. Are you very, I've, I have

Speaker 8:          00:30:55       yet. I want to let someone know why. Because they're warriors and warriors have discipline and the things that they go through. I feel the same way. Most military guys that I know are cool as fuck. Yeah. Cause the, first of all, they get broken down in training. You go through, once you, once you go through all the fucking physical reserve rigors of basic training. Yeah. That's brutal to, to the average person. And then you become a part of a group that has a code and you feel honored to be there and it elevates you as a human being. Yeah. It elevates them together. You know, it removes a lot of your ego. You know, there's a lot of like the, the regimen of the discipline they did develop, they can apply that to the rest of their life. Like very easy.

Speaker 5:          00:31:29       That is why it becomes incredibly infuriating when you,

Speaker 8:          00:31:34       they're being used against trapped in a meat grinder for no reason for and reasons dropping. Like some of the coolest, most fascinating brave is to rope people in a fucking meat grinders in the military. Industrial Complex can sustain itself on their blood. Right when there's been so many fucking lies. I mean, the more you look it up, the more they may go go into any of the stories on the weapons of mass destruction before we invaded and, and compare them to what we actually know that they really knew when they said that. It's like they did it on purpose. They wanted to get in there for whatever fucking reason. Yeah. And if it's some crazy, the world is gonna end. If we don't stop this, but we can't tell you shit. Like I would love to believe you. Yeah, I would love to. I would love to believe that the reason why you're a, you're not telling us exactly what the fuck is going on is because you're really protecting us from some insanely evil thing that if we knew about it, it would, society would collapse. But our strong, brave, powerful leaders are going to guide us without our knowledge. I would love to believe you if you weren't all full of Shit, if she weren't all getting busted left and Ryan cheating on your wives stealing money, jerking off on babies at the Bohemian Grove, you worship the owl

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       God molec he's that slow

Speaker 4:          00:32:42       having gay sex. I mean, how many of these fucking guys in the Bush administration where day, how many of them did? There was a ton of them. You know how you know? Because there was a guy who was an embedded reporter named Jeff Gannon, right? Jeff Gannon ran a website that was all dedicated to gay, like military men. It was like military studs would like, did have dog tags on it, a little towel over their cock and it was like a gay escort service and this fucking guy was running it. And he was an embedded reporter. He was in the White House throwing all these lob questions at the pleasure of the president. Like, when are these Democrats going to come to their senses, sir? Like, like what kind of a fucking question is that? You know, like that kind of Shit and me why I was just sucking cock sleeped in the White House, slept in the fucking White House and at least one occasion like what the fuck man,

Speaker 5:          00:33:29       he's not, I mean it's the funny thing about it is what, the only thing that's surprising about it rather it becomes extremely surprising according to how conditioned you are a [inaudible]. And one of the first things you have to realize in any country that you're living in is there some percentage of your mind is filled with information that has been placed there intentionally to make you a good citizen. You are conditioned. Uh, I just say Great National Geographic documentary on North Korea and everyone should watch that. It's on Netflix instead of view. Watch it. And the reason you should watch it is because you get a very extreme case of conditioning. And the way these people act. And uh, you know, it's basically the way they got in there as they followed. Uh, a doctor was removing cataracts, uh, of North Koreans and um, they told them that the camera crew was there just to monitor the, all right, what he's doing, they didn't tell North Korea it was national geographic.

Speaker 5:          00:34:19       So they, you know, at the end of the thing that people who can see stand up in this room, they're pulling the bandages off their eyes and they can see. And the first thing they do, they don't think the doctor that helped them, they stand up. There's a picture of Kim Jong Il and they go, oh, thank you, great heater. I will work five times harder in the salt mines for you. It's, yeah, I saw them say that. It's true. That's real. That's the conditioning. That's conditioning. And it's, if you think as an American citizen, you don't have some of that in your fucking brain. You're out of your mind. You're conditioned. We all are in it. Because when you're growing up, that's what they do. What do you do? Use.

Speaker 4:          00:34:58       And it's also that we would like to believe that there is some sort of a higher ideal. We would like to believe that America is something that's above everything and we are noble and brave. We do do the right things and we are the police force for the world because we are the only good Christian nation that, you know, is here to support the right values. Yes, we have. Everyone's good in mind. The conditioning. Yeah. I mean, but there's a lot of pride behind that. It's like it's, it's similar to the idea of being in the military. It's like you're a part of something bigger and greater and more noble condition. And so the whole, that's like military is like the highest level of that. And then being a proud citizen, it's just just slightly below them and that's all. But it's also an ideal, I mean it's also like it is conditioning, but it's also like, wow, wouldn't it be ideal? We all did have a moral code that was like really responsible and we were really cool to each other and we were really disciplined and we did the right thing. And we didn't, you know, I mean if the codes, you know, it'd be the, they exist on paper so that they are an ideal, right? So if we're all proud of that ideal and we subscribed to that ideal, that does kind of elevate us.

Speaker 5:          00:35:57       Well. I think that, um,

Speaker 4:          00:35:58       it's, I think it's better. I honestly, I do think it's conditioning, but I do think that framework of conditioning is better than a wild, like free for all.

Speaker 5:          00:36:07       The thing is not that the, I mean I think that if you look at a beehive, there's conditioning happening with Carmen's from the queen. I was around the Bi to be, it's not to say that like, uh, we should allow society to fragment into like individual units that are all running around screaming that there is nothing to believe in. It's just, uh, the idea is that yeah, of course, man at the, the eye, the human ideal. The ideal of making sure that, you know, if you hear it, if you hear about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, if you really think about that ideal, the pursuit of happiness, life, your health, and being healthy and being able to evolve and be strong, liberty, your freedom, your ability to do whatever you want and to do that, to pursue whatever happiness that you want with that liberty, that's amazing.

Speaker 5:          00:36:59       If this country really stood up for those ideals and people were really fighting for those ideals, we will be in some kind of like techno utopia. There'd be Cordova milk bars and masculine cocktails that you could drink and perfectly, perfectly, uh, uh, engineered pharmaceuticals to enhance your intelligence. Because in the 60s, they didn't cut off all research on psychedelics and they would have made the leap into really why it was working and why it helps people who are depressed, why it helps people who are alcoholics white helps people who are dying. They wouldn't have gone underground and we would have so much more research, but the very fact that psychedelics are illegal marijuana is illegal. The very fact that the, that we are not allowed to put into our body. Anything that we want shows us that those ideas that you're talking about are not being upheld but suppressed

Speaker 4:          00:37:49       right now. What's behind that meets the man man. What is the machine behind it? How does it happen? How is it in the same situation today as it was in 1970 with all the information that we have, you would think that 40 years would go by. Well that's ridiculous. That's a long ass time with all this information that we have. There's so much work that needs to be cleaned up and there's so many assumptions that we had made in the past about so many different things in our society that we have found through the age of the Internet to be not true. And one of them is everyone can access marijuana studies. Now, when I was a kid, I thought marijuana gave you brain damage. I heard all kinds of crazy shit. I thought for sure you could probably die from marijuana. You know, you can o d on it, you know, there was so much misinformation.

Speaker 4:          00:38:30       Yeah. But now we know now it's all very clear now it's everywhere online kind of. He, the only way we can trust the government is if you amend shit when the shit that doesn't make sense anymore is inapplicable. You know, the, the, the, the, the, these drug laws that were put into place when people didn't have the Internet where you couldn't go research all the positive benefits of siliciden mushrooms, how many people have quit, you know, like really like they've had like people that were like lifelong cigarette smokers, one cigarette, you know, uh, they, they are one mushroom trip rather and they never smoked a cigarette again. They realize like what the fuck they're doing to their body. They think about the whole situation, how ridiculous it is, how they get sucked into it and they never smoke another cigarette ever again. There's nothing that has that kind of success rate like Ibogaine. It's another one that's another psychedelic that does that. Heroin addicts, people who get hooked on pills, they go and do it. Bam. They, they completely dropped their addiction. Have a totally different way of looking at life. Well, yeah, cause it's a blue stopping it. How does it get stopped?

Speaker 6:          00:39:28       It's a, um, I mean, I think a Terence Mckenna sums it up by talking about the dominator culture and the partnership. Uh, but it's gone

Speaker 4:          00:39:40       ignorance on the part of the people that are in the position of power. It must be ignorant as to the effects of the psychedelics because if it wasn't, and they were doing them, if they were doing it and they knew how powerful psychedelics are for elevating your consciousness, if they knew that there's all this potential that you could take it in a shamonic fashion if you were, if you do it intelligently and you do it, it's like a massive vehicle for, for human growth. If they didn't know this or I, then they're, they're acting on, they're acting on ignorance because if they were experiencing it, if they were doing this, they would change everything. They change everything. I firmly, absolutely believe that of all the people in charge were doing like weekly and monthly mushroom rituals, they would completely rethink every fat, everything. So you know, they're not doing it right. They're not. So they're key. Whoever is in charge of Cape, me keeping things on the schedule one list, you know, whoever is the person who informs the Dea, like there's these are things we want to concentrate on. This is, you know, blah, blah, blah, chase after this, go after that. Whoever's doing that clearly isn't experiencing

Speaker 6:          00:40:39       follow the money. That's how you find out who's doing it, that people are doing it are the people who make money enforcing the law. Right. But my point is we need to get those people on mushrooms. Well, that's really what needs to happen. Yeah. I mean, that sounds crazy, but that might be the way to fix the world as a way to fix the world might be to get all the leaders on mushrooms. I think that I, I've thought about this, fuck yeah. For Real. It sounds like Hokey, 16 year old parking lot bullshit. Yeah, man, we need to [inaudible] mushrooms, Bro. But it's not just, it's not just a really, I mean, how much is mushrooms helped you? Yeah, but I, I don't, I think I would've been fine if I didn't have my showrooms. You know, you're not fine now kid, you know? But seriously, like, yeah, I think I like the wet mushrooms did to me, but if I didn't do it, I don't think I'll be fucking like freaked out. My drawings just wouldn't be as good, you know? Oh, I think you're discrediting

Speaker 4:          00:41:31       the information that you get when you have a good trip. When you have a good trip

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       and you come back, you're like, Oh God, I'm such an idiot. You come back. You're like, wow. Yeah, so humbled. You know? I'm just like, I was thinking so foolishly and now I see it all. It's like, why? Why wasn't it here to me before? It's like I was just out of my grasp and yeah, I have this elevated, uh, point of view and it lasts as long as you can hold onto those ideals. It's like as time goes on in between trips, they slowly became more and more ether all, you know, they slowly became more missed. Like you can't quite grasp onto that feeling of, of being connected. It's like, you're like, Huh, it's running out. You're going to have to go in there again. Is there a library card? Yeah. Go into the store to store your store settings. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:42:15       And, and, and, and I think that, um, what you're talking about is absolutely true. And I was thinking like, you know what, if somebody engineered a virus that somehow was like gap gave people a psychedelic experience that was contagious, that if you sneeze, the person you sneeze on is going to trip out so that there's sort of like wave of people tripping from some kind of bizarre new virus spread across the country and, and induce the state that you're talking about. It's gotta be possible. That's, look, I think, you know, like if, if animals can spray toxins out and kill you. Yeah. And animals also excrete psychedelic compounds like toads that have five Meo DMT on their back. Right. They secrete it, you know, if that's possible. So we know they can spit and we know that they can screen psychedelics. Well sure they can spit psychedelics at. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       That would be nuts, man. A fucking frog that just jumps in front of you and crazy and makes you trip out. Could you imagine mood ITTO the dad too. It just hops on you. It's a frog. Like you're chilling with your boys. You guys are like having lunch and shit, fishing, whatever, and all of a sudden the frog jumps on you or you're like, dude, he got zapped in the kid's like gone for like five hours to doon doon doon dude. Do you remember what town? Do you remember when aids first came out and there was that whole thing with miskitos having aids blood. You remember that there was like, oh no, the eighth mosquitoes I do. Yeah, it's true. Right

Speaker 6:          00:43:42       work and be like, dude, I got zapped by a trip and frog. I can't come

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       repping [inaudible] you'd have to have your mom calling for you. You wouldn't be able to pick up the phone man. You'd be wrestling with that thing. You know what? I figured that the frogs Jack to the frogs have like a smile. They're like a smiley frowny face. It just jumped patio [inaudible] came. Don't, don't, don't you always hear that? Seems like you don't know. Can we do and do you find yourself falling into the fucking die? That's what it's Chirp would be. It would be that song if I did it. Yeah. You hear about in the field. Ah, been waiting so long. They get fucking sing in the car. Your grandma gets hit with it once. Who Scrambles Song? Where's the song coming from? God, that was great.

Speaker 4:          00:44:30       I'm go, what the fuck man. I'm hearing singing that you hearing that jump up. Oh Dude, I have an important man. Don't, don't, don't, don't tell me. Yeah man. For sure. That's possible for sure. That happened to me know. I was thinking, this is a weird thing that I was thinking the other day. What was life like before eyesight was invented? Okay. Because there was life before ice, right? The first life was like single celled organisms. Yeah. And then it, you know, they started combining and mutating. Yeah. And then eventually they picked up the, the ability to see how fucking insane most of the world been when there was no eyesight. Yes. Something that someone developed that, but stop and think about that for a second. Organisms developed this ability to see things, right. To recognize the space in front of them. If we didn't have that, if no organisms had that, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:45:26       This would never have taken place. Right. The, the evolution of human beings, the ability to do what we do, we have to be able to see things and touch things. Sure. You falling in a forest did it really fall? If no one has solid, you know what I'm saying is what if there's other senses that we easily could develop just like eyesight. They just haven't gotten here yet. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's totally, yeah. I mean, if we're, we're okay. The idea is we'd like to think that we're the most evolved things ever because we are for earth, we're the most of all things, but we're not as evolved as we're gonna get. Okay. If like if you, if there seems to be, if you look at like the way life has evolved, just seems to be things just keep getting more and more complicated and seem like there's like it gets like accelerates, right? Yeah. And whether or not you believe that there is some sort of a magic man who created the whole world or some sort of a, an all knowing, you know, uh, intelligent design entity that's, you know, and you know, non visual. That's a part of everything. Whether or not you believe in any of that stuff. I mean you, you, you still have to look at the whole picture and go there. It's a, it's a very strange existence, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:46:31       Yeah. And you know, what was weird is back in the primordial past when blind things were wandering around, you could have three keys, we can be a bunch of other shit. They could talk that blind things back then if they could talk. And the ones that just started to see looked around and they were like a John, I don't want to sound crazy man, but we're surrounded by water and what appears if he coral reefs, like, what's fucking wrong with you, man? Larry went insane. Juniors, nonsense dog about the coral reefs in the water would fucking idiot. It's the same thing now. People start having these visionary experiences and they're like, you know what? I think we might be surrounded by a matrix of infinite intelligence that likes to personify itself in the form of extra mentionable entities that seemed to look like Elvis. People are like, dude, shut the fuck up. You sound great. You sound like a retard, retard. Um, but you know, as we advance, you know, maybe that is what we will begin to see in some way without having to smoke. Well, it's gotta

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       be something next. There's gotta be something next. I mean, human beings evolved out of the lower primates and the lower primates would make noises and gestures. And then eventually we figured out language, then written language, recorded history, and then we evolved to where we can communicate. Today. It's got to keep going as to, it's accelerating. The changes are happening quicker and quicker than before. Yeah, I think you're going to eventually get born with Bluetooth. You know, like your body's just going to have some kind of robot electronic in it now. All the signals that we send out, you know what I mean? When you think about it, signals are relatively recent in terms of human history, the history of the human biology, you know, I mean signals have only been around like radios for awhile, a couple of hundred years or something like that. Like how long has radio been around?

Speaker 4:          00:48:11       1920s wasn't really something like that Saturdays, but whatever it was in the 1800 yeah, so before that there was nothing man you didn't know signals in the air and then it was radio and then it was CB radio and cell phones and satellite there satellite sending signals or signals all over the fucking place. What if we start evolving the ability to pick up these new things called signals? Like what have, the only reason why human beings needed eyesight was because they had a climb out of the primordial Malkin and figure out their way around and it was easier to not fall off cliffs. You can see where the fucking cliff was, so they started to develop this like what if that's what's going on? What if we are going to develop the ability to tune into signals? No, I don't think it's going to be genetic, but I think you're going to be able to talk to each other without saying words like the more we start getting an advanced with computers and we're doing symbols and signs, I think pretty soon we're going to be able to start communicating without talking.

Speaker 4:          00:49:05       Like kind of like I could just sit there and like look at you in a tent. You know what I mean? I think that's the sense that's DM come when you have a DMT trip. That's what it feels like. It feels like communication without within intent but with no words so I understand exactly what you're saying. I understand. I understand it more of like as a, like a wave, like blocks of numbers and letters is no blocks or number of numbers and letters. The communication is like, it's like a very clear and obvious wave of information. That thing. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. I know what you're talking about. Whatever that wave is that it'll talk to you in your own language because that's what you need to hear. But you realize while this is happening a while, it's, it's talking that you're, no, that's not your job.

Speaker 4:          00:49:46       You're just interpreting what it's saying and, and relaying it back into English. That's what you're doing. Yeah. Your fax machine is picking it up and printing out and yeah. Well you just, you can't, it's like, remember when you used to have um, uh, an emulator for windows you had back and sort of opened up in a window? Yeah. Like it was all like junky and didn't want, that's exactly, that's what's going on. Yeah. You can't quite understand what they're saying. So you have to do it through an emulator software. You have to like run it through your own vocabulary, but you're getting pure intent from them. You know? That's why like when I, I saw, um, the, one of the Times I had this DMT trip, the DMT things, um, they always, they always say a bunch of the same things. So one of the things they say is relax and don't give into astonishment.

Speaker 4:          00:50:32       And when I heard that, I didn't know if the reason why the said that to me was because I had heard Terence Mckenna say that. They said that I didn't know. I was like, fuck, like what is this? And are they saying this to me because I knew they were going to say this to me. So they're like reinforcing it or is this just something replaying in my head because I expected it. Maybe it's a total hallucination, but it seemed like what they're doing is trying to say that they're trying to say that, but they're saying it with pure intent and you put it into the words that you would use. And the words that I would use was the words that Mckenna would you have used [inaudible] so it's like they're saying to you, relax and try to take this in. But they're not using words and they're saying, look at this. Like they're showing you things like that. Keep showing like more and more complex, crazy images. And as they're showing you these different things, they're saying, look at this, look at this. But you don't really hear it. It's like, you know, they're saying it, but you don't really hear it. That's the next shit man. Right. Pure intent. Pure intent with no mouth.

Speaker 6:          00:51:33       Yeah. That's really good. I like that. Cause I always, as you guys were talking, I was thinking about like, well yeah, I mean I'm sure there's going to be, uh, you know, through technology and ability to transmit thoughts in some way. But yeah, what you're saying is tuning into something else, which is, uh, something bigger than like human communication. It's tuning into what a Mackinac cause, uh, like the guy in my mind or like the mind of the earth and mine of the earth, tuning more into that. And like hearing what that message is or even more tuning into the, uh, the, you know, universal consciousness or the thing that connects you to all things and, and you know, what would be awesome, man, and this is another part of it, and I don't mean to keep going back to the conditioning bro, but it would be so awesome to be able to have the experience you had and just accept that it was real to not have to go back through your head.

Speaker 4:          00:52:22       Well, no, I think it's important to question whether or not it's real. I think it's important to question whether or not it's just a pure hallucination. Yeah. It's just your brain is been dumped with a, an extreme amount of chemicals that are usually, they're in small doses and your brain is hit with is Overwatch. And because of all these synapses go off and it creates these beautiful hallucinations. Yeah, it's possible. I'm not, I'm not absolutely convinced that what's happening when you have a DMT experience is that your, you're going into an actual, another dimension and communicate with actual other entities. I know it feels like that, but he could be that my imagination is on fucking hyperdrive. Yeah. It's a possibility that you have to consider as unlikely as it is or rather as unappealing as it is to me. Yeah. I would love to think that like it's, it would be way cooler if there's a drug that your brain makes. It lets you talk to aliens. Yeah. That's way cooler. Yeah. It's possible that it's not, that's not what's going on. Your brain is just getting like walked.

Speaker 6:          00:53:15       But if Duncan came to you and said, I believe my dreams, I think my dreams are trying to commute, can communicate with me, you have to at least think that maybe that's possible too. That's kind of like same. You know that your dreams are trying to communicate with. Yeah. That's the other thing of you're a dream master of like push things into the back of their mind and then in their dreams they're trying to work out those issues and those issues come popping up. That's, that happens sometimes people in their dreams, well I have a variety of different types of dreams. Some dreams clearly or whatever just happened. Like you know, like Glenn back is like having a conversation with me about a pasta because I ate pasta while I was watching Glenn Beck and fell asleep. There's, there's that, those kinds of dreams, right? And then there's the other kind of dreams and the other kinds of dreams, if you're lucky enough to remember them, are much bigger than that.

Speaker 6:          00:54:02       Like sometimes I'll wake up and I can, it's almost like I'm waking up from a lecture where somebody in like an almost like monotone voice is like, and then the true reason for loving other people creates a unified consciousness that allows the furthering of the evolution. You know, when you wake up, like what the fuck was that? But like I think you're kind of like, you're sinking, you gotta talk more into the microphone cause your, your volume is all over the road. I think you're kind of sinking. They're pulling their iPods would just go, fuck sorry guys. I think I just got a little too casual. Their fellow, my, for the last time I did this podcast, we have shitty likes last time. These are way better. They pick you up way better, but you adjusted and moved away for the top. I wasn't talking about the mix, but the last, the last time I did this podcast, I got contacted by some of the coolest fucking people have ever been contacted by an internet like mind blowing people.

Speaker 6:          00:54:52       Like people were sending me their art on Facebook that was like insanely psychedelic and like I got real, I got a flood of like the most mind melting youtube videos of different people giving lectures. And one of them, and I can't remember the guy's name, dammit, which isn't fair to the person who sent it, but I wish I could remember it. He was talking about how they're finding out that in, in, um, there's no such thing as empty space. It's just filled with intelligence. It's just, it's condensed information in every single quantum molecule of the universe is just pure information. And like what, what my theory is right now, um, is that maybe when you're getting high, you're tuning into that information field and it's some kind of extra terrestrial and library that, uh, where the books transform into a words and letters and ideas that you've experienced in the past because there's no other, you know, there's no other grammar for it.

Speaker 6:          00:55:51       There's no way to communicate the information to you because it's outside language. It's pre language, right? So it's shaping and according to, you know, for you, like you said, you Mckenna talked about don't give into astonishment. And so that's what you read or saw as this wave of intent was coming to you. But to me to dismiss that wave of intent, uh, as a hallucination is, and I know you're doing it speculatively, I think that you are, I feel like maybe you're just saying that, but I think you may have made a decision about it already. I know, you

Speaker 4:          00:56:23       know, I honestly, I have and I haven't, I'm still open to the possibility that this is all horse shit. Yeah. But everything is horseshit. But I absolutely believe that there's a benefit to this horse shit. There's a benefit to the quality of life for the person that's, that's done it and had the experience. I think there's a benefit to the people that are around him, the people that he interacts with or she interacts with that you'll, you'll create more positive energy and you'll have like a better base to operate under. Like the thing you said about like all these cool people contacting you in the Internet. Yeah Dude, I have so many fucking cool fans on my message board and on, on Twitter. There's a lot of cool motherfuckers out there, cool people. And one of the things that I'm finding when I'm talking and all these people that I'm running into, like we did the, uh, these shows in England and a huge percentage of the people in the audience were podcast listeners.

Speaker 4:          00:57:08       A huge percentage. When I yelled out like, how many guys watch podcasts? Fuck, they went fucking crazy. That's awesome. So I'm thinking, you know, wow, this is nuts. Like this. It's so cool. They could just download it all over the world. But it's so free and open and out there. Right. And I was talking to this kid afterwards and they were telling me how like there's no one who talks like this near them, you know, they're like four for two hours every week or you know, if you do two of them four hours every week, we get to sit down and talk and listen to people talk that we don't know anybody like that. We don't know anybody who just considers all the different, uh, options in an argument. And it has these weird, bizarre topics that they talk about and puts themselves out there and it's really honest about shit like this.

Speaker 4:          00:57:49       And these dudes are like, dude, you're change in the way we look at the whole world. And I'm like, whoa. I thought about that. And I'm like, I wish I had something like that when I was young. I wish I had something where, where there was just some, I could communicate, basically sit and listened to people, communicate with anyone, law and sit and learn. It's almost like sitting at a table with your, your, your fucking, you know, you're cool dad. And his friends, you know, when you're a little kid, if you, if you had a cool dad. And My stepdad was really cool guy and I would sit around with his friends and I listened to them talk and I was like, you know, 12 or 13 and they would let me stay up and you know, and they would, they would be sitting around talking and there's all these architects and shit and like really intelligent, interesting guys.

Speaker 4:          00:58:28       And I was like, wow. I'm like, yeah, I'm kind of thinking in how they think. And I was like tuning into the way they thought and it was like helping me, it was like helping me like see things like a little differently than being around a bunch of other 12 year olds. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I totally know what you're, so for a lot of these people, like they're like, dude, we don't know anybody like you. We don't have anybody like you in our town over. Everybody's thinking inside the box and everybody wants you to just get a good job and, and, and just move on and get a family and don't consider anything to go to church to be a good person. And you know, there's a lot of people that we're talking to, they're like, they're starting to look at this thing. They're starting to back up and they're starting to look up at the sky and they're starting to look to the left and look to the right and go, Whoa, what the fuck is this? What is this thing we're doing here? Because this isn't just, we're living life. In the beginning, Bob was a baby. Bob went to high school, then college. He played a bit of football before down with

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       his lovely, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what it is. That's just some shit we made up to make ourselves ourselves feel more comfortable. I mean, those events are actually taking place. Probably is going to school. Bob Is, but that doesn't mean shit. Okay? What really means something is we're flying through the fucking universe. We are in space. We are in a ship. It's an organic ship, right? We're not, we're not on the ground. Okay. We're thinking we're on the ground now. We're flying. Oh, am free to be in space. In a space ship. You're on a spaceship right now. It's just fucking huge. It's a 24,000 mile across space ship. Yeah. Okay. It's a spaceship. That's what it is. We're not, we're not grounded. It's not like the universe is a solid mass and we're sitting on it. We're flying. We are right now holing, and we're spinning a thousand miles an hour. Yep. Spinning a thousand miles around around a massive nuclear explosion for

Speaker 6:          01:00:17       work. Fuck, I've got to get my blockbuster video back. I am Meg Whitman polite. I am going to clean up California with conservative thinking and values. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're caught in a massive field of time were being carried on the, on the river of time towards some unified future where either we get blasted by a nuclear holocaust or something happens where you all merge into the, the, the universe through technology or skynet goes live or skynet goes live. Oh, that was fucking Japanese dolls too. We were talking about that before the podcast. The Japanese doll that sings. It was a new job. Oh wait, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Can I make one more point about where you're just talking about and then we'll, we'll talk about fucking robots. Uh, but, uh, but, um, the thing that I was thinking to address the point of like doing a podcast and getting these kinds of ideas out into the places where they might normally get, it's like there's two, two points.

Speaker 6:          01:01:21       One is this technology, this technology is only existed for a very short time. Yeah. Like the 93, right. [inaudible] became accessible by them. Yeah. To have the money to get this kind of a gear together and then put it on the Internet. It costs so much less than it used to cost. Yeah. So anyone can create these little nodes transmitting the information. Number two, this is what I was thinking. Um, there is an idea coming, I don't know what the, like when Tesla had his idea for a alternating current, uh, this idea came to him in a vision, right. So there's an idea coming and that idea just transformed society and there's been so many ideas like that that transforms society. There is an idea coming, I don't know what the fucking ideas, it could be a drug, it could be a machine, it could be an movie.

Speaker 6:          01:02:08       We don't know what it is, but there's an idea coming. That might be the next transformative idea in the last transformative idea that finally pushes is outside of uh, um, being stuck in the ego structure and becoming part of everything else. And I dunno what the fuck it is, but um, what we're, what you're doing here by like putting information like this out in, anytime you put information that goes against the conditioning, what you're doing is like sending out little messages in bottles and eventually one of those things might wash up on some super intelligent person. Sure. And they might open it up and be like, wait a minute. Holy Shit. Wow. I just thought of whatever it is. They're non 49. The device that opens up a portal into the future and creates the machine Mckenna talked about. It's like the idea of spreading this information is to crew is still lay the framework so that whatever this fucking thing is that we all know is in the works and it's a lot more than a sweet Asian android. You can fuck in the mouth, whatever this idea, whatever this idea is, it's like snuck in the end.

Speaker 4:          01:03:17       There's a lot of what people have to, people have to realize it's not going to end did. The real thing is we're living our lives, we're going through this, what we think is a predetermined pattern of behavior following the same roads to get to work every day and we're thinking that it makes sense, but all the while we're doing this, we're supporting technology. [inaudible] technology is developing, developing at a far, far faster rate than our biology can process. You know what I've always said about movies and songs and everything that it kind of freaks me out. How much they get to me. I call, it kind of freaks me out when I see like Avatar and I'm like this fucking amazing and they're like ropes me in and I'm like, God, I want everybody to be okay. Fuck those assholes and want to fuck up your planet.

Speaker 4:          01:03:58       And you know, you get roped into it and then you leave like in this like, Gee, I just went through like a journey. You know what I'm saying? My brain and all my room, my reward systems got hijacked and I went through this journey and it felt really good and it felt really cool and everything. But I was thinking about it. I'm just like, that's one of the reasons why people are so fucking child like and delusional. And it's not because there's some grand program or that's trying to keep us in line. It's because the media itself, the ability to create movies that are super satisfying, the ability to create these happy endings, that's what we want to see. That's like, even though, right, that's not what happens every day. That's really what we appreciate cause that's, that's the highest rewards ratio, you know, that we can get from, from watching it.

Speaker 4:          01:04:37       Performance. What, we're not set up the process that we're set up to process real events and we're set up to imitate successful behavior. We see the one monkey that's a bad mother fucker that knows where the snakes are. Any beats a snake with a stick and everybody runs away. I want to fall back. Guy He rides with a fucking snakes are, that guy's cool and you imitate his behavior. You whacked us the ground. Find out where the snakes are. You know what I mean? It's like they pick it up from the leader. They get your information. You know, we, we need to think about it that way I think.

Speaker 6:          01:05:05       Yeah. So like what the information coming from the media now is what it's like. If I just can't find a man to love me, you know what I mean? It's like how many movies there based on some, some woman

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       either having to choose between two guys and she can't pay her. The marriage isn't going that well, but she meets her or lover from the, it's all about where their reproductive cycle it's are the movies are all about like the, the great conclusion is a successful reproductive cycle.

Speaker 4:          01:05:32       Yeah. These, these things hijacking our reward systems, these meet music and everything and, and you know, the, the beauty of music, it's like the beauty of birds chirping, you know, get to appreciate nature. It's like we have this built in beauty of recognizing rhythm, you know, thumping on things and tapping on the ground. But when you hear a real song that moves you with beautiful lyrics and fucking mute like God, it changes your whole state of consciousness. Yeah. And it just completely hijacks your reward system. And what I'm thinking is that these things, these, these, these, these things like songs and movies and all these brilliant things that people create, what they're doing is just accelerating the need to make cooler shit even faster. It's like, here's your award. You want to, you don't want to make new technology, make new technology. And I'll give you Bluetooth image.

Speaker 4:          01:06:16       Oh, so bright. You give you more reward. Brain juice, stuff flows down. Make you happy. Avatar. So blue, look at skin gold. So high resolution, more love, more love. So for that, I need to get the latest loved thing. They'll ne latest lovebox Bro. It's 90 fucking inches across each. Amazing Three d you don't need glasses. And it's like, wow, they got to develop the next. What's the next thing? You have to kick it to another level. We're going Hologram folks, we're going Hologram. No more screens. We don't need a fucking screen. What you need to do is just shut your lights off and I'm going to have a fucking play. It's going to go on in your house. You're gonna just don't move because you'll ruin the illusion. You're going to see it all take place right in front of you. Turn to the left, turned to the right.

Speaker 4:          01:06:56       It's all around you all the time. You know, they'll start off going to get right back to theater. Yeah, they'll start it off. It'll be almost just like a projector on one wall and eventually it'll be immersed in reality shows. Yeah. Returns. Well, you know, they to keep going. I really like what you were saying about hijacking. What'd you say? Hi Jackie. Reward system for love and for honor and for, for lost and passion and all these different things that are set up to make sure that you're successful. There's like this, I'm sure you've seen it yet because

Speaker 5:          01:07:20       it's fucking awesome. I fluid. If you ever seen Ferra flew, yeah, fair fluid. If you look it up, it's so cool looking at ah, this kind of magnetic fluid where if you play certain sound frequencies that ferrofluid forms into these awesome shapes and patterns. And there's a way you can do it by putting a, I don't know what, what the material is, but if you put stuff on a speaker and you have it set up just right and play certain tones, the material we'll take on geometric formation automatically. And I, I don't know the physics behind this, but I think that with your mind, uh, what your mind does is, are there certain patterns that are either or electronic neurological interface of your mind temporarily takes according to external stimuli. So, for example, uh, if you see something moved from behind you really fast, what do you do?

Speaker 5:          01:08:08       You automatically turn around. You just look, you don't think about that. You don't think, you know what I should look. You just look, because that stimulus is activating something in your brain and creating an automatic pattern. Like if you've ever dropped a cup or drop something, I don't know if you've done that and you just snatch it, you didn't think about it. I'm like, fuck, I'm like Spiderman. I just, how'd I do that? I didn't think about that at all. That's a pattern electronic pattern that your brain took. So in the same way these movies and songs, when you hear them, they're literally causing the temporary neurological state of your mind to take these, these forms to take on these forms. And um, that's very addictive, I think. You know, because there's certain of those forms that you, that are more enjoyable than others. For example, like the form your brain takes when you're on a beautiful woman, like, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          01:08:55       You're, everything shifts in your mind. Suddenly everything changes. The, the whatever it is, whatever environment you're in, you could be shitting, you could be sitting on a giant Turd and a beautiful woman walks in and all of a sudden things aren't quite so bad. It's like, that's because your mind is the pattern of your mind is transformed. And it's like, that's what these, that's what movies are doing. And that's what, uh, you know, I think people have gotten really good at understanding how that primate, neurological geometry works and they really get it, activating it in certain ways, you know, via Fox News, you know, like you turn off Fox News and it's like everything's trying to kill you.

Speaker 4:          01:09:36       Yeah. Um, well for sure. That's one of the reasons why Fox News is a huge problem is cause, you know, propaganda. Even though it's funny, like Fox News propaganda always makes me go, well, you have to be an idiot to believe that, but there's a lot of idiots out there, you know? And you know, even though I mean look, propaganda, the real problem with it is if you're not telling the truth and you're in control, the media, that's a giant responsibility. Sure you've, you've done some horrible, horrible disservice to mankind because you're broadcasting confusion. You're fucking things up. Even little fuck ups. They do, like, we've talked about this before, where whenever a politician gets busted for a sex crime, anything crazy, sexual hookers, whatever, there's always a d next to his name. It doesn't matter if he's a republican or not on Fox, they put d right next to his name. Right. And then if you ask them, oh, it was just a slip up, but you know, something like that, we just assumed it was a democrat. Yeah, it's a joke. They make a joke. I make a joke out of it. But meanwhile, what they're doing is they're causing a lot of people who may be on the fence, you know, to go one way or another. So whatever. I mean, whether or not it matters, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:10:37       No, I mean, it matters because the real thing that Fox is doing, I mean, I, it's not like fun, I don't think. I think part of Fox is disseminate conservatives conservative ideals, but really it's like you want to understand Fox, don't watch their reporters, watch the commercials in between and that'll teach you everything about Fox News because it's like they're selling geriatric diapers. Maybe have seen that. The one fucking commercial that's like, uh, shows like some happy old lady driving around a moped and our living room and they're like, you could have one of these for free. I can't, that's not fights. Not Young people listening to Fox. It's just old in geriatrics

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       and their living rooms on their mopeds to two fucking steps away from death bill O'Reilly to give them the real deal and keep them safe. If he's telling the truth, he's fine. He's, I love bill O'Reilly. Oh, poor Mitzia. She would just, she would fucking watch. She would watch that and that and if we all tried to get her to stop because was always about helping her mental state, but it's like, dude, I watch terrace. Ah, they're going to get us off. I used to watch, I watched that. I still watch a fucking Glenn Beck, ironically. But if you interesting to watch every now and then because it's sometimes I agree with him 30% no, sometimes he makes good points and then he wraps him up in nonsense. Then you know, oh, then you go, this guy's just an actor. Yes. He's like putting on an act like what he's doing.

Speaker 1:          01:11:58       He's developed this conservative act. He used to be on a morning zoo. You know what I mean? And I think maybe he believes some of the stuff that he says, but there's a lot of what he's doing. That's the atrics. Oh, that's Sarah Pailin. Shit man. He's a nut dude. When he had Sarah Palin who was interviewing her saying, she might be the only hope for this country. Oh, sorry. What did you just do? We could die like people. It's almost like he decided he was going to make it so ridiculous. Let's see if we can pull this off. Like they probably had an argument, like don't say that, man. If you say that she's the only hope for this country, everybody's going to know you're, you're fucking with her. I think I can do it. I think I'm sincere enough. Ah, he is a God damn, that guy snaps next.

Speaker 1:          01:12:35       I don't know whose or when, but late at night guys snaps you. Oh, you're so strange. He works all the time too. He doesn't just do his TV show, which he does that. He also writes like a book every two months and he also goes on tour and he does like live performances and he was doing comedy for a while. He was doing like the Glenn Beck like live comedy performance thing where you would talk about who crazy government and he would do like, like a live sort of a stand up thing. But that didn't go so well. So now he just gives like these kind of like live speeches. So the motherfuckers just like raking in money. He's obsessed, he's making bank. But if you've seen that, I don't know when this was, it was recently released, it was from his podcast and he's got some kind of sickness and I don't know what the thickness is, but he's crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:13:20       He broke it heart. It's crazy. Quickly broken, hurt. He's telling his flock about this sickness and it'd be so sweet of Glenn Beck cod boats getting stuck sucked. Of course it's going to happen. Oh, well you know what though? He's not a perfect guy. He admits it. He had done drugs and drank and stuff. Didn't he like had a problem with booze or something like that? Well that's the thing that televangelists always say when they get caught with that with getting their dick sucked. But like that, that black televangelist, when they're asking these logs, Keisha did you or did, did you whatever. And he's like, what was he saying? What did he say? He said, um, he's like, none of us are perfect. That means yes, that means you, well, there's a lot of evidence. Apparently he's fucked Eddie Long. That guy. Yeah. Evidence is that anytime anybody goes to a bunch of people saying it too, it's not just one person any long his name as the fucking evidence.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       It's not going to log. That totally got pimples from Oakland and he would sell. I go fucking minister. Weird Shit. Like lick their face and oh no, weird. He's like, he's like in a hotel room with some young kid who thinks he's a messenger of God and he's like, look, your face Giamo, I just like licking your lips of Moses used to the lips of sheep. There was, it was. It's a Christian thing to lick the lips of someone who loves here. Brian ruining the whole erotic cap. My husband etic atmosphere. Just strange moaning. Parliament starts playing. He puts his Bible down. I'm Simpson's Pan is like the biggest travesty. Yeah, the the the biggest like crime against humanity. The idea that you can take children and pretend that you're religious and fuck them. Yeah. That's the, that's the, that's definitely getting, I mean that might be one.

Speaker 1:          01:15:14       I mean, but besides murder and rape and all the other horrible things that people do. Yeah. That's one that's really underlooked you really ruined a life. How the fuck you going to get over the fact that big fat, sweaty guy who smells like your car just fucked you in the ass. He smells like Dzhokhar and barbecue sauce and it just fucked you there. Not only that, but don't forget that this man is a representative of Jesus. When your mind is the greatest person on the planet. So the, it's, it's like, it's like someone's assistant molesting you and you're like, Oh God, they must be bad too. He smells like Jerry curl juice and communion wafers as loads smell the Viagra on his breath. Eight like 20 them in between ceremony. Red Table wine is all about fucking people's kids. God Damn, that's crazy thing. It's amazing that one priest could get allowed, would be no one priest comes out and does that.

Speaker 1:          01:16:09       And you know, and people should be like, well that's just one guy's just fucked up and yeah, it's understandable. This guy is just, he's, you know, we didn't see it coming. It's crazy. But if you've got like hundreds of thousands of cases, like all over the world, like at what point in time does everybody step in and start like thoroughly investigating churches, like having like security there at all times. Having cops there at all times looking for inappropriate shit. Like this is a scene of a crime. How many crimes had been committed here? Who knows these, we've got a hundred kids saying that someone made them suck the deck. Just to put it in context with, oh, that's a crime scene. God dammit. Let's imagine that Kmart for example, now let's say Walmart, let's say Walmart, all of a sudden word got out that all these Walmarts all across the country, the manager was fucking little kids. It would be what, one week before the government to send it on all the Walmarts. There we go. What is this? Well, it turns out ladies and gentlemen, what we had here was a pedophile ring disguised as a business. There was actually a Typo in the training manual that to

Speaker 6:          01:17:11       for whatever it is like you wouldn't, you wouldn't, you would investigate that because the Catholic church is so powerful. Uh, no one, no one's fucking with it. No one's fucking with it. And that's the, that's kind of the problem. And the Goddamn primate hive is we are not good at dealing with obvious truths. We're not good at addressing things and it just want to correct. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:17:33       establish a new viewpoint. That's, that's one thing we don't want to do. Once we have opinions on things, very difficult to get someone who really just abandoned that opinion and then recognize the opinion as wrong and then move on. Very hard for us to do. And that's one of the, one of the reasons as primates, we get stuck in certain types of behavior because it's comforting, you know, instead of just being alone on your own, not knowing whether or not you're doing the right thing or the wrong thing in life, you know, you're just literally working around on guesswork instead, you know, you have a confidence in, well, I've always done it this way and this is how I am and this is right and fuck the terrorists. Now we've got to fight them over there so we don't fight him over here. You know, and you know, you, you have these things and you don't want to let those things go because you've argued for those things forever.

Speaker 9:          01:18:12       Like, have you ever seen the documentary on the Sphinx where I'm doctor Robert Schoch, he's from the Boston University, Boston University, I think, or University of, uh, one of the mass, either University of Massachusetts. No, no, no. It's Boston. I think it's boss, maybe Boston College. Anyway, um, very well respected geologists goes to Egypt, looks at the Sphinx. Okay. And notices that there's all this erosion on the Sphinx and on the Sphinx and closure that can only be attributed to rainfall for thousands of years. Well, the only problem is the last time they had rainfall and the Nile Valley, it was 7,000 BC. So it's was like, you know, that's like 9,000 years ago. So that predates where they thought the construction of the pyramids sat in, buy something somewhere around 5,000 years. That's like impossible. I mean, that's like as far away from us as you know, like 5,000 years ago, you know, think about 5,000 years for us.

Speaker 9:          01:19:03       That's ancient Egypt. So it's as far away from them as ancient Egypt is to us. So he's saying we have a situation where it's at least that old, and it might be far older than that because this is thousands of years of rain. This has been cut out and thousands of years of rain has caused it to do this. So it had to be older, even still. So there's a bunch of people that are theorizing 10,500 BC. There's people that want to go 34,000 BC cause you add up all the dates of the pharaohs. So these guys, John Anthony West, who's a, an egyptologist who's been studying all this shit his whole life, he's one of the ones that's convinced that the ancient Egyptian history is a a rich long history. Not of 5,000 years, none of 2,500 BC but 34,000 years. He says it goes back far. You know, you just have to recognize it and understand it and appreciate it and you can show the different construction methods.

Speaker 9:          01:19:52       He's like, they've got like very clear evidence. Like this is their building things very differently here. And this is below what was on top of it. So we're talking about something that was buried in sand. So they built on top of something that was far older than what's right here. And so he has all this shit explained out and then he shows, the geologist shows all these fissures in the water and they explained that this are in the, in the walls that's only caused by water and they explained to all these conventional Egyptologists like this has got to be, we have to reconsider the age of this. Maybe it's just a bunch of bird p. So when the the Egyptologists look at him, the egyptologist goes, well, what's the evidence of this culture? You're asking us to consider a culture from 10,500 BC? Where's the evidence? This culture?

Speaker 9:          01:20:33       Like what the fuck are you talking about? What is this? What is this? They don't want to admit that they've been teaching for a hundred years. Some shit that's incorrect. Yeah. They want to attribute it to Khufu and all these different guys that they can know. Well, this guy existed at this point in time. It's documented and taught Moses the third. This is the guy. We attributed it to this. He was around at this point in time. They don't want to admit the possibility. That shit goes back thousands and thousands of years earlier and they deny him. He shows all this geology. He's got over a hundred geologists from all over the country that have signed off on this that they have looked at the erosion and say this is very clearly water erosion of thousands of years. Yeah, and they don't care. They don't give a fuck. They don't even want to talk about it.

Speaker 9:          01:21:13       Yeah. Egyptologist only want to consider it. Well, yeah, that but in a lot of them is, it's an because it would embarrass them. Yeah, it wasn't exactly, it's like they're in charge of information. They're in charge of disseminating information. You have the clearest information you could ever have as geology. It's fucking rocks, man. It's like, what is this? That is slate. That's provable. What is this? That's granted. Yeah, it's fucking, it's rocks. Okay. You got rocks with deep fishers for their looks like water. It's smooth. It goes down just like water would do. It's not like sand erosion. He shows this doctor Ron shock shows a difference between Sandra Rojan and water erosion.

Speaker 5:          01:21:45       It's interesting. Isn't very clear difference what you are talking about, how like bizarre it is that priests are pedophiles have embedded themselves into the priesthood, uh, and are doing the exact opposite of what some pre your think of priesthood should do or what, why they're always protecting the priests. So then you look at Egyptology and it's curious. Oh look, there's the exact same structure and Egyptology w instead of somebody being a true as store and being like, wow, good work. Holy Shit, this is going to transform everything. That's amazing right there. Like, you know what? That's a lot of ink to rewrite all this history. Let's not waste our time. Yeah, look, why don't you go investigate that arrowhead. Okay.

Speaker 9:          01:22:27       This is the dumbest thing that guy said. Where's the evidence of this culture? How much evidence do you think would be there after 10,000 fucking years? Nothing, man. It would all be eaten up, especially houses like American houses, like a regular house with drywall and shit and the roof tile, that shit's gone. Earth is going to swallow that up. It's

Speaker 5:          01:22:44       fucking hard, man. Because if you think about it, just to empathize with that asshole egyptologist if you think about it, I can think of specific times I've gotten in a fight with someone and known in my head that I am wrong in the midst of the fight. I just know I'm wrong and I just keep pushing on, pushing through, even though

Speaker 8:          01:23:06       I know I'm wrong in clearly in a, in a, in a, in my head. And that's just some dumb little fight. Imagine Egyptologists who stayed his entire career on the fucking thing. It's like, and to epidemics saying you're wrong about something that you mean being wrong, being proven wrong on something that's devastating because that just shows it like you didn't consider everything and you have a flaw in your thinking. Like you had dated this and you were clearly incorrect. So the hieroglyphs that you read that you attributed to all these various guys saying this is when we built this as well. Like the Sphinx itself, like one of the guys I forgot, I think it's taught Moses the third, whoever's accredited with the, no, that's not him. The fuck is accredited with the, uh, building of the Sphinx. It's not Khufu Khufu was the guy who was a cat, made the, he was credited with the Great Pyramid.

Speaker 8:          01:23:51       Um, anyway, whoever it was, the, the hieroglyph the way it said, the way it was, uh, you know, the, what the reason why they attributed to him is because he said that he was told in a dream that if he uncovered this, thinks that he would, uh, get to be pharaoh. But the problem is it's the word is uncover. Like if, if it's uncovered, if that's the real translation, then you're saying that it was there. Ready. I don't know how, how clear it is to translate hieroglyphs though. You know what I'm saying? Like if you're reading something and hieroglyphic how much of that is open to interpretation because it's such an alien language. I mean, it's so different than English to put it into English words and to put it in, in, in the context of we're going to recognize as me having a certain intent.

Speaker 8:          01:24:32       I mean, God, it's so hard, man. I just saw this thing called, what am I, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The point is that all it says is that he was there when the Spinks was built. That's all you know for sure. You know it just cause it's written somewhere. You know, I rocked this sphinx and you know I built La, I built a shit. And then scientists, you know, a thousand years to know, oh, Joe Rogan built La. It's written right here. That doesn't mean anything, man. It's a fucking giant structure. Yeah. You say you built it. Where's the drawings, man? You don't even have any fucking directions. Is this pictures of you assholes with plates on your heads with fruit and there's no pictures of you building the fucking parents? None. Not a single high rigor roof represents the construction of the pyramids. You think, why would you write that down?

Speaker 8:          01:25:12       What's really important is how do you make bread? Oh, it's fucking crazy. Yo a fire and we got to fuck with some flour. Yeah. They have all this different things that they have written down about their life and their culture and war and space. Somebody sketching a pyramid on the wall and like they're like boring. Why are you sketching that thing? We just built it. Forget about it. Let's talk about 2 million, 300,000 stones connected so perfectly like in like the king's chamber and all these stones inside. You can't get a razor blade in between a man. Well, I mean, yeah, so I think that, why would you write down how you made that? Yeah, fuck it. Just fucking boring. It's just rocks and stones. It's probably like, it's a simple way we just haven't thought of yet. Let's draw me. No, it's probably something that's so basic and you're like, oh Duh. They wouldn't want to draw that dough. No, there's no way. No,

Speaker 9:          01:26:04       there's no way. Just the numbers, the numbers of stones, they don't know whether or not the stones were caught or whether or not they were poured. There's a separate argument that they were made out of limestone and it's fairly convincing and it's another one that's going to fuck with Eg Egyptologists for sure. Because the theory is that they made those stones with like, they made a concrete out of limestone and they mixed it and then like set them in place. So it wasn't that they moved all these stones is a, they made concrete and made these blocks like in place.

Speaker 5:          01:26:34       Um, well I think that,

Speaker 9:          01:26:35       well that doesn't make any sense either, right? Because if you, even if you make concrete blocks, then you've got to pick them up and move him.

Speaker 5:          01:26:40       I mean, I don't know. Your mind gets more detailed than mine does in these things. These things. Did you like you try to like figure it out? I, I, I'm, I don't know man. I just look at it. I'm, I think that maybe I have lazy thinking and this says that I will just let myself believe that. Like I've had, uh, uh, alien crane. It's just too much work, right? Yeah. I don't need you. I don't go into the number of stones and stuff back, but I do think whatever it is and the way it was built is for whether it's the most mundane, it's just a shitload of people figured out how to do it or whether the thing just teleported in from some uh, Sumerian dimension or or whatever. I still think it's a, it's like awe inspiring that things like that exist and I think that there is the tendency in science to try to minimalize things for some reason and remove that, that feeling of like, Holy Shit, what is that? It's by the time Egyptologists get down with everything and it's just like a snore fast out there. You've got this ancient insane pyramid that appears to somehow is a, is Ivan, and I think I've heard you say this somehow at some time of the year

Speaker 9:          01:27:48       lies the summer solstice. Yeah. To visit. There's a like shafts inside that point to certain constellations. There's a bunch of design where when the sun is rising at a certain time of the year, it goes like in the temple in man. It goes like up the shock rose. It's like there, it's been crazy, incredible shed. Like there's so much of what they did and even the Mayans, the Mayans had some visual effect on the side of one of their pyramids that as the sun would rise, it would look like a snake was moving up the side of their pyramid. And you know, they read worship Wetzel Quad, Alicia's the feathered plumed serpent. A flying, flying snake.

Speaker 5:          01:28:22       Yeah, I've seen the video of the sheets. Snake Shadow. It's okay. It's

Speaker 9:          01:28:25       pretty dope. But you know, you think about these ancient ancient civilizations, I mean, how much room for error do you have when you're moving 2000 fucking pound stones and you know, you're doing it in your barefoot with fucking, you know, a goofy thong on pushing these giant stones. Maybe it was just an extinct animal that used to love to build pyramids. You know, dinosaurs, irritating pyramid dinosaur, right? I look, Eric goes, he's just shits a mountain nakeds pyramid ever. That's his, that's his, that's his beehive. Yeah. Why does he like to eat clay? So, yeah, no, it makes a really complicated Ann Hill. There's only one of them.

Speaker 5:          01:29:02       They existed and then he died and he turned it into a pyramid. So it looks complicated. Sphinxes it looks complicated, but it's just nature manifesting itself through Dung. Well, you know, we don't know. I mean, I think are, I'm like, you know, when you, what I was thinking is if you could paint, if like you, you are some primitive person and you knew that whatever you painted on a wall was going to get super scrutinized by anthropologists who are going to look at the thing and be like, oh, this means that they worshiped the cow. God. Right. Maybe you're not I to draw a cow. Right. Well, I mean, yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:29:36       makes sense that they would draw cows. I mean, that's what they needed to stay alive, you know? I mean, it was very important to them. You know, when people talk about, why did you know, why did animals worship cattle? Well, there's two reasons for sure, but the Indian region doesn't make sense. There's two reasons. One, they did like a lot of ancient cultures. They were embedded in cow cattle worship. They were like, yeah. What is it called? Choctaw? He, do you know how to say that one? No, I just read him seconds. That was the one that Mckenna talked about and he shows all these images from like all the different shit that they were like had the, that was in honor of the cow. They had horns and they were showing cows and then the idea is that the reason why people worship cows, his idea is that there was mushrooms, it was growing off cow shit and they were eating them and they were having these psychedelic experiences, which makes sense except they also needed them to stay alive.

Speaker 9:          01:30:26       You know, you have to look at the fact that if you're the first time that they invented culture, the first time that they invented civilization, they had to figure out a way to stay put. Right. That's what I had to do. So they, they had to figure out a way to corral the animals. So wants to corral the animals like, oh, we got 'em they, they worship on, they put the horns up like, oh, this is what keeps us sustaining. This is what allows us to stay here. This is what keeps us alive. You know, they have a big supply of these animals and then keep slaughtering them. I mean, if you're a family of four and you have a full farm just for yourself, let me think about that man. You got up full farm with, you know, 30 cows and you've got all these chickens. You, you should account and you get a side of beef. That's all a lot of fucking food. That shit will last you a long ass time. Yeah. And you've got all this corn that you're growing and all these vegetables that you growing, you don't need anything else. You know, you could, you could do it all there. You're, you're totally self sustaining.

Speaker 5:          01:31:13       Yeah. And it's, yeah, it's safer. You're, if you have to go out hunting all the time, you're going to get attacked by lions and shit. It's, yeah, but I don't think it's all about the mushroom. I don't think, I mean it's, yeah, it's more, I mean, they, in India they can, I've, I've read, they consider a cow dung to be antiseptic. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:31:32       Yeah. The, the, the Indian thing I was saying that didn't make sense is that the Indians didn't even eat them. So if they don't eat them, if they worshiped him as God's, then what happened there? Because I understand the idea that the cattle keep you alive and that's why you worship, but you eat them. You know, the, the Choctaw, he, okay. I think those guys, I think they were like at the time where everybody ate animals. Yeah. You know, there was no, there was no, no, like sacred animals where he couldn't eat it. Like you got to eat everything that was there. You know, you don't have that much choice.

Speaker 5:          01:31:59       But India people are starving, but they won't go after the cows. Well, yeah, they, yeah, they, there are, they do kill some cows in India. There's some people don't fly that way anymore. Right. But in, you know, in the Hindu religion, right. Our cow sacred. Oh yeah, you, when I was in India, you would go down the street and just pass a cow and you can pet it. Cows are like dogs, they are sweet. You are of them and they like it now lick your hand and they're just really sweet animals. That's the thing. It's like, you know, we were like wow, bowls. Those people in China eating those dogs, how could they do that? Pass the stake honey. Um, you're eating a gentle, very sweet creature. That's, I mean, I'm not saying it doesn't taste good. I'm not a vegetarian. I eat them. But you have to recognize when you're eating that thing, it is a very, very sweet animal.

Speaker 5:          01:32:56       Cows, cows are like really gentle, sweet, not entirely dumb animals. They, especially if you like, I mean when you see a cow in the wild or a cow at a slaughter house or a cow that's being harvested now you're seeing something that was a, that's being treated in the most horrific way. You know, it's, it's not in its natural habitat and I'm not glorifying the way cows or any animals are treated in India. But I think that any animal that you shall love to, it's going to become sweet and domesticated and seem kind of smart. You do you understand that Joe wants to kill tigers? It was, we should kill tigers.

Speaker 5:          01:33:32       Yeah. Until everything that kills you. That's why I'm not done for bowls roaming the streets either. You know? Well, I mean, yeah. It's like that's a, that's an interesting point. And by just done an off note, uh, what is more satisfying than watching a lion tamer get chomped by align the Russian video. Any video. When you see somebody, you've gotten a lion cage getting mauled by a lion, there's all, it's like the one time you can watch violence without having to feel too bad because this is a person who was enslaved and animal that's not meant to be enslaved or put in a cage prodding and poking it and getting the inevitable result. But it's disturbing, dude. Have you seen the one that, not the one that just happened where the guy at, were they like, did the, I don't know what you call it, did some worldwide wrestling move on?

Speaker 5:          01:34:18       I'm like, they both grabbed him and stretched his arms out for a second. There are about to rip his arms off. No, I did see that. Yeah, it looks like they going to tear his arms off, but the hose kept them all got so close to being the greatest. I thought it was going to be. I thought it was totally going to be deaf. I thought it was going to be arms come off death. That was a, yeah, it was about to be like death for that was amazing that he was still okay. It was like walking around and got fucked up. I'm sure there's blood everywhere. There was blood all over the line. It wasn't a blood. There was a jacket that's blood, but there's a lion attack video on your website and by the way, man, why do people on your website keep posting these death videos? What the fuck dude? You get like every, there's so many like death videos and like I have a problem not watching

Speaker 6:          01:34:58       them and it gets stuck in my head, but there was just there on the Internet if they're on the Internet and it's interesting it's going to be on my website. I know, I know. It's not a choice. You want to have to make Derek need to see this. Yeah, I'm gonna well maybe it's not that bad. Let me see. Oh my God, it's terrible. Stop. No more debt. Smart video on your website of, I think it's Russia and its Elian finishing the job and it's like, Geez. It's like, you know, first the guy's got his arm in the cage and he's in the lions kind of like holding onto his arm a little bit and it almost looks, it's kind of femme fun. The lines just having a little bit of fun. The guys got, the guy's indicates with one arm out, there's somebody there kind of holding onto them.

Speaker 6:          01:35:40       The lions like you're not cats play with their food and she's kind of like chilling out looking at the guy and the guy's like they're in the first second. It looks like you might get out of this and then the line for whatever reason just pulls him into the cage and chomps down. I think on his neck you can't really tell cause the lines on top of him and you just see that thing that happens. You know if you've ever been bitten by a dog or a cat when it just bites in and it's, it's in for the real bite. It's doing that. It's just biding deep and all of a sudden the guy's body does this convulsive thing, which is kind of the last like little like adrenaline pump before he dies and it's just this awful seizure and then some guy in like a military helmet or a military hat or I don't know, police officer comes and shoots the fucking line, which is the saddest part of that.

Speaker 6:          01:36:28       The lion bellows out is it's being shot like what the fuck? What do you expect? What did you think was going to happen? What can we say? It's authentic surprise. Like, oh and that, and that's the end of the line. The line was doing everything it was supposed to do. The lion was passing the lion test. When the fucking monkey comes and starts poking, you are washing your cage, you eat it. That's how it's works. That's how it's worked from the beginning of time. How long did you think he tricked up thing and to trick them, you have to be on them all day. Every day. Yeah. Those guys are handled big cats. Those motherfuckers get very intimate with those cats because you have to, you, you can't like tell you a couple months off and go to Sweden. I came back from the Alps to tell you what to eat and to talk.

Speaker 6:          01:37:12       I was like, why the fuck was I listening to you again, bitch, get over here just yeah, crack you in the, wait a minute. You know the fuck. Wait a minute and here's my dumb hippie point. That effect of the lion handler manipulating this powerful lion. That is exactly what oppressive governments do to the people. And it's the exact same thing where you have the clear powers, the power of the people. They are more powerful than, uh, we Baka who's like, I don't care what they say about marijuana. I'm going to keep arresting people that they arrest me for arresting people, you know, so I would, he said, no, I made that up, but he said some awesome, awesome shit. Yeah. He got to go on Bill O'reilly tomorrow. Yeah, he would've been, he would've been an anchor on Fox News the next day. But the is like

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       the, the, the, the people or the lion and you event and that's the, that's the horror of the government is when the line starts waking up and the people start realizing, wait a minute, you can't tell me I can't fucking eat mushrooms. You can't tell me I can't smoke pot. You can't take 60% of my money away from me anymore. I don't understand why we were in Afghanistan. And instead of being like, well, that's weird. What time is it? I have time to grab a coffee. You start fucking organizing and doing what you can to fight against it, which I never do, so I should shut up. But it's,

Speaker 8:          01:38:28       you're saying it's just, it's an idealistic point of view and the only reason why it's idealistic is cause no one's pulled it off yet. But it doesn't mean it's not possible. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:38:36       Paris, have you seen what they're doing in Paris? Yeah. That shits not getting a lot of airplay is, or what's happening? Tell us in a, in Paris, uh, I believe it's in Paris, they're like increasing the age that you can get your pension, uh, from 61 to 63. So I guess it's equivalent to being a 61. Like for all your life you've been working or whatever, and all of a sudden you're about to have the big vacation before you take it. You have to work two more years. And not everyone's that they, but I think there's other things involved. They have like serious financial problems all day. Well, yeah. Well they, you know, a lot of people were saying the financial problems they're experiencing, we're, we're, again, we're about to get a little taste of that too. But um, uh, but what you're seeing over there is, um, not being carried in the mainstream press that much because it's a, it's a mild little revolutions happening over there. They caught off the fucking oil supplies. They're cutting off oil supplies really to the city yet. Um, and I don't know. And I was coming off oils activists, they're fucking blockading like the Oil Refineries. There's like a ship full of oil apparently floating out there and can't come in. Whoa. Yeah, there gas is running out over there from these activists because there are six seating there like that. But the problem, it's like that's the level of reaction you have to have to oppression.

Speaker 8:          01:39:49       So the activists are cutting off the oil and the reason why they're cutting off the oil to the city is to starve the city outside. The city has to listen to them. Well somebody call in and explain this cause like this is like something all in, we don't have right now. I'm just give me off the fucking Hook here. But they are, I know they're blockading the fucking oil and and I, it's not getting that much play in the news. I haven't heard anything about this. Oh, let's go to cnn.com that was you. Okay. You would have to think that's breaking news, right? Yeah. That's breaking news. Dems look to energize women and unions. Yeah. Lindsay Lohan backwards. Scotty, the stock chart. Worst Day in two months to bullshit stories. That's their big story. Two things that make no sense. The stock market, which is fake as fuck and no one understands. You can't even pretend you understand that. Yeah. After that Bernie Madoff Shit, that guy was, he even stockbrokers got fucked by that guy, right? No one knows what the fuck that guy was doing. How is that possible? Then you have a bullshit system, right? Your system is nonsense. Even the people that were experts didn't understand what the fuck was happening. Yeah. Nobody saw this fucking gigantic collapse coming. Nobody vocal about it. Please

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       shut the fuck up. And then Dems look to energize women in unions. What does that even mean? How is that a story? It's a number one story. I'd rather look at that. That's the big one. That's the picture. And at some haggard old check who hasn't seen a dick in over a decade and she's talking about running shit. You talking about [inaudible] and shit? Not one that was still connected to a body talking about running shit. You ain't running nothing, mom. Shut the fuck up. All right. I'm tired of these crazy old bitches that want to run shit. Go Meg Whitman. Neh. Donald. No. Christine O'Donnell. Just because your vagina doesn't work anymore, it doesn't mean you get to be a man. You don't get to run shit. Okay. How dare you. You heard me? You heard and Joe? Yeah. You are a man. I'm not talking to you. I was looking at you, but I wasn't talking to you.

Speaker 4:          01:41:36       He's talking to these crazy brides that want to run shit, man. Stop it now. The fucking, the, the, the, what's her name? Um, fucking, what's her name? Ellen did president. You would be against Alan become? Um, I would vote against her just based on my talkings with Greg Fitzsimmons. What does he say about you have to talk to Greg for semis. Oh, nothing goes public with that shit. You know what? I would fucking vote for Ellen just for the absurdity. I would, I would hope we would all dance like on national flag day. Meg Whitman, ladies, thanks that marijuana is a gateway drug and that it should not be legal because if it is more we'll get to our children. Oh, we've got to protect our children. I'm so tired of people being able to say things like gateway drug with no consequences. Like that's a, that is a lie.

Speaker 4:          01:42:26       That is nonsense that has been disproven by science like you can. Alcohol is far more of a gateway drug to bad decisions and marijuana is marijuana in fact, keeps a lot of people from ever trying dangerous drugs because they get fucking paranoid. You know, they think about it because of marijuana and they get paranoid. If you're going to start doing coke and ecstasy and then you're going to do it anyway. Man, it's, it's, it's out there. If you want it, it's there. You know, it's not hard to find pot. It's out there. It's not going to change the ability of kids to get pot. They can get pot everywhere. I mean, just drive down the street from my house. There is five fucking medical marijuana stores, five of them in a row and like two blocks. It's pots everywhere. You're telling me that pot is, you know, it doesn't have a GPS chip on it.

Speaker 4:          01:43:07       So the 21 year old dude who bought it can't sell it at twice the price to some 17 year old kid. Now you know, it's fucking, anybody can get it. It's everywhere. Pots just out there, man. It's out there. So you can't fucking tell me that it's there. That there would be some sort of a, a bad thing. You know, that that would come with making it legal. Making people who are responsible human beings who want to do something to make themselves feel. You're treating them like criminals. And you're saying that that being a criminal is okay, but it's okay for them to be a criminal because they want to relax and have a plant that makes you feel soothing and it makes sex better and it makes food better. No, you want them to be a criminal, but yeah, that's just dom. Let's talk. Let's look at the gateway drug idea, and if you think about it in a where all

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       drugs are lumped together, all illegal drugs are lumped together into one category, right? Some teenagers smokes pot for the first time. I was like, this is fucking awesome. Holy Shit. Drugs are great. It's like, no, actually drugs aren't great. Certain drugs are great, certain drugs are fucking awful. Cocaine is that I, I personally hate it. I have friends who are fans of it, but they're annoying. Someone on cocaine is really annoying to be around. It's, it's, it's too expensive. I fucking hate it. And of course the freebase form of it is awful. Meth, awful heroin, awful. These are terrible drugs. Why are you lumping them together in with a drug that only seems to have mostly positive effects on your life outside of if you smoke it way, way, way too much and you get a foggy mind and I don't know, maybe you eat too much.

Speaker 9:          01:44:41       Well I think you also have to take into consideration that everyone has a different biological makeup. You know, there's some people that get addicted to alcohol really quickly to some people that are allergic to wheat. You know, some people, marijuana is not the best thing for them.

Speaker 5:          01:44:51       But you know what? You know what's, this is the thing though, man. There was this one girl, there was a girl I dated that she smoked we once and she took one hit and within two minutes she stood up, ran full speed into the bathroom, hit the bathtub and hit her head on the wall and she just laid in the bathtub for like three minutes. And I was like, what the fuck are you okay? She said that she just got this instant thing that she had to stand up and run and she didn't even know where she was. She just started running and that was from one hit from weed. Yeah. But yeah, but no, she wasn't dumb fucking intelligence. That's bad. You think one hit, one hit. How good was the weed? Ohio brick. We Bong. Really? Yes. Wow. We'll try giving a skateboard to a nine year old. If you want to talk about a dangerous, scary, you give a kid a escapes

Speaker 9:          01:45:36       or they'll go get you sell like a propaganda. They'll go slam. Yeah. Yeah. I'd love to see you in Congress. I'm running for office. Mr Trussell. How do you explain all of these children that smoke marijuana and ran into the bathtub and hit their heads? He man, it's like, you know, you can get my nine year old kid a skateboard man. Uh Huh. Duly noted. Mr Trussell, please, please sit down, take your seat. They'd be like, listen to this guy. You'd be a ch huge fuck up for the cause. You'd be like, when they made the movie of the story, you'd be the fucking that got it. Steve Buscemi would play and uh, he would get up and he'd be super stoned. Forget what he was saying. And he would say, hey man, just like you can't give a nine year old a fucking skateboard.

Speaker 5:          01:46:21       Well, the whole thing, I mean, the whole thing about keeping weed away from kids,

Speaker 9:          01:46:25       it's like you should, I think you should keep all things that change kids, psychological state, that the state of mind. I think it's all tricky. It's a very dangerous, I think it's up in the air. It should be done. I have a father, you know, I think you should be introduced to alcohol by your father.

Speaker 5:          01:46:40       You're right. Can I just say something just to go back a little bit. I'm not saying we should give pot to kids. I know you're not just blow it in their, we should make them

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       buy it. You shouldn't give it away. They get that. They get the wrong idea. I think for a lot of kids earn it. A lot of kids through a lot of, a lot of kids are going through a lot of weird shit when they're growing up. I mean everybody is just the reality of becoming a teenager and then, you know, growing into manhood or womanhood, it's a fucking freaky feeling. Like, Oh my God, I'm going to have to take care of myself someday and make my own money and fucking feed myself. And this is just too crazy. I don't want to leave my mom's house and his fucking schools drive me nuts. How much am I going to have to work once I got a job? I'm working this hard when I'm in school. You know, all that shit could be overwhelming to kids, you know, to Real, especially young kids like 14, 15.

Speaker 1:          01:47:26       If you start throwing pot in the mix too, that might send them off into the woods. There might Corinne them off track and really fuck with their head. But what have you were six years old watching sesame street and you had this magic guy come and go, hey, uh, would you like to look at this stoned as a six year old PR? No, man, listen, when you're six years old, your brain is still developing. I don't think it's a good move to introduce drugs. And to develop their minus the mean street. I want to talk about this magic guy, this guy all the time. I'm more interested in the college guys in that pot. That's what I, that's what I would be doing if I was at a time machine. I'd be going back in time giving myself, we'd would you when I was watching sesame seeds.

Speaker 1:          01:48:06       So paranoid you did to try this? Yeah. You had to go back in time into your life and do anything differently. What would you do differently? Uh, probably that I was getting myself. No, I don't know. Uh, is there any one instance from your childhood that you would redo? You take back? Probably throwing rocks at that cardinal threw a rock at a bird. Yeah. Yeah. Little baby and a baby cardinal. That was like retarded or something like that. But I was like six or seven. And you know, I think I've talked about this before. Yeah. What about you? [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:48:40       same. I, yeah, at once when I, when I was a kid, I like went in my, my grandparents love birds and I had a BB gun and my grandparents were out of town and I like took that, drove their golf cart because they drove around in a golf cart with like, like I'm on a hunting safari into the backyard and just shot a Robin Wright, just killed a Robin and it fell and it like spiraled down and all the other burden, like there's bird feeders all over my grandmother's yard and as a staff, you know, statue of Saints and these birds are like dive bombing me. They were freaking out cause I'd killed one of them and they're freaking out and just swirling around. And it was like, I was mortified. Uh, and that's definitely something that I would go, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:49:22       fish fish bombing to where used to take him eighties and put it in fish's mouth, you know, like live fish and it would light them and then throw him off the roof of the school at people. Oh my God, you guys are sick fucks. Which gives me his fish. There's a pond at our elementary school that you catch them going with Ketchum and then we put them in a bucket and then they'll mark God, you guys are a mess. Fish bombing. Oh, bombing. Yeah. That's such a fun. It was great for fishes. Like imagine your fish. All of a sudden you're yanked out of your world into an alien world. Stare at these things. These things are laughing. They throw you a bucket. You're flopping around in a fucking bucket. You're swimming around in circles. You can't get out, but he takes it out of that bucket.

Speaker 1:          01:49:59       Shoves his big giant Dick in your mouth. You know this, this explosive deck lights it on fire and then you fly through the air and explode. That's how you leave this world. We had also did squirrel baseball where like the squirrels would go up and you need to stop because it's, you're looking at some Dexter Shit fucking serial killer than what you would do. Kitten crucifixion scene in the Bible with kittens. Have you ever strangled a frog? Was real easy. Just put them in your throat and just strangle it. You know? Look at their face and then you've killed. No, I've never killed a frog. Skidding. Disturbing. That's one thing I used to love. I used to collect frogs or inner window. Well know you guys know what window wells are. They're like, we're the basement windows are and had little sling and the neighborhood. We had wood frogs would get trapped in there.

Speaker 1:          01:50:45       And so as a kid I would take all these frogs and put them in buckets in the neighborhood would have like a pet show where you bring your pet and he's like, Ooh, first place, second place. And I didn't have a pet because my cat ran away. So I would take my bucket of frogs and I did that. I'll put like little things for them to climb up and down. And that was my pet never won, but I was at frog free. That's all I wanted to say about frogs. I have plugged in. I was a kid. The thing about frogs is they've got no rights, right? You take a frog and stomp on it and nobody ever goes, what happened to your frog? I Dunno. He died. Right? Was buried that bitch in the backyard. Nobody ever does an autopsy in your fraud. Go Watch this frog as of a crushed skull.

Speaker 1:          01:51:19       The fuck is going on at frog. CSI gives a fuck. You can play baseball with frogs. You could throw frogs at each other and hit each other with fucking frogs and the frogs die in a paralyzed. Nobody's going to arrest. You told us were pretty bad ass toads were like, throw a toad at a dude in front of a cop and nobody would say shit. You can pick up the toad and her alum at a dude and he hit the dude and nobody would be like, fuck man. Animal rights. So a toad is a frog with herpes. You know they used to have those like little bumps. If you look close and you're all just like warts are nowhere near the waters I would. It is. I don't that yet. They're dry, dry licking a frog thing. Did you ever do that? No. Did you ever? It doesn't work that way. When I was a kid, I did it, but I don't think I ever trip. Maybe I was doing DMT went out by the way to do it. Doesn't everybody thinks it's looked at frog? No. You have to smoke it. If you look at it, it's just like eating it. It's not going to get into the, it's just like

Speaker 9:          01:52:10       tea. When you, your brain makes it. You're, if you, if you eat any sugar has DMT in it. DMT contains whatever, whatever it is, uh, in your body, your stomach breaks it down. It's called the Amato aiming model. Avian oxidase. So when you're taken DMT orally, you're, your stomach kills it and it never gets in your bloodstream. Wow. So you have to smoke it. He can't orally consume DMT and less like the way they do it in the, uh, in Peru and the Amazon, they, they make this stuff called Iowasca. You know what that is? And with Iowasca, what they've done is they put in one plant, they put one plant that has DMT in it and another plant that has an inhibitor. And that's why it works. So you can't really lick a frog. Cause if you lick a frog would just be like eating.

Speaker 9:          01:52:50       It wouldn't work. Right. So what you do is you take the frog and you put it on a glass, you know, and you make the frog excrete his body ages all over this glass and this body just I guess just as certain animals that kills him, kill sheep. If they ate five Meo DMT kills them. So you take any, excrete it on the glass and then you stick the glass in the sun and it dries it out and then you scrape it off with a razor blade and then you smoke it. That's how do you think the some I figured out how they figured out anything that'd be figured out to eat lobsters, you know? I mean I get that. Makes Sense. Let's see if we can get this thing. You're like, ah, you know, like I wonder what this just on the back of my fat guys, if I try and smoke it, let me see if I stuck it up mass.

Speaker 9:          01:53:34       How many steps were there before he tried smoking? He had to figure it out. Right? I bet it's fairly recent. I bet the smoking it off the frogs. I bet it's probably pretty recent. There's a bunch of different types of, uh, of, of DMT out there too. That was one of the things they were talking about. Like different people have different experiences depending on what plant they use when they make Iowasca cause if they use Syrian Rue, I was listening to some guy talking about this on the Internet and some interesting discussion about it. And if you use Syrian Rue, apparently they have all this like, um, uh, Annunaki imagery and all this Mesopotamia imagery. You get all this, like it's, they all have snakes. That's one thing they share in common, but it's, when you get it from the Amazon, you see black people and Jaguars, you see like jungle themes you see like plants and shit and like a big jump.

Speaker 9:          01:54:21       But when you get it in the, uh, the Middle East, the stuff you're getting is all like fucking Mesopotamia Shit. It's all like Babylonia, all that cuneiform tablets and that kind of imagery. You get in the San Fernando Valley, you see Carl's Jr's traffic Zang, old cars with little tires. Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, the, the idea of, uh, you know, keeping psychedelics from people by locking them up. It is amazing that they've been able to do that for that long that they have been able to keep them illegal. And then if people try to use them, if you want to use it for your own edification, for your own, you know, your own experience, it's illegal for you yourself to do something. Some person will come and get you and lock you in a cage. Where could you imagine if it was only us? Look and there's only the three of us were the only people left on the earth.

Speaker 9:          01:55:13       And um, we discovered while we were here that there is some shit that makes you experience like these incredible states of consciousness and you start having this wave of creativity in these new ideas and it feels like an incredibly intelligent alien lifeforms communicating with you. And then we were like, you can't do that dude. You can't do that. If you do that, we're going to kill you or lock you in a cage and we're going to contain you. We can't have you running around having an experience and it just running around. You're not doing anything to anybody else. You're getting it and then you're doing. And if you do it and you test positive for it, you are, you are against the law.

Speaker 6:          01:55:46       Well, let's imagine that. Let's say we just in this house, there was a creature in a weird outfit did, if he caught any of us smoking pot would come and grab us and take us to a certain part of the house and put us in a rape cage. We would stop that animal. Kill it. You kill it. You'd be like, you know what the thing that's taking us and putting us in the rape cage, um, there's only one of them and there's three of us. So I don't want to go on that rape cage again. Can we please make it? Can you, can you, can we get rid of the guy who takes us into the rape cage? Yeah. It's like

Speaker 9:          01:56:20       we're trying to be enlightened here and we keep getting raped. Well, yeah, try to fucking take pay Odeon communicate with the spirit world and someone keeps throwing me a cage of some big black dude. What the fuck man? What the hell man, why does it have to be a black dude? Why? Because they probably would win more often. Why the better rapers athletes? Oh Man.

Speaker 6:          01:56:45       Yeah. It's a, it's a, it's a real confusing situation. And whenever you a year, you know, leave Baka talking about how he's just going to keep arresting people or anytime you hear or like in Mexico and they're like, they just found 500 yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:57:00       Tons of marijuana. Do you hear about that? Yeah. Biggest, biggest cash crop ever that they hauled in. They busted. Yeah. It's just, it's just, I mean, less Mexican weed. That stuff sucks. Your weed sucks. If you weed was good, you want to be shooting each other. Yeah, that's true. Mexican weeds, the worst. No Brazilian weeds the worst. And I was in Brazil, we got some weight. It was a intellect. A little, it was like almost like particle board. It was like a little brick. Yeah. Little Sin. Very tightly compact brick. And you had to break it off and then smoke it. AIDS tastes like shit and it smelled like shit and you barely got hot. It's like a cousin of high. It wasn't like real high, nothing like we have here. You would take God, these people are living in the forest, the rainforest rather. Beautiful Tropical Paradise. You know how easy it would be for them to grow weed. They keep it illegal.

Speaker 6:          01:57:48       That's how it was in Bahamas to same thing. Really. Bahamas shit.

Speaker 9:          01:57:51       Isn't that amazing? What the fuck is that about man? You know? I mean, how do they not rebel against that? Prostitution is legal in Brazil. Cage fighting's everywhere. That's the birth of valley. Tuto five the birth of no rules fighting and somehow or another they keep potty illegal. It's an interesting,

Speaker 6:          01:58:08       well, yeah, I mean it's the big, it's the, it's the elephant in the room everywhere. It's just, yeah. That to me is the criteria through which you can measure it. How far a society's advanced is their relationship with psychoactive drugs. [inaudible] says everything because it's like anyone who does a psychoactive drug knows you. It's fun. It is fun.

Speaker 9:          01:58:29       This is the poor. The podcast will always click off. I was hoping you would talk about the first UFC, which bode clear. No. To me, it a Hippie faggot and he wants to talk about is fucking

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       pro drug bullshit. That's the only reason why we're talking about drugs at all is because drugs are part of life. That's the only reason. If drugs weren't drugs, if they were, if there was some new word, it's a, it's a part of life and a fucking significant one. Yep. That's a gateway drug. It's all fucking gateway drugs got damn and everything's out. Drug milk is a gateway drug to cookies. It's, you know it is. Drink some milk. He's like, Oh, I'm just going to be to have cookies and this shit. The next thing you're eating cookies, the milk got you. Eat Cookies. Cookies are bad for you. Cookies of sugar in it. You're going to get diabetes. You're gonna fucking die young to smoke or eat cookies whenever we want. Yeah, that's right, bitch. There's people that want to let mandate against fatty foods. They want to, I want to say that food should, shouldn't have a certain amount of calories or fat content or you know, bad oils or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:59:29       Fuck that man. If it tastes good, just let me know what it's gonna do to me. If I ate it, I'll make my own decisions. Your space suit, you get to Iran, whatever fuel you want through it, it doesn't matter what it is and if sometimes that fuel kills you. Tough Shit. Tough Shit. That's the way it goes. What I say? So give me it all man. Let it leave it all on the table. Let's fucking sort it all out. I don't want my kids to get hooked on it. Neither do you write good. So let's educate her fucking kids. All right, let's educate our kids and let's get rid of the scumbags and want to push it on kids. Get rid of people that are, you know, don't make it. Don't make it illegal to sell the children. Don't make it legal to give them propaganda that makes them think that drugs are good.

Speaker 1:          02:00:06       But you know the whole idea behind locking anyone up for doing anything that they want to do. As long as they're informed and a of age, we can do what you want to do, man. If you want to start smoking crack in 2010 he lives, you're like a successful person who's got a good business on a nice family. Like I've always wanted to try crack. I just saw, you know, I mean, I see new Jack City. It's so appealing. I know it sounds crazy, but there's just like part of me. It's been missing. Southbank Ip crack. Yeah. I want to try and crack once. I don't think I'm going to wind up in a fucking crack house with no money. I mean, come on Mike. I'm Sigma Phi. We went to school together. We played the costs. I'm not a crack head. I just want to try crack.

Speaker 1:          02:00:47       Julie doesn't want me to do it, but I told her, hey, don't worry. That's on happening. No, why not? I did it. Why not? You did do crack, man. We talked about this before. No, I haven't. No, I haven't, but I did. I did. Um, when I was, uh, why are you saying that he didn't? Because he acts like a crack it when I was not that it really offended you are ruthless where you're cut downs Brah you know, they come so fast and so unexpected and they're so powerful when they land. Yeah. It's just incredible. You really thank God you doing comedy again company again? No, I useless. Ruthless Brian. I'm just kidding. I heard him but I have, I have bought crack. I when I was really, when I was living in crowded one side fucking food away, I didn't even want it. I looked at him like, what the fuck is this? I'm going to do crack come out. Really guys, guys, really? I just moved to La

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       and my landlord was a crack head wound. He had a friend who would do crack with them now. I didn't know, I knew that he was into drugs. I didn't know it was crack and his friend was over and his friend said to me, you have a copter, a rock before. And I, I swear to God, I didn't know what he meant, but I wanted to seem cool. So I was like, no, never copped the rock where I wasn't sure what he meant. He's like, give me a ride. So I, he's like, drive up here, turn right. I turned right, drive around the corner, drove around the corner, we pull up in front of a house. These two fucking gangsters come running out of the house. I don't know what it is, but they're automatically screaming at him. They're like, you stupid mother fucker. You fucking idiot.

Speaker 6:          02:02:17       Don't just fucking pull up here. They throw crack into the car. He gives them money. I'm like that. And you know, that's when I was like, Oh, you, you more on? What do you think this was? Drove or drove back? Well, you know, like really, what'd you think? And um, drove back, uh, and, and him and my landlord proceeded to smoke crack together. And that's the only time I've ever seen anyone smoke crack. So shitty smells, smells like burning plastic. The guy's face got all pale. And he was like, if I have a heart attack, call nine one one. Wow,

Speaker 1:          02:02:48       whoa, whoa. No, I didn't suck. I remember the first time I ever saw someone smoking crack, it was like on HBO or something like that. It's like some sort of documentary and while the guy was smoking crack, I was like looking at him. He's fine. He's not even going crazy. Yeah, I thought you smoked crack.

Speaker 6:          02:03:06       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:03:10       fuck man. Does this get crazy? Know the guy just smoking crack. He's just sitting there and I'm like, how high could he possibly like a speedy high? That's all it is. It's like, Ooh, I'm feeling speedy. You feel better if you like, that kind of thing. It was not my thing. Is it like coffee? No, it's like doing like doing cocaine pretty much always reminds me of exactly of doing cocaine. That's pretty much what it was. Ugh, wow. Never done it. Never done it. Dodge that bullet. Don't do it. I'm not going to, I think it might be what? The funding research? No, I'm not. I'm not interested in hanging out the pilot. I'll see any cocaine advocates. I don't see any cocaine people going, I made it because of cocaine. Cocaine's responsible for most of my energetic decisions. Most of my drive, most of my wisdom when I innovating on a beach town, you'll start getting in that, that group of people that were like, no, I prefer a cocaine when I go out. You know, it's a nice drug. You will have people that are selling it to like civilized cocaine. People always one up shooting each other. They just get crazy cocaine, relationships, cocaine people. They just get to that fucking point, that Goodfellas point. Like when that fucking chick throws the, the basket at Ray Liotta that she's cooking the coke for him and she throws the basket as [inaudible] mad at him. They always get to that.

Speaker 6:          02:04:27       I was, um, I was just telling him about this, that I had this, one of, one of the first girls I dated was in Asheville, North Carolina, and I met her and this little, because she was sitting at, they just done cocaine and she was sitting next to this blonde girl and the blonde girls like all coked up and she's like, we're gonna run this town. They can, small mouth run Asheville. It's like 600 population. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah. But that's what it does. Asheville supposed to be really cool. It's the coolest city ever. It really is. And it keeps getting cooler and cooler and cooler. I haven't know. Every time I go back there, it's just gotten more interesting and more subversive and really, yeah, it's a really cool place. We should do comedy there. Are you and me? I'd love it. Yeah. Yeah. There's a club up there.

Speaker 6:          02:05:19       Okay. Talk in trust. So we're going on the road. All right. You got to go do it. That'd be good. That'd be good one for you too. You're, you're acting so fucking weird. It'll fit right in with those hippies. Oh, there. I mean, it's not hippies. It's an arc is up there. It's everybody. It's every, it's just a way, it's a mix of like, I don't know how to enter because you're talking about, I believe there's a lot of uh, environmental Liberation Front type people in there, but I'm not, I'm not positive about that. So people who live in Azure, I don't know, easy

Speaker 9:          02:05:43       bags. The problem with the, you know, the really radical organizations, like almost all of it, even though change does need to occur at the very top, like if you get to the top of pita and you find out fucking none of these guys are. Yeah. You know, you get to the top of any of these, like major, like what does that Animal Liberation Organization? Yes, it is. Well, it's the people who wet the animals free. There's a lot of people that don't even think that animals should be pets that they did all, all animals should be free to go where they want that you shouldn't be keeping them locked up in cages and yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:06:12       Yeah, yeah. There's some, there's some, yeah, that's great animals. Just run her dogs running around fucking everywhere. Oh my Chihuahua Mayor Qd. She shouldn't be a, yeah, that would be cool though. You get like a new dog every day, which is kind of dog I'm going to hang out with today. Oh, there's a golden retriever. Hey doggy, come over. Yeah, fair. What stood

Speaker 9:          02:06:30       out here where I live, because there's a lot of coyotes. I see coyotes all the time, which is a really strange thing. It's like the cousin to a dog. Like a dog didn't quite make it, you know, and to the group got cast them the outside of man and now it just follows around and man encroaches on its territory. So it comes in and eats cats and shit every now and then. Dogs, cats, dogs, man. There's a story. When I used to go to this, a pet store near my house, there was a guy who used to work there that train dogs and he had this dog that he worked as a veterinarian assistant. This dog got brought into him, uh, that was just covered in fucking cuts. It was horrendous. They had to put the dog under and it was, it was uh, a big pit bull, like a 90 pound pit bull.

Speaker 9:          02:07:11       And they were like, what did this to this dog? Like he wants to gotten a big dog fight with a bunch of dogs. Like this dog is like covered with hundreds and hundreds of wounds. Okay. Like they then hours of stitches, who knows how many. So they, they take the dog and they stitch them up, they put them in the veterinarian's hospital and they go back to the scene of the crime to figure out what the fuck happened. And they follow like a trail of blood and like some, they see some scuffle the woods. So they go and figure out what the fuck happened. And there they find nine dead coyotes. And what what they do is one coyote will come out and they'll show themselves and then the dog will see that and bark at it and the coyote will look like he's going to run and the dog will have instincts to chase and the coyote will run and a dog will chase after him.

Speaker 9:          02:07:55       And as he chases after him, then they ambush him with the rest of the pack. So they ambushed his pit bull and it killed nine coyotes. Christ. Could you imagine the look on the coyotes faces when this fucking thing is coming? I can't tell. Are we ever going to fuck him up? Mikey looking can fuck them up. This is a pitch. You want some person who wants a coyote and then they see this big giant fucking fire hydrant head muscles for crushing things built into its fucking skull. The skull of a, a big male, pitbull. Brian, what are you doing? Turn the volume back up the vines and then through the headphone vine. What happened? I haven't changed a thing. You just did something? No, my volume just jacked. Oh, you're just adjusted something. I was turned down in the headphone fine. Okay. All right. Point. It didn't affect that podcast point is that the, you know, dog tried to kill coyotes. Coyotes tried to kill the dog.

Speaker 1:          02:08:55       Man. That's, that's a, that's a stupid fucking Kiowa. It's like, here's what you do, Roger. You're going to see a Chihuahua. Maybe

Speaker 9:          02:09:04       they just think dogs, man, they think dogs are soft. But you know what? Pitfalls are not regular dogs. Those things are engineered first of all, to fight through pain, to not worry about their own instincts. They were the ones that worry about their own instincts. They don't let breed. When the dogs quit, when the dogs give up, they realize this other dog superior. They never let that dog breed. And a lot of times they kill them. You know, it's pretty fucked up. But what it makes at the end of the day is this crazy fucking monster animal that will do anything. You know the pit bulls are like, that is the one

Speaker 1:          02:09:34       last dog you want. Come on after you man. No Shit. And like there's a guy in our neighborhood walks his fucking pit bull off leash. He told me about that. It's awful. It's like most of them are great and people are getting, you know, a lot of people get scared. My dogs great. Yes, most of them are great, but you have to recognize the potential for destruction. If you've got a nutty one, donate their brains also swell. No, that's fine. That's bullshit. Bullshit. No, no. That's all silliness. Ah, they're, they're fucking crazy dogs. They are sweet though. Anytime I've been around someone's pitfall, it's the sweetest dog ever. I've never, everyone always says no. It's the sweetest dog ever. It's not like all of them. And then it just takes one bad day and then it's like, okay. It's crazy. Like they're nuts, man. I've had a bunch of them, three of them, four of them. One of them got this temper and the other ones there was all fighting. They fight, they, they get mad at each other. And you know, if you have, you know, more than one, they get together sometimes and they just settle arguments and one of them doesn't want to back down. Next thing you know, you've got a dead dog. And these dogs loved each other and live together all the time. He used to lick each other and play together. We wanted to

Speaker 9:          02:10:33       kill each other. Huh? Yeah. It's horrible. But this just, that's what it is, man. It's just what it is. And now they're, they're engineered to fight. You know, and that's the problem. They're, they're engineered to not have like normal Alpha Beta interactions where, you know, the Beta gives up in the Alpha dominates them and leaves them alone. No, they fight to the death. All right? They just go after it. You know, sometimes I'd come home and it'd be all bloody. So they worked it out. You know? I'm like, well, I'm glad you're assholes. Work this out. You know? And I would just assume it probably never happen again. Yeah, of course it would rouse. Yeah. Well, it's, you know, it's, it's a fucking scary thing when you think about what a dog really is because a dog has just some fucking animal that could kill you that you control. You know, you got a dog like that dog that can kill nine type nine coyotes. What a fantastic scene that must've been coming up on that scene. Just oh carnage. Just coyote guts and coyote faces jaws half hanging off, you know? I mean, think about what that thing must've done to those coyotes and they just bite at, I'm Taryn skin and he's not even paying attention. He's just jacking the next one

Speaker 5:          02:11:36       rage of frosting. Great. It's probably hard, man. I had this really spooky fucking thing happened in my neighborhood where I was walking my dog and this Weirdo came up to me and he's like, you should be careful with your tires like high, oh, he's in his name right there and killing animals. And it was like an eye. You didn't need to tell me that. Like I understand it was just this weird gaunt guy. And I started thinking like, was that a serial killer? I just run into a serial killer is like,

Speaker 9:          02:12:04       maybe it's just a nice guy. I want you to look out for your dog.

Speaker 5:          02:12:06       No, cause he said, he like says, you know, I've got, was he whispering this into your ear? Yeah, he said we got a problem. Yeah. He kind of pointed at things like, you know, I've got problems but our coyote attacks lately. And you know, like when you're around somebody you kind of get the sense as a bad person like you is it, it was something that, something else that's wrong with it. And then I remember walking up the street a ways and there was just like, uh, I limb of an animal. I don't know if it was a rabbit or what the fuck it was, but some limb that he gotten chopped off. So I guess he's right. I don't know if that name,

Speaker 9:          02:12:39       maybe he did it. What limb? Like a dog's limb. Yeah. It was like a foot of a dog. Yeah. I think it was a dog. Yeah. Do this. No joke, man. Coyote snatch right off leashes. Yeah, in Brentwood. A friend of mine was living in Brentwood. He was walking his dog and the coyote came and took it right off his fucking leash and ran with it. Ah, that's just snatched. It came by and snatched it and ran away. Was Dog screaming and Yiping, ah, it's out of his hands and he's running after it and you can't do a God damn thing about it. Instead, when my dog was a puppy, actually was worried about, I said there was a lot of falcons that were just hanging out in front of my thing and they would like come down real close. I'm like, okay, some hawks come inside now I think don't even live in this country.

Speaker 9:          02:13:16       Do they found thousands? I don't know. To America, what am I talking? I don't know. I think so. Either way. Birds of prey. Were you the one that posted that thing of the giant Eagle? They didn't kill the animal, but pushes it off a cliff and then goes down and eat. Yeah, they grabbed goats and dragged him off the side of the cliff and drop them. Awesome. Too Sane Dude. Eagles are ruthless mother fuckers, dude. They're so scary. The idea of made it's a flying dinosaur. That's really what it is. I mean, they have the same mentality that a dinosaur would have, right? I mean, when they say that birds, they say that birds are the descendants of dinosaurs, right? Whatever survived the big Yucatan meteor impact, asteroid impact, whatever survived, whatever, you know, animal dinosaur species, they eventually evolved into birds. That's the theory, right, isn't it?

Speaker 9:          02:14:02       Yep. So that's the theory. Chickens grow things every once in awhile, right? Chickens do. Yeah. Yeah. And so if that's the theory, then you got to think that the really ruthless ones that we have today, you know, like eagles and shit like that. They were probably some nasty ass fucking flying little dinosaur reptile thing that made it, you know, live through the holocaust of some gigantic chunk of iron and rock slamming into the earth at 45,000 miles an hour. These ruthless little concert lived and became eagles. They weren't the only ones. What a fucked up way to kill things too. They fly out of the sky, they're like dragons man. They look like Dev Dragon clause and shit. They don't spit out fire, but that you take away all the feathers and shit. If they didn't have feathers and you looked at them for what they wore underneath that, all that pretty, you know, soft exterior of the feathers.

Speaker 9:          02:14:57       That's a nasty, scaly, you know, gray looking lizard thing that flies. That's what it is. I mean we think of them as being soft and almost be a million. You know what I'm saying? Those are lizard things. Those aren't like, like, like any fucking mammal. That's a creepy alien looking lizard thing with dead eyes. Those eyes don't give a fuck about you. And they come swooping out of the sky to snatch fish out of the water and fly with them and pull eagles or pull polo rather, um, uh, goats off the side of a fucking cliff and drop them. Just ruthless cons. They're like a little fucking devil's little flying demons. I the Noble Eagle. I take offense at you disparaging or Ruth Colker who could shed his grace on thee. Just evil flying lizard, snatches fucking shit out of sky and eats babies. They'd probably babies. I bet there's definitely been a baby that got snapped up by an eagle course.

Speaker 9:          02:16:01       There's a fucking cool video in, um, Alaska. These people are in their yard and they have this yard that's all this grass in it and they throw out some fish like, you know, the, after they made filets, I throw it like heads and all sorts of extra fish that they have. And these eagles come out and they're all eating in their yard and they've gotten like fucking, I don't know, 2030 bald eagles eating the salmon in their yards. Like, Whoa, like this is nuts man. These crazy fucking demons with pretty feathers. That'd be cool. Get really stoned and watch an eagle feast. Go on your backyard. Would, you know, seeing any natural, any animal in its natural habitat must be fucking incredible. You know, like you run into a bear if you actually did run into a bear. I mean I ran into a bear at Yellowstone, but it didn't feel like it was a natural environment because they were coming up to cars and it was obvious that these bears had been coming up to college before.

Speaker 9:          02:16:58       So it almost like felt like the zoo, it didn't feel real and they would tell you not to feed them, but people were still feeding them. They were like open their window of crack. This is like the seventies. I did this when I was a little kid, you know, and I remember thinking like, this is just like the zoo. Like this isn't until we went to sleep, we were in our sleeping bag and a, we were camping and it was me and I think it was just me and my stepdad. No, no, it was a whole family. So we're camping in Yellowstone and um, I slept through the whole thing, but apparently they heard some banging around and shit. And we got up there in the morning and the cooler had been torn open and all the food had been eaten and there was paw prints all over the car.

Speaker 9:          02:17:35       So there's bear was just feet away, just feet away from us sleeping and signed some little Baggie. We're basically like a little dinner in a Baggie. The whole family's in this baggy, but these bears are so conditioned to being around wasteful humans and sloppy humans that they just look for food that way. Right? They're conditioned to go look in your cooler. That's where the food is. It's not like let's start eating people. But if they did, they'd be like, Holy Shit, this is way better though in the bag. They can't even get out of the bag. You just start eating them. You just jump in and start eating. They can't get away, you know? I mean they, they could do that. They were right outside our door. Rip and shit apart. So strong they could tear apart a cooler, rip it open. Sto stomped all over the car.

Speaker 9:          02:18:14       Big Ass paw prints. That's, to me, that's like one that really is a shitty death is getting, I mean, I like, it's obvious to say, but compared to other deaths, getting killed by an animal. Yeah. How about the guy that just got killed by a goat? What is that? I didn't, I saw the link, but I didn't click on it. What is that? Goat jabbed him in the leg and it penetrated one of his arteries and he bled out. That's bad luck. Goat apparently was super aggressive. He had, they'd had problems with this go before and they, uh, had done things to try to condition the goat, stay away from people. So they would go near the goat and shoot it with like a beanbag gun and shit. And that made the go even more douchey. Cause don't go through stubbornness. Fuck goats. Don't learn what they should've done a shot at with a gun.

Speaker 9:          02:18:56       That's what they should've done. You've got to go. That's continued. Wants to Jack People. Yeah. Let's just kill this fucking goat. All right. There's plenty of other goats. Why we? Why are we taking chances? Job Goshen. Go shoot the goat with a bullying. Go bully the goat so that the goat is scared of people. What is this? A petting zoo. It's the mountains. Oh, it was in the mountain? Yeah, it's in the mountains. So guys in the bands and goat comes up and just fucking goes after him, gets him in the leg, the is fucked. And then the goat won't let people take away the body to go standing over him while he's moaning. You know, he's hasn't died yet. So he's lying on his ground and they can't the go to waste so they can

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       save the guy. Go. I know. I mean goats aren't that small. Goats. Goats goat though. Say that, bro. Go fuck you up. Hey Man, what's a wild don't a lot of goats. You haven't been around a wild mountain. Mountain Mountain. Go to scary dude. Those things are strong as fuck. You ever see how they can climb up the side of mountains? They climb on mountains. I mean like this, like this incredible pitch. It's like a fucking 60 degree angle there. Climbing straight up a mountain. You're like, how the fuck are they doing this? That's the height of absurdity. Like if you think about as that man was laying there, going into shock and contemplating his whole life situation, going from being, you know, then like, oh look, oh my God, Mary, look, it's a goat. Oh eight the goats coming. Oh Jesus fucking Christ. Oh my God, I'm bleeding.

Speaker 1:          02:20:14       I get in a week. What did I just get killed by? Go get killed by go my Dick and run. Yeah. That's so absurd to think about that. That's very strange. How long in all of human history, how many humans had been killed by goat? Probably like, it's probably pretty small. It's small. The biggest thing in this country for farm animals, pigs, pigs kill more people than any other farm animal. Have you seen Jackass Three d yet? No, but apparently what happens with pigs is they'll eat anything. And if you, if you're feeding pigs and you fall into the the police side, they just start jacking you. Yet there's my, my um, my parents have a place, uh, on this like little island off the coast of Georgia that's got wild pigs and those things will kill you. Like they're dangerous. Wild pigs especially cause they always have babies.

Speaker 1:          02:21:02       And if you get, it's the same thing. If you get around their babies, they'll, they've got tusks, they'll bite you in. They're, they're filthy. So the vital get infected. Even their pigs are dangerous. Very ruthless. Feral pigs are scary because feral pigs change, you know the story that if you get like a pink pig that's in a, you know, in a farm and it's kept well and fed well, they have a certain appearance to them. Well when they get loose within three weeks, their body starts to change. It's a very strange phenomena. The idea of a farm animal is like an embryonic stage and all it has to do is think that it has to fend for itself. Yeah. And then it becomes this different thing. It's like some new chemical gets released and it's for becomes thick and Harry like thick and like darker and then its tusks grow.

Speaker 1:          02:21:47       It changed, literally changes the animal. It's a fascinating metamorphosis. Yeah. And it happens within three weeks. Within three weeks of the animal becoming feral, they just get loose and then they start morphing fucking nutty shit. That's Nutty, nutty shit. Like what's happening there? What's that saying about people, you know, are we not reaching our full potential because we get our food from a supermarket and you know, are we are, you know what I'm saying? [inaudible] we set up that way. That's a great like weird Saifai idea, which is like a space ship finally makes it out of the Earth's gravitational field and get to a certain distance away from Earth. And the people on the spaceship start changing like their body

Speaker 8:          02:22:26       start elongating the aliens. Oh my God. The more they more for like the pigs. Yeah, look, if you go into space, that's the next stage. Yeah. That's the next stage. It's like, uh, the like the aquatic worm jumping into the pawn to give spaces. The next stage we're just like, we're here. We're just like squashed aliens. Like the gravity squashed his dad when we get off the plan and you know, there's certain salamanders that never reached adulthood unless exert certain environmental conditions are in place. Like weather conditions are like temperature, moisture, you know, certain conditions have to be in place otherwise they stay in the immature phase their entire life. How fascinating would that be if that's what the thing with humans is, is once you get off the earth, once you go into space, then the different gravity and environment of space allows your body to knock out of the human shell and become this next thing. Third, I start secreted already know that, right? Because the people in the space be smart as fuck. People that got back from the space station will be dropping science on far enough. People in the space station, they're still on the gravitational what? [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          02:23:35       there's a lot of what ifs. Every week, man. I blamed the weed would if, man, if we go to space, we turned into a frog and then you smoke yourself with the front, wants to suck my Dick shot that up. Chips seem pretty happy.

Speaker 9:          02:23:49       So it was on this flight to London and Melanie Griffith was on the flight and uh, Melanie Griffith is a very nice lady. She seems very sweet. Like she smiles at everybody. She's like, she seems nice. And uh, I was thinking, man, this is Melanie Griffin. Like, you know, I remember her old school from like the 80s, you know, some of those movies that she was in. You know, I remember when she played, I mean, even recently when she played. Um, and uh, the thing about the guy who, uh, William Randolph Hearst, what was the movie about? Was it called? It was about him. It was about the constraint. The making of Rosebud or the making of a citizen Kane. It was, Orson Welles was in it and it was all about how crazy we ran our first wasn't she played his wife. I'm like, she's like, so it's a good actor, you know, a an actress.

Speaker 9:          02:24:32       So anyway, she's, she's on this plane and I ate a cookie like, um, two hours before the flight. I figured like I'll eat it in the car over there and then right when I get on board it'll kick in and it was way too strong. Why would you get that? It was so strong, dude. It was so strong. I was breaking down my entire life. I was thinking about everything I've ever done, every every negative thing that I've ever done, every positive thing that I've ever done. And then I started thinking about the possibility of endless universes. The possibility of every single choice leads you into another parallel universe that you don't even feel the distance, you don't even feel the difference in the, in the switch over. I started thinking all this crazy shit and I started thinking about mortality. I started thinking about energy and life and I was just couldn't, I couldn't function. I was curled up in the fetal position. I was so, I was so adrift. I was so high that I seriously considered pissing my pants really, because I had to go, I had to pee, but I didn't want to get up. So I thought I'll just pissed my pants.

Speaker 8:          02:25:31       I had, I thought that that was a real consideration for a whole second, for a whole second. I was like, I found a solution. I was going through my possibilities.

Speaker 9:          02:25:39       I wanna, I wanna pee. Okay. I don't want to get up. What are the options? So I'll just piss myself though

Speaker 8:          02:25:45       knew I had to pee. But my brain was like, that's all that my brain was like, that's all well and good, but you see you can't get up. There's no way you can get up. We need to stay in this spot. Yeah. So I got up

Speaker 9:          02:25:55       and then I, I peed. And then I thought about like how ridiculous it is that I even thought about that. So I'm sitting in this bathroom, you know, looking out this little round window at, you know, it's turning dark now and I'm seeing fucking street lights and shit and I'm 30,000 feet up and I'm fucking flying. Dude. I'm gone. I am a wash in a river of information and it's flowing by so quick. I can't grab any of it and I have to pay attention to what I'm doing because I'm on Whitewater rapids. And um, if I don't pay attention, I'm going to hit a rock of consciousness that I might never recover from. You know what I'm saying? Like I gotta keep it together. That's how high I am. So I go back to my seat and I lied down again back in the fetal position after I'm done.

Speaker 9:          02:26:34       Peon. And, um, the seats are all staggered. Like they're not in a straight line. You know, it's not like everybody's head is at the same place. Everybody's feed her in the same place. Well, four hours into the flight, everybody starts to go to sleep. I'm so high I can't do anything. I'm just laying there just hoping this is just gonna eventually come back to normal. And I don't have to think like this for the rest of my life cause I'm not gonna be able to enjoy anything because I'm going to overthink everything. And so as I'm thinking this, I look over and I noticed that this guy is sitting in this one seat right here and he's this big fat guy and right where his ass is directly across the aisle is Melanie Griffiths

Speaker 8:          02:27:11       head three feet away is three feet away and this guy is sleeping okay. And Melanie Griffith is sleeping. This guy doesn't even have a

Speaker 9:          02:27:20       a blanket on. Okay. And I got my headphones on. Okay. And listen to some music. I'm trying to writing on the computer and this guy, oh,

Speaker 8:          02:27:28       his ass. I mean opens his ass on Melanie Griffiths head. Her head was right across the aisle. It was only three feet away. He just shit in her head. He was, there was no blanket to contain the blast radius. It was just she wake up, dude, she didn't say nothing. No one said nothing. There's no way. She didn't know what happened. There's no way. I don't know if she realizes this guy just shit in her head because she was facing the other direction. She just probably like, oh my God, someone's disgusting. But she has no idea that really she just got shat upon. That is awesome too at this guy is not even wearing fucking a blanket man. He's just got his sweaty dress slacks and it's just a poorly maintained lid to a biological sewer that's not very well maintained either. And this guy

Speaker 9:          02:28:22       probably had all kinds of fucked up food and you know, just burgers and shit. He's fat man. He's got this big fat face and he just just fucking unloads. It was horrible man. It was horrible. And you know it was him because he's the fat guy in this. No one gets discriminated more than fat guys. When somebody farted, you know, black people get blamed when shit gets stolen. And Chinese people when they're in a car accident, they get blamed. Nobody gets blamed more than if somebody farted. And as a fat guy, that's just immediately, even though we all know some very skinny people there have some horrible fucking gas. It doesn't matter. I'll get a fact. Yeah, the fact guy's gotta be worse. He Shit right in million Griffith his head. Did she move around or when moved? He did though. He moved. He adjusted after he farted, he moved into Charleston.

Speaker 9:          02:29:14       I was like, you motherfucker. Like I saw him move. So I knew he was conscious while it all happened, but you know, his back was turned. So he's pretending that nothing was real. You know, he was turned into a seat. So he was like, you know, facing a little wall so he could just pretend nothing. I'm going to open up on purpose. Dude. He opened up. He didn't like the feeling he farted a vengeance. No, but it would be funny if he did. Imagine if they set it up this way. Imagine if it was like the guy came out to Melanie Griffith agent. It's like, I have $1 billion I made in the software industry and I have, but one wish I want to fart on Melanie Griffith. He had this idea and he, they were like, well, you know, first of all, we're going to, you know, even to bring it to Melanie's desk, um, we're gonna, we're gonna need to talk numbers because guys like $5 million, I'm willing to pay $5 billion to Fart.

Speaker 9:          02:30:04       And Melanie Griffiths face. It's the role of her lifetime and so no, no, no. Let's say they had to figure out how are we going to do this? Okay. Melanie is not gonna agree to just let you fart in your face. Man. This is just, this is not going to work this way. What we needed to do is get you guys both on an airplane. That's the only way you're going to be about three feet from her head. I mean you can't be fighting right on her head but are going to be three feet away and we'll seed it so that your ass lines up with her face and you get to far down there and take it from there. Maybe hurt her agent, did the whole thing. He's taken all the money. He said it all up. Maybe always for this guys wish maybe she has a super sophisticated enemy and that's all he's been doing her whole life is paying guys to [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          02:30:46       did on an old woman at Starbucks a couple of weeks ago. It was one of the greatest things ever. She was right behind. You are totally right behind me. It was one of those where I was just going to do a little quick. I thought it was going to be quiet. Nice one, but he's just like super, super loud and powerful. Loud. Yeah, it was super loud and powerful and very embarrassing and I remember looking at her, I kind of like looked back like like 10 seconds later, just kind of when we did a little look back to see what was going on and she did not seem like mad. She looked kind of concerned, like almost like meet with. Was that me? No, her face look so confused to exactly. I thought it was going.

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       That's awful. She thought she shit herself. That must be the worst feeling ever. When you're incontinent and just walking around, your body doesn't contain it's bowels anymore and your urine leaks out and like, oh God. Yeah, it's pretty gross when these things start melting down, man. You know it's funny up, kids don't give a shit if you watch him pee. They don't feel bad about peeing and pooping and everything like that. It doesn't, it's not like there's no shame in it. And so, uh, my daughter is learning how to potty train, so she's getting out of the diaper stage, but occasionally she just makes a mistake. And so, uh, she's sitting in her, her high chair and she has to pee. She thinks about it while she was, I'm just kind of just pissed. It's just like an agreeable amount of p is dripping off the high chair.

Speaker 1:          02:31:59       It's on the ground. And she's like, what happened? She goes, I peed. You know, like, it's not bothering her. I go, why didn't you tell me you have to go? She goes, I forgot. I'm like, oh, okay. That's the basis of Freud and psychology is the way your parents handled you're yourself. Exactly. So I go, okay. I go, well, next time that happens, maybe we should, uh, make sure before you go into a high chair, you use the potty. She was like, okay. Probably. She says shit like that. That's how I saw it. Yeah, no, yeah, yeah. And there's a lot of maybes. Yeah. Maybe like maybe we can get ice cream. You know, it was like there's a lot of like trying to steer the conversation a certain way. Very manipulative it too. That's awesome. Have you taken the a I'm sitting on my toilet photo for her so she can use it and in her Facebook and 15 years, no, I'm not gonna allow her to have Facebook.

Speaker 1:          02:32:50       How many, how many terabytes of photographs of kids sitting on toilets are on Facebook? Like two, two or three. That's such a, that's the thing that kills single people. I have one of you will have babies in our mind. I have one of me holding Glamour magazine sitting on the toilet naked. Really? Glamour magazine. Is there any more overused premise than the woman's magazine? Do they have a story left to tell? I mean, is there a new sex trick to keeping your man how to keep your ups a passion in the bedroom? I mean who has exhausted a genre more than like cosmo? Men's magazines always have a new way to get a six pack. That's true. Every third men's magazine or second men every every other month. It's like new way to day. The six pack of a marine. Yeah. There's something very homoerotic about those bodybuilding magazines. There's something very homoerotic about the admiration of a man's physique. You know, looking at this guy, motherfuckers get the best thighs or something, but we'll get the striations in the the ass and then the Lula back with the Christmas tree in the lower back. The striations are incredible. I mean, he did still a tremendous job. Tremendous job. And uh, you know, and cutting the Waldo out so he could really shoot a muscle. I mean, it's so very beautiful, beautiful sculpture he made his body into why not your SCO suck his Dick Buddy. You

Speaker 9:          02:34:17       know what I'm saying? Like there's something weird about it, but on the other hand it's like, I recognize your, your desire to have a insane body. Like why not go do it if that's what you're into and you get oohs and ahs out of it and people think you're special because of it. I totally, yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:34:30       Was the difference between wanting to have an insane body and then like talking about a Christmas tree on someone's back a term. I never heard mine. There was a dude

Speaker 9:          02:34:38       who used to be a huge bodybuilding fan. This is back when I lived in Boston. He was one of my students when I was teaching martial arts. He was a huge bodybuilding fan, but he was fat. I never understood it. The dude was like, seriously fat. And I was like, well, I guess he was really fat at one point. And then he got into bodybuilding and then he started slowly losing weight because you, he wanted to have a physique like that. So, but he never lost any weight. I just like, was it just a fat guy? I always talk about Bible. You see the latest thing. And Lee Haney is incredible. I don't know who those though. You know, I think it was a, who was it? The WHO's the Mr Olympia back in that day. I really have no idea but this. But he was, and I was like, how come?

Speaker 9:          02:35:14       You know, I mean, are you into bodybuilding? Like do you body build yourself? And he's like, well, I did, you know, I lift a little weights, I lift. I just tried to keep in shape, but I'm just, I just admire what they do and I'm like, whoa. Okay. There's something weird about that. Some weird about you fixating on other dudes bias. You're a fan of what they're doing to their bodies, but you don't even do anything to your own. Like you just like to stare at their improvement. Our core, I'll look, it isn't back. That is a hilarious character. His back's incredible. Yeah, it is hilarious character, right? Like a guy who's not gay at all, but he's just like super into like really, really into men's body development.

Speaker 6:          02:35:50       Like you go out, you go to his office and it's just got like framed pictures of muscular guys and he's just like, I respect their work. Yeah. Come here. Let me show you something Joe. Look at our Christmas tree. Yeah, that's a terrible term I've never heard. Yeah, they call it the lower back. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          02:36:06       Yeah. This, this guy, this guy told me the Christmas tree, this guy back, one of my students was like Scott, that Christmas tree and as low.

Speaker 6:          02:36:12       Yeah. Christmas tree and a lot of presence under that. Put a little bit of snow on that tree. [inaudible] the snowman. Where's that present on the ditch? Yeah. It always helps to go to some gay place folks. Yeah. We are very immature. Very, very no watches it. I got to say, God have a little immature with farting met Melanie Griffith Hack. Is that where I went wrong? Yeah. You blame me and it really happened, man. Nobody but shit. What I like, what I like is it was preceded by, it looks like you were like on the verge of like figuring out one of the biggest things ever and it you ended up in a catatonic state and got to see you. One of the funniest things of all times. Yeah. No Shit. Right. That's a very funny moment to get to witness. I mean that that may be only happened once.

Speaker 9:          02:37:04       Yup.

Speaker 6:          02:37:05       People aren't always farting. I'm Melanie Griffith. His heads probably more likely that you'd been abducted by an alien. Then you get yourself into a position where you could fight a Melanie Griffiths head. Yeah. Operation. You saw

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       the final phase of operation. Would you rather fart on Melanie Griffin's head or Angela Landsbury. I wouldn't want to fall on any one of their heads. Angela, all the way [inaudible] I'd make her wear a little bit of makeup. I put the blood on people's heads. That's just rude. Fucked that girl. Who was Angela Lansbury murder she wrote here. Can you where you have a problem? I just want to see what these pucker up. What is it that we want to see? Like little old ladies kicking ass. Could you imagine if Angela Lansbury like would beat dudes up occasionally. Like they try to get her from calling nine one one in the fall and she kicks him in the balls and he carries it. Yeah. Like if there was like a female seniors MMA, whoa. That would make a lot of money. Oh my God. Could you imagine ladies, old ladies beating the fuck out of each other? And occasionally they would die bravely in the ring. Like she died for our freedom and they would show just the sound of hips breaking ACL is just snapping like carrots. They ensured grow wild haymaker and their foot falls off.

Speaker 1:          02:38:23       Oh God, that'd be so sad to watch. Just concern grandchildren weeping in this dance. Isn't there a video online? I didn't watch it but somebody put it up to old ladies got into a fight. Somebody throw up on Twitter. I know you folks know who know what it is. It was on the rogue and board. I'm pretty sure I didn't watch it, but I saw the opening frame and it was like one old lady was down and the other old lady was up and I was like, I don't need to see anymore. I need to see these old ladies beating the shit out of interesting old lady porn. Like really old lady porn. Yes. I've seen some very disturbing because that one old lady, this one old lady I showed it looked like she was like maybe Alzheimer's, like they found her like she, she didn't seem like she knew it was Jesus.

Speaker 1:          02:39:05       It was really bad. There's a dark one I want. The first one I ever watched was Ron Jeremy. He was like the first one to do it. I think it was him banging this really old lady and she was like, oh, it's so lovely to feel so good. I was watching it and she was just like, just wretched old creature. I was like, oh my God puts these look fine. Kind of still though. Like they look like they don't look as old as their faces. I don't see that much sunlight. Don't you think it's a charitable thing to do though? The face is getting lit up by sunlight all the time, man. You have to realize how bad that is for people don't realize how bad it is for you until you look at the rest of your body. How much is your face deteriorating like?

Speaker 1:          02:39:44       Well this is much more wrinkles in my face, in any other part of my body. You know it's because my face is in sun all the time. Your son's coming off your windshield, you're out there in the sun. The aging process is accelerated by the sun for sure. Huh? You know like your armpits and everything when you aren't pits get wrinkled, your faces jacked as fuck. You know, when you are pit start giving out, you know, and all that shit starts to sag and wrinkle, that means your face looks like ass son. You know these poor old ladies man, these poor ladies,

Speaker 6:          02:40:14       a dark moment for a woman. You know, when especially a really super attractive woman who's kind of banked her personal self esteem on being attractive, that's gotta be the worst feeling in the world, man. Yeah, you mean the Lady Universal Justice crushing in on you. Do you justice as a justice? Because anytime you are an idolater, anytime you base your, they'll shout, not build the house on sand. Don't, don't, don't structure your whole life. And it's an easy thing to do. And you know, I get it and I understand how easy it would be to slip into depending on your looks and all that stuff. But it's like if you are really intelligent, you would have developed some facet of yourself that wasn't based on that. Yeah, yeah. I know what you mean. Yeah, I guess. But it's, that's easy to say. Most people live their lives without a rule book or a guide book.

Speaker 6:          02:41:00       And they really don't know what the fuck they're doing. There's a lot of good people that wind up and shit lives cause they just never were told how to live and they made a series of mistakes and they fell into the wave of the momentum, those mistakes. And now here they are. I'll fucked, fucked by circumstance. Being born a fuckup neighborhood did some fucked up parents and fucked up friends. I prefer to believe though that and I think this is where we definitely differ in opinion cause I really believe that no matter what life situation you're in, you can get out of that. No a better place I can. If you go to jail, you can't. If you do something dumb when you're young and you want to go to jail, I think that this areas, even in jail, there are ways that you cannot master certain techniques of getting out of it.

Speaker 6:          02:41:38       There's there's, there's always true, but you will not be you. You will not be surrounded by those. Those techniques. You will not, you will will have to seek them out. It's going to take a very rare effort to really rise and eliminate yourself from the horrible reality of your conditions, your surroundings, violent people, all the different shit that they're doing in there, the gangs, all the bullshit. We're not going to involve in there. It's more difficult. But it's like, I just think is it an almost impossible man? You, it's, I mean, people do it and they get through it and they become better people for it and they learn while they're in there and they really truly reflect on their life and you know, reflecting their mistakes, but much more likely to get sucked into the system. But, um, there's a great book by Viktor Frankl called man's search for meaning, which is a written by a psychologist who was in Auschwitz and was observing the way people were reacting with apps, having their humanity ripped away from them, their clothes ripped off, being naked, covered in lice, uh, randomly getting killed.

Speaker 6:          02:42:36       And um, he like founded an entire style of therapy based on his theory of why some people in these situations survived. Some even flourished in these situations as far as being kind to people around them and why some people died. And the essence of his theory is that, uh, that within the human being, if you can find something to live for, just something, whatever it is, then that will take you through any situation. It'll get you to the other side of any situation. So it's, this book changed my life. It's one of my favorite books. It's fucking incredible. And one thing that he says

Speaker 5:          02:43:12       in there, which is really awesome, as he talks about how he was, uh, being on foot on a forced work march, and he was really weak and he was being, he was on a forced work march and he fell down and one of the soldiers, because he fell down, came and just started beating him, beating with his fucking rifle, get up, get up, get up. And He, um, he had seen this soldier kill people with his technique, just beat him to death with a rifle because they wouldn't get up. And he thought, if I don't get up, I'm going to die. And he thought, well, you know, why should I not die? This is, I'm probably going to die anyway. Why should, why not just let this be the moment that I die? And all of a sudden he imagined himself giving a speech where he was talking about this experience and using this experience to try to transform the world in a positive way, to show people that no matter how fucking horrible the situation is, you can find a way out of it mentally to give you the strength and the will to keep pushing forward.

Speaker 5:          02:44:13       And he got up and he survived and he became like a very famous, um, psychologist and an a philosopher. So it's a good, what was that guy's name again? Victor Franco in the book is man's search for meaning. And it's a brutal book. It's really fucking intense. The description of the death camp and stuff, but it's awesome. And his therapy was called logos therapy. Existential psychotherapy. Wow.

Speaker 9:          02:44:39       I mean, what is the search for meaning? The search remaining is a search to try to find a reason to stay alive. And then if you do try to find a reason to stay alive and succeed and you do look forward to life and put positive energy into it, something's going to come out. But is, is that a meaning? Is that meaning, you know, man's search for meaning? Is that a correct is, is there really a meaning to, to everyone. And if we look at the way the world is going, look at the direction that human beings are, are headed into with the pollution of the world with, you know, this crazy nuclear arms race thing, trying to keep Iran from developing nukes and Israel's got him and all these people go have you look at overpopulation. If you look at the economic crisis, that crisis of of government, you look at all this crazy shit that's going on. Like what are we, we're preserving what, like what are we doing? We're moving it towards what direction, you know, like what, what are we trying to save? What are, what is, what is, what is good about all this?

Speaker 5:          02:45:35       Well, I mean, the thing is like the I, the ego tries to create a lofty reason. Somebody's, you know what I'm saying? Like search for meaning. No, you live and you, but you live and you die. You live under these

Speaker 9:          02:45:46       stances of is slow toxification of the earth and you die. And man's search for meaning. Okay, well you're searching for meaning while all this shit is happening, right?

Speaker 5:          02:45:56       Well, yeah, I mean, you know what I mean? I know exactly what you're saying. And I think he's, he's dealing with that very issue and he, uh, what he says, what he says that he, yeah, he would ask his clients are the people who came to me, he's like,

Speaker 6:          02:46:09       why don't you kill yourself? What's the reason that you're not killing yourself? Why are you deciding to stay alive in the world? Have you explored that? If you ever asked yourself, what's getting me out of bed? What's the reason behind this? And it doesn't have to be some lofty thing. It doesn't have to be, I'm staying alive to cause I wanna you know, I want to become president and bring peace to the world. It can be some very simple thing. It can be your kids, it can be art. It can be cause you like video games. It doesn't have to be some lofty fucking thing. Even though to me some of those ideas would, it was very difficult for me to swallow it. But it's finding that connection to the world, you know, it's finding that right way.

Speaker 9:          02:46:49       What is that all about? What is the meaning of all of it? I mean, that's the thing man. Search for meaning that there's some sort of a meaning to everything.

Speaker 6:          02:46:55       And I think it's an individual. It's like what you said when you're at these,

Speaker 9:          02:46:59       each individual has their own particular meaning. And if they don't hit that frequency and they don't find that path, then they won't

Speaker 6:          02:47:06       be happy. Well, think of it man. Like, you know, like the Times that I've, this sounds really stupid, so go ahead and make fun of me for it. But like, uh, um, I have, uh, uh, a really, uh, amazing girlfriend. I have a really fucking cool shower. I fucking love those entities right now. There have been times in my life where I haven't had things like that. You know, we're having those connections, right? And I've noticed I tend to be more self destructive in those states. Right. You know what I mean? Like I agree. It's like we are, uh, Louis C CK has this really funny joke about how like if you don't have a kid, you know, he's like, I can't die. There are people I have to feed. They're things that I have to take care of. You know, they're like, I like, it adds this whole other d. So it's like finding that thing in your life, you know? And it doesn't have to be an interpersonal relationship. It can be other things, but it's like the idea is find that thing and that thing will be the thing that steers your ship through this turbulent, the inevitable. But

Speaker 9:          02:48:07       take it a step further. What, what is this purpose? What is this, this reason to stay alive, this reason to find this thing, this reason to do your job and stake your position here and have your influence here. What is it, what is it about choosing the correct frequency to you? Whatever it is for you, whether it's pursuing a a career as a professional bowler or a carpenter or a doctor or a writer or whatever the fuck it is for you. What is it about that pole like what, what do you, what is, what is really happening is fulfilling your own personal desires and interests? Is that really just a part of a gigantic equation and then everybody is working and everybody has a certain part and it's, it's, it's not stated. It's not written in stone. There's some room, some wiggle room to go this way and that way, but in order to truly be happy, your, your instincts, your emotions, all these things are guiding you towards a certain direction and that certainly Rick direction might be a part of some huge that is impossible to see.

Speaker 9:          02:49:09       You'd have to get so far high above the human race. You have to separate yourself from your history and your ideas about humans to in order to see it all together and all the see all the fucking different things that are happening all over the world, all together simultaneously and consider the impact of the human race as a whole. It seems like that that's why there's trashman. That's why there's like these jobs. You'd be like a wire people actually doing that. That's crazy. You know? It seems like that is makes complete sense that way. We don't like to think that it makes sense because we'd like to think that we all have our own personal choice. We all have our own identity and we all have our own path that we can choose through this life and you can change when you can become a different person.

Speaker 9:          02:49:47       And I agree with all that I, I'm not saying that it's 100% everything that you do is set in stone, but it seems to me that there is, without a doubt there's a push towards a certain direction and it might not be very exact. It might not be. Everyone gets pushed towards a certain direction. But if you're, you're instincts are to breed, to settle down, to procreate, to possess the coolest material possessions to shy show off for the Jones is to be successful at what you do. What are all those things doing? Well, all those things. They're all pushing innovation. They're all pushing the creation of new technology. They're all pushing the invention of new crazy fucking super things. Yep. It's almost like we don't even realize we are infected by a parasite. The parasite is technology. We're slowly giving birth to it over a period of a couple of decades until it gets to a point where it can take care of itself.

Speaker 9:          02:50:37       And what we're doing is we're carrying it inside of our bodies. We're leaving it, you know, in, in our houses. Everywhere we look we're connected to it. And it is a life form. It is a life for, yeah. We just don't recognize it as a life form because we're looking for something like us. We are looking for something that has cells and give blood and it has blood pumping through it. But if you look at like my old Shitty, I have an old shitty Mac laptop. It's big and fat, like a fucking like a Bible, you know, and it cranks open. It's like it's all rickety and shit. The screen looks like dog shit. It's only a few years old man. It's like 10 years old. You know. That's, that's, that's insane. You know, in 10 years this thing is evolved. Like, like it's like comparing a monkey and comparing a person.

Speaker 9:          02:51:19       But that shit took millions of years. This laptop into a macbook pro that only took 10 that's a 10 years. His big fat, stupid brick and now this thing's awesome. What is that? It's 15 years. 16 years. That's some crazy shit. And, and the thing that it evolved into is using itself as a, as tip make make itself smaller like that you're using each subsequent evolution is accelerating the next phase. Yeah. It's, it's really cool man. Yeah, it's fascinating man. It might be a life form, like literally, literally technology. It might be something that we just, we don't consider it a life for him cause we need to consider life forms as being similar to us in some way. You can kill it. It bleeds, it eats a chits. We, that's the only way we see it. We don't, we don't see this

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       thing that we're making. We're literally creating its brain young. But if you are watching from a far, you'd be like, Oh yeah, those creatures are innovating. Some sort of, I don't know. Sure. If you were an alien intelligence without a doubt. Right? That's immediately what you would say a Terence Mckenna. That what he says is we are extruding psychic objects into the material universe. That's what human beings do. And if you look at the, you know, the cities, it's like coral extrusions of matter coming from our minds like coral reefs and this is all being, this is all moving towards the invention of some super tool. Yes. Yeah. This is moving towards the invention of some new connection to the universe. Some new, you know, we might be giving birth to some organism of some technological organisms. Something that can replicate something that is sentiment, it's aware of itself, and that can make decisions and alters its environment and chooses to replicate itself in a more advanced way.

Speaker 1:          02:53:07       And then that one chooses to replicate itself in a more advanced way. And like literally within a year they could go through 10,000 years of fucking evolution. I mean, they can, they can produce incredible results. You know, if you really get to the point of view, see how quickly took technology and computers have evolved as compared to biology, if they're both life forms, it's not even close as to which one's gonna win. Yeah, the technology ones going, they're getting to, they're going to develop wormholes and portals and we'll just be growing webbed feet because we live near water. You know what I mean? That shit will take a million years before people can hold their breath past five minutes. Right. There's one tribe in New Zealand that can hold their breath for seven minutes. This is an evolutionary advantage. You know, when they talk about like Eskimos have an evolutionary advantage where they could be outside in freezing weather and their hands don't get cold like ours do.

Speaker 1:          02:53:51       Well, your, your hands would get frostbite, you'd be fucked and you might even lose your fingers. They can actually be fine. You know, it's because their body has adapted to that environment. But that shit takes generations. Yeah. You know when that started. Okay. They didn't even have writing. Okay. And the way that that happens, Joe is, is by according to like hardcore evolution as it's random mutation. It's not even as though the necessity caused, the thing that happened is though, like you through the will of necessity that you need to survive in the cold longer, suddenly you get that it's a mutation that happens to some lucky Eskimo. And because he has that mutation, he's a little bit more advanced than he reproduces more on passes that mutation on. And that's how it gets into the gene line, not from an intentionality. So it's even more random than necessity. It's just, you know, when the moth accidentally mutates into the same color of the tree, that math is gonna survive more. The birds can't see it. And that math, is it accidental though? That's, that's the big question. The question. Random mutations being accidental is a very controversial subject. Yes. It's a very controversial theater. Very cause a lot of people believe that things just like Mckenna had this idea that everything. Brian, why do you keep doing that? Because we have three minutes till we have to split up. Apartment has

Speaker 9:          02:55:04       codes. You're going seven, five please. I'm just letting you know because he will have to split this into two podcasts just so it doesn't matter. I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck about two podcasts. Right. What were we talking about?

Speaker 5:          02:55:17       We're talking about whether evolution is some random mutation or whether through the need of the organism itself. Somehow this begins to itch in Munich.

Speaker 9:          02:55:26       Well, the idea that, thanks did, Mckenna had this idea that everything naturally moves towards uh, infinite complex con. Let comp the idea. What was the exact wording? Um, his idea was that everything moves towards complexity. Let like everything from the Big Bang till today from single celled organisms to multi celled organisms, from everything that exists in the whole universe has like an ethic. It has like a rule and that rule moves towards more and more complex things. And that, you know, what it is is that these animals recognize that they're being spotted and somehow or another by them getting jacked over and over again, the universal consciousness recognizes this is unfair. This is kind of a tricky situation. These things are stupid and they stand out. We have to figure out a way to hide them, to keep them in the situation. And so what they do is they impart some sort of an ability to blend in with their environment. Like chameleons are like octopus can, you know, that it's just some sort of a universal intelligence that recognizes there's an imbalance. You know, we need this octopus, but they're too easy to eat. We did. They're getting Jack left and right. Let's figure out a way to keep them around a little bit more. And so they adjust their superpowers. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 5:          02:56:34       Yeah. And, and I find that so I mean that other alternative that just at some point on our, it's like, wait a minute, I can turn any color in the world.

Speaker 9:          02:56:42       Well, and even the idea of random mutation and you know, maybe that is how it goes and maybe the whole thing is programmed by radiation and maybe random mutations are really what causes evolution. But maybe that's the tool that it uses in order to move towards complexity. It's still the, it's moving towards the same thing every time. So to call it just random mutations. It's not like, it seems to be these random mutations are always good. Yeah. They're always an advanced version. They're not that, that they don't, they don't succeed. Yes. They don't succeed. So even though it is, yes, it's very simple. They are random mutations. But look where it's going. It's always going towards more and more complex things. You know, it's fascinating shit man. When you really think about the idea that we're, we're moving towards something and no one's recognizing it and it's all happening all the time. And everything you do every day in your life is really just pushing this thing along in a program towards some predetermined goal,

Speaker 5:          02:57:35       right? Yeah. The thing that you consider to be whatever that, that, whatever it is, it really is part of a bigger picture. And that's a very optimistic way to look at it. And I liked that way of looking at it because the alternative is as them,

Speaker 9:          02:57:48       Ooh, well that's it folks. That's the end. That's the mind. Fuck. That's the mind fuck of life. Is this all just a pattern? Are there patterns upon, are there

Speaker 8:          02:58:02       infinite possibilities for these patterns? Is every single second a choice that you make that pushes you into a parallel universe of a very close distinction, but, but different, was it evolution that farted on her, Ellen Griffin said, was the evolution or a random mutation? We want to thank, uh, the podcast. We want to thank the fleshlight for sponsoring the podcast. If you go to Joe rogan.net of the, uh, put some, put some of that [inaudible] word on cause there's some new shit. What is this? That's like Duran Duran. Talk to the guy, the guy that did the song at the opening at the podcasts singing. Now it's just another song. Who's singing there? Freelance.

Speaker 8:          02:58:47       Yeah. Throws tosome Deann word on you got any in there? Check gut put. I don't need you. Do you got that one? I was listening. I didn't really like it. Well I'm not asking you if you like it. Yes please. The lavender, our lavender, our dotcom was in our podcast. And where do you get it? I, it's on iTunes. It's on iTunes. It's on lavender out. And uh, his Twitter is Duncan Trussell, t r U S. S e l l. And M. Brian's Twitter is red band, r. E. D. B. A. N. Thank you very much for tuning into the podcast. Thanks to the fleshlight. And again, if you go to Joe rogan.net, you can get 15% off and you can fuck it and it's awesome. There you go. It's right there. And it's blue, but it's not avatar. That's an alien. Thanks everybody. And we'll probably be doing another one this week. Um, I'm trying to figure out who going to do it.

Speaker 8:          02:59:40       It might be Brian Cowen, but, uh, thanks very much for all the love. Thank you everybody in England. I had a great fucking time. I'll be at the galaxy theater this Friday night at 8:00 PM with Joey Diaz. It's, no, it's not Anaheim and Santa Ana. Yeah. Did I say that already? Or wind is born. What's that? Where wind is born. Where wind is born. Santa Ana winds. That's where they start. Yup. There you go. Knowledge Vegas at the palms this weekend when Natasha Sheriff from last Comic Standing Vegas out of the palms, the palms, what is this? This is dot Harris the Ding Dong show, October 25th.
