and not only to discover and you
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.990
and not only to discover and you
approach a new technique and I see this

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
approach a new technique and I see this

with brawn and goldstein I can also see

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
with brawn and goldstein I can also see
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.480
