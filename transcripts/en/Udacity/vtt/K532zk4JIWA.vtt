00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.650
David what was your answer?

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.410
&gt;&gt; So this time we're looking at
the origin instead of the destination.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.770
We start at the route and ask,
is the origin north of 5N?

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.802
Just barely it is.

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:10.282
Is it East of 5E?

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:11.512
No, is it east of 3E?

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:12.627
No, is it east of 2E?

00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:14.210
It's really not east of anything.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.890
So the case we retrieve
is going to be Y.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.900
&gt;&gt; Thatâ€™s right David.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.070
Y is the closest matching
case to the new problem.
