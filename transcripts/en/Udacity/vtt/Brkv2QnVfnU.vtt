To edit your Piazza profile, click the
gear, then click Account Email Settings.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.280
Here, you'll be able to change your name
as it appears when you post on Piazza,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.060
as well as your preferred email
address and profile picture.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.080
&gt;&gt; One thing we highly advise
is setting a profile picture.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.410
It doesn't have to be an actual photo of
you if you aren't comfortable with that.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.540
But simply having a unique picture
really improves your recognizability

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.961
when you're posting on Piazza.

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:28.967
I can say as an instructor that when I
see a name, sometimes it takes a second

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:32.420
to remember the conversations I've
had with that student in the past.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.490
But when I see a picture, I usually
remember them pretty immediately.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.780
&gt;&gt; Below here, you can change your
email settings for the class.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.970
Piazza can send you a lots of emails,
depending on how you have it set up.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.600
So if you're drowning in Piazza emails,
you can change your settings here.
