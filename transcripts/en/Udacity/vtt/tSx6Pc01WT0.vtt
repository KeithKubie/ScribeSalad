00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.130
The component marketplace is real and more continue to grow.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.140
This is going to bring customers the benefits of well-defined, tested and

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.870
supported, and documented solutions.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.120
Nevertheless, there are some ongoing concerns that need to be addressed.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.240
How about liability?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.380
When a system that uses a component fails, how is liability apportioned among

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.630
all the vendors that have provided components to it?

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.960
Quality guarantees.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.000
How can cross cutting quality of service requirements be addressed in

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.350
a multiple component environment?

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.010
If the quality of service has to do with performance which of

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.270
the components is responsible for providing the performance guarantees?

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.990
Well all of them.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.650
And the third question to be looked at.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.200
Contract persistent over versions.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.950
What is the white balance between new versions and support for

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.240
incompatible exis, existing features?
