00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.650
The coolest one I've worked on so far. The

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.770
one that I there are several that we've done kind

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.790
of, on the team. But the one that sort of

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.430
seemed most flushed out and seemed kind of have the

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.550
best effect within the company thus far is the

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.660
we made a coaching dashboard for the course managers, to

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.210
kind of assign each student a risk index, which

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.500
related to this, you know, behavior and usage of the site and tries

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.280
to you know, figure out how well they're doing. And also on top

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.450
of that, a sort of urgency index which then tracks sort of changes in risk

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.390
and allows one to in theory kind of group students into trends.
