&gt;&gt;Sandra: Hi everyone my name is Sandra Leung
Li and I'm one of the many volunteers that

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:11.081
help organize the Authors@Google events. So
thank you all for joining us today. Today

00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:16.481
I am very honored to extend a warm welcome
to Alexis Maybank who is the co-founder of

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:22.410
Gilt Groupe. Alexis has dedicated her career
to building and launching innovative and compelling

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.289
e-commerce experiences for consumers.
In 2007, Alexis along with a founding team,

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.260
launched Gilt Groupe. She served as Gilt's
founding CEO and today she serves as the company's

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.620
chief strategy officer. Alexis holds a BS
and an MBA from Harvard University and is

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.899
actively involved in the Robin Hood Foundation.
She currently mentors many emerging entrepreneurs

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.239
in both the technology and fashion sectors.
Along with her fellow co-founder, Alexandra

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.429
Wilkins Wilson, Alexis recently released "By
Invitation Only: How We Built Gilt And Changed

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.929
The Way Millions Shop". Alexis thank you very
much for joining us today.

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.290
[Applause]
Alexis: Thank you for having me. Do we have

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.710
any Gilt members in the audience, or people
familiar with the Gilt model?

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.090
[Laughter]
So I don't have to give too much background

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.920
before you get started. That's good to know.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Yeah, I think we have a lot of customers

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.420
in here, I've seen a lot of the bags and boxes
in the mail room.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.130
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Yes.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Well to start it off, I wanted to

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.329
ask how the book tour is going, I'm sure you've
racked up a lot of frequent flyer miles.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.439
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Yeah and I have actually been doing
a lot of day trips so I think yesterday, excuse

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.700
me last week I was in Dallas for a day and
I was in Austin for a day. And the week before

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.420
that I was in New Orleans and Atlanta. So
it's actually been exciting because I've met

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.079
with thousands and thousands of not just customers
but emerging entrepreneurs. People with ideas

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.880
they want to pursue in all parts of the country
over the past four weeks. And that has been

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.979
so, so exciting. Something I didn't expect
actually as a byproduct of going on a book

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.740
tour. But it's been rewarding and so energizing
at the same time.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.159
&gt;&gt;Sandra: And what is been your favorite city
to visit?

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.670
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Well, I always love coming home
to New York.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.220
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Of course.
&gt;&gt;Alexis: That goes without saying. But it

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.680
was very exciting to see how, something that
was really relegated to Silicon Valley. A

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.360
kind of entrepreneurial buzz and here's what's
happening and dollars flowing to support ideas

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.470
in different areas has come to New York. I
saw that in Atlanta in a major way. Boston

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.950
has always been a bit of an entrepreneurial
hub, but seeing it in Austin and Atlanta as

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.040
strong as it was rooted there was pretty exciting
to see and get more familiar with.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.510
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Alexis: And not as much is happening quite

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.880
in Miami yet. Not as much is happening quite
as much in Chicago although Groupon's done

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.510
quite a bit there. So I've been getting a
greater pulse on entrepreneurial stirrings

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.410
in different cities too.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Got it. So tell us why did you and

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.110
Alexander decide to write the book?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: We found it interesting that as

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.430
we met with customers, as we met with entrepreneurs,
as we met with just people in any kind of

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.370
professional standing how similar the questions
we were getting were. It was how did you find

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.290
capital, how did you find engineering talent,
how did you go about convincing Grandeur,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.850
your first partners, to take a plunge in a
time like 2007? The questions were common

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.370
no matter the walk of life you found the person
in. We actually, it was expected that when

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.570
we met with customers and others they'd want
to know about, is Valentino really that tan

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.920
in person?
[Laughter]

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.880
What are you gonna have in your next Hugo
Boss sale? So we thought those would be the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.730
questions we get most often, nah never. So
it showed to us the common interest that people

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.050
have in pursuing an idea that they are passionate
about. Common interest that they have and

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.930
understanding how to go about it. Because
it's a wish or a dream that many people harbor.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.940
And it's not just viewing it in the form of
a startup but like here in my family business

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.600
here's something I'm thinking about pursuing.
Or in the context of a larger company here's

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.950
something I've been tasked to do and how can
I think about it differently?

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.850
So we took these questions that we would get
asked so often, the kind of common interest

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:38.290
in, and also the story of Gilt as kind of
a fun story in many ways. And we wanted to

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.850
just take a moment to document it and reflect
on our past five years and a situation that's

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:51.320
been one of the fastest-growing businesses
in recent memory. And just documented. You

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.480
know memories get fuzzy quickly, but also
it was a good way for us just to put those

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.280
answers down on paper from our point of view.
You know there's not one right answer, but

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.810
it was our opportunity to just state it, put
it there and relay it to a larger audience.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.280
&gt;&gt;Sandra: The Gilt handbook.
&gt;&gt;Alexis: At least some of our thoughts and

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.840
lessons learned from the past five years in
the trenches.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.460
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Perfect. And how is the actual book
writing process? This is your first book.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.110
&gt;&gt;Alexis: So everyone in this room knows what
the pace of technology is like today right?

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:33.200
We took four months from okay were going to
do this to launching our business. Which is

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.450
even a long time frame now when you look,
then it was ridiculous. Our investors, everyone

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.300
said you're going out way too fast for this
idea. I think maybe slow it down, maybe take

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:49.240
another month and make sure things are perfect.
The pace of innovation today is measured in

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:56.640
sometimes weeks. From idea to launch. And
so when we spoke to the three publishers that

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.860
approached us to do this project, and they
said it would take two years we really almost

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.210
fell, I think both of our mouth fell open
at the same time. You know two years, it took

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.370
us four months to get Gilt up and running.
But it was a two-year project, we ended up

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.690
using every single moment because we had full-time
jobs so it was the Thursday morning we met

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.200
regularly every week and then the weekends
that we would spend working on this. And it

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.630
was just a testament to the different timeline
you see in tech versus publishing, but also

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.240
writing is a bigger endeavor than I would've
thought two years ago.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.340
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Did you and Alexandra split up chapters
or how did it work in terms of collaborating

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.050
it?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: We split up chapters, we would have

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:48.320
brainstorming sessions where we would kind
of record a moment and flesh out down to okay

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.220
well what was the color of the room we were
walking into? We were really trying to flesh

00:06:54.220 --> 00:07:00.130
out our memories in certain instances that
were formative in the Gilt experience. And

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.190
given it's a big challenge tying together
a point of view of two people, we actually

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.930
brought on board an editor to help tie together
the voice and the thought process and to have

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.680
it more of a coherent story.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Well, you mention how Gilt was launched

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.980
in only four months. I wanted to touch on
that more, why did you guys decide to launch

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.150
it so quickly?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: We decided to launch it so quickly

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:34.639
for three main reasons. The first was two
months in there was a European business that

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:40.510
was comparable to Gilt's who all of the sudden
out of left field raised capital at a billion-dollar

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:46.229
valuation. We were like whoa. One, that's
gonna set off the alarm bells in every venture

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:51.480
capital around country. To put money behind
similar ideas so competition is gonna come

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.400
quickly.
Two, our business in face of competition I

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:02.490
think those who are familiar with Gilt or
are familiar with at least e-commerce or you

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:08.180
know how competitive the space is today. Back
then there was no one, but we realized, okay,

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.350
if competition is coming, if there's gonna
probably be VC dollars flowing towards the

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:18.960
idea in many forms, we've got to scale quickly.
And so being out the door quickly and focusing

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.610
on being able to move initially from working
with a partner like a Ralph Lauren and saying,

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.930
okay, we want $100,000 of your product and
trying to get quickly to a stage where we

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:34.430
could say we won $1 million worth of your
product so that we. So that that scale in

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:40.079
terms of size of the business could build
that competitive barrier which was really

00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:46.750
important for us to do.
But third, just much simpler. We had the holidays.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:52.649
So we launched November 13 which is the last
kind of moment we could to capture what is

00:08:52.649 --> 00:08:58.430
the biggest season in any sort of retail.
So if we'd gotten out the door in kind of

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:04.550
a frozen tundra of January, we would have
missed a very important season.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.040
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Yeah, well it worked out for you.
&gt;&gt;Alexis: It did.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.649
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Well, I wanted to focus on you a
little bit. You've obviously been very successful

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:16.930
in your career. So what do you attribute that
success to?

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:25.369
&gt;&gt;Alexis: I, well, first of all, I've been
a little bit on the venture capital side as

00:09:25.369 --> 00:09:32.379
this is my third start-up through Gilt. And
I think to the extent you're operating in

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:38.509
an environment driven and fueled by technology,
if you're operating in an environment that

00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:44.510
is so rapidly evolving as our world is, jointly
and talking to the room here. There is kind

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:52.899
of two characteristic traits that you need
to have. One is flexibility. Flexibility to

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:58.540
take any new challenge and adapt readily to
that challenge. Flexibility to say, in our

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:04.129
case you know looking at our business, "Wow,
I watched 12 months just pass where he went

00:10:04.129 --> 00:10:09.079
from 0% of our revenue coming in of people
shopping over mobile devices to now it's almost

00:10:09.079 --> 00:10:12.889
30% of our revenue people shopping over mobile
devices. What does that mean for me and my

00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:17.889
context in my business?" So I think you need
a lot of personal flexibility.

00:10:17.889 --> 00:10:23.350
I remember being thrown into the trenches
at eBay when it was 40 people and I was right

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:29.499
out of college. You know I was 22 years old
or something. And in hypergrowth, you get

00:10:29.499 --> 00:10:34.370
so many opportunities you'd never get, and
I benefited not just because I was in the

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.189
right spot at the right time but also because
I was flexible or maybe even naive enough

00:10:38.189 --> 00:10:44.830
to say yes, I want to run Canada as you launch
a new business. Or yes, I'll learn about the

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.740
automotive space and help you run eBay motors,
launch it and get it up and out the door.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:54.649
So I think flexibility is just really important
as you look at being open to changing context

00:10:54.649 --> 00:11:01.879
and changing opportunities that come up in
a gross scenario. And just personally, I get

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:07.610
some weird rush when I'm thrown in the deep
end of a pool where the water level is slightly

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:12.240
above and over my head and where I have to
learn about so much so quickly and come up

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.389
to speed really fast. I just love that experience
of feeling stretched and incredibly challenged.

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:25.620
So there is no better environment than the
entrepreneurial environment because if I look

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.740
at the first four months of Gilt not only
did I have to do the things I knew, be it

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.709
product marketing, product development. Thinking
about acquiring an audience through viral

00:11:34.709 --> 00:11:38.890
marketing, social marketing really quickly.
I had to learn things that I never knew I'd

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.679
have to ever confront like how to find warehouse
space in the New York, New Jersey area. And

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:49.230
identify if through certain cues if there
would be Mafia involvement in that space.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:54.139
I never thought I'd have to ever learn about
something like that, but I get kind of a weird

00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:58.629
thrill or rush out of it.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Had you figured that out?

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:01.269
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Well, one, is it unionized? That's
one of the first things that you're supposed

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:04.449
to look at and I won't bore you because this
is something you'll never have to use in your

00:12:04.449 --> 00:12:11.589
day job. But second, I would walk into facilities
and you could tell based on the trust level

00:12:11.589 --> 00:12:16.439
between the employees and the management.
So I walked into facilities where literally

00:12:16.439 --> 00:12:24.480
during work hours there was not a window and
all the doors were closed with chains. I was

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:32.269
like what happens if there's a fire? And warehouses
have fires, what happens? And so I was told

00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:37.850
to look for subtle cues in terms of the work
structure, the organization of that workforce

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:43.029
and then the trust level between the workforce
and the management. I mean it sounds rational

00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:45.499
but I was, like, wow, I'd have to think about
that? Interesting.

00:12:45.499 --> 00:12:49.249
&gt;&gt;Sandra: I think chains are a good thing
to watch out for, we don't have them at Google.

00:12:49.249 --> 00:12:51.970
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Yeah, can you imagine if they had
chains on all these doors, that's what those

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.600
employees that that once they've had.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: We should do that is a test sometime.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.230
&gt;&gt;Alexis: I'm sure they'd love it.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: See how people react. So you talk

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:03.410
about the thrill of starting a new business,
do you still feel the same thrill today as

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.970
when you first started Gilt?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: I do because our business is evolving

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:17.110
every day. So we, a year and a half in, started
building our Japanese business. So I was very

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:22.800
involved in building Gilt Japan from ground
up. I was highly involved in our expansion

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:33.910
as we moved into Gilt Home. I was at the helm
of the marketing team as CMO when we embraced

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:42.420
and knew that we had to start investing heavily
in data and personalization and mobile as

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:47.509
not just the form of customer acquisition
but in distribution of our product and services.

00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:53.959
So it has evolved so much every year, again
something that everyone in this room can relate

00:13:53.959 --> 00:14:01.339
to. So that every quarter our business never
feels the same. And that has led me to what

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:06.290
I love best, the kind of pursuing new ideas,
new opportunities and getting them up and

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:10.950
off the ground.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Who would you say are your most

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:22.199
significant influences past and present?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: My biggest influences have been,

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:29.449
I would say, and this is the easy one, my
dad was somewhat of an entrepreneur. So that

00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:33.929
was a big influence and still a person in
my life that I go to for a lot of advice.

00:14:33.929 --> 00:14:41.350
I played college athletics and I think I had
coaches who were highly influential. But that

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:46.240
taught me a lot about the kind of tenacity
you need to have is an entrepreneur. You know

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.879
on the field if you fall down you get right
back up and keep going. You fall down on your

00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:54.619
face so many times in business and that's
to be expected and you need to keep up and

00:14:54.619 --> 00:15:04.009
keep going.
Whether you like or don't like her political

00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:08.110
stance, I put it to the side, I actually learned
quite a bit about seeing Meg Whitman at the

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:20.329
helm of a business as it scaled from 40 people
to about 15,000 employees. And seeing that

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:26.420
person as she morphed from a start-up environment
to leading a Fortune 500 business. Like the

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.339
stages of leadership in transition that you
need to undergo and undertake in order to

00:15:31.339 --> 00:15:36.949
remain successful. We're not there yet, were
only at 1000 people which is tiny from a Google

00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:37.949
standpoint.
[chuckles]

00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:41.660
&gt;&gt;Sandra: You're getting there, you're getting
there. Let's talk about Gilt, how is the actual

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:47.319
idea of Gilt of born?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Gilt was born out of personal interest

00:15:47.319 --> 00:15:55.429
that I had with my co-founder Alexandra in
part and in part through a first seed investor

00:15:55.429 --> 00:16:02.189
that we had who is now full time at the company,
Kevin Ryan. He saw this model working in France

00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:06.889
and thought well, there are elements of it
that could be interesting here. And then we

00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:12.089
shaped it from a personal past time of sneaking
out of offices here in New York to attend

00:16:12.089 --> 00:16:16.959
New York designer sample sales in the city.
I mean we would drop everything, there was

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:22.429
no location too far, no line too long. We
just thought it was amazing to be able to

00:16:22.429 --> 00:16:30.199
get recent collections at 70% off. So that
model and the fact that we'd get calls from

00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:35.899
family members saying when you're at the Fendi
sample sale, you pop into Louis Vuitton sale

00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:39.989
if you could ever get me something like this
just buy it, I don't care, and I'll pay you

00:16:39.989 --> 00:16:44.839
back. So that gave us the confidence that
there would be other people and perhaps a

00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:51.679
nationwide audience that could perhaps also
want to drop everything, in our case, at noon

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:58.129
every single day to shop this way. And that
was the formation, the idea and gave us a

00:16:58.129 --> 00:17:06.139
sense to of the emotion you'd bring to shopping
in a format like this. And then from that

00:17:06.139 --> 00:17:09.240
we try to translate that online in a number
of different ways.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:14.380
&gt;&gt;Sandra: And so that's how the flash sale
idea came about? I mean how did you guys pick

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.949
the 36 hour time limit?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: We wanted to create an experience

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:23.990
where every single time you came to the site
the selection would be different, the experience

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.360
would be different. There was never a guarantee
that you could come tomorrow and find the

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:37.299
same item. So 36 hours, in fact we even considered
shortening it to much shorter than that. But

00:17:37.299 --> 00:17:42.700
it gave that sense of freshness every day,
it was fleeting, it was going away. But honestly

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.740
we could've had probably the same revenues
as a business by having three-hour sales.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:54.720
Over 65% of everything we sell as a company
happens in an hour and a half a day.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.679
And that's, I mean our idea, the business
idea is quite simple at the face of it but

00:17:59.679 --> 00:18:05.100
it's quite complicated to execute. Because
starting as a small company we had to build

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:12.049
a business that looked like Amazon for that
hour and a half. And not over invest in hardware

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:17.770
and systems and employees, etcetera. that
accommodated a business for the rest of the

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:25.460
day was a startup. So we had this massive
spike and still do today for just really 90

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:30.309
minutes each and every day that impacts us
dramatically from how we think about customer

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:37.580
support to how we pick up and package 15,000
items, boxes going out the door every single

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:44.470
week from our three warehouses. It impacts
how we keep our site stable and scaling again

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:49.190
without over investing in technology, using
the Cloud in many unique ways.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:54.040
&gt;&gt;Sandra: So we love data here at Google,
and I'm sure you have a lot of data and analytics

00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:00.870
at Gilt. So can you see that people are mostly
logging in mostly right at 12 PM for the sale?

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:05.070
Is that when you see the highest spike?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Well, first of all we call them

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:11.600
our shopping athletes. Men are just as competitive
if not more than the ladies on the site. But

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:21.610
we see a huge spike in traffic, a huge spike
in inbound traffic at about 11:50 every day.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:25.750
And really what is happening is people are
warming up the mouse, they're like stretching

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:30.059
a little bit, they're like getting ready to
just dive into the virtual doors right at

00:19:30.059 --> 00:19:36.049
noon. Into the sales as they open up. So the
traffic spikes 10 minutes before the sales

00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:43.179
will go live. We generally have about 4 to
500,000 people at this very same instance

00:19:43.179 --> 00:19:48.840
enter the sale at about noon so that they
can get in, elbow others out-of-the-way, get

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.970
items into their shopping cart quickly so
then they can take a breather for about 10

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:58.260
minutes which is the cart limit. And that
you exclusively have access to that item and

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:07.360
then decide what they want to buy. So the
peak spike in traffic happens from 11:50 till

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.870
about 12:10 every day.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: So I mean is that the right strategy?

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.590
Getting there 10 minutes early?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: It's kind of exciting. Well, it's

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.840
something we talk about and it's something
we always talk to customers about too. Should

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:27.200
we have various spikes? Is 9 AM good for California
as it is 12 for people in New York, actually

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.380
we see it more often now, it's the lunch escape
that people have jumping into the site. But

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:37.370
it's also my 12 o'clock meeting is starting
right now and I just got to pretend I'm checking

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:45.820
e-mails quickly. And they're going in on iPads,
iPhones, larger and larger amounts. But is

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.090
it the right strategy? What is working really
well for us, and what was very new at the

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:55.549
time is a thought that, the kind of consumer
psychology around e-commerce was shifting.

00:20:55.549 --> 00:21:01.860
It wasn't about having everything available
all the time for all people. It was the curation

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:08.020
of the best stuff, some stuff for the right
amount of people and the expectation that

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.100
I could come in, find something amazing and
be out in under 5 or 10 minutes. That was

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:17.309
the big change. The change in psychology of
if I don't get there soon enough and it gets

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:22.640
old out, it's not Gilt's fault it's actually
my fault as a consumer. That, that's a big

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.159
shift, if you went into a store, if you went
into Amazon and saw nothing left you'd think,

00:21:27.159 --> 00:21:32.169
'oh my God, what a terrible experience'. So
in some ways it's worked for us but we know

00:21:32.169 --> 00:21:36.179
that is not without its frustration for some
consumers. And we've had to really address

00:21:36.179 --> 00:21:42.020
that through the experience in terms of investing
a tremendous amount in understanding just

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:51.399
how many size 6 MARC by Mark Jacobs we need.
Or how many size 11, or let's just say size,

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:56.260
and neck size 17 Brooks Brothers shirts that
we need. Or whatever is. We've got to always

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.570
invest in understanding what is the right
exact point in supply and demand on every

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:07.899
single item and getting it as right as possible
because that psychology can flip very much

00:22:07.899 --> 00:22:13.289
to anger, anguish if people are constantly
frustrated and can't get the item that they

00:22:13.289 --> 00:22:17.529
want. Or it sells out too quickly, so it's
a very fine line that we walk.

00:22:17.529 --> 00:22:21.610
&gt;&gt;Sandra: And have you had any angry e-mails?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Oh never.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:26.600
[Laughter]
Well, one of the funny stories that just emphasizes

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:32.149
high emotion people have when shopping on
Gilt. And this is something also that's exciting

00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:37.120
because it could never happen in off-line
world. Our first moment our servers were brought

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.760
to a standstill is when we had at Christian
Louboutin sale. Or maybe the guys in the room

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.850
who might not know it, some of the ladies
know about the famous red backed shoes and

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:53.029
how much excitement there is around it. We
had at that sale six months in the business

00:22:53.029 --> 00:23:00.759
200,000 women try to buy the exact same single
pair of shoes in one size at the same second.

00:23:00.759 --> 00:23:04.630
And you know literally not just did every
single member of our engineering team freeze,

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:10.080
but the site froze for about 45 min. Because
that's something we wouldn't have been able

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:16.950
to sustain in any other environment. But points
to the spike in activity that we had and still

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:23.419
have on the site today.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: So I want to ask you, you and Alexandra

00:23:23.419 --> 00:23:27.679
knew each other in school. How would you know
each other before you actually launched Gilt?

00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:31.400
&gt;&gt;Alexis: We went to college together. We
went to business school together. We became

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.090
very much glued at the hip. We had talked
about ideas in business school we wanted to

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:42.890
pursue. But we had spent a tremendous time
together as friends before we took the plunge

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:47.909
to work together. And we actually reflect
on this quite a bit in the book, like how

00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:51.490
to think about the partner decision especially
if you're going into business with a friend,

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:55.491
if you're going into business with a former
colleague or even a family member. Because

00:23:55.491 --> 00:24:01.820
not everyone should go into business together.
So we called it our form of premarital counseling

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:07.130
that we went through. But some of the things
we thought about before we jumped into business

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:15.679
together as friends is one, how would we handle
disagreements and even fights? Because you

00:24:15.679 --> 00:24:19.750
fight very differently as friends than you
do as colleagues. And if you don't manage

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:26.510
what is a natural form of tension or disagreement
that comes up in the work environment productively

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:32.409
it can be really detrimental. So friction
causes better ideas, that disagreement you

00:24:32.409 --> 00:24:37.120
have actually causes better ideas at the end
of the day. But you've got to figure out ahead

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.220
of time how you're going to fight well. And
so that was one thing we spent time thinking

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:46.190
about.
Second, there is always an emphasis on how

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:51.549
differing skill sets should come together
to form a really good team. But in our case,

00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:56.340
we really believed it was more important to
think about how differing personalities come

00:24:56.340 --> 00:25:02.029
together to form a strong team. One thing
that always happens in any situation is you

00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:07.460
have a natural human tendency just to hire
people like yourself from a personality standpoint.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.580
Whether you're much more detailed forward
focused or you're more of a big picture thinker

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.850
or if you're always task oriented, you always
tend to hire people like yourself which is

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:20.380
natural. But you have to get good at identifying,
okay what are my blind spots, what are my

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:25.200
weaknesses? What are the weaknesses in the
team? And be good at complementing and having

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.809
a very differing group of people around the
table so that, in our case as the start of

00:25:30.809 --> 00:25:36.190
team, we weren't all starry eyed optimist,
never saw an idea we didn't like. Were pursuing

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:41.570
them all at the same time and weren't as good
at making decisions on anything else other

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:46.370
than intuition.
So we spent time thinking about whether we

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:50.919
were good personality fits. And as we actually
matured as a startup team we started using

00:25:50.919 --> 00:25:54.700
things like Myers-Briggs which were really
good at identifying what were major holes

00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:00.630
that we had around the table because there
is no more common killer to ideas, startup

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:09.590
teams, internal teams than having a group
that doesn't work well together. Because they're

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:13.660
all rushing down the same wrong path in the
wrong direction at the wrong time. Or there's

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:19.399
a sense or lack of trust. Or there's kind
of a red flags that in your optimism to make

00:26:19.399 --> 00:26:25.000
things work you glossed over in a partner.
So we spent a lot of time talking about all

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.309
those things.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Well, do you know your Myers-Briggs

00:26:27.309 --> 00:26:32.030
type? And Alexandra's?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: I am E N T P to an extreme which

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:38.789
means I am an extreme extrovert, I am very
good at making decisions on intuition. I'm

00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:46.960
terrible about taking time to look at details
around the research. And I am extreme on the

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.210
P which I think, or one of them which, oh
no T which I think means I'm not very structured

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:58.570
thinker, I'm not very good at schedules and
a lot of those things which is not very healthy

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:03.150
as the CEO [laughs] which I was at the time.
So it meant I really had to focus on those

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:08.830
elements and bring in in which I actually
did a COO of who was good at and complemented

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:12.720
me in a number of different ways.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: So I want to leave a little bit

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.340
of time for Q and A and we'll just go through
a couple more questions. You know you talk

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.909
earlier about a lot of people having their
own ideas and wanted to pursue them. And a

00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:27.420
lot of times people have those ideas but they
don't have the courage to actually move forward

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.309
with them. So what advice would you give them,
for that extra push?

00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:37.130
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Two thoughts. One, if you have an
idea and you want to pursue it, look at who's

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:44.620
doing it already and who did it and tried
and failed. And be really mindful of why.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.640
So if people are doing it already, can you,
are you equipped, is your team equipped to

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.629
do it better and why? If someone has done
it already and failed again why? Was it too

00:27:53.629 --> 00:27:59.009
early? Were their legislative issues? Was
there something in the context that made it

00:27:59.009 --> 00:28:03.940
really hard to pull off? And actually we throughout
the book you'll see there's some checklists.

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:13.330
But think about the idea and if it's sound.
But second of all, I think when pursuing an

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:18.460
idea to the extent you're incredibly passionate
about it and you are the target audience have

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:22.850
confidence in the fact that regardless of
your background that you are better equipped

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:28.659
than anyone to think like that customer. To
market to that customer. To develop a product

00:28:28.659 --> 00:28:34.249
for that customer. And bring that confident
in to any meeting with investors, any meeting

00:28:34.249 --> 00:28:39.210
with senior management, any meeting with anyone
else that is integral to getting that idea

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:44.129
the ground. I think sometimes people get too
reflective and just okay what is my resume

00:28:44.129 --> 00:28:52.129
say. And if you are tackling an idea for an
end user that you are so intimately familiar

00:28:52.129 --> 00:28:59.289
with or are that end user yourself, you are
better equipped than almost anyone to understand

00:28:59.289 --> 00:29:06.519
the mindset. So take confidence in that.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: What keeps you up at night?

00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:12.639
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Everything when it comes to startup.
I think one misconception is that you get

00:29:12.639 --> 00:29:19.130
to a point and you're like and you're like
okay we've made it we're done. Or the thought

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:24.440
that you just have as an entrepreneur some
sort of brazen confidence that makes you impervious

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:30.009
to anything else. And the truth of the matter
is you're deeply fearful at every single moment

00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:35.519
that one, that first sale no one will show
up. That wow that competitor could take off.

00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:41.980
And I think actually it's a good thing because
that fear gives you an edge that makes you

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:47.139
never, sit back and say we made it, or we're
done. Because that's a point when you really

00:29:47.139 --> 00:29:54.519
start losing ground to someone else. So things
that keep me awake have to do with competition,

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:58.600
to shifting trends in the business and how
we're going to adapt as a team or company

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:05.179
to any number of things. And not to steal
Andy Grove's line but it really is truly the

00:30:05.179 --> 00:30:06.960
paranoid that survive.
[Laughter]

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.309
&gt;&gt;Sandra: All right good to know, we'll all
be paranoid then.

00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:14.960
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Yeah, it's just really not to say
being fearful. Now there's looking over your

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:24.190
shoulder but you're never done. You never
finished. And as quickly as things get built

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:31.461
something else can emerge and you can similarly
be sidelined too, as a business and idea a

00:30:31.461 --> 00:30:37.190
team or whatever it is. So you just have to
be nimble intellectually. Think about broader

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:45.549
context and be able to pivot your idea or
your team in increasingly shorter and shorter

00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:49.720
time periods.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: What do you do for fun?

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:55.480
&gt;&gt;Alexis: For fun, well, one right now I have
two kids under a year and a half. So for fun

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:01.080
it's like chasing after them most of the time
and finding free time, as much free time to

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:07.210
see them as possible. But I've always been
an athlete so I spend as much time as I can

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:12.619
too, just running the skiing or any number
of different hobbies I have in that area.

00:31:12.619 --> 00:31:14.630
And then fashions pretty fun, too.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Just a little bit.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:21.840
&gt;&gt;Alexis: So there's lots of fun parties,
events and others that are just a side perk

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.911
of my current job. So I'm looking forward
to Monday night going to the CFDA awards.

00:31:27.911 --> 00:31:33.960
Last year Lady Gaga showed up at it with fishnet
stockings up to here and I don't even know,

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.909
I saw her sit two rows in front of me in a
thong with 4 inch spikes on the back of it.

00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:41.799
So how she did that is still beyond me.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Sounds really comfortable.

00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:45.669
&gt;&gt;Alexis: It will be a fun event on Monday
night as well, too.

00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:49.940
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Cool, last question before I open
up to questions. Tell us something about yourself

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:55.899
that we would find surprising about you.
&gt;&gt;Alexis: That I balance a career mostly in

00:31:55.899 --> 00:32:04.659
fashion by making sure that I do at least
a one or two week excursion, camping excursion

00:32:04.659 --> 00:32:09.340
every year, usually in Alaska. So I feel like
I've got to still be able to get my hands

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:14.830
dirty. So even though I operate in fashion,
people always find, that I reveal this to

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:21.789
most look at me in horror when I tell this
to like that Zac Posen. That I still go to

00:32:21.789 --> 00:32:27.100
the outback of Alaska or other spots, try
to at least a week a year.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:31.919
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Didn't know that.
&gt;&gt;Alexis: I know it somewhat strange but I

00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:36.309
feel I need something at the other end of
spectrum given my day job.

00:32:36.309 --> 00:32:40.259
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Cool, well are there any questions
from the audience?

00:32:40.259 --> 00:32:46.419
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Thank you for being here. My question
has to do with sales channel conflict. I'm

00:32:46.419 --> 00:32:53.249
quite curious as a discount seller of big
fashion clothing, you mentioned Ralph Lauren.

00:32:53.249 --> 00:32:57.780
What were the steps that you had to take and
the trials that you had to overcome in getting

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:03.169
big brands to sign up without conflicting
with their existing sales channels?

00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:08.100
&gt;&gt;Alexis: It's not something that, well, first
of all of morphs to give in each area. So

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.789
when you talk about sporting-goods it's very
different than fashion. And all of it we have

00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:18.590
to be mindful of now given how many categories
we're in as a business. But in the early days,

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:26.210
first year, we would always come up against
pushback from department stores saying, you

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:32.210
know, if you start working with these guys.
So we faced a lot of channel conflict there.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:38.830
And a couple of things, basically our end
brand partners needed us. They needed us because

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:44.190
of the returns that they get back from department
stores. Any number of things that just weren't

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:48.230
functioning well in their own distribution
channels out to market.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:55.110
But the second thing that's much more important
today in terms of every brand we work with,

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.470
and something that we had to pivot our original
idea around. We really thought we just be

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:05.970
a liquidator initially of desirable, desirable
product that given the seasonal construct

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:10.600
of fashion they're already about to sell fall.
And are we thinking about buying fall woolen

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.210
products right now? No, were thinking about
buying summer but that's a season old and

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:18.140
that's what we're selling. We thought that
would be our business opportunity is just

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:22.860
as messed up seasonal cycle in fashion and
being able to help brand partners with end

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.850
of season goods.
But it more quickly, to our partners, really

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:32.370
wanted to work with us because the context
their business was changing. Those that were

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:37.570
coming into the stores were, tended to be
50 years old or older. They're having a really

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:43.270
tough time reaching younger consumers who
are increasingly behind flat-panel monitors

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:48.530
for 80 hours a week and not spending time
in stores. And they saw Gilt as a really unique

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:57.230
way to reintroduce their brand, to acquire
customers, to even just reposition their brand

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.700
in a number of different ways to an audience
that they were reaching otherwise.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:05.620
And that was our magic. That was why they
wanted to work with us. And it's still the

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:10.940
case today. So they view us as a marketing
partner, marketing channel and customers often

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:15.700
come to us for that sense of discovery of
a known brand, but being able to buy from

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:22.400
it. And being able to discover something new
that they hadn't thought to buy before. And

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.640
that's how we get over today is the fact that
we are equally a channel to reach a certain

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:32.450
customer in a new way as a department store
is or even other channels like their own website

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.750
might be for them is the business.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Next question.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:41.950
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Hi, thank you so much for being
here I'm a huge fan, I use Gilt all the time

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:48.140
so thank you. I was just wondering because
I think a lot of us who are here are entrepreneurial,

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.570
and I was just wondering you're very positive
and I love that and I love your confidence

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:56.100
and I like your advice. But I was just wondering
if there was anything that you or your co-founder

00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:03.180
were really afraid of? Because it seems to
me it was obvious there was a target audience

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.010
for this. So that wasn't really a fear like
you knew that people would like this. But

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:10.450
I was just wondering if there is anything
that you were afraid of taking the leap to

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:12.961
start your own business?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Well, in terms of the idea, there

00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:17.230
was a great possibility that first morning
when we got started that no one would come.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:22.380
There was no guarantee, there really wasn't.
We had sent out lots of invitations to many,

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:27.180
many, many people but when you're standing
there, your first sale and you're trying to

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.580
move through what was our first purchase of
about $8000 worth of Zac Posen inventory.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:36.090
Like there was a real possibility no one would
show up and then no one else would sell to

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:41.270
us and that we wouldn't be able to get a number
of different things. But it shifted a lot

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:46.590
over time and there is no more gut wrenching
experience than starting your own business.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:50.930
It's filled with lots and lots of lows and
you just have to know that that's coming.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:55.390
But one thing that was pretty scary in the
early days was would we be able to raise money

00:36:55.390 --> 00:37:00.340
for this idea?
In 2007, no one was investing in e-commerce

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:07.920
it was still close enough to 2002. Certainly
no one was investing in fashion online. And

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:11.890
nothing got us laughed out of the room faster
than when we said that we would get guys to

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:17.330
shop for themselves one day on Gilt too. And
then they were like yeah, whatever. So it

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:21.360
was, then we really thought we'd have to go
to Europe to raise capital for this because

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.510
of the fact we were e-commerce, the fact we
were touching inventory and the fact that

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:29.900
we are touching fashion, all pretty bad words
at that time.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:35.320
So raising money it's a very scary process
and so much hinges on your ability to do that.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:41.000
And that was wrought with a lot of issues.
One, because of the perceived lack of it but

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.071
also two, you know having to go in and convince
people that, wow, I'm so passionate about

00:37:47.071 --> 00:37:54.370
shopping that I would drop everything, just
trying to convince a room full of people that,

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:58.530
often guys, who care nothing about fashion.
But this was a big opportunity. You know there

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.190
were really many moments that we really thought
we wouldn't be able to raise money for.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:06.090
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Sorry guys I think we only have
time for one more question, I saw you walk

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.760
up first.
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Oh, I hope this is interesting

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.600
enough. So my sister and I were talking about
this a few weeks ago. We're both Amazon prime

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:18.980
members and we both now don't buy anything
online if we have to pay for shipping that

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.700
says the psychology of it even though we pay
for Amazon prime.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.080
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Have your bought on Gilt?
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Yes, but there are many times

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.790
that I don't buy something because I don't
want to pay the shipping.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.911
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Even though you do have free

00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:34.350
shipping for the next X amount of time. Is
this something that ever comes up where you

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:37.240
think about the psychology of this?
&gt;&gt;Alexis: All the time, all the time. And

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:43.530
not just shipping because any e-commerce business
the top thing, if you do any of the surveys

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:53.510
or other work to get a sense of what's driving
your customer satisfaction score, shipping

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:59.400
is always the primary thing. So customers
are taught, too, that shipping is something

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:04.510
that you shouldn't pay for. So we think about
it a lot. We recently have invested in bringing

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:10.950
down the shipping by nearly 50%. The truth
is that you're always paying for shipping

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:15.540
as a customer is just where you're paying
for it. In the price of the good or the shipping

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:22.140
itself. So we do think about a lot. We're
working on something right now that I can't

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:27.890
reveal but hopefully you like it. But I'm
curious to know when you do buy on Gilt and

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:33.490
given your statement about Prime why did you
buy with us? What drove you to make that purchase

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:36.810
regardless?
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Most times that I buy something

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:42.270
on Gilt, it's either something that's just
an absolutely amazing deal and the shipping

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:46.110
added onto it, it still makes it an amazing
deal or it's something that I absolutely must

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:52.190
have. Like especially for some cheaper items
like jewelry and stuff I just won't buy it

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:56.770
because I don't want to pay for the shipping.
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Yeah, and that's commonly what we

00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:03.230
are across our membership is that the pricing
and availability I can't get anywhere else.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:09.470
And then I must have it. So that has made
it so that we can do a little bit more. You

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:14.480
know we can pass on the lowest prices through
the cost of the item and try to just push

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:18.370
our pricing lower and lower on shipping. But
yeah it's something working on a spending

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:23.100
a lot of time thinking about. So it's a great
question and we know it's at the top of every

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:27.340
single person's mind who shops anywhere online,
it's a top driver.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.010
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Thank you.
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Alright well, Alexis, thank you

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.820
very much for joining us today.
&gt;&gt;Alexis: Thank you for having me.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:32.440
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Thank you for your time.
[Applause]
