00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.720
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the dome some of you might recognize this place

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.179
And I hope that you realize that when we're here we're about to do some crazy stuff usually with fire

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.759
And that's the case today. We're going to be trying an experiment that I am pretty excited about not too long ago

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.778
We showed you how to make a super cooled bath of acetone using some dry ice

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.619
And we can freeze stuff in it, and it was not quite as cold as liquid, nitrogen

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.459
But had a lot of sanity cools something interesting happened when I poured water into the supercooled acetone the water dispersed

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.290
But then very quickly throws into crystals, and as it sat in it for a while it turned into a slush

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.920
I took some that slush

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.739
lit it on fire on a brick and it burned pretty well if I was very interested in how I can touch it and

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.649
Simultaneously feel like my hand was freezing and on fire

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.649
I want to try making some snowballs out of that acetone ice slush and see what happens if I just light them on fire and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.019
Throw them then while I was thinking about that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.209
I thought maybe there are some other ways to make some fire snowballs, and I wanted to try some of those as well

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.000
So I called up my local ice rink, and I asked them if I could have some of the scraped off snow

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That's created when they Zamboni the ice

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.229
They were gracious enough to let me take some of that snow

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.759
so I now have a cooler full of snow and a second cooler full of sand pre-packed snowballs and

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.389
The purpose of today's video is to see what kind of fluid we can pour on this snowball to get our best fireball

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.439
We'll use acetone isopropyl alcohol some lamp oil and even some gasoline on these snow walls to see which gives us the best

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.390
Fireball in addition to several different varieties of making the fire balls. I have a few different things

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.320
I'm going to try to launch them of course. I'll try just throwing them like a normal snowball

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.929
I've also got this dog toy designed for tennis balls But will use it for throwing the balls

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.140
And some of you may recognize our water balloon launcher that grant showed you how to build some time ago here

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.519
We've got some dry ice let's break some of this up fill our container around our Bowl

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.078
Then pour all of our acetone in and we should start to get a supercooled acetone bath

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.070
Even with good gloves on this stuff gets so cold so fast

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.520
There we go and our bucket here

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.810
It's got lots of holes drilled into it all the way around so that our acetone will easily

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.870
Get in but our dry ice will stay on the outside

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.740
there you go you can see the bubbles are starting to calm down

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.750
It means our acetone is starting to get nice and cold

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.949
Now the gloves I was wearing were good for installation

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.520
But they weren't

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.360
waterproof or

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.889
Acetone proof at all and so I've actually managed to squeeze a pair of the black gloves over the other gloves and now I should

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.410
Have insulated hands and ones that won't

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.540
Hold acetone as unweighting it on fire. That's just the combination I want

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.859
Let's try pouring some water into this bath. Let it cool down and see if we get that same slush. We got last time

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.389
Probably not even a little bit safe either

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.880
But I've got gloves on I've got long sleeves on I've got glasses on I'm kind of keeping myself held away

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.400
It's fine

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.530
Of course the water is able to get through the little holes in the plastic container

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.719
So we're just starting to get some slush surrounding all of the bucket and the dry ice and everything

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.959
But there is a lot more of it in the plastic bucket than out when we last made some of this acetone frost

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.029
Mixture it took a little while for it to really concentrate down and freeze all of the water in it

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.699
So let's just set it aside for a minute and try adding some of our fuels to our pre-made snowballs see how that works

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.919
We're already working on acetone, so let's try making an acetone soaked snowball

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.660
Not what I had in mind

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.299
I Didn't have quite the right tool for opening the lid the way you're supposed to the whole thing. Just popped right off

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.230
It should still pour out

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.230
Kind of that are probably splashed a little

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.979
Alright, we've got our snowball. Let's try and

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.170
Pour some acetone on it's not gonna pour very well, but looks

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.860
Like it's getting absorbed nice and into the snow. That's what we want

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.249
Now for the safe part lighting it on fire

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.080
Really not lighting very well, maybe we need more acetone

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.879
That's on fire only my gloves on fire the snowball is not

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.849
Successfully

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.059
melted a small portion of the snowball I

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.369
Don't think acetone is going to work very well, so let's move on to trying one of our other fuels

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:02.030
Next up we have our 91% isopropyl alcohol see if this works better than the acetone kind of have my doubts

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.689
Snowball just doesn't wick the fuel through itself enough to stay lit

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.770
It's almost like it's made of water or something well acetone didn't work and alcohol didn't work. Let's try lamp oil

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.270
No still nothing, huh

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.430
our lamp oil gets cold enough that it even solidified it starts to

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.749
Gel up a little bit the water and our supercooled acetone is now quite cold, and we've got a good slush

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:50.769
I'm gonna see if I can make that into a snowball light it on fire and chuck it

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.620
Squeeze a little bit of the acetone out

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:02.199
But not a lot because I think that will just make it not light so let's try that much see how this works

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.800
Just went out immediately all right, let's try it without squeezing it at all just get a big old scoop of acetone slush

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.189
Still not much this kind of goes out right away

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.519
I'm just gonna pour it out on the ground. This doesn't work as a snowball

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.610
Though I'm trying I won't think that he'd be able to feel anything through my gloves

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.389
Well, I've got one more idea. We have the whole acetone bath. It's really cold, but it is acetone

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.200
Well that just does not want to light

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.840
Are those three types of fuel didn't work, so we've had to upgrade to gasoline

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.619
and I'm a little nervous about doing this because it's gasoline but

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.320
You know for science, I guess

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.129
I think the whole rock is gonna light on fire whether or not the snowball does

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:34.889
Yep Drock lit on fire our snowball

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.710
Hey, that's on fire a little bit oh

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:51.179
It breaks open it catches on fire better. Oh yeah now, it's nicely ablaze as is my hand throwing

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.840
That one out my hand stayed lit

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.039
new strategy

00:07:56.039 --> 00:08:01.619
I'll try part of the snowball in this pan of gasoline then bring it over here to the fire

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.780
To light it. See if this works

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:11.319
Yep

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.210
And I let my can of gas on fire

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:21.619
That's just gonna burn now now I know that the idea works

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.009
I got a snowball it stayed lit all the way to when it hit the wall

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.470
I just need to have the pan of not burning gasoline farther away from my source of fire

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.369
So I don't accidentally light it by holding a flaming snowball

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.430
live and learn

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:40.099
No snowball soaked in gasoline

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.509
Now a long ways away from our gasoline I

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:57.799
Don't know if it stays on fire all the way across very well, I'll try one that's considerably more soaked in gasoline

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.640
Which is a higher risk of lighting my hand on fire even more I?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.400
Think it'll be worth it

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.939
Wow I got farther I think it got farther on fire

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:28.889
That was like on fire until it hit the wall, that's pretty good. All right. We've got our little dog toy thrower and

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.300
now I'm not as afraid of lighting my hand on fire it might melt this but

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.970
Let's try that

00:09:40.209 --> 00:09:44.698
Ha it hit the wall still on fire fireball success

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:24.849
Now I brought this water balloon slash snowball launcher thinking that maybe I could try using it to launch some flaming snowballs

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:29.980
But since gasoline is the only thing that I can get to actually make these snowballs light on fire

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:35.800
I'm not gonna do that because I think when it launches. It was just sort of spray gasoline on fire

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.009
Everywhere, and that would probably include on me

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.679
That's just too dangerous for me to try right now

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.310
I will use it to just launch a snowball and you can see how well it works

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.310
But I'm not gonna try it while it's lit on fire

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.920
Flies beautifully

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:14.960
They have a few mixed results with our fire snowballs the acetone lamp oil and isopropyl alcohol

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:21.620
Weren't flammable enough to stay lit while soaking the fireball they would maybe light for a second and then just go out right away

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.710
gasoline gave us pretty good results with our snowballs

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:30.259
But it did have a tendency to light other things on fire at the same time so maybe not the best idea

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.720
But it did look really cool. That's the part. I like

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.720
Super cooling our water in the acetone gave us a snow that was a little bit flammable

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.790
But it didn't actually stay lit very well

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.319
He would light very briefly and then just go out and when he threw it it wasn't on fire anymore

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.880
Definitely our best result was from soaking the snow balls in the gasoline

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:56.030
I really preferred using the dog toy thrower to throw the snow balls because then my hands weren't lighting on fire as much and although

00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:00.379
My gloves did a great job of keeping me from getting burned or even uncomfortably warm

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.600
It's obviously not a very safe thing to do

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:07.009
All in all this has been a fun experiment and although it didn't work out quite as well as I was hoping

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.300
We did get some really fun results

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.550
Thanks for joining us for this video and remember to come gear yourself up with products and merch at the king of random

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.620
Calm see you there

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.680
So it's just a little bit oh

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.939
Yeah, it does that put it out with snowballs

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.119
Snowballs are not an effective method of firefighting

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.679
Then you just gonna end up with me with hands on fire juggling snowballs

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.330
My hands are on fire

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.010
Hey guys

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.739
Thank you for your comments so many of you have really interesting

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:45.440
Suggestions for projects and experiments, and we love testing those out for you. I also wanted to say thank you for the great feedback

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.940
You're leaving for me and my team because we're all in this together, so thank you for being on our camp
