1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.930
Honestly,
I think that is another consequence of live.
I mean,
I'm not,

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:06.220
I'm not arguing that you shouldn't be alive because it,

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.680
it has a massive advantage for you as well,
but it is,

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.090
there's just a different feeling,
like,
you know,

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.400
if I knew that this was being taped and I could rethink the thing we're about to

6
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.350
say about Liam Neeson or whatever it is,
you know,
it's,
it's different.
Yeah.

7
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.370
And so,
um,
but well,
the Liam Neeson story is a perfect example there.

8
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:30.360
Okay.
I let it,
let's go.
They're a perfect example of a story where,

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.410
you know,
if you are Liam's friend,
you'd go,
don't tell that one.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.000
Don't tell that one.
He's like,
but I want to be honest.
Yeah.
Like don't,
don't,

11
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.160
you could be honest with me.
I'm not gonna judge you.

12
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.900
If you tell me that someone got raped and you went out with a baseball bat for a

13
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:50.850
week looking for a black man to beat up all the kill to kill,
I'd be like,

14
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:53.070
Oh,
Jesus Christ,
man.
Like,

15
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:55.280
what the fuck was going through your head at that point in time?
Like,

16
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.510
that's terrible.
Like,
yeah.
Like I feel awful about it.

17
00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:02.040
I can't believe that was me,
but,
but it didn't happen.
Nothing happened.
And now,

18
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.430
you know,
people are calling him a racist and they don't want them in movies.

19
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.880
And well,
I mean this is,
this is fascinating to me because again,

20
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:12.090
this is a much larger problem with,
with massive implications.

21
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.570
We need to think through the whole process of redemption for people in our

22
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:23.400
society.
Right?
Like,
like we,
we have to understand what are the,

23
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.430
what are the criteria for successful apologies and for forgiveness or like what,

24
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.090
like what,
what does what,
because especially,
I mean,
w we're in,

25
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.420
we're in a world where people are,
are having their,

26
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.710
their reputations destroyed in their careers,
threatened for tweets.

27
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:44.240
They sent us teenagers.
Yeah.
Right.
And you know,
more this,

28
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.120
this is the dorseys point.
Things are not disappearing online anymore.

29
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.430
In a certain point,
you know,
everyone,
this,

30
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.440
there's going to be a three 60 kind of pan optic on view of everyone's life.

31
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.681
You know,

32
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:59.460
there are people who have grown up on social media and everything is out there.

33
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.060
And,
um,
I mean,

34
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:06.470
the irony here for me is that you have,
you know,

35
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.570
progress progressive's and the people on the far left who receive a disclosure

36
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:16.740
like,
you know,
Liam Neeson's,
let's just take his,
and they just want,

37
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.780
they just want to see him burned alive.
Right?
Let's,

38
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.300
let's just do the wicker man on this guy because this is,
you know,

39
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.950
this is so awful.
And yet alongside that,

40
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.210
the same people on the left are people who have as a,

41
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:34.760
as a genuine ethical norm,
the rehabilitation of murderers,
right?

42
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.510
Like you could be somebody who spent,
you know,
20 years in prison for a crime,

43
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:40.141
you admit,

44
00:02:40.141 --> 00:02:44.640
you committed and there's this norm around redemption.

45
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.390
And,
uh,
so there's,
you know,
there's no way to square those two things.

46
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.690
They're constantly holding these two contradictions,
right?
I mean,

47
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:56.670
here's another one.
Women's rights and supportive of the job.
I mean,
yeah.
What,

48
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.010
yeah,
this is what's going on there.
How do you do that?
You know,

49
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.810
don't be Islamophobic,
but also support women's rights and gay rights.
Yeah.

50
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.540
Okay.
Well,
I don't think I,
Eric Weinstein,

51
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.600
our mutual friend calls these,
the,
um,

52
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.630
the Hilbert problems for social justice warriors.

53
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:17.250
And the David Hilpert was a very famous mathematician who at,
at,

54
00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:19.720
at the turn of the,
the 19th century,

55
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:24.250
posed a set of problems in mathematics that,
you know,
we're just,
you know,
the,

56
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.120
the,
on his list of the most desirable questions that you're like the hardest

57
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:31.510
questions in the most consequential questions to answer.
And so,
you know,

58
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.600
Eric has been a mathematician,
is flip that around ironically and said,
these are,

59
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:36.940
these are the questions that social justice warriors have to answer.

60
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.740
And there these impossible opposition of this sort.
But,
so the Liam Neeson thing,

61
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.320
and you know,
forgive me if I,

62
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.990
if there's some detail that has come out that I'm not aware of,

63
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:50.140
but my understanding of it is he,
you know,

64
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:54.910
he had a friend who was raped and then he reported this state of mind,

65
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:59.710
this murderous state of mind he was in where he was walking around with.

66
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.470
He calls it a caution as the British word for like,
uh,
it's like,
uh,

67
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.360
a small metal club.
Right.
Um,

68
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.720
it was like a black jack or like another term for it,
I think.

69
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.110
And I'm looking for a black guy to kill,

70
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.870
you know,

71
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.670
like there's a hoping someone's going to come out of the woodwork and threaten

72
00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:24.671
him so that he could kill this guy in this act of instrumental violence because

73
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:26.770
his friend had been raped by a black guy.
Right.

74
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:29.410
So it's like any black guy will do now that's,
that's sort of like the,

75
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.030
the extra horrific wrinkle to the story right now.

76
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.750
And he's confessing this as a kind of a symptom of transient mental illness,

77
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:41.260
at least as far as I know.

78
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:44.650
It's like he's horrified by the fact that he was in the state of mind.
Right.

79
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:48.280
Can you imagine like,
I,
you know,
Liam Neeson it actor,
uh,

80
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.440
I have everything to lose and although I don't remember what,

81
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.780
at what point in his life he said this happened,
um,
can you imagine that?

82
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:59.980
I was in the state of mind.
Right?
And this is,
as you say,

83
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.960
an all too honest disclosure,

84
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.130
but it is damn interesting.
Right?

85
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.050
And it is the kind of thing that we should be able to talk about.
Right.

86
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.950
And it's not,

87
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:16.951
and the fact that this is becoming synonymous with racism seems just wrong

88
00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:20.610
given,
given how he's,
he described,
or at least how I've,

89
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.750
I've heard this because he's saying,
listen,

90
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:27.610
if this had been an Armenian guy or an Italian or a Japanese guy,

91
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.950
I'd be looking for one of them.
Right?
I mean,
what,
what,

92
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.070
what this was at least on his telling is the virus of instrumental violence.

93
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:39.280
I mean,
the,
the,
the virus of like,

94
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.350
this is how every blood feud ever in human history gets started.
Like you,

95
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.230
like someone from your tribe killed my brother,

96
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.340
and now what I want to do is kill anyone from your tribe.
Right.

97
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:55.340
It doesn't matter who you know,
and,
and that's,
you know,

98
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.210
clearly as toxic as it gets,
you know,
ethically.

99
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.040
But that's not racism.
Right.
That's just,
that is that we,

100
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:08.960
we have a word for it.
It's an,
it's an instrumental violence.
Um,
but,
you know,

101
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:13.250
yeah.
Obviously he's getting totally pilloried over this.
Uh,
but we need,

102
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.840
we just need to figure out how to talk about how people can redeem themselves

103
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.490
once something this unsavory is,
is revealed about their past,

104
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:29.360
whether they reveal it or whether it's just,
you know,
found out about them.
Yeah.

105
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.550
Um,
I mean it is racism though,
Ryan,

106
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:35.060
because he's specifically looking for a black guy.
I mean,

107
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.520
I understand that it's a part of the other tribe.
No,

108
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:39.940
but it doesn't suggest that he has,

109
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.300
that he disposed and he feels one way or another red black people.
It's like,

110
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.540
like if you told me,
um,
uh,

111
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.910
yeah,
he,
he could,
he could have said again,
it could have been,
uh,

112
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.800
an Irish guy.
Right.
Or it could have been made,
well,
I guess he's Irish.

113
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.210
He's Scottish or Irish.
Um,
it could have been an English guy.
Right.

114
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:01.130
He could've been like any type.
Right.

115
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:05.420
It's like the salience of the tribe is what he was reacting to,

116
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.830
at least in his description.

117
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.150
I don't know why you wouldn't take him at his word given that he didn't have to

118
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:13.100
say any of this in the first place.
Right.
I mean like,

119
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:16.880
this is like an amazingly honest and unnecessary disclosure,

120
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.410
but it's,
um,
and I don't think people would think of it as racism if he,

121
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.770
if the story simply was,
uh,
you know,

122
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.570
she got raped by a cop and I was just hoping to go kill a cop.

123
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.370
Right,
right.
You know,
the same story.
Right.
Um,
and,
uh,

124
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.683
so yeah,

125
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.690
but we're so trigger happy in our outrage with respect to anything.

126
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:43.700
Like where do you think that is?
Like what is going on?

127
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:47.720
Because outrage seems to be more in season than it's ever been in my lifetime.

128
00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:48.331
I don't,
I know,

129
00:07:48.331 --> 00:07:53.331
I remember outrage being so just such a,

130
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.400
it's,
it's,
it's recreational.
Yeah.
There's a,
there's a,
I mean,

131
00:07:58.401 --> 00:07:59.960
it's back to Jack.
I mean,
so a lot,

132
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.320
it has a lot to do with social media and Twitter in particular.
Yeah.
