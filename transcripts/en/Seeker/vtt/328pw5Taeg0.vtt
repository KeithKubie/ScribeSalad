00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.010
The Large Hadron Collider… it's a massive
beautiful piece of human ingenuity, engineering

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.010
and...

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.470
Wait a minute, that's not the LHC.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.470
This is the Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:18.550
Hey everyone, Trace here on location at the
Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.019
This is the Large Hadron Collider or the LHC
for short.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.019
It's a 27 kilometer particle accelerator,
sitting 300 meters under the border of France

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.779
and Switzerland.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.189
It's an atom smasher, the biggest in the world.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.550
Designed and built by thousands of engineers,
scientists, and mathematicians from across

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.430
our tiny planet with the goal of helping other
scientists learn about things of incredibly

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.210
small size by smashing them together.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.940
These smashings are called collisions.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.280
"This is a really all they're interested in.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.580
They're interested in collisions, collisions,
collisions."

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.400
That's Mike Lamont, he's the Operations Group
Leader working on the LHC.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.210
It's his job to "run beam."

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.160
Beam being nerdy lingo for bunches of hydrogen
protons that fill up the LHC.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.420
The LHC is a ring containing two beams going
in opposite directions!1 But if we look closer

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.469
that beam is actually made up of bunches of
protons...

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:14.780
Each bunch as about 100 billion protons each.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.659
"These bunches are about 30 centimeters long,
typically about a millimeter, dimensions as

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.530
they're going around the ring.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.060
Think about a long, thin, tapered, piece of
spaghetti."

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.020
Incredibly powerful superconducting magnets
keep the beams flying at nearly the speed

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.570
of light with the aim of making these proton
bunches hit.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.850
"We pass these thin hairs through each other,
and we get about 30 collisions.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.380
Most of the protons just miss each other and
they carry on around the ring, they come back

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.540
one turn later and they can do it again."

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.600
And the reason why they miss each other is
because atoms are mostly empty space.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.540
So getting them to collide is incredibly difficult.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.709
It would be like standing 10 kilometers apart
and trying to shoot two needle-thin arrows

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.740
at each other so they hit halfway.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.850
So, the key is to do this a LOT.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.550
"The target this year, to put it in context,
is about 800 million collisions a second,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.890
so we really have to work hard to get that
rate."

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.850
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS PER SECOND is insane,
imagine trying to control a proton traveling

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.700
at nearly the speed of light.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.760
To keep the bunches on track, the LHC uses
dipole magnets (two magnets).

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.640
But, when they need to steer the protons,
they use quadrupole magnets: four!9 One on

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.790
each compass point; applying three to four
hundred metric tons of force per meter…

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.790
"We take our pieces of spaghetti and focus
them down with very strong Quadrupole Magnets,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.420
which are like lenses, to get them down to
the diameter of a human hair as we pass them

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.240
through each other in the center of the experiments."

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.800
And that’s why the LHC is in the business
of collisions.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.170
The LHC is sort of like your power company,
but they're not providing electricity, instead

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.960
they're generating collisions.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.380
More collisions, more better!

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.840
They spend all their effort to try and get
these bunches of hydrogen ions to hit INSIDE

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.450
of other scientists' experiments.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.020
Of course, having a collision is great, but
if a proton collides in the woods and no one's

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.730
there does it make a boson?

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.510
Who knows.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.270
Scientists still have be watching at just
the right fraction of a second, to discover

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.800
a new particle.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.340
Thats where the "experiments" come in.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.730
They sit on the LHC ring at collision points8,
and they're probably what you think of when

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.660
you hear Large Hadron Collider.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.550
The famous ones are ATLAS and CMS which spotted
the famous Higgs-Boson back in 2013.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.660
"it's called C-M-S Compact Muon Solenoid however
it is really not compact.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.560
It's a relative term, as you can see, nothing
of that size is compact."

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.690
Dr. Talika Bose, sits in the control room
of the CMS waiting for an exciting collision

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.540
to happen inside her three-story science experiment,
thanks to the LHC.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.280
"Every twenty five nanoseconds… you have
a bunch colliding with another bunch.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.150
You may have a proton here and a proton there,
which has a heart.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.030
What we call shattering a heart event and
out of that come out a whole mess of particles"

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.740
This is what she's talking about.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.170
When two protons collide, it looks like this.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.880
To you and me this may look like a whole mess
of particle parts but to Dr. Bose, this ‘mess’

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.270
can actually tell you what’s inside a proton.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.480
"There are two important pieces of information
that we get from this, one is whether it's

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.970
curving this way or it's curving that way.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.420
That tell us whether it's positively charged
or negatively charged.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.020
Then how large is the radius of curvature,
because it could be curving like this or it

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:46.710
could be curving in a much larger radius and
this has a direct relationship with essentially

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.730
what the velocity and consequently what the
momentum of the particle is."

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.980
And this is why the LHC is awesome.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.889
Dr. Bose is basically watching millions of
proton car crashes in order to reverse-engineer

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.540
the automobile.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.260
Smashing atoms together can reveal what they're
made of!

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.240
But instead of injectors, plastics, steel
and glass, physicists find neutrons, kaons,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.160
pions, muons, and neutrinos.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.870
By the way, physicists call particles made
of these things…

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.940
HADRONS.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.830
Hence the name LARGE.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.050
HADRON.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.280
COLLIDER.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.530
Proton collisions like these help physicists
reveal exactly what these tiny structures

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.760
that make up our universe are made of.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.830
The technology is super advanced, but the
science is the same as it's always been.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:06:01.090
We're simply breaking things apart, hoping
to understand how they tick.
