00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.420
&gt;&gt; Hello.
Each day of the year, bad news coming out

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:14.370
of Iran.
Iran's government violating people's right

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.100
in fundamental ways.
Just yesterday, two young men, one at age

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.970
of 19 and another at age of
35, were executed.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:36.350
And this is very sad.
Iran's government giving any excuse and force

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.780
them to confess against
theirself in prison.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.329
Then later under this condition, they execute
them.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.719
The government like to terrorize people of
Iran to not come to the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.719
street.
I think this is responsibility of international

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:07.200
community, raise their
criticism toward Iran's government.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.150
I think this is the right time that United
Nations Secretary appoint a

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.540
special envoy on Iran's affairs.
Human rights condition is getting worse and

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.229
worse in Iran.
And I am requesting everybody especially,

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:37.730
hold economic from members,
could take responsibility to raise the criticism

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.590
regarding human rights
issue.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.060
Thank you.
