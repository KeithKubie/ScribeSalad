and the right hemisphere is specialized
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.310

the left hemisphere has a pretty well

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
the left hemisphere has a pretty well
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.859
the left hemisphere has a pretty well
organized microstructure and the right

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
organized microstructure and the right
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.139
organized microstructure and the right
hemisphere is more diffuse as well and

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149
 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.639
that's true in left-handed males in

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649
that's true in left-handed males in
 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.440
that's true in left-handed males in
particular so the circuitry can be

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
particular so the circuitry can be
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.810
particular so the circuitry can be
switched around a bit but it's okay the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
switched around a bit but it's okay the
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.730
switched around a bit but it's okay the
modules are basically the same although

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
modules are basically the same although
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.830
modules are basically the same although
they can be moved a little bit but

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
they can be moved a little bit but
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.810
they can be moved a little bit but
Goldberg thought that it isn't language

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
Goldberg thought that it isn't language
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.380
Goldberg thought that it isn't language
versus non language it's routine versus

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
versus non language it's routine versus
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.289
versus non language it's routine versus
novelty and so the left hemisphere and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299
novelty and so the left hemisphere and
 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.559
novelty and so the left hemisphere and

extraordinarily fast so that would be
like a snake reflex that can move you

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650
like a snake reflex that can move you
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.860

a reflex it doesn't even hit your brain

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230
a reflex it doesn't even hit your brain
 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.830
a reflex it doesn't even hit your brain
it's really super fast and then there's

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840
it's really super fast and then there's
 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.530
it's really super fast and then there's
a defensive Crouch that's that's

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540
a defensive Crouch that's that's
 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.750
a defensive Crouch that's that's

then there's the cognitive processing
and that all streams out across a time

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830
and that all streams out across a time
 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.710
and that all streams out across a time
span right and maybe that time span is

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720
span right and maybe that time span is
 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.930
span right and maybe that time span is
half a second so and that's really a

long time if something is attacking you
 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.370
long time if something is attacking you
so you got it those initial responses

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380
so you got it those initial responses
 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.750
so you got it those initial responses
are quite primitive but they're

there's subcortical structures that
 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.010
there's subcortical structures that
orient you towards novelty and prepare

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020
orient you towards novelty and prepare

and the right hemisphere seems to be
 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.410
and the right hemisphere seems to be
dominated by those systems so imagine

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420
dominated by those systems so imagine
 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.440

images about what it might be
 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.640
images about what it might be

they're frozen like a prey animal and
 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.280
they're frozen like a prey animal and
their right hemisphere is producing

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290
their right hemisphere is producing
 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.120
their right hemisphere is producing
monsters to inhabit the darkness that

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130
monsters to inhabit the darkness that
 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.640
monsters to inhabit the darkness that
are the child's hypotheses about what

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650
are the child's hypotheses about what
 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.120
are the child's hypotheses about what
might be out there okay because that's

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130
might be out there okay because that's
 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.370
might be out there okay because that's
what you want to know right you want to

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380
what you want to know right you want to
 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.320
what you want to know right you want to
know what's out there and then you want

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330
know what's out there and then you want
 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.540
know what's out there and then you want
to know what to do about it I can tell

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550
to know what to do about it I can tell
 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.520
to know what to do about it I can tell
you two kids dreams that are sort of

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530
you two kids dreams that are sort of
 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.820
you two kids dreams that are sort of
relevant to that so when my daughter was

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830
relevant to that so when my daughter was
 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.930
relevant to that so when my daughter was
about three she came into the bedroom

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940
about three she came into the bedroom
 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.270
about three she came into the bedroom
that my wife and I had and she was

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280
that my wife and I had and she was
 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.520
that my wife and I had and she was
crying she'd had a nightmare and she

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530
crying she'd had a nightmare and she
 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.060
crying she'd had a nightmare and she
said that she saw a stream and there was

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070
said that she saw a stream and there was
 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.550
said that she saw a stream and there was
garbage all over the stream and she

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560
garbage all over the stream and she
 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.680
garbage all over the stream and she
didn't like that and so I sat her down

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690
didn't like that and so I sat her down
 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.530
didn't like that and so I sat her down
okay so imagine the stream with the

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540
okay so imagine the stream with the
 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.940
okay so imagine the stream with the
garbage in it now imagine that you're

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950
garbage in it now imagine that you're
 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.320
garbage in it now imagine that you're
taking the garbage out and throwing it

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330
taking the garbage out and throwing it
 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.620
taking the garbage out and throwing it
in the garbage bin and so she and I got

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630
in the garbage bin and so she and I got
 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.570
in the garbage bin and so she and I got
her to like visualize that because that

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580
her to like visualize that because that
 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.220
her to like visualize that because that
kind of puts her back in the semi dream

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230
kind of puts her back in the semi dream
 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.290
kind of puts her back in the semi dream
state and then she cleaned up the mess

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300
state and then she cleaned up the mess
 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.940
state and then she cleaned up the mess
and then she could go off to sleep

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950
and then she could go off to sleep
 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.890
and then she could go off to sleep
now you you could tell the child don't

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900
now you you could tell the child don't
 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.930
now you you could tell the child don't
worry about the dream isn't real that's

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940
worry about the dream isn't real that's
 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.880
worry about the dream isn't real that's
not that's true because it's not real

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890
not that's true because it's not real
 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.940
not that's true because it's not real
like other daytime things are but it's

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950
like other daytime things are but it's
 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.730
like other daytime things are but it's
not like it's not real it's a dream like

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740
not like it's not real it's a dream like
 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.860
not like it's not real it's a dream like
a dream is real it's just not the same

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870
a dream is real it's just not the same
 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.490
a dream is real it's just not the same
kind of real and so what I did with her

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500
kind of real and so what I did with her
 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.000
kind of real and so what I did with her
was to indicate to her practically that

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010
was to indicate to her practically that
 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.770
was to indicate to her practically that
if she saw something a normal us

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780
if she saw something a normal us
 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.420
if she saw something a normal us
something that was out of place right

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430
something that was out of place right
 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.820
something that was out of place right
something that was a mess that it was

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830
something that was a mess that it was
 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.600
something that was a mess that it was
within her capacity to set it right okay

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610
within her capacity to set it right okay
 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.720
within her capacity to set it right okay
and so okay so now your right hemisphere

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730
and so okay so now your right hemisphere
 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.930
and so okay so now your right hemisphere
tells you what monsters might inhabit

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940
tells you what monsters might inhabit
 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.720
tells you what monsters might inhabit
the darkness now what you have to do is

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730
the darkness now what you have to do is
 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.340
the darkness now what you have to do is
figure out there's two things you have

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350
figure out there's two things you have
 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.130
figure out there's two things you have
to figure out one is what to do about a

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140
to figure out one is what to do about a
 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.520
to figure out one is what to do about a
given monster and now there is to do

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530
given monster and now there is to do
 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.530
given monster and now there is to do
what about is to figure out what to do

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540
what about is to figure out what to do
 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.430
what about is to figure out what to do
about the class of all possible monsters

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440
about the class of all possible monsters
 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.960
about the class of all possible monsters
right that's a whole different thing

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970
right that's a whole different thing
 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.460
right that's a whole different thing
that's something that only human beings

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470
that's something that only human beings
 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.730
that's something that only human beings
are capable of that level of abstraction

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740
are capable of that level of abstraction
 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.290
are capable of that level of abstraction
right and so what you might do about a

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300
right and so what you might do about a
 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.110
right and so what you might do about a
particular monster is hide or go out and

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120
particular monster is hide or go out and
 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.020
particular monster is hide or go out and
get rid of it it was just an actual

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030
get rid of it it was just an actual
 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.180
get rid of it it was just an actual
animal right but that doesn't help

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190
animal right but that doesn't help
 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.680
animal right but that doesn't help
because there's all the other potential

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690
because there's all the other potential
 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.960
because there's all the other potential
predators that are still there and so

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970
predators that are still there and so
 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.460
predators that are still there and so
maybe you can go hon to all them down

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470
maybe you can go hon to all them down
 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.140
maybe you can go hon to all them down
but that doesn't help either because you

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150
but that doesn't help either because you
 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.659
but that doesn't help either because you
you can't hunt them all down it's not or

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669
you can't hunt them all down it's not or
 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.909
you can't hunt them all down it's not or
it's not very likely anyways so instead

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919
it's not very likely anyways so instead
 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.470
it's not very likely anyways so instead
what you have to do is figure out how to

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480
what you have to do is figure out how to
 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.090
what you have to do is figure out how to
configure yourself so that you're in the

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100
configure yourself so that you're in the
 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.280
configure yourself so that you're in the
best possible position to fight off the

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290
best possible position to fight off the
 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.440
best possible position to fight off the
monsters when they come that's your best

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450
monsters when they come that's your best
 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.600
monsters when they come that's your best
bet
