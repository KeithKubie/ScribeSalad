00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.490
LIZ NOLAN: I like
to solve problems.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.850
And I think I have a fascination
with the natural world.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.390
And those merge well in
the context of science.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.700
Not all bacteria are harmful.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.950
And in fact, if you
consider a person

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.640
on a cell-per-cell basis,
there are more bacterial cells

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.930
in us or on us than are
eukaryotic or human cells.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.860
Many bacteria help us out, maybe
with the digestion of food.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.250
But other types of bacteria
have the propensity

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.680
to invade tissues
or produce toxins.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.260
And so if their populations
get out of check,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.030
they make us sick.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.550
Just like humans or any
animal, bacteria need food.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.250
In my lab, we're particularly
interested in metal ions.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.040
And you might not think of
metal ions as being food,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.180
but they are essential
nutrients for all organisms.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.840
Bacteria seeking to
colonize or survive

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.180
within the host
environment need methods

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.760
to acquire certain metals.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.560
We respond first by using
our innate immune response.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.130
MEGAN BROPHY: So
it's kind of gross,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.750
but you can see some protein.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.770
And then you have fat
on top where it's shiny.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.790
I work with a human protein
called calprotectin.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.990
And it's secreted in response
to bacterial infection.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.000
And when it encounters
these bacteria,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.940
it chelates, so it grabs
onto zinc and manganese

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.030
in the environment and
starves the bacteria.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.310
LIZ NOLAN: So zinc is
an essential nutrient.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.700
And the general idea is
that calprotectin is somehow

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.920
acting as a sponge.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.400
In my lab, we over-express
and purify calprotectin

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.550
or [? mutants ?] where
we have systematically

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.780
changed an amino acid we think
is important for calprotectin's

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.370
mechanism and then utilize
this purified protein

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.070
in a suite of studies.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.780
We can come to conclusions about
where the metal binds and how.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.530
We can also do experiments
called titrations

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.220
that allow us to determine
how tightly the metal

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.240
binds to a particular site and
also what the selectivity is--

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.520
so does calprotectin
have a preference?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.640
Does it prefer to bind
zinc over manganese,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.980
over some other
metal ion or not?

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.540
In high school, I didn't like
my chemistry class very much.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.720
And that motivated me to
take chemistry first thing

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.710
in college.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.690
And I loved it.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.840
I liked that it
was quantitative.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.900
And I felt it overlapped
well with courses

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.480
I took in biology and geology.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.760
And when I ultimately
decided on a major,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.520
I found chemistry the
most appealing because

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.070
of its broad
applicability and ability

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.130
to bring a molecular-level
understanding

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.560
to very complex questions.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.610
