00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.950
With countless movies filmed and released
every year, it's strange to think that one

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.031
of cinemas greatest achievements could be
taking shape at any given moment. But for

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:18.730
every movie that makes it to theaters, there
are hundreds of others that never get that

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.820
far. Sometimes, those failed films have so
much talent behind and in front of the camera,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.300
movie fans have to wonder just what masterpieces
could have been created if things had gone

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.130
differently. After you watch the video make
sure you let us know if we missed some in

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.280
the comments below! Here are Screen Rant's
10 Best Movies NEVER Made.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.339
Darren Aronofsky’s “Batman: Year One”

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.339
When the Batman movie series became a laughing
stock back in the late 90s, Warner Bros. knew

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.489
they needed a reboot. But before Christopher
Nolan was ever interviewed, the studio turned

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.559
to an even more unlikely name: Darren Aronofsky,
the mind behind the dark drug drama Requiem

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.210
For a Dream. The director's plan was to adapt
the origin story "Batman: Year One" with the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.320
comic's original writer Frank Miller handling
the script. His vision of Bruce Wayne made

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.590
Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy seem like fantasy,
with an orphaned Bruce Wayne relying on acid

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.510
and chemical bombs instead of high tech gadgets,
and a Batmobile built out of a Lincoln Continental.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.750
In the end, Aronofsky's R-Rated, ultra violent
story went too far, and he went on to make

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.900
The Wrestler and Black Swan. But it convinced
Warner Bros. that a darker, grounded Batman

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.480
was the way to go - and the director's top
choice for the role - Christian Bale - was

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.740
wearing the cape in no time.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.920
Paul Verhoeven’s “Crusade”

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.070
In the early 90s, no action star was more
reliable than Arnold Schwarzenegger. So when

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.850
the actor mentioned to director Paul Verhoeven
that he was a history buff on the set of Total

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.270
Recall, the director realized his dream of
a brutal film set in the First Crusade could

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.480
become a reality. With Arnold hot off of Terminator
2, and Verhoeven off of Robocop, the production

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.950
of Crusade moved ahead quickly. The film cast
Arnold as a slave recruited into the war,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.160
uncovering the uglier political side to the
crusades, making it a smarter film than most

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.700
audiences would expect, given its extreme
violence. The studio doubted the 100 million

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.800
dollar movie would be a hit, and pulled the
plug. Arnold got paid anyway, but his fans

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.490
were robbed of what might have been one of
his most iconic roles.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.040
Jodorowsky’s “Dune”

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.260
Frank Herbert's epic space adventure was a
bestselling novel, but the movie version remains

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:25.111
one of Hollywood's most profound duds. But
things could have been different. Years before,

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:29.210
director Alejandro Jodorowsky had tried to
adapt the book to film, crafting one of the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.740
most ambitious movie productions of all time.
Getting the likes of Orson Welles, Mick Jagger,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.239
and Salvador Dali on board was hard enough,
but the director also had his own son spend

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.639
two years training in martial arts to play
the highly trained young hero. In the end,

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:47.189
the studios got cold feet on his outlandish
vision - but the assembled talent didn't disappear.

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.159
Artist H. R. Giger stuck around to reshape
Hollywood horror with Alien, a movie written

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.120
by Dune's screenwriter. The recent documentary
"Jodorowsky's Dune" revealed just how many

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.200
fantasy and sci-fi films took inspiration,
or entire scenes, right from the director's

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200
vision.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.969
George Miller’s “Justice League Mortal”

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.639
DC comics fans are set to receive a shared
Justice League movie universe before long,

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.100
but things would have been very, very different
if WB's previous plans had worked out. Before

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.310
director George Miller shocked the world with
Mad Max Fury Road, he was set to introduce

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.970
a brand new take on the Justice League back
in 2007, with special effects and costumes

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.680
designed by the minds behind the Lord of the
Rings trilogy. Casting Armie Hammer as Batman,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.060
Megan Gale as Wonder Woman (she plays the
Valkyrie, the naked woman Furiosa meets when

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.349
she arrives at “the green place” in Mad
Max), Common as Green Lantern and Fury Road's

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.419
own villain as the Martian Manhunter, the
stars got as far as costume fittings before

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.849
the Hollywood writers strike brought the movie
to a standstill. It never regained momentum,

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.620
so the plan of seeing a young, sci-fi/fantasy
Justice League hit theaters not long after

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.939
Iron Man just wasn't meant to be.

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.370
Sergio Leone’s “Leningrad”

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.049
What would happen if the director who redefined
Westerns decided to tackle a World War 2 drama?

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.209
We'll never know the answer, but after Sergio
Leone made Clint Eastwood a household name,

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.620
his shift into American cinema didn't go too
well. After his American crime drama Once

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.159
Upon a Time in America was heavily edited
by the studio, Leone was determined to work

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.569
with star Robert De Niro on an even bigger
epic. Based on a real life account of the

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.819
900-day siege of Leningrad in World War 2,
De Niro would play an American trapped in

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.120
the city, with the 100 million dollar film's
opening shot one of the longest continuous

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.700
scenes in history. Sadly, Leone would die
of a heart attack just two days before he

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.700
would have signed on to direct.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.250
Steven Spielberg’s “Night Skies”

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.330
After Close Encounters of The Third Kind turned
out to be a massive success, the studio was

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.389
begging for a sequel from director Steven
Spielberg. But instead of friendly aliens,

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.030
it was a darker story he had in mind. Based
on actual events, "Night Skies" would have

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.620
followed a family on a Kentucky farm terrorized
by alien invaders. Realizing the story might

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.410
be too dark for his tastes, Spielberg lined
up The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Tobe Hooper,

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.210
with the aliens designed by effects legend
Rick Baker. It seemed a perfect recipe for

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.150
success, but script problems stalled the film,
and Spielberg would eventually work elements

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.440
of the treatment into E.T. and Poltergeist.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.100
Francis Ford Coppola’s “Megalopolis”

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.710
It's hard to believe that the director of
films like The Godfather and Apocalypse Now

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.680
could have tried to reach even higher heights,
but after those acclaimed dramas, Francis

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.849
Ford Coppola had his mind set on sci-fi. Set
in a future New York City, "Megalopolis" would

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.260
follow an architect setting out to create
a small-scale Utopia - not unlike the ideas

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.720
behind the similarly claimed BioShock series
of video games. The director was so committed

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.440
to his pet project, he helmed Dracula, Jack
and The Rainmaker just so the studio would

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.009
fund his big budget production. Megalopolis
would have been a New York story at its core,

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:38.919
but when the 9/11 attacks changed what that
would mean for the foreseeable future, Coppola

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.659
had no choice but to abandon the project.

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:44.220
The Beatles in: “The Lord of The Rings”

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.000
We know what you're thinking: this has to
be an idea thought up on a whim that could

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.030
never have been made, right? Not quite. A
decade after J. R. R. Tolkien's story was

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.190
published, it was impossible to tell just
how famous the series would become, which

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.110
meant acquiring the rights to a feature film
was entirely possible. It just so happened

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.020
that The Beatles were the hottest property
in the world at the time, dominating the box

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.780
office with Help!, Hard Day's Night and Yellow
Submarine. It was John Lennon who sought the

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.990
rights to the story, hoping to play Gollum
with Paul McCartney starring as Frodo, Ringo

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.479
Starr as Sam, and George Harrison as Gandalf.
The band had even approached Stanley Kubrick

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.159
to direct, so no matter how against the idea
Tolkien turned out to be, it's impossible

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:27.689
to think about the epic film trilogy that
might have been...

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:28.810
Hitchcock’s “Kaleidoscope”

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:34.360
No matter how good a director may be, their
time at the top usually has an expiry date.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.771
In the case of Alfred Hitchcock, the mind
behind mystery, suspense, and horror films

00:06:37.771 --> 00:06:42.190
that revolutionized filmmaking was determined
to change with the times. With the rise of

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.180
edgier, realistic films in the 1960s, Hitchcock
decided to use his imagination. His brilliant

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.400
idea: to tell a story from a serial killer's
perspective, with a realistic look at sex,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.090
nudity and violence, filmed in real New York
locations with handheld cameras. The director

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.759
was so determined to redefine his style, he
wrote the script himself, along with 450 perfectly

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:08.561
detailed camera shots, and even filmed test
footage to prove his vision. But the studio

00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:12.880
said it was all too risky, and talked him
into sticking with his existing brand. And

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.430
the movie that could have been Hitchcock’s
masterpiece, and years ahead of its time,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.789
never came to be.

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:19.840
Tim Burton’s “Superman Lives”

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.500
He may be known for some stranger movies these
days, but director Tim Burton beat the odds

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.319
when he made Batman as famous on film as he
was in the comics. So it seemed like a no-brainer

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:34.400
to let him tackle a Superman reboot too. Superman
Lives was scrapped, but as the years passed,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.539
more and more unbelievable details trickled
out. It was only when photos of Nicolas Cage

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:42.569
wearing a Super suit appeared that fans realized
the movie would have been one for the ages

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:46.469
- no matter how it turned out. But with a
fragmented script that would have seen Lex

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:52.030
Luthor and Brainiac merge into a single being
- Lexiac - it might've been for the best.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.030
Conclusion

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.081
Those are some of our favorite films that
never made it to the big screen, but do you

00:07:56.081 --> 00:08:00.120
have any others you think would have been
worthwhile? Be sure to share them in the comments,
