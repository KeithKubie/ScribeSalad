00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.610
&gt;&gt; Alright, so I'm just going to drag these down. Let's see. Where

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.370
do I want to drag them to, down to Band Detail I guess.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but not above the name.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.910
&gt;&gt; Oh, not above the name. Right. And I'll do that for all of them.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.370
&gt;&gt; Yup. And so you have columns so you

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.470
can drag those fields to the other side also.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.050
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right, cool. So I'll put my contact information

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.250
on the right column. I'll put this other stuff over here.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.800
&gt;&gt; And if you wanted to,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.650
at the top here, it says you can drag sections. So you can

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.775
even create new headers for more information, like if we had a finite

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:35.860
set of stuff that was only about the stage, we could possibly drag

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.780
down a section and name it like stage information or something like that.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.780
&gt;&gt; Cool. Okay, so that wasn't so bad. I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.310
just had to drag all these fields on. I think

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.860
I still prefer using the Wizard, though, because I like

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.312
that it does everything for me. Schema Builder's cool, though.

00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:50.670
&gt;&gt; I mean,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.310
there are tradeoffs to both. Definitely with

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.850
the Wizard it allows you to, you know,

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.440
do everything you might want to do from security

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.030
to field creation in one clean sweep. But

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.280
if we would say, knew our entire data

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.710
model, right from the beginning, it would probably

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.040
be pretty tedious to have to go through

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.200
the seven steps for let's say, 100 fields.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.455
&gt;&gt; Right,

00:01:07.455 --> 00:01:07.540
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.130
&gt;&gt; But dragging them all, you know, in the Schema Builder

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.740
it allows you do to a lot at once really quickly.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.650
&gt;&gt; Okay, makes sense.
