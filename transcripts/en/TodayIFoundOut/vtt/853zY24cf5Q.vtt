00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:17.449
There’s a perception that religion and science
go together about as well as mayonnaise and

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.449
marshmallows.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.880
In some instances, this is, perhaps, true.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.470
But on a typically warm Southern California
January in 1933 at the California Institute

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.810
of Technology in Pasadena, California (the
same place and same time that Jack Parsons

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.870
of rocket science fame was doing his experiments
— history intersecting!), religion and science

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.020
proved that these two ideals didn’t have
to be enemies.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.319
On that day, some of the greatest science
luminaries of the time from around the world,

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:45.079
Edwin Hubble and Albert Einstein to name two,
gathered to hear a series of lectures.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.510
But it was one man and one lecture that caused
Albert Einstein to declare, “This is the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.999
most beautiful and satisfactory explanation
of creation to which I ever listened.”

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.959
It is well known that on the eve of the Third
Reich’s rise, Einstein left his homeland

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:00.920
of Germany for the United States.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.500
But few know that traveling with him was Belgian
Catholic priest Georges Lemaitre, a man that

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.470
Einstein greatly respected.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.689
Georges Lemaitre was a religious man, but
also a great scientist himself, a cosmologist

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.689
in fact.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.340
He studied the universe and, most notably,
its beginnings.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.469
His research, beliefs, and conclusions greatly
influence the way we understand our very existence

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:22.469
today.

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.080
Born in 1894 in Charleroi, Belgium, Georges
took an early interest in figuring out how

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.469
things around him worked.

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.970
He began his studies in civil engineering
at the Catholic University of Leuven, the

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.590
largest French-speaking university in Belgium.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.469
He took a break from his studies to serve
in the Belgian army as an officer during World

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:39.469
War I.

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.360
He performed admirably and, at the end of
the war, he received a Belgian War Cross,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.939
an award for bravery on the battlefield.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.729
He, then, returned to the university and earned
degrees in mathematics and philosophy.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.179
Ever since Georges’ was a young boy, he
embraced religion and understood the relation

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.539
it could have with science.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.350
He emulated his former teacher, Cardinal Desire
Mercier, who held progressive beliefs on philosophy

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.350
and cosmology.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.899
So, instead of entering a life of academia,
he entered the priesthood.

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.509
On September 23, 1923, Lemaître was ordained
as a priest by his spiritual teacher, Cardinal

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.509
Mercier.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.720
During his spare time, (now) Father Lemaître
continued his scientific studies, especially

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.569
on the theories of general and special relativity.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.909
Cardinal Mercier, recognizing Lemaître’s
talents, allowed him to go study at the prestigious

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.250
Harvard Observatory.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.620
During the same time, Lemaître earned a Ph.D
in physics from MIT.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.860
Lemaitre’s considerable and varied studies
allowed him to cross paths with other noted

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.319
astronomers and cosmologists of the day, including
George Hale (discoverer of solar vortices

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.840
and magnetic sunspots) and Vesto Slipher (galactic
redshifts and oversaw the discovery of Pluto),

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.549
which had a great influence on his later findings.

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.189
It was at this time that Lemaitre came up
with a profound theory that still impacts

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.269
our study of the universe today.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.269
In 1927, he published his article “A Homogeneous
Universe of Constant Mass and Increasing Radius

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.099
accounting for the Radial Velocity of Extra
Galactic Nebulae.”

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.379
In it, he proposed and described his theory
of an expanding universe.

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.019
Using Einstein’s theory of relativity as
a guide, Lemaitre speculated that space is

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.750
constantly expanding and, therefore, the distance
between galaxies is also increasing.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.010
Later, Hubble would demonstrate the same thing
and even to this day is generally given credit

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.659
for coming up with the idea.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.110
Further, Lemaître discovered what has since
become known as “Hubble’s law,” a rate

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.110
of expansion related to the galaxies’ distance
from Earth.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.870
Lemaître also derived what is now known as
“Hubble’s Constant.”

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.159
In both of these instances, he did this before
Hubble published his work concerning these

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.980
same revolutionary ideas.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.980
Hubble’s real contribution in this case
was to provide the observational basis for

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.349
Lemaitre’s mostly mathematically-based theory.

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.590
Unfortunately for Lemaître, his Nobel Prize-worthy
paper (though at the time astronomers couldn’t

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.780
win Nobel Prizes for their work in astronomy
as it wasn’t yet considered part of Physics)

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.780
had little impact on the scientific community
due to it being published in a journal hardly

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.110
read outside of Belgium.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.260
But one man in particular read it, Albert
Einstein.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.099
Lemaître and Einstein met for the first time
in 1927 at the famed fifth Solvay Conference

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.300
in Brussels.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.090
Impressed with Lemaître’s findings, but
not swayed, he told him, “Your calculations

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.130
are correct, but your physics are abominable.”

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.810
Essentially, Einstein thought Lemaître’s
math was correct but what the math seemed

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.430
to show was not.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.630
In 1931, wishing to make his theories more
widely read, Lemaître sent his article to

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.330
Sir Arthur Eddington, a British astrophysicist
and someone who wanted to make scientific

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.840
theories accessible to everyone.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.970
(He was the one who announced and helped explain
to the English-speaking world Einstein’s

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.500
theory of relativity when he was a still a
German-based scientist.)

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.170
Eddington translated Lemaître’s work and
had it published in the “Monthly Notices

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.940
of the Royal Astronomical Society,” a peer-review
journal still in existence today.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.750
After this publishing, it became apparent
to both skeptics and Lemaître himself that

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.190
there was something missing from this theory.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.810
The universe is continuously expanding, but
when and how did the expansion begin?

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.830
This left Lemaître perplexed, but like a
good scientist, he kept questioning.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.830
Only a few months later, using Eddington’s
1931 talk about the end of the universe entitled

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.570
“On the End of the World From the Standpoint
of Mathematical Physics” as a guide, Lemaître

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.110
came up with another groundbreaking theory.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.110
In a May 9, 1931 letter to Nature journal
(also still published today and has been since

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.140
1869) Lemaître wrote:

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.670
If the world has begun with a single quantum,
the notions of space and time would altogether

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.890
fail to have any meaning at the beginning;
they would only begin to have a sensible meaning

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.860
when the original quantum had been divided
into a sufficient number of quanta.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.770
If this suggestion is correct, the beginning
of the world happened a little before the

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.940
beginning of space and time.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.770
This would be coined later in a collection
of essays in 1950 by Lemaître as “The Primeval

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.500
Atom,” where he would also refer to the
the beginning as a “now without yesterday,”

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.210
or mistranslated and more popularly known
as “the day without yesterday.”

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.880
This was the foundation of what would become
known as the“Big Bang Theory,” after several

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.530
other scientists would add to Lemaître’s
theory.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.710
Many skeptics of the time did not agree with
this origin theory.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.900
They believed that Lemaître’s religious
background clouded his scientific process.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.480
Essentially, what Lemaître was claiming,
according to critics, was that something somehow

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.910
had to have created the “primeval atom,”
leaving open the possibility of a greater

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:12.910
being.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.030
In fact, Pope Pious XII proclaimed in 1952
that the big-bang theory affirmed the notion

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.470
of a “transcendental creator” and, therefore,
was in harmony with Catholic dogma.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.500
As for Lemaître, he did not appreciate the
Pope’s assessment and argued vehemently

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.330
with him over the issue, trying to get the
Pope to stop using his work as an argument

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.790
for creationism, preferring that his work
stand on its own or not, without allowing

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.230
religious ideas to cloud people’s perception
of it.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.070
(Ironically, given Lemaître’s math and
theories were generally sound given the state

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.850
of scientific knowledge of the day, in many
of these cases it was the dissenting scientists

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.050
allowing their own bias’s to influence their
perception of Lemaître’s work.)

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.382
Despite the conflict, Lemaître detailed all
of these theories to an awe-inspired audience

00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:59.000
in 1933 at the aforementioned conference in
Pasadena, California.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.110
When he was finished and Einstein proclaimed
his now-famous quote, New York Times writer

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.530
Duncan Aikman, who was covering the conference,
took a picture of the two scientists together

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.840
with the caption, “They have a profound
respect and admiration for each other.”

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.710
In the same article, Aikman continued,

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.760
‘There is no conflict between religion and
science,’ Lemaitre has been telling audiences

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.840
over and over again in this country …. His
view is interesting and important not because

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.950
he is a Catholic priest, not because he is
one of the leading mathematical physicists

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:54.040
of our time, but because he 

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.880
is both.
