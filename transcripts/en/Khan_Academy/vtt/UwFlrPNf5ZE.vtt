00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:02.230
- [Instructor] What I'd
like to do in this video

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.424
is get an intuitive sense
for what the derivative

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:07.034
with respect to x of sine of x is

00:00:07.034 --> 00:00:10.575
and what the derivative with
respect to x of cosine of x is.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.491
And I've graphed y is equal
to cosine of x in blue

00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:16.765
and y is equal to sine of x in red.

00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:18.585
We're not going to prove
what the derivatives are,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.131
but we're gonna know what they
are, get an intuitive sense

00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:23.600
and in future videos
we'll actually do a proof.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.333
So let's start with sine of x.

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.746
So the derivative can be viewed

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:28.486
as the slope of the tangent line.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.185
So for example at this
point right over here,

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:35.352
it looks like the slope of our
tangent line should be zero.

00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:40.391
So our derivative function
should be zero at that x value.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:46.042
Similarly, over here, it looks
like the derivative is zero.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.642
Slope of the tangent line would be zero.

00:00:49.642 --> 00:00:53.441
So whatever our derivative
function is at that x value,

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:55.691
it should be equal to zero.

00:00:57.233 --> 00:00:59.333
If we look right over here on sine of x,

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:02.389
it looks like the slope
of the tangent line

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:05.269
would be pretty close to one.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.110
If that is the case, then
in our derivative function

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.573
when x is equal to zero

00:01:09.573 --> 00:01:12.692
that derivative function
should be equal to one.

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:14.914
Similarly, over here, it looks like

00:01:14.914 --> 00:01:17.953
the slope of the tangent
line is negative one,

00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:20.494
which tells us that
the derivative function

00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:24.661
should be hitting the value of
negative one at that x value.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:28.590
So you're probably seeing
something interesting emerge.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.521
Everywhere, while we're trying to plot

00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:34.218
the slope of the tangent
line, it seems to coincide

00:01:34.218 --> 00:01:37.368
with y is equal to cosine of x.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:40.700
And it is indeed the case that
the derivative of sine of x

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.278
is equal to cosine of x.

00:01:43.278 --> 00:01:44.717
And you can see that it makes sense,

00:01:44.717 --> 00:01:47.058
not just at the points we
tried, but even in the trends.

00:01:47.058 --> 00:01:50.097
If you look at sine of x
here, the slope is one,

00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:52.859
but then it becomes less
and less and less positive

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.416
all the way until it becomes zero.

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:57.446
Cosine of x, the value
of the function is one

00:01:57.446 --> 00:01:59.298
and it becomes less and less positive

00:01:59.298 --> 00:02:01.733
all the way until it equals zero.

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.684
And you could keep doing
that type of analysis

00:02:03.684 --> 00:02:05.006
to feel good about it.

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:08.370
In another video we're going
to prove this more rigorously.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.580
So now let's think about cosine of x.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.703
So cosine of x, right over here,

00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:15.712
the slope of the tangent line

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:17.786
looks like it is zero.

00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:19.109
And so it's derivative function

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.090
needs to be zero at that point.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.229
So, hey, maybe it's sine of x.

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:24.867
Let's keep trying this.

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:27.747
So over here, cosine of x,

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:32.727
it looks like the slope of the
tangent line is negative one

00:02:32.727 --> 00:02:36.240
and so we would want the
derivative to go through

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.695
that point right over there.

00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:40.337
All right this is starting to seem,

00:02:40.337 --> 00:02:41.889
it doesn't seem like the
derivative of cosine of x

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.335
could be sine of x.

00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:46.040
In fact, this is the opposite
of what sine of x is doing.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.008
Sine of x is at one, not
negative one at that point.

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:50.266
But that's an interesting theory,

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:54.712
maybe the derivative of cosine
of x is negative sine of x.

00:02:54.712 --> 00:02:56.295
So let's plot that.

00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.388
So this does seem to coincide.

00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:04.779
The derivative of cosine of x
here looks like negative one,

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.102
the slope of a tangent line

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:10.026
and negative sign of this
x value is negative one.

00:03:10.026 --> 00:03:12.354
Over here the derivative of cosine of x

00:03:12.354 --> 00:03:14.061
looks like it is zero

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:17.962
and negative sine of x is indeed zero.

00:03:17.962 --> 00:03:20.364
So it actually turns
out that it is the case,

00:03:20.364 --> 00:03:24.531
that the derivative of cosine
of x is negative sine of x.

00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:27.471
So these are really good to know.

00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:29.061
These are kind of fundamental

00:03:29.061 --> 00:03:31.194
trigonometric derivatives to know.

00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:33.238
We'll be able to derive
other things for them.

00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:35.690
And hopefully this video gives
you a good intuitive sense

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.072
of why this is true.

00:03:37.072 --> 00:03:40.655
And in future videos, we
will prove it rigorously.
