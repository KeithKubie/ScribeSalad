00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230
are calling themselves bitches and it's
 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.099
are calling themselves bitches and it's
the end it's it's meant as a compliment

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109
the end it's it's meant as a compliment
 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.130
the end it's it's meant as a compliment
to themselves so how do lexicographers

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140
to themselves so how do lexicographers
 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.520
to themselves so how do lexicographers
deal with that with this idea that that

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530
deal with that with this idea that that
 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.650
deal with that with this idea that that
slurs get reclaimed but how do you

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660
slurs get reclaimed but how do you
 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.399
slurs get reclaimed but how do you
describe it and and every person has a

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409
describe it and and every person has a
 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.860
describe it and and every person has a
different reaction to the word bitch and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870
different reaction to the word bitch and
 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.390
different reaction to the word bitch and
that depends on the content

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400
that depends on the content
 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.060
that depends on the content
that's used in who uses it what kind of

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070
that's used in who uses it what kind of
 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.439
that's used in who uses it what kind of
mood they're in when they hear it

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449
mood they're in when they hear it
 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.540
mood they're in when they hear it
whether it's directed at them or not

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550
whether it's directed at them or not
 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.400
whether it's directed at them or not
whether they're using it of someone else

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410
whether they're using it of someone else
 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.560
whether they're using it of someone else
so it's a really difficult thing as a

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570
so it's a really difficult thing as a
 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.080
so it's a really difficult thing as a
lexicographer to come up with a just a

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090
lexicographer to come up with a just a
 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.960
lexicographer to come up with a just a
one-line definition that covers all of

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970
one-line definition that covers all of
 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.840
one-line definition that covers all of
