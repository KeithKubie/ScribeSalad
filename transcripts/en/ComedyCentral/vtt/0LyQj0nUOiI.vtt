00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.368 line:92%
In a shocking development,

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:04.771
conservative air horn
and thinking man's

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:08.674
swamp thing, Bill O'Reilly,
has been fired by Fox News.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:12.145
-(cheers and applause)
-Yeah! Yeah!

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.982
-Yeah!
-(chanting and whooping)

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.817
Big fans of that.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.118
This comes amid revelations

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.753
that the network paid out
multi millions

00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:22.855
to settle multiple
sexual harassment suits

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:24.857
involving
the famously-furious host.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.326
When he's not
aimlessly shouting

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.928
and harassing woman
who work for him,

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.064
O'Reilly moonlights
as the best-selling author of

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.365
 Killing Lincoln,

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:35.268
 Killing Kennedy 
and Killing Reagan.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.471
His next book will be
 Killing My Own Career.

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:42.876
(applause and cheering)

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:48.014
Bill's already transitioning
from the no-spin zone

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.649
to the no-job zone.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:53.219
On vacation today, he was
photographed meeting the pope.

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:54.554
(laughter)

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.023
Ugh! Guys...

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:59.992
Guys, I wonder
if he had anything to confess.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:02.795
I don't know.
Think about it.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:05.331
I mean, listen,
if you get fired for a raft

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:06.666
of sexual harassment charges,

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.035
you can always find a job
in the Catholic Church.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:10.470
Hey-oh!

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:12.305
-(applause and cheering)
-Come on, you guys.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:15.942
Hey-oh!

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:18.077
-That's wrong.
-Comedians, with the recent...

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.378
Four years of Catholic
high school.

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.947
Four years. Four years,
Catholic high school.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.015
With the recent departures
of O'Reilly and Megyn Kelly,

00:01:23.048 --> 00:01:26.586
it seems like the conservative
news network is either trying

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.788
to get rid of every Irish person
who works there,

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.490
or undergoing major changes.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:33.326
What is next for Fox News?
Marcella.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.596
I don't know, Chris, but it will
definitely be racist as (bleep).

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.631
HARDWICK:
All right. Points.

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:41.033
-(applause and cheering)
-Yeah!

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.202
-Chris.
-They'll use all these disasters

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:44.770
to justify never
hiring women again

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:46.139
because if they weren't around,

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.807
none of this (bleep)
would have happened.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.208
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.844
-That's their words, not mine.
-That's their... yeah.

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:54.013
-I like how you had to make the
clarification. -Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.515
Oh, that's them. That's not me.
I'm not saying...

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.250
-Yeah.
-That's not me. I love my mama.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.751
HARDWICK:
Ross Mar... Ross Marquand.

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.720
(imitating Clooney): Uh,
they're gonna get George Clooney

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.856
to come in there and do
 The Fantastic Mr. Fox News.

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.559
-(laughter) -HARDWICK: Oh,
that's fantastic. Oh, I wonder

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:09.128
if George Clooney were here
right now what he would say.

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:12.627
-Well, I just did that.
-Oh, there we go. -(laughter)
