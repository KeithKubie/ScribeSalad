00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.820
-You're a right-handed signer aren't you
Katherine? Is that right?

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.680
-Yes.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.240
-Okay.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.320
So that is your passive hand, yes?

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.320
And you're doing most of your signs with your right hand.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.140
And so we have a member of the
audience who can't hear what I'm saying.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.840
Mika can't hear what I'm saying but he's
in touch. And Katherine is able to sign

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.700
to him as fast as I can speak.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.220
Now there's a little experiment because

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.840
you're in the cradle of British
science, the crucible, so let's do a

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.420
little experiment.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.800
We've been talking about appearances 
and right and left handedness.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.560
Can a deaf person pick up the
message of sign language when it's

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.120
reflected in a mirror? We think so far as
we know that's a unique experiment and

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.760
this is the home of unique experiments
so if you would ask Mika to come down

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.720
and join us, we can do this experiment.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.100
Hello Mika, thank you very much for joining us.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.280
Would you like just to sit, just to stand there 
because it's important for seeing the reflections.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.420
And Katherine if you'll go round 
to the mirror, thank you very much.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.900
And why not say something to us
first, right?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.880
What I've forgotten to ask you was just to say
something to the audience specifically

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.020
in sign language, all right? So will you
say that for us, to the audience?

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.920
And then tell us what you've said.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.620
Thank you very much! What did you say?
-Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.630
-You'd never have guessed it, would you?
Very good!

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.740
Now, can we do the experiment of the
reflection of the sign?

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.880
Now I think the result of that experiment 
Katherine you're going to have to tell me.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.920
-I said "Hello Mika, It's nice to see you again".

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.480
-Very good and Mika could understand. 
-He said "It's nice to see you again too".

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.740
-So, this language is so effective that
 even when  the images are reversed,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.200
as we shall see at the very end of the lecture, communication is unaffected.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.720
Thank you very much indeed for 
coming and helping us with this demo.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.180
[APPLAUSE]
