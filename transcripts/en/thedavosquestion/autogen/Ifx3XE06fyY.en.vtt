productivity through credit and we had a

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349
productivity through credit and we had a
 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.140
productivity through credit and we had a
terrific set of panelists that brought

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
terrific set of panelists that brought
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.550
terrific set of panelists that brought
many different perspectives from the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
many different perspectives from the
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.019
many different perspectives from the
private sector from the public sector

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
private sector from the public sector
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.390
private sector from the public sector
and from from organizations that are

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400
and from from organizations that are
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.179
and from from organizations that are
focused on improving competitiveness we

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189
focused on improving competitiveness we
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.310
focused on improving competitiveness we
had a wide-ranging discussion the themes

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
had a wide-ranging discussion the themes
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.019
had a wide-ranging discussion the themes
that that really came through very

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
that that really came through very
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.509
that that really came through very
strongly were first that well the first

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519
strongly were first that well the first
 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.030
strongly were first that well the first
and obvious point is that improving

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040
and obvious point is that improving
 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.370
and obvious point is that improving
credit access is essential to driving

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
credit access is essential to driving
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.350
credit access is essential to driving
growth in the emerging markets and we

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
growth in the emerging markets and we
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660
growth in the emerging markets and we
see that around the world and that's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
see that around the world and that's
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.220
see that around the world and that's
true not just for very large

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
true not just for very large
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.660
true not just for very large
institutions but for very small

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
institutions but for very small
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.810
institutions but for very small
companies and entrepreneurs as well and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
companies and entrepreneurs as well and
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.580
companies and entrepreneurs as well and
then the question is how to do that and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590
then the question is how to do that and
 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.440
then the question is how to do that and
how to do that in ways that are really

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450
how to do that in ways that are really
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.690
how to do that in ways that are really
lasting and we talked about several

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
lasting and we talked about several
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.520
lasting and we talked about several
different things the first of course is

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530
different things the first of course is
 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.770
different things the first of course is
an underpinning of trust its its

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
an underpinning of trust its its
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.860
an underpinning of trust its its
macroeconomic environments that foster a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870
macroeconomic environments that foster a
 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.840
macroeconomic environments that foster a
willingness to invest a willingness to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850
willingness to invest a willingness to
 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.029
willingness to invest a willingness to
save and a willingness to extend credit

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
save and a willingness to extend credit
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.490
save and a willingness to extend credit
so the strong macroeconomic environment

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
so the strong macroeconomic environment
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920
so the strong macroeconomic environment
that's been created in Latin America in

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
that's been created in Latin America in
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.800
that's been created in Latin America in
recent years is essential but beyond the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
recent years is essential but beyond the
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.289
recent years is essential but beyond the
trust at the at the level of the country

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
trust at the at the level of the country
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.969
trust at the at the level of the country
is what occurs at the level of the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
is what occurs at the level of the
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.760
is what occurs at the level of the
individual business or a person and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
individual business or a person and
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.789
individual business or a person and
there it's essential that trust needs to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799
there it's essential that trust needs to
 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.429
there it's essential that trust needs to
have a foundation of transparency the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
have a foundation of transparency the
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.399
have a foundation of transparency the
informal networks in informal companies

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
informal networks in informal companies
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.640
informal networks in informal companies
and individuals are very large in in

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
and individuals are very large in in
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.770
and individuals are very large in in
most latin american countries and if

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780
most latin american countries and if
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749
most latin american countries and if
we're really going to make progress we

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
we're really going to make progress we
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.210
we're really going to make progress we
need to have incentives for people to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
need to have incentives for people to
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.219
need to have incentives for people to
want to register as individuals and as

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
want to register as individuals and as
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.319
want to register as individuals and as
businesses because it's only through the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
businesses because it's only through the
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.719
businesses because it's only through the
availability of information that anyone

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
availability of information that anyone
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.450
availability of information that anyone
will be willing to extend credit

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460
will be willing to extend credit
 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.000
will be willing to extend credit
in a in a reasonably priced manner and

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010
in a in a reasonably priced manner and
 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.490
in a in a reasonably priced manner and
we also need to reduce the perceived

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500
we also need to reduce the perceived
 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.190
we also need to reduce the perceived
risks and burdens of registering which

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200
risks and burdens of registering which
 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.899
risks and burdens of registering which
means we need to bring down tax rates

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909
means we need to bring down tax rates
 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.790
means we need to bring down tax rates
you need to bring down the regulatory

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800
you need to bring down the regulatory
 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.590
you need to bring down the regulatory
burden that's often associated with that

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600
burden that's often associated with that
 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.749
burden that's often associated with that
so this theme of trust and transparency

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759
so this theme of trust and transparency
 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.200
so this theme of trust and transparency
is the first underlying element of being

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210
is the first underlying element of being
 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.210
is the first underlying element of being
able to boost credit in these markets

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220
able to boost credit in these markets
 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.060
able to boost credit in these markets
the second is creative private public

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070
the second is creative private public
 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.490
the second is creative private public
partnerships that that government and

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500
partnerships that that government and
 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.160
partnerships that that government and
banks and institutions need to work

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170
banks and institutions need to work
 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.949
banks and institutions need to work
together to create mechanisms to

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959
together to create mechanisms to
 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.160
together to create mechanisms to
encourage sharing to address regulatory

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
encourage sharing to address regulatory
 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.620
encourage sharing to address regulatory
constraints that exist today and to

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630
constraints that exist today and to
 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:21.699
constraints that exist today and to
create environments that encourage

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709
create environments that encourage
 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.160
create environments that encourage
private institutions to rent but also

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170
private institutions to rent but also
 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.520
private institutions to rent but also
foster an environment of competition and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530
foster an environment of competition and
 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.990
foster an environment of competition and
so that so that individuals wanting

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000
so that so that individuals wanting
 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.060
so that so that individuals wanting
credit have multiple sources to turn to

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070
credit have multiple sources to turn to
 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.250
credit have multiple sources to turn to
and the last we had a number of very

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260
and the last we had a number of very
 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.229
and the last we had a number of very
interesting innovative mechanisms that

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239
interesting innovative mechanisms that
 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.850
interesting innovative mechanisms that
have been tried whether was about

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860
have been tried whether was about
 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.770
have been tried whether was about
mortgages in Brazil weather was

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780
mortgages in Brazil weather was
 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.199
mortgages in Brazil weather was
mechanisms to have risk pooling because

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209
mechanisms to have risk pooling because
 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.030
mechanisms to have risk pooling because
anyone small business might be too risky

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040
anyone small business might be too risky
 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.009
anyone small business might be too risky
to extend credit but if there's a way to

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019
to extend credit but if there's a way to
 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.770
to extend credit but if there's a way to
pull it then an investor can invest with

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780
pull it then an investor can invest with
 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.229
pull it then an investor can invest with
with more diversification and a lower

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239
with more diversification and a lower
 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.539
with more diversification and a lower
overall risk and therefore be willing to

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549
overall risk and therefore be willing to
 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.150
overall risk and therefore be willing to
lend at a lower overall rate and we saw

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160
lend at a lower overall rate and we saw
 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.880
lend at a lower overall rate and we saw
a number of examples in Colombia and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890
a number of examples in Colombia and
 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.100
a number of examples in Colombia and
Brazil in other places around the world

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110
Brazil in other places around the world
 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.440
Brazil in other places around the world
where innovative mechanisms have really

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450
where innovative mechanisms have really
 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.880
where innovative mechanisms have really
boosted credit and created new

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890
boosted credit and created new
 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.160
boosted credit and created new
opportunities so those were the key

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170
opportunities so those were the key
 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.350
opportunities so those were the key
themes of our panel was very interesting

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360
themes of our panel was very interesting
 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.090
themes of our panel was very interesting
and really gave a sense of optimism and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100
and really gave a sense of optimism and
 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.370
and really gave a sense of optimism and
opportunity for the years ahead thank

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380
opportunity for the years ahead thank
 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.470
