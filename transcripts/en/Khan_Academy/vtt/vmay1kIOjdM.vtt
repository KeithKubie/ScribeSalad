00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.409
- [Instructor] In previous videos

00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:04.576
how Rome became a Republic in 509 BCE,

00:00:05.944 --> 00:00:08.700
but it's worth noting, and
I've done this in other videos,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.312
that at that point Rome
was not this vast empire.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:16.146
It was really just in
control of Rome itself.

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:20.412
But over the next few hundred
years, it starts to expand.

00:00:20.412 --> 00:00:22.236
Rome is a militaristic society.

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:25.128
The Roman legions start
to exert it's influence

00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:27.709
over more and more of
the surrounding people

00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:29.722
on the Italian Peninsula.

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:32.422
We keep going several hundred years

00:00:32.422 --> 00:00:35.755
until we enter into the 3rd century BCE.

00:00:38.253 --> 00:00:41.663
This is a map of what the
Mediterranean, at least,

00:00:41.663 --> 00:00:45.830
looks like roughly as we enter
into that 3rd century BCE.

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:50.001
You see, even though that Rome
has now exerted it's power

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:53.241
over most of the Italian
Peninsula right over here,

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:56.567
it was not the dominant
power in the Mediterranean.

00:00:56.567 --> 00:01:00.071
It was really the upstart,
the new and growing empire.

00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:02.279
There are other significant empires.

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:06.179
You see here the remnants of
Alexander the Great's empire,

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:10.311
his successors each now with
their own significant empire,

00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:14.522
and in particular, Ptolemaic
Egypt and Seleucid Persia,

00:01:14.522 --> 00:01:18.710
which had control over
much of the Middle East.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.505
The other empire that you see here in blue

00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:23.838
was the Carthaginian Empire.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.900
As we will see in the 3rd
and 2nd centuries BCE,

00:01:30.732 --> 00:01:34.549
Rome and Carthage are going
to come at loggerheads,

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.595
and Rome, eventually,
is going to overthrow

00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:41.762
Carthage as the dominant
empire in the Mediterranean.

00:01:42.863 --> 00:01:44.615
But you can see in this
map right over here,

00:01:44.615 --> 00:01:47.725
entering into the 3rd century BCE,

00:01:47.725 --> 00:01:49.369
Carthage, that you see in blue,

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.612
was a significant empire.

00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:55.319
So the question is, who
were these Carthaginians?

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.212
The answer is is that
they were Phoenicians.

00:01:58.212 --> 00:01:59.736
Another answer is, even the

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:01.814
Phoenicians did not call
themselves Phoenicians,

00:02:01.814 --> 00:02:03.360
but to understand where
all of this came from,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.445
we have to go back 5,000 years ago.

00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:09.800
5,000 years before, roughly
5,000 years before now,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.189
around 3,000 BCE, where you have

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.356
these city-states like Tyre and Sidon.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.871
I don't know if you can see those well.

00:02:19.871 --> 00:02:20.916
Let me rewrite it.

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:23.858
That is Tyre, this is Sidon.

00:02:23.858 --> 00:02:28.260
Now, this map is obviously a
map of the 3rd century BCE,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.949
but if you go back to when
these cities were founded,

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:35.280
in fact, before they
were, I guess you can say,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.985
put under the influence of Nebuchadnezzar

00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:38.831
and then accumulated Persia,

00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:41.871
these were independent city-states.

00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:45.456
They're actually existing
cities in modern day Lebanon.

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:47.016
In this region, then,

00:02:47.016 --> 00:02:49.389
the leading cities were Tyre and Sidon.

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:50.903
You had a group of people that

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:54.132
would later be known as the Phoenicians.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:58.151
The Phoenicians were
famous for many things.

00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:00.484
They were famous as traders,

00:03:03.445 --> 00:03:06.420
as really ship builders, and traders.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.459
And they colonized much of,

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.853
or large segments, of the
coastline of the Mediterranean.

00:03:12.853 --> 00:03:17.113
This is going back thousands
and thousands of years.

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.739
Carthage was one of those colonies.

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.829
It was established in the 9th century,

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.856
this is what modern
day historians believe,

00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:26.606
sometime between 846 and 813 BCE.

00:03:28.345 --> 00:03:32.316
It was a Phoenician
colony, it was set up as,

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:36.624
really, a trading post for
the Tyrians, right over here.

00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:39.995
The reason why they're called Phoenicians,

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:41.496
they didn't call themselves Phoenicians,

00:03:41.496 --> 00:03:44.186
these Phoenician people,
they were called that

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:46.919
by the Greeks and later the Romans,

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:51.577
because they were famous for
trading their purple dye.

00:03:51.577 --> 00:03:54.158
They had their purple dye,

00:03:54.158 --> 00:03:57.792
which was derived from mollusk mucous

00:03:57.792 --> 00:04:01.125
that they were able to get from the sea,

00:04:02.113 --> 00:04:05.878
as great sea traders and ship builders.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:10.045
They had this purple dye, and
the term for this purple dye,

00:04:11.353 --> 00:04:15.520
it was related to the word
phoinikes, or pho-ni-cian,

00:04:16.825 --> 00:04:19.587
and I know I'm not pronouncing it well.

00:04:19.587 --> 00:04:22.580
The Greeks and the Romans
of the time called them

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.278
the Phoenician people
for their purple dye.

00:04:26.278 --> 00:04:31.018
Now, Carthage, as we will see
in probably the next video,

00:04:31.018 --> 00:04:33.826
Carthage has a series of wars with Rome,

00:04:33.826 --> 00:04:36.563
which are called the Punic Wars.

00:04:36.563 --> 00:04:40.764
I've always wondered, where
does that term Punic come from?

00:04:40.764 --> 00:04:42.550
Why isn't it called the Carthaginian Wars,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.685
or the Roman-Carthaginian Wars?

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:48.109
And that's because the Carthaginians

00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:52.054
were referred to their origins
as coming from Phoenicia.

00:04:52.054 --> 00:04:55.137
The Latin term for that was poenicus,

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.604
once again, related to the
Greek word for that purple dye.

00:05:01.604 --> 00:05:05.771
So poenicus became punic,
so the idea of Phoenician,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.438
these are all related words to each other.

00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:15.284
When we're talking about the Punic Wars,

00:05:15.284 --> 00:05:16.520
these are the Romans,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.464
or this is the modern day English.

00:05:18.464 --> 00:05:20.672
The Romans would have said poenicus.

00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:23.706
These wars were referring
to the wars with Carthage,

00:05:23.706 --> 00:05:26.370
who were descendant from the Phoenicians.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.916
Now, just as a side note,

00:05:27.916 --> 00:05:29.966
another thing that you
might be wondering about is,

00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:33.769
hey, this word, Phoenician,
it looks familiar.

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:36.617
It looks like phonetic,
like the phonetic alphabet.

00:05:36.617 --> 00:05:40.542
That was the other famous
contribution of the Phoenicians,

00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:43.059
is that our alphabet,
the idea of our alphabet,

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:47.226
was derived from the Phoenetic
alphabet of the Phoenicians.

00:05:48.532 --> 00:05:50.559
The Phoenicians did
many, many, many things.

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:53.370
They settled much, they were
one of the real naval powers

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.628
of the Mediterranean going back

00:05:54.628 --> 00:05:56.550
thousands, and thousands of years.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.495
By the time we get to the
Middle Roman Republic,

00:06:00.495 --> 00:06:04.840
we're in the 3rd century
BCE, we're in the 200s BCE,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.925
the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon,

00:06:07.925 --> 00:06:10.360
they're now part of the Seleucid Empire.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.670
The Seleucid Empire was one of

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.484
the successor empires
of Alexander the Great,

00:06:14.484 --> 00:06:17.449
but their offspring,
so to speak, Carthage,

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.955
is now a dominant power
in the Mediterranean.

00:06:20.955 --> 00:06:23.394
With Rome starting to exert it's might,

00:06:23.394 --> 00:06:25.142
although it has very powerful armies,

00:06:25.142 --> 00:06:28.110
it does not, at this point,
have a very powerful navy.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.527
But as we will see, as we get to 264 BCE,

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:35.260
these two great powers
in the Mediterranean

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.927
start to come into a
little bit of conflict.
