[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.180
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.270
interesting developer community.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.190
has asked this question.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.636
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:33.960
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a Question and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.545
Answer show.

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:36.720
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions.

00:00:43.012 --> 00:00:44.140
PAUL SAXMAN: Hello, everybody.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.920
Welcome to this week's Google
Maps Developer's Office Hours.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.600
I'm Paul Saxman.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.710
And with me this week is
somebody you probably

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.060
recognize but hasn't
been around for a

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.100
few weeks, Mano Marks.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.140
What have you been
up to, Mano?

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.390
MANO MARKS: I got married.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.983
PAUL SAXMAN: You got married.

00:00:59.983 --> 00:01:02.420
MANO MARKS: And I went on my
honeymoon, so very exciting.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.990
Spent a month in Italy.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.459
I'll post pictures soon.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.920
Not that anybody here cares,
but anyway, yeah, it was a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.204
great time, a great time.

00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:10.060
PAUL SAXMAN: I care.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.850
MANO MARKS: Paul's been holding
down the fort here for

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.020
us this summer as a bunch
of us take our

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.120
honeymoons and vacations.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.100
So thanks, Paul,
for doing that.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.510
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, my pleasure.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.030
MANO MARKS: And he's
new to our team.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.590
I guess regular viewers will
know him, know that he

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.740
recently joined the
Google Maps team.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.090
So we're really happy to
have him on board.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.140
PAUL SAXMAN: Cool.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.050
Yeah, happy to be here.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.280
It's a lot of fun working
back in data.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.280
Some of you might recognize me
from Google TV, which is also

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.910
a really great product and a
really fun product at Google.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.420
But yeah, likewise, this
is likewise pretty

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.860
exciting and fun.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.950
So you know, I keep thinking,
like being Google Maps team,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.970
we should probably have one of
these, like where in the world

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.310
is Google Maps Developer
Relations?

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.870
Because we tend to move around
for talks and stuff, and

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.120
things like honeymoons
in Italy and--

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.610
MANO MARKS: That would have
been even better last year

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.990
when we were spending
so much time.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.820
I was on the road
50% of the time.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.830
And we did 100 presentations,
actually 100 events, more than

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.260
100 presentations last year.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.840
PAUL SAXMAN: Wow.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.680
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.580
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, so we'll look
into that following the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.240
Carmen San Diego theme maybe.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.810
So today, we have two
big topics we're

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.510
going to talk about.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.110
One is the Google Places API
Developer Challenge.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.260
And the other one is actually
something that we presented at

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.290
Google I/O, but Mano is
going to go into a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.260
little more detail on.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.800
That's the Google Maps API
Symbols and Heatmaps.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.150
So Mano has some great examples
that we're going to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.400
show and kind of pique you guys'
interest, hopefully.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.600
It's kind of similar to what
we presented a couple weeks

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.450
ago when Brendan Kenny was on,
except this doesn't use WebGL.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.930
This is just using overlays,
correct?

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.360
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.790
PAUL SAXMAN: Overlays
and markers.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.670
MANO MARKS: It's something
that's integrated directly

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.600
with the API.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.320
So yeah, we'll get a little
bit more into that.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.270
But why don't we start
with the Places

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.850
API Developer Challenge.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.510
PAUL SAXMAN: Great.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.710
Yeah, so if you guys haven't
seen it yet, this last week,

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.100
we announced they were holding
a Google Places

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.420
API Developer Challenge.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.860
We're kind of inviting
developers around the world to

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.760
actually work with local
municipalities--

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.180
cities and communities--

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.800
to develop apps that actually
solve problems in kind of the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.770
local areas.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.690
And these use the Google
Places API.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.700
So that's kind of part of the
criteria, is find interesting

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.570
ways to use the API to kind
of help support your

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.980
municipality.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.934
MANO MARKS: Why don't we show
the Challenge page--

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:45.790
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.910
Absolutely.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.180
MANO MARKS: --to everybody
on the Live stream.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.843
PAUL SAXMAN: I'm going
to steal the mouse

00:03:47.843 --> 00:03:49.560
from you, Mano. o--

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.830
oops!

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.610
Can you maybe zoom
in a little bit?

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.250
MANO MARKS: You can use
the scroll wheel to

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.850
do that, can't you?

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.636
Or no, sorry.

00:03:58.636 --> 00:04:00.940
He was just playing a video
game this morning, so--

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.018
PAUL SAXMAN: [LAUGHS]

00:04:05.018 --> 00:04:07.240
Oops, sorry, that's the--

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.340
uh-oh, technical difficulties.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.760
MANO MARKS: There we go.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.992
PAUL SAXMAN: All right.

00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:15.850
Now, how do we get out
of this mirror mode?

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.700
This is a Windows thing.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.110
All right.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.980
Well, we're going to go
with that for now.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.660
Little distracting for
some of you, but--

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.390
so this is the Challenge website
as you can see here.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.086
Let's get rid of that.

00:04:29.086 --> 00:04:29.510
MANO MARKS: Here.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.030
PAUL SAXMAN: There we go.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.320
Nice.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.285
So the website is
developers@googl

00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:36.130
e.com/places/challenge.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.650
All the information that you
need to know about the

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.050
Challenge is there, including
the registration forms.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.950
MANO MARKS: We'll post
the links, too,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.960
after this Live stream.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.910
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.145
So we have some videos to kind
of explain the Challenge to

00:04:52.145 --> 00:04:56.050
you, a lot of information on the
site in general about it.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.860
But what you're going to want
to check out-- so there's a

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.000
few things that are really
important here.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.860
One is the timeframe.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.470
So it's actually a pretty
long timeframe.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.010
The judging doesn't start
actually until November 1.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.970
So actually the Challenge
ends October 31.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.810
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.010
PAUL SAXMAN: So I believe
that's about what?

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.810
I think 10 weeks from about now
or maybe August 15 when

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.430
submission begins.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.460
So it gives developers a lot
of time to kind of work out

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.070
their ideas, kind of submit
their applications, and get

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.985
them judged.

00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:32.120
MANO MARKS: Tell them
what they get.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.590
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, that's--

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.690
MANO MARKS: If they win.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.430
PAUL SAXMAN: That's
kind of the--

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.970
probably the most important
part to some people.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.410
So over on the Prizes page,
what you could see-- so

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.460
there's two different
judging categories.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.580
There's the Judge's Choice
Award, which is actually

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.460
obviously determined by the
judges, or the winners are

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.670
determined by the judges.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.420
There's also a People's
Choice Award.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.470
So it's important for you guys
to kind of spread the word.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.755
If you're developing an app,
spread the word to people you

00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:59.150
know so that they can
get in there and--

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.630
MANO MARKS: Judge your--

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.043
PAUL SAXMAN: --judge your app.

00:06:00.043 --> 00:06:00.870
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.000
We're not going to do a toll
call that you have to--

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.840
no 900 numbers or--

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.330
PAUL SAXMAN: No, absolutely.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.410
MANO MARKS: --whatever people
are doing these days for that.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.160
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, yeah, right.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.500
Yeah, spread the wealth.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.380
So there's two Google I/O
tickets that are actually part

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.840
of the Judge's Choice Award.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.280
And also, there's a travel
stipend as well.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.600
So it'll get you to I/O. And I
think that's more than enough

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.065
for a hotel in San Francisco.

00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:30.940
MANO MARKS: Oh, yeah.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.840
PAUL SAXMAN: To tell you the
truth, I haven't stayed in a

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.636
hotel in San Francisco for
a little while, but--

00:06:34.636 --> 00:06:35.612
MANO MARKS: That's true.

00:06:35.612 --> 00:06:38.030
PAUL SAXMAN: You know, another
great thing about this is it's

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.960
a chance to get some
notoriety.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.650
You get to actually potentially
showcase your app

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.480
at Google I/O 2013.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.280
And I mean, this is well worth
it right here-- dinner with

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.130
the Google Maps and
Places API team.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.130
So you can potentially
hang out with us.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.270
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.140
PAUL SAXMAN: Some of
the organizers,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.640
potentially some judges.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.900
MANO MARKS: And we eat well.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.170
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.840
MANO MARKS: Let me tell you.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.570
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.530
And so runners up, runners up
also have some really great

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.040
prizes as well.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.630
We have Google Nexus 7 Tablets,
15-minute hangouts

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.650
with a Google executive
to be determined.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.890
And People Choice Awards,
I think it's equally as

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.390
compelling.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.250
I think it's-- well, pretty
much the same

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.790
as the Judge's Award--

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:29.170
two I/O tickets, $3,500 travel
stipend, and showcasing your

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.710
app at I/O, and dinner
as well.

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.460
MANO MARKS: So a total
of six entries can--

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.950
I guess, sorry--

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:37.570
PAUL SAXMAN: So we have--

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.380
MANO MARKS: --seven entries.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.270
So three Judge's Choice awards,
one People's Choice

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.140
award will win the top prize.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.030
And then three runners up will
get to the Nexus Tablet and

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.330
the hangout with the
Google executive.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.730
PAUL SAXMAN: All right.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.050
So over on the rules, I'm
not going to read

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.800
this to you guys online.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.990
But it's pretty long.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.370
And I think it's pretty
important to just to kind of

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:05.320
get an idea of what the
application entails.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.740
A big thing here is it must use
municipal data or city or

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.900
community data, and it must
use the Places API.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.080
A lot of information about
prizes, privacy,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.825
et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:18.825 --> 00:08:21.430
There's one other thing
I wanted to mention.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.450
Judging, oh, team size--

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.920
it can be an individual
project as well.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:32.820
So if you want to use those
two tickets to bring your

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.676
significant other to Google I/O,
you can do that as well.

00:08:35.676 --> 00:08:36.926
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.860
PAUL SAXMAN: Entering is
just a simple form.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.240
This gets you on the list, gets
you information updates.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.540
And another really important
thing on the site here--

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.330
the resources.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.350
So here's where we're
actually posting--

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.510
well, not only information about
the Google Places API,

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.960
which is spread out through our
developer documentation,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.790
but here's a list
of data sources.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.710
And we're going to continue
to add more data sources.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.280
Actually, we're going to add
more hopefully this week and

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.135
throughout the duration
of the Challenge.

00:09:07.135 --> 00:09:09.490
So keep your eye on
this page if maybe

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.050
your city's not listed.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.600
And definitely feel free to send
information our way if

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.780
you think there's data sources
that we should potentially

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.440
post up here.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.590
And this is an international--

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:24.910
like I said, an international
challenge, so anybody in these

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.520
countries is welcome to
participate and a number of

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.710
other countries.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.320
And this is one thing that--

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.400
oh, yeah-- that was interesting
in the rules.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.760
Of course, there's a few
countries that aren't able to

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.990
participate listed up
at the top here.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.730
But that shouldn't be a
surprise to anybody.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.990
And the FAQ at the bottom here,
keep giving us your

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.710
questions, and we'll keep
this updated for

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.285
the rest of the community.

00:09:53.285 --> 00:09:55.070
MANO MARKS: And, of course, you
can always ask questions

00:09:55.070 --> 00:10:02.020
on our regular Office Hours
or on Stack Overflow about

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.060
particulars of using
the Places API.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.020
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.670
Yeah, we're getting a good
number of questions these days

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.410
about Places API on
Stack Overflow.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.810
I monitor it every day, and
there's a few other team

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.180
members that do.

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.760
So definitely, if you have any
questions, obviously, search

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.520
Stack Overflow because your
question might have been

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.500
answered already.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.950
MANO MARKS: What's your
Stack Overflow score?

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.583
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, not even
close to yours.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.900
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.057
Yeah, I've actually been a
Stack Overflow user for I

00:10:31.057 --> 00:10:34.800
think, geez, like quite a few
years, since I think 2007 or

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.625
something like that.

00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:39.670
But my score was pretty level
for quite a long time.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.110
So it's only in the
last year or two.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:46.070
But I think I saw yours,
which is impressive.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.820
MANO MARKS: What's great about
Stack Overflow is your score

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.380
can grow as people--

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.640
I was on my honeymoon.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.670
I came back from my honeymoon,
and it had grown like 100

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:56.010
points because people found my
old answers and up-voted them.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.190
But anyway, enough about that.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.470
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.390
MANO MARKS: Yeah,
anything more on

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.250
the Developer Challenge?

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.660
PAUL SAXMAN: No, I
think that's it.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.830
Maybe in a week or two, we
could have somebody--

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:13.420
one of the organizers of
the Challenge, so--

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:13.720
MANO MARKS: Yeah--

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:13.890
PAUL SAXMAN: --from our
marketing team.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.010
MANO MARKS: --can come on and
answer some questions

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.570
specifically about
the Challenge.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.540
PAUL SAXMAN: And besides that,
yeah, just let us know any

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.860
questions you guys
have, any ideas.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.990
We're happy to communicate with
you guys over Google+,

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.120
Stack Overflow.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.500
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.430
PAUL SAXMAN: So we're looking
forward to seeing what you

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.458
guys put together.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.610
MANO MARKS: OK.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:35.990
PAUL SAXMAN: On to--

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.833
let's give the mouse
back to you.

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:38.680
MANO MARKS: OK.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:44.530
So there was a great session at
Google I/O called Spatial

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:45.570
Data Visualization.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.970
And I gather that Brendan was on
a couple weeks ago and did

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.590
a great job talking about some
of the WebGL intricacies and

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.300
the amazing things that
you can do with WebGL.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.980
For those of you who don't want
to quite go that far, you

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:06.280
might be interested in our new
Heatmap and Symbols services

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.550
and APIs in the Google
Maps API.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.380
So we're pretty excited
about this.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.950
So what is a Heatmap, though?

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.320
Often, when I talk about
Heatmaps, people immediately

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.600
assume I'm talking about
temperature.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.000
And no matter how much I talk
about other things, they just

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.170
can't get the word Heatmap
out of their minds.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.360
So a way to think of this
is intensity maps.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.720
It's really trying to show
intensity of objects at a

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.310
location, or things at a
location, data points.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.690
So here's an example.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:43.180
This is intensity of airports
around the world.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.270
And the reason they're called
Heatmaps is because they use a

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.210
color scheme often-- not
always, but often--

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:55.100
that we are familiar with from
weather forecasts for heat.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.200
So red is hot, so lots of
intensity there, lots of

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.950
things there.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.130
Yellow is less hot.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.670
And then green is
even more so.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.650
And this one actually shows--
you can see here it's mostly

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.740
yellow and green around
the world.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:17.080
But as I zoom out, you can see
that the intensity changes.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.320
And you can see the
concentration changes because

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.440
as I zoom out, the areas that
are represented are smaller.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.270
So you see it here.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.480
You get some deep red areas.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.020
So this is just using
the Google Maps API.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.010
And it uses the Visualization
library, which you can add

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.770
very easily to--

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.870
you just add it as a parameter
in the loader.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.240
And then you just add data.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.230
And it's just the more points
that you add to the Heatmap at

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.435
a particular location, the
more there are there.

00:13:50.435 --> 00:13:51.430
PAUL SAXMAN: So I was
kind of amazed.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.862
I was playing around
with the--

00:13:53.862 --> 00:13:55.340
it's a Heatmap overlay, right?

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.060
You get a overlay object that
you could put over your map

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.130
and how easy it was actually
load data.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.507
So I was thinking like, oh, I'm
going to have to process

00:14:04.507 --> 00:14:06.390
or parse a CSV file.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.780
Or I was going to have to get
data, load it from some ugly

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.190
format into the API, and
actually parse it, and load it

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.510
into the overlay.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.840
And no, it was a lot
easier than that.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.120
I just had to have a JSON
file that had all the

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.426
data loaded into it.

00:14:23.426 --> 00:14:24.200
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.170
PAUL SAXMAN: Making a JSON
file was really simple.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.850
Then all you do is you
load the JSON file

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.340
as a script, right?

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.240
And that actually--

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.370
so JSON is JavaScript.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.420
You can tell I come from a Java
background because I have

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.690
to parse everything in Java.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:44.450
But yeah, you load the JSON
file into the script.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.340
It loads it as data.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.070
And then the data is just passed
directly as an object

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.680
to the overlay.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.685
So no parsing necessary as long
as you have the JSON file

00:14:53.685 --> 00:14:54.980
in the first place.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.760
MANO MARKS: And there's
a lot of different

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.620
options you can use.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.680
So you can control-- for
instance, you can see this

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.060
changes as I zoom
in and zoom out.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.920
But sometimes, you want
that to stay the same.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.500
So if I go to this next one,
this is the same example.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.210
You see, as I zoom in and zoom
out, it actually retains the

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.830
same color values.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.470
And that's useful because
as you're zooming in--

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.190
say I zoom in Vancouver on this
other example, you'll see

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.160
it kind of spreads out.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.710
And then suddenly, you've
lost the Heatmap as

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.060
you get really close.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.650
And that's useful
in some cases.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.240
But in other cases, you want
to retain that area of high

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.340
intensity on the map.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.750
You can also control
things like color.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.790
And this is an interesting
example where we use both

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:43.190
styled maps and the changing
the color of the Heatmap.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.570
So you can see that it uses
a slightly different color

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.765
scheme and made all
the water black.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:56.015
And you can use it, of course,
on a variety of different--

00:15:56.015 --> 00:15:59.520
you can use it on top of
satellite view regular maps,

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:05.050
hybrid view, anything that we
have, or your own custom maps.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:05.190
PAUL SAXMAN: Can we--

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.850
MANO MARKS: You can sort of
toggle them on and off, yeah?

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.590
PAUL SAXMAN: I was just
going to say, I think

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.500
they're really cool.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.190
So compared to what Brendan
showed a couple weeks ago with

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.110
the WebGL, which is very
powerful tool, but then you do

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.600
a lot of WebGL programming.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.530
I mean, you're responsible
for actually doing

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.160
the rendering yourself.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.530
What does the code
look like here?

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:24.275
I mean--

00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:25.303
MANO MARKS: Oh, that's
really good question.

00:16:25.303 --> 00:16:26.970
PAUL SAXMAN: What is necessary
on the developer side?

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.220
MANO MARKS: Let's
take a look at--

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.600
let's view the source here.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.740
PAUL SAXMAN: It's the magic
control sequence.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.210
Right.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.620
There we go.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.720
MANO MARKS: So standard loader--
see, you add this

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.930
libraries=visualization.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.000
Here, we're loading
a JSON object.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.860
And here, whoever created
this sample--

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.020
actually, it was Enoch who
presented this at Google I/O--

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.390
put in polygons to cover up the
oceans because that's his

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.870
favorite way of doing that.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:08.109
So then, here's your standard
creating your map code.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:13.589
You create a new data object,
this MVCArray.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:16.670
And then you pass it to
the HeatmapLayer.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:22.569
And then you just add data
points to the HeatmapLayer.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:23.546
And that's it.

00:17:23.546 --> 00:17:24.520
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, so it's--

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.430
MANO MARKS: So it's
really simple.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.079
PAUL SAXMAN: To actually get
the Heatmap overlay, you're

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.990
looking at seven, eight
lines of code?

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.450
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.750
PAUL SAXMAN: Right.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.180
MANO MARKS: Yeah, and it's
important to emphasize this is

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.360
all done client-side.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.450
This is all loaded
into the browser.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:46.660
So that data doesn't get sent to
Google, and then generating

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.170
an overlay, and then sent back,
which is what we did

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.610
with the FusionTablesLayer.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:56.040
So Fusion Tables had a great
Heatmap functionality that a

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.300
lot of people like.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.950
It has that functionality,
and that still remains

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:00.750
an option to you.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:05.400
But if you can do it in
client-side, this actually

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.290
makes, I think, a smoother
transition and a

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.230
more dynamic one.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.030
If you take a look here at this
example, as I said, you

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.420
can toggle on and
off the Heatmap.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.360
But you can also change the
gradient, so you can change

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.110
the colors.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.140
You can change the radius of the
points, and you can change

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:28.710
the opacity and a lot of
other options as well.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.080
So you get a lot of dynamism
because it

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.080
happens in the client.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.550
It doesn't have to go
back to the server

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.286
to regenerate something.

00:18:36.286 --> 00:18:37.180
PAUL SAXMAN: So how might--

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.140
I mean, so I can definitely
see the kind of scientific

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.580
application of this, so if
you're analyzing a certain

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.710
data set and you want
to see it on a map.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:45.380
MANO MARKS: Sure.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.700
PAUL SAXMAN: But how might
you integrate this

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.160
into a Web 2.0 app?

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.740
Like what are some good use
cases for using Heatmaps in a

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.690
non-scientific application?

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.610
MANO MARKS: Well, so this is
an interesting data set.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:06.690
This is taxi rides
in San Francisco.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.890
So that might be something
that you could use to

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.020
demonstrate to your customers
where there's an

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.770
intensity of locations.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.840
So you can see there's
a lot of taxis.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.620
Say this data set was taxis,
where the taxis are right now.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.480
So if I wanted to go find a
taxi, I would go down there.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.120
Or a cafe or some other thing,
you could show where

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.120
restaurants were or something
like that.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.840
So there's a lot of
potential there.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.490
So if I want to go out on a
Saturday night and I want to

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.280
see where things are, not
necessarily want to go to a

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.970
particular restaurant, but I
want to go to a neighborhood

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.590
and just like hang out, go to a
bar, or go to a restaurant,

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.210
and just like in a sense of that
neighborhood, that would

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:56.080
give me a sense of which
neighborhoods to attend if

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.700
I'm, for instance, using Google
Places to find those.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.430
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.290
Very cool.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.330
So, yeah, so that's a good
point, is I think a lot of

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.650
municipal data actually is
kind of street by street,

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.660
neighborhood by neighborhood.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.330
So you could potentially use the
Heatmaps to kind of show

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.640
certain things about certain
streets, neighborhoods, areas

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.810
of the city.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:21.190
MANO MARKS: And then, of course,
crime statistics,

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.200
another classic example
of using Heatmaps

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.770
or demographic data.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.120
PAUL SAXMAN: And then my next
one is going to be cafe

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.650
density because I'm always
looking for if there are good

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.900
places to hang out on the
weekends when I'm not busy.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:37.110
MANO MARKS: So--

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.920
PAUL SAXMAN: --I
need a laptop.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.140
MANO MARKS: --this next sample
actually shows how the

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.015
dynamism of the HeatmapLayer,
which is that I can actually--

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.800
basically, every time I
move the mouse, it's

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.460
creating a new point.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:56.590
And that allows me to just sort
of track the movements,

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.650
the areas in which somebody
is going on this map.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.980
This is actually not a map
that's particularly useful.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:07.520
But it does show how the
Heatmap can just--

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.180
as you're getting data, you
can just keep adding to it

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.480
based on user input.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.980
Or you can--

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.592
you know, more stuff being
loaded from your server side.

00:21:17.592 --> 00:21:18.010
PAUL SAXMAN: Right.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.950
Yeah, exactly, because
it is JSON.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.580
So you can just dynamically,
constantly, just make--

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.380
MANO MARKS: Exactly.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:23.960
PAUL SAXMAN: --like requests.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.640
MANO MARKS: In response
to an event, just add.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.830
And you see, if I can just hover
over this one point and

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.900
just add a whole bunch of
points, it actually starts to

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:37.160
affect the rest of
the Heatmap.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.030
And you start to see some
shrinkage in the intensity in

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.200
other areas.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.240
So I think that's a really fun
and interesting example.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.310
PAUL SAXMAN: Very cool.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.360
MANO MARKS: So I think we're
going to switch gears here and

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.310
start talking about symbols.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:22:01.240
So Symbols is a new addition
to polylines and markers in

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.400
the Google Maps API.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.550
And the idea here is that for
a long time you've been able

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.955
to do custom markers
in the Maps API.

00:22:08.955 --> 00:22:12.040
You can use your own icon
for the marker.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.740
However, doing custom lines
really wasn't that useful.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.830
And loading in the custom
markers, you were loading in

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.590
an image, a particular image
that was reused.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.070
So Symbols now allows you to
use SVG, Scalable Vector

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:35.310
Graphics, to change how both
lines and markers look and are

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:36.300
represented.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.840
And this gives you a
lot of dynamism.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.330
So we've built in some
default styles.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.170
So this is actually in response
to a lot of requests

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.970
that we've gotten over the years
for this kind of thing.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:54.900
You see here this line
is actually an arrow.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.810
PAUL SAXMAN: So is it just
a simple polyline, right?

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.510
MANO MARKS: It's a simple
polyline styled as an arrow.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.820
And this is one of our
default styles.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:07.745
This is another one,
a dashed line.

00:23:07.745 --> 00:23:12.600
Often, very common request that
we never accommodated

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:18.580
before, but we do believe with
the spread of support for SVG,

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.490
and Canvas, and other
technologies that we use to

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:26.460
implement this, we
can now do this.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.990
PAUL SAXMAN: And again, since
this is a polyline, this is

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.350
client-side again, right?

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:31.850
MANO MARKS: Yeah, it's all being
rendered client-side.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:33.050
That's correct.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.270
PAUL SAXMAN: So, you
as a developer, you

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.660
provide some kind of--

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.610
you either say what you want
the line to look like using

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.530
one of our pre-canned styles
or you can provide SVG

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.340
parameters.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.580
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.630
So this, for instance, see
there's a little happy face, a

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.300
little X, a little
dot at the end.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.180
You get quite a bit of
control over this.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.810
And this is all done
by SVG that's just

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:55.940
defined in the page.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.190
Actually, let's take a look
at the source on that one.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:00.905
So you see here, it's--

00:24:00.905 --> 00:24:02.270
PAUL SAXMAN: Want me to
zoom in a little bit?

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.180
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.810
Thank you.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.990
Help me, too.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:08.361
[CHUCKLES]

00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:12.290
So you see here standard
map loading.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.910
And then you create a line.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.340
And this just has two
points on it.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:24.220
And then you create different
symbols using SVG, and

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.730
symbolOne, symbolTwo,
symbolThree.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:32.270
And then with the line, you
create this new polyline.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.970
You give it the path, the line
coordinates, and then you put

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.230
in these icons.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.240
And there's a number
of different things

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.840
you can do on here.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.690
You can put in the offset.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:48.550
And the offset can either be a
percentage or a pixel value.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.350
And that allows you to define
where on the line

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:52.660
something shows up.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.700
Now, this brings an
interesting point

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.220
and why we used SVG.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.180
SVG is Scalable Vector
Graphics.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.860
If you were to use icons, and
you were to do something like

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:10.190
this, zoom in, it
would distort.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.070
The icon would eventually
be distorted.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.510
Or it would get too small
if you zoomed out.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:20.500
But because it's using
SVG, it scales.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.980
You're just defining where
the vectors are.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:27.510
So it scales so that you
get a nice, clean

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:31.270
representation each time.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.580
PAUL SAXMAN: And also,
I think it was--

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.360
well, maybe we'll see what
your next tab is.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.540
Are you going to Markers?

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.400
Or--

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.190
MANO MARKS: I was going
to Animation.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.160
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, right.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.680
MANO MARKS: So again, because
it's SVG but it's all

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.370
happening in the client,
we can do things

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.010
like alter the offsets.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.930
And so you can just have a
little timed thing that alters

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.970
the offset, and it actually
moves it around.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:00.250
So this is--

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.260
let's take a look at the
source for this.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:13.640
So again, line, symbol,
polyline, and the offset.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.530
And has it starts at 100%, which
means it starts at the

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.260
end of the line.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.080
And then it just has a function,
animateCircle, which

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.680
moves that circle.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:30.195
Every count, it moves that
circle a little bit, offsets

00:26:30.195 --> 00:26:32.100
it, changes the offset.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.280
And then it just
keeps running.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.520
So animateCircle just keeps
looping around.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:44.740
So very simple to do really
interesting animations.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:45.050
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:50.960
So all it needs, you just have
to modify the variable on the

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.270
symbol to actually get it
to-- or on the polyline

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:54.530
actually--to get it to--

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.460
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.700
PAUL SAXMAN: Very cool.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:04.790
MANO MARKS: So this sample
actually takes advantage of

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:09.150
our Elevation API, and
ElevationService, rather.

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.150
The ElevationService allows you
to say, give me all the

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:16.610
elevations along a path
at so many intervals.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:20.520
And this says at every
500 meters.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.130
And so then, we create
a new line that

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.790
goes sort of off that.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.180
Well, this is actually
a good example.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.820
I'm going to zoom in.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:36.050
You can see there's actually
individual lines here.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:40.560
And then each line, the length
of the line, is by the height

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.310
of the elevation
at that point.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.280
And then you'll see there's a
different line that creates

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.900
sort of a shadow off of it.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.940
And these lines are all at an
angle that was calculated off

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.630
where it was on the line.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.060
PAUL SAXMAN: So this is kind of
a cool visualization for,

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.190
let's say, if you want
to do a bike riding--

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.860
MANO MARKS: Yeah, that would--

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.600
PAUL SAXMAN: --tour map or
something like that.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.500
MANO MARKS: That would be
a really good idea.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.010
PAUL SAXMAN: So you
could put all your

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.601
data in the map itself.

00:28:08.601 --> 00:28:11.010
MANO MARKS: Exactly.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.250
So those are the
samples I had.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:16.670
I, unfortunately, wasn't able to
play a video that I've got.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:20.250
But what I would suggest, if
you're interested in this,

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.370
check out the Google I/O
presentation that Enoch Lau

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.870
and Brendan Kenny did.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.550
Enoch spent a lot of
time talking about

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.680
these different details.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:36.950
And then also check out the
What's New in the Google Maps

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:42.760
API session that was done by
Brian McClendon, Peter Birch,

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.240
Dylan Lorimer, and
Thor Mitchell.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:50.510
And Thor Mitchell has a really
great video where he shows all

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:54.980
the planes that arrive
in and out of San

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.310
Francisco in a given day.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:01.840
And that video was done using
the Maps API and animating.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.150
And he actually animates them
flying on and off, flying to

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:10.360
and from their destinations,
so really, really powerful

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.580
visualization.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:17.710
We'll post links to both those
presentations in the Google

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:21.845
Maps API page, Google+ page.

00:29:21.845 --> 00:29:22.815
PAUL SAXMAN: Awesome.

00:29:22.815 --> 00:29:24.790
So I'm not over here
checking email.

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.360
I'm bringing up the questions.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:27.680
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.350
OK.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.120
So, yeah, now-- and now,
your questions.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.030
So we're going over
to Google--

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:34.370
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.386
[?

00:29:34.386 --> 00:29:35.020
MANO MARKS: Is it Moderator?

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.970
PAUL SAXMAN: So yeah, we
have Moderator running.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.470
Actually, I think I set
the Moderator timer

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.620
to turn off at 10:30.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.550
So if you have any questions,
I'm going to go over to the

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.560
YouTube Live, and we'll check
the comments there as well.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.560
MANO MARKS: OK.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.450
PAUL SAXMAN: But we'll
start out with

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:52.790
what we have in Moderator.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.980
MANO MARKS: We didn't put
this up on the screen.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.810
So yeah, why don't you just
go ahead and read

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:57.830
their questions then.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.080
PAUL SAXMAN: Sure.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.700
So we're going to try to get
the ones that are either--

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.390
so OK. "The HeatmapsLayer has
presentation options, but once

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:12.490
rendered doesn't seem to have
events or interaction options.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.990
Is this true or a misreading
of the Docs?" So in

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.200
referencing--

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.930
so events or interaction
options on Heatmaps.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:24.340
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:29.290
So anything that it's going
to have on the layer--

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:35.880
it's an MVC object, so it'll
inherit whatever other layers

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:41.550
have, the sort of the basic
MVC layer objects have.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.240
I actually am kind
of blanking.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.480
I don't think it has a onClick
event or the standard--

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.260
PAUL SAXMAN: Oh, I see
what he's saying.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:47.677
MANO MARKS: --click events.

00:30:47.677 --> 00:30:48.930
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.620
MANO MARKS: But I'll have
to take a closer

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:53.740
look at those Docs.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.450
And maybe we can circle back
to that next time.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.360
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, that's
a very good point.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.770
We got a couple questions
about Google Glass.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.560
Unfortunately, we're probably
not going to answer those--

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.272
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:31:04.272 --> 00:31:04.630
PAUL SAXMAN: --since it's--

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:05.365
MANO MARKS: It's not our team.

00:31:05.365 --> 00:31:08.570
And so we're not qualified
to answer the

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.240
Google Glass questions.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.100
PAUL SAXMAN: Especially
distribution.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:12.770
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.470
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, definitely.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.090
We'll see about posting
something about where you guys

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.767
can find information about
that stuff because--

00:31:19.767 --> 00:31:20.930
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.370
PAUL SAXMAN: --because
it might not be

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:24.520
widely available yet.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:31.410
And so "Google Maps Navigation,
is there an API

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.810
that will integrate
with Google Maps?

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.840
And then, "we'd love to be able
to take users along our

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.700
routes using Google
Turn-by-Turn."

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.260
MANO MARKS: So that's a
really good question.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:45.320
And neither of us is on
the Android team.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:49.230
So we really probably aren't the
most qualified people to

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:49.820
answer that.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.520
However, I will say
that Navigation

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.470
doesn't have an API.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.970
But it does allow you to launch
it with an Intent.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:03.830
So I would look into what it
supports with the Intents.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:06.130
I'm not sure if it supports
a particular route--

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:09.040
probably does--

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.675
or a particular destination.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:18.790
Yeah, so as I said, no API at
this point that I know of.

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:23.390
But you might want to check out
the Android Office Hours

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:24.410
for more information.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:25.390
PAUL SAXMAN: Mm-hm.

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.720
I mean, we do also have the
Google Directions API.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.770
So you can get route
information.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:31.030
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.260
It just doesn't allow you
to do that turn by turn.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:33.698
PAUL SAXMAN: Right.

00:32:33.698 --> 00:32:35.450
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:36.970
PAUL SAXMAN: So it
looks like--

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.520
oh, Live comments,
here we are.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.770
"How can you animate a Heatmap
using a Google Drive table?

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.080
Can you show some code?"

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.600
MANO MARKS: So I don't think
either of us have any code

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.650
ready for that.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:53.250
So that's a really
good question.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:59.340
You would have to draw, I would
imagine, just on the--

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.340
so Google Drive table instance
is basically a Fusion Table.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:08.370
So you'd just need to pull out
your data using the API,

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:15.590
create some JSON, and push
it into Maps API.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.130
PAUL SAXMAN: So it's
all about the JSON.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:20.126
Does the Fusion Tables
have export to JSON

00:33:20.126 --> 00:33:22.060
or a JSON feed interface?

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.040
MANO MARKS: You know, they
released a new API while I was

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:24.510
on my honeymoon.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.210
And I haven't taken
a look at it.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:31.360
So, yeah, unfortunately,
I don't know.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.170
But ask the question on Stack
Overflow and I think we can

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.300
get some more information.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.980
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, I think it's
fair to mention that you

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:40.880
just returned yesterday
from your honeymoon.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.805
MANO MARKS: Yes, that was
my first day back.

00:33:42.805 --> 00:33:45.540
PAUL SAXMAN: So your email
backlog is still probably

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.180
pretty massive.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.950
Looks like that's pretty
much it for questions.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.410
If you guys have anything,
feel free

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:53.780
to comment on Google+.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.950
We're going to post a link to
the recording, the YouTube

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.120
recording, on our
Google+ stream.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.190
So feel free to add comments
or questions there.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:05.150
We'd love to hear
from you guys.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.460
So any feedback you guys have
is much appreciated.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.360
MANO MARKS: And I believe
next week, there's an

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.400
Australia-friendly time
Office Hours.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.770
So Chris and Luke will
look forward to

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:19.580
talking to you then.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.449
PAUL SAXMAN: Mm-hm Yeah, we'll
be sure that gets posted on

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:25.179
the Google Developers Live
calendar so you guys can get

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.060
some advance notice.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.770
So I think that's everything
today.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.400
Thanks for hanging
out with us.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.090
And looking forward to having
you guys at a future event.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:34.500
MANO MARKS: Yeah.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.110
PAUL SAXMAN: So--
