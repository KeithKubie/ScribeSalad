00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.214
At this point, hopefully you feel like you can attack a new big

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:08.606
investigation bring it within the scope of a statistical inference problem and

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:12.563
then apply iterations of the QMV process to gradually hone a solution.

00:00:12.563 --> 00:00:14.994
You've seen a taste of what model building and

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:18.480
data analysis problems looks like in the real world.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.740
And how it is a continual process of investigation.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.070
Finding results and

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.140
then proposing new lines of investigation based upon those results.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.630
Sometimes, retrying or adjusting previous decisions.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.740
Specifically, we get the process going by iterating on

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.890
an initial question until we arrive at answers to the following.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.150
What metrics will be used to capture the phenomenon?

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.211
What statistical inference problem will be examined?

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.258
What features will inform the inference problem?

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:53.204
Once we've determined how to measure the problem as well as what form of

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:57.085
question we'll be answering, we enter the modeling phase in which we

00:00:57.085 --> 00:00:59.680
choose a method for answering this question.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.944
This method should take advantage of structure within data to

00:01:03.944 --> 00:01:06.330
achieve maximum effectiveness.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.310
Lastly, once we've built the model, we evaluate how good the model is at

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.690
generalizing to the wider phenomenon in the validation phase.
