00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:03.636
Should anyone here know of any
reason that this couple should

00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:08.341
not be joined in
holy matrimony, speak now

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:09.709
or forever hold
your peace.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.580
Really? Nobody's gonna object?

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.082
We're all just gonna
let this happen?

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:17.350
What is the objection?

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:20.119
I didn't want to be a hero,
but, you know what?

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:25.024
My ankle tattoo
says "Carpe Diem."

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.292
Seize the carp.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.860
So, fine.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.696
Stop the wedding.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.264
Amy, what
the (bleep)?

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.466
What the (bleep)
you, Sasha.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.500
I'm gonna say it.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:35.635
What are you talking about?

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.938
I was outside, bumming
a smoke yesterday,

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:41.608
after the free
rehearsal dinner.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.442
Thank you guys so
much for that.

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:49.015
And I'm outside
and I remember

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:52.518
that I overheard something

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:58.290
interesting that one of
your bridesmaids told me.

00:00:58.357 --> 00:00:59.558
Who?
Which bridesmaid?

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:03.095
Okay, which one did I talk
to yesterday?

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:04.463
Okay.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.599
You asked me to help
you find your car.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.768
I said you shouldn't be driving
because you seemed drunk.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.170
No. Before that.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.572
Before that,
wiseass.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.608
What-- No, what did you say?

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:17.810
You told me something really
revealing about Chris.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:18.878
Right?

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.012
What's your name?

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.014
Pam.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.015
That's not it.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.016
No. Sit down.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.017
Right down.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:26.018
Do not sit down.

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.820
(Amy)
Sit down, Pam.

00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:30.857
Sit down, Pam.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:34.159
There's an elephant in the
room, y'all, and it stanks!

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:35.695
Everybody wants
you to stop.

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.396
You do, Chris.

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.965
But this side of
the room has my back

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:42.668
and so do other people.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.704
I'm looking at you,
Janine.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.171
She told me also.

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:47.172
What are you
talking about?

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:48.808
Grow up!

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:52.545
Janine gave me a piece
of gum earlier.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:55.581
She also dished
some dirt too.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:56.682
Are you done?

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.652
Are you done lying,
Chris?

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.588
Don't forget, you hooked
up with me in college.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:03.590
That was me.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.524
You're also a
piece of (bleep).

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.693
No, I'm not.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.730
Fair enough.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:11.797
Only time will tell.

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:16.402
But for now,
cat's out of the bag.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.204
(meows)

00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:20.640
Wake up.

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:21.941
Wake up,
San Francisco.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:23.375
I don't know.

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:28.547
I believe the answer to all
your questions is right here.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:31.551
I think I had written something
down earlier about this.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:32.886
Oh, I have gum.

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:38.391
Do you want this?
You don't care.

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:41.160
Is there something
you need to tell me?

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:42.261
Of course not,
babe.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.263
Okay.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.432
Are you sure?

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.033
Okay, fine.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.102
I'm gay,
I (bleep) dudes.
