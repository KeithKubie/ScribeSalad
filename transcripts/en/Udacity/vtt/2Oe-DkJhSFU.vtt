00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.380
Alcohol is the second leading cause of premature death in the United States.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.485
Excessive alcohol use is associated with brain tissue loss and intellectual

00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:10.440
impairments.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.625
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Long term alcohol use also results in problems with the liver including fatty

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:16.480
liver and cirrhosis of the liver.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.044
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In addition to heart attack, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, cancer and

00:00:20.044 --> 00:00:23.662
impaired immunities which are all associated with excessive long term alcohol

00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:25.290
use.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.592
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's a lot of negative effects so keep that in mind. Now, let's recap the

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:34.039
benzodiazapines and the barbituates. Both of those are used as medicines, but

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.616
they're also both abused. The barbiturates are used as medicine to treat

00:00:38.616 --> 00:00:42.908
epilepsy, because they reduce seizure activity. And the benzodiazepines are

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:46.418
used to treat anxiety, and sometimes they're prescribed for individuals as a

00:00:46.418 --> 00:00:49.210
sleep aide for those with insomnia.
