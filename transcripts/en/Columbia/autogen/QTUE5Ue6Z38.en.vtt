that debate is absolutely irrelevant the
reason for that is that the policies we

500 at 750 are identical if we can
 

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:33.259
500 at 750 are identical if we can
figure out how to stabilize at 450 or

00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:33.269
figure out how to stabilize at 450 or
 

00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:35.449
figure out how to stabilize at 450 or
550 we can probably figure out how to

00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:35.459
550 we can probably figure out how to

tool of policy analysis and that's the
 

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.350
tool of policy analysis and that's the
use that I'm going to put it to so the

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360
use that I'm going to put it to so the
 

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.300
use that I'm going to put it to so the
kaya identity tells us all of the tools

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:02.310
kaya identity tells us all of the tools
 

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.840
kaya identity tells us all of the tools
in the toolbox if you want to reduce

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:05.850
in the toolbox if you want to reduce
 

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.820
in the toolbox if you want to reduce
emissions to the level of stabilizing it

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.830
emissions to the level of stabilizing it
 

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.040
emissions to the level of stabilizing it
so with respect to each one of these

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:10.050
so with respect to each one of these
 

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:14.300
so with respect to each one of these
four factors there's a lever so each one

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:14.310
four factors there's a lever so each one
 

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.810
four factors there's a lever so each one
of these things

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:15.820
of these things
 

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.050
of these things
can be used to reduce emissions so less

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:19.060
can be used to reduce emissions so less
 

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.780
can be used to reduce emissions so less
people all else equal equals less

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:21.790
people all else equal equals less
 

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.200
people all else equal equals less
emissions a smaller economy all else

emissions a smaller economy all else
 

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:29.790
emissions a smaller economy all else
equal equals less emissions increasing

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:29.800
equal equals less emissions increasing
 

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.890
equal equals less emissions increasing
efficiency so that means doing the same

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:31.900
efficiency so that means doing the same
 

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.760
efficiency so that means doing the same
or more with less energy that reduces

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:35.770
or more with less energy that reduces
 

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.550
or more with less energy that reduces
emissions increasing efficiency is a

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:38.560
emissions increasing efficiency is a
 

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.560
emissions increasing efficiency is a
different thing than not doing anything

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:40.570
different thing than not doing anything
 

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.080
different thing than not doing anything
at all so if you're lying in bed one day

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.090
at all so if you're lying in bed one day
 

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.000
at all so if you're lying in bed one day
and you say you know I don't want to go

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.010
and you say you know I don't want to go
 

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.890
and you say you know I don't want to go
to work today I'm going to reduce my

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:46.900
to work today I'm going to reduce my
 

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.560
to work today I'm going to reduce my
carbon footprint no that doesn't work

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:49.570
carbon footprint no that doesn't work
 

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.840
carbon footprint no that doesn't work
think being lazy doesn't work you have

think being lazy doesn't work you have
 

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.940
think being lazy doesn't work you have
to do the same or more with less energy

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:53.950
to do the same or more with less energy
 

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.840
to do the same or more with less energy
and then the final category there is

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:56.850
and then the final category there is
 

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.210
and then the final category there is
reducing carbon intensity of our energy

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:00.220
reducing carbon intensity of our energy
 

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.300
reducing carbon intensity of our energy
sources so generating energy with less

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:03.310
sources so generating energy with less
 

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.430

emissions so if you switch from coal to

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440
emissions so if you switch from coal to
 

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.670
emissions so if you switch from coal to
natural gas you become more carbon

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:08.680
natural gas you become more carbon
 

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.430
natural gas you become more carbon
efficient about forty to fifty percent

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440
efficient about forty to fifty percent
 

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.620
efficient about forty to fifty percent
more carbon efficient if you switch from

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:13.630
more carbon efficient if you switch from
 

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.280
more carbon efficient if you switch from
coal to nuclear or wind or solar and get

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:17.290
coal to nuclear or wind or solar and get
 

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.950

on modulating these levers and the good
 

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.750
on modulating these levers and the good
news from an analytical standpoint is

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760
news from an analytical standpoint is

going to make things a little simpler

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640
going to make things a little simpler
 

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.040
going to make things a little simpler
for our discussion I'm going to combine

technologies of energy consumption with
the technologies of energy production so

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:06.460
the technologies of energy production so
 

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.070
the technologies of energy production so
the technologies of consumption our

some of those things you put in a book
 

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.280
some of those things you put in a book
and then after the book comes out and

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:38.290
and then after the book comes out and
 

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.330

the first number was eighty dollars a
year and it turns out that at eighty

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:23.590
year and it turns out that at eighty
 

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.530

number of people expressing support got
 

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.020
number of people expressing support got
up to less than ten percent so this

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:40.030
up to less than ten percent so this

emissions isolate technology and I'm
going to argue that a reduction in this

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:32.730
going to argue that a reduction in this
 

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:35.750

ratio of emissions to GDP is an

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760
ratio of emissions to GDP is an
 

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.550
ratio of emissions to GDP is an
indication at least with respect to

carbon that we're making progress so we
 

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.090
carbon that we're making progress so we
want emissions to go down and we want

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100
want emissions to go down and we want
 

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.540
want emissions to go down and we want
GDP to go up and if that happens that

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:47.550
GDP to go up and if that happens that
 

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.370
GDP to go up and if that happens that
ratio goes down that's progress with

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:49.380
ratio goes down that's progress with
 

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.100
ratio goes down that's progress with
respect to technology and so I'm going

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.110
respect to technology and so I'm going
 

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.360

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.840
by the kaya identity so what if we want
this emissions to reduce by eighty

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:48.850
this emissions to reduce by eighty
 

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.850
this emissions to reduce by eighty
percent by 2050 I just picked that as a

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:50.860
percent by 2050 I just picked that as a
 

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.160
percent by 2050 I just picked that as a
number it's often bandied about it's

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:53.170
number it's often bandied about it's
 

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.740
number it's often bandied about it's
it's it's used by 350.org you see the

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:55.750
it's it's used by 350.org you see the
 

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.900
it's it's used by 350.org you see the
small island nations have used that

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:57.910
small island nations have used that
 

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.550
small island nations have used that
number if you like seventy percent

00:31:59.550 --> 00:31:59.560
number if you like seventy percent
 

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.010
number if you like seventy percent
that's fine fifty percent by 2050 that's

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:02.020
that's fine fifty percent by 2050 that's
 

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.070
that's fine fifty percent by 2050 that's
okay too ninety-five percent none of the

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.080
okay too ninety-five percent none of the
 

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.100
okay too ninety-five percent none of the
conclusions i'll present to you our are

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:07.110
conclusions i'll present to you our are
 

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:09.090

number so you know now from the kaya

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.010
number so you know now from the kaya
 

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.010

identity that we have to specify a rate

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:14.020
identity that we have to specify a rate
 

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.980
identity that we have to specify a rate
of gdp growth in order to talk about

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:16.990
of gdp growth in order to talk about
 

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:18.690
of gdp growth in order to talk about
what this decarbonisation curve will be

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:18.700
what this decarbonisation curve will be
 

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.860
what this decarbonisation curve will be
in the future so i'll give you five and

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:22.870
in the future so i'll give you five and
 

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.510
in the future so i'll give you five and
i'll give you an anchor so this starts

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:24.520
i'll give you an anchor so this starts
 

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.930
i'll give you an anchor so this starts
at that point 62 and if we have to

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:27.940
at that point 62 and if we have to
 

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.180
at that point 62 and if we have to
reduce emissions eighty percent by 2050

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:30.190
reduce emissions eighty percent by 2050
 

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:32.910
reduce emissions eighty percent by 2050
for five different rates of gdp growth

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:32.920
for five different rates of gdp growth
 

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.300
for five different rates of gdp growth
so one percent to five percent and give

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:36.310
so one percent to five percent and give
 

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.640
so one percent to five percent and give
you an anchor 1982 2006 was

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:38.650
you an anchor 1982 2006 was
 

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.310
you an anchor 1982 2006 was
three-point-five percent all of them are

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320
three-point-five percent all of them are
 

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.750
three-point-five percent all of them are
below point one so we're at Point 62 so

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760
below point one so we're at Point 62 so
 

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.490
below point one so we're at Point 62 so
if I say we have to go from point six

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:47.500
if I say we have to go from point six
 

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.010
if I say we have to go from point six
22.1 you might say oh that's only point

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:50.020
22.1 you might say oh that's only point
 

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.930
22.1 you might say oh that's only point
five point five that's a small number

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:51.940
five point five that's a small number
 

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.050
five point five that's a small number
easy no problem so what I'd like to do

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:55.060
easy no problem so what I'd like to do
 

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.700
easy no problem so what I'd like to do
next is give you a

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:56.710
next is give you a
 

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.889
next is give you a
sense of what is that in terms of a

00:32:58.889 --> 00:32:58.899
sense of what is that in terms of a
 

00:32:58.899 --> 00:33:01.680
sense of what is that in terms of a
policy ask what does that mean more

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:01.690
policy ask what does that mean more
 

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.990
policy ask what does that mean more
intuitively than these abstract

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000
intuitively than these abstract
 

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.870
intuitively than these abstract
decarbonisation numbers and the reason I

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880
decarbonisation numbers and the reason I
 

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.840
decarbonisation numbers and the reason I
say that the stabilization target

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:09.850
say that the stabilization target
 

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:12.659
say that the stabilization target
doesn't matter and the emissions the

00:33:12.659 --> 00:33:12.669
doesn't matter and the emissions the
 

00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:14.399
doesn't matter and the emissions the
amount doesn't matter they're they're

00:33:14.399 --> 00:33:14.409
amount doesn't matter they're they're
 

00:33:14.409 --> 00:33:16.409
amount doesn't matter they're they're
all below point one and if you want to

00:33:16.409 --> 00:33:16.419
all below point one and if you want to
 

00:33:16.419 --> 00:33:18.960
all below point one and if you want to
go below point2 that's fine but the

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:18.970
go below point2 that's fine but the
 

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.360
go below point2 that's fine but the
challenge of getting them low is

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:21.370
challenge of getting them low is
 

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:22.919
challenge of getting them low is
essentially the same from a policy

00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:22.929
essentially the same from a policy
 

00:33:22.929 --> 00:33:24.630
essentially the same from a policy
standpoint it's insensitive to your

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640
standpoint it's insensitive to your
 

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.610
standpoint it's insensitive to your
target because the challenge is so large

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:28.620
target because the challenge is so large
 

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.409
target because the challenge is so large
so I took the middle range I stapled it

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:31.419
so I took the middle range I stapled it
 

00:33:31.419 --> 00:33:32.850
so I took the middle range I stapled it
on to that historical curve that's what

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:32.860
on to that historical curve that's what
 

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.500
on to that historical curve that's what
it looks like that's what we would have

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:34.510
it looks like that's what we would have
 

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.740
it looks like that's what we would have
to do for a three percent gdp growth

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:37.750
to do for a three percent gdp growth
 

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:40.860
to do for a three percent gdp growth
rate and i'm going to start i'm going to

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:40.870
rate and i'm going to start i'm going to
 

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.149
rate and i'm going to start i'm going to
drill down now i'm going to talk about

00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159
drill down now i'm going to talk about
 

00:33:42.159 --> 00:33:45.570
drill down now i'm going to talk about

test of efforts to try to decarbonize
 

00:33:57.429 --> 00:34:00.990
test of efforts to try to decarbonize
through policy here's the

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000
through policy here's the
 

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.700
through policy here's the

decarbonisation curve for the united
 

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:04.409
decarbonisation curve for the united

you see this steady downward slope from

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:13.540
you see this steady downward slope from
 

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:17.760
you see this steady downward slope from
1982 2006 the UK is actually a very

1982 2006 the UK is actually a very
 

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.250
1982 2006 the UK is actually a very
carbon efficient economy there are about

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:20.260
carbon efficient economy there are about
 

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.349
carbon efficient economy there are about
fifty percent more carbon efficient than

and all you need to see is the slope the
 

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.480
and all you need to see is the slope the
slopes shows that manufacturing went

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:48.490
slopes shows that manufacturing went
 

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:52.859
slopes shows that manufacturing went
from about thirty two percent 1972 about

00:34:52.859 --> 00:34:52.869
from about thirty two percent 1972 about
 

00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:57.380
from about thirty two percent 1972 about
twelve percent in 2007

00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:00.300
 
so the legislation that was passed by

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:00.310
so the legislation that was passed by
 

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:02.160
so the legislation that was passed by
the UK parliament in december two

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:02.170
the UK parliament in december two
 

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:06.660
the UK parliament in december two
thousand eight mandated that the UK

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:06.670
thousand eight mandated that the UK
 

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:09.120
thousand eight mandated that the UK
reduce its overall emissions by thirty

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:09.130
reduce its overall emissions by thirty
 

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:14.640
reduce its overall emissions by thirty
four percent 1990 levels by 2022 so now

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:14.650
four percent 1990 levels by 2022 so now
 

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.370
four percent 1990 levels by 2022 so now
that we have a kaya identity as our tool

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:17.380
that we have a kaya identity as our tool
 

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.400
that we have a kaya identity as our tool
we can say well what does that mean for

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:19.410
we can say well what does that mean for
 

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:23.250
we can say well what does that mean for
decarbonisation so here's that curve

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:23.260
decarbonisation so here's that curve
 

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.920

starts at that point for two when i

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:25.930
starts at that point for two when i
 

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.260
starts at that point for two when i
first did this analysis i assume that

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:28.270
first did this analysis i assume that
 

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:30.810
first did this analysis i assume that
the economy of the UK was going to grow

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:30.820
the economy of the UK was going to grow
 

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.270
the economy of the UK was going to grow
turns out that the economy of the UK has

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280
turns out that the economy of the UK has
 

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.240
turns out that the economy of the UK has
shrunk fairly dramatically since then

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:36.250
shrunk fairly dramatically since then
 

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.520
shrunk fairly dramatically since then
which gives the illusion of progress

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:38.530
which gives the illusion of progress
 

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.380

know there's some economists who tell me
it's an identical book cap-and-trade but

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200
it's an identical book cap-and-trade but
 

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.950
it's an identical book cap-and-trade but
why not put a price on death and have

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960
why not put a price on death and have
 

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.870
why not put a price on death and have

so I'll go back to this graph imagine

00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:42.580
so I'll go back to this graph imagine
 

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:47.010
so I'll go back to this graph imagine
this is the human lifespan graph it had

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:47.020
this is the human lifespan graph it had
 

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.960
this is the human lifespan graph it had
a curve something like that how are we

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:48.970
a curve something like that how are we
 

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:52.380
a curve something like that how are we
able to do that all right so oh and this

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:52.390
able to do that all right so oh and this

even more provocative and some of the
chapters that follow so for instance

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:17.860
chapters that follow so for instance
 

00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:23.820
chapters that follow so for instance
about how it is in what some scientists

00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:23.830
about how it is in what some scientists
 

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:26.160
about how it is in what some scientists
anyway in politicians especially tell us

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:26.170
anyway in politicians especially tell us
 

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:27.930
anyway in politicians especially tell us
about climate change that they're

00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:27.940
about climate change that they're
 

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:31.680

these kinds of facts but but others as

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:33.790
these kinds of facts but but others as
 

00:58:33.790 --> 00:58:36.030
these kinds of facts but but others as
well about about climate science and

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:36.040
well about about climate science and
 

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.840
well about about climate science and
about climate modelling so I was

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:39.850
about climate modelling so I was
 

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:41.190
about climate modelling so I was
wondering if you could just talk a

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200
wondering if you could just talk a
 

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.750
wondering if you could just talk a
little bit about that just give us a

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760
little bit about that just give us a
 

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.250
little bit about that just give us a
flavor you know for

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:44.260
flavor you know for
 

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:47.940
flavor you know for
some of the very direct arguments you

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:47.950
some of the very direct arguments you
 

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:51.150
some of the very direct arguments you
make about for instance some of the work

00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160
make about for instance some of the work
 

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.170
make about for instance some of the work
that you especially well known for about

00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180
that you especially well known for about
 

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:56.280
that you especially well known for about
hurricanes for instance and how that

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:56.290
hurricanes for instance and how that
 

00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:59.880
hurricanes for instance and how that
figures in climate politics yeah let me

00:58:59.880 --> 00:58:59.890
figures in climate politics yeah let me
 

00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:03.030
figures in climate politics yeah let me
um I mean there's a lot I know that's

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040
um I mean there's a lot I know that's
 

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.440
um I mean there's a lot I know that's
that's a lot we could talk about here

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:04.450
that's a lot we could talk about here
 

00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:06.120
that's a lot we could talk about here
but yeah but if you go back to one of

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:06.130
but yeah but if you go back to one of
 

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:07.890
but yeah but if you go back to one of
that first graphs that I showed with the

00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:07.900
that first graphs that I showed with the
 

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.570
that first graphs that I showed with the
integrated assessment model and you know

00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:09.580
integrated assessment model and you know
 

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.990
integrated assessment model and you know

on it became part of the debate that
 

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:21.680
on it became part of the debate that
there had to be consensus reached on

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:21.690
there had to be consensus reached on
 

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:24.090
there had to be consensus reached on

sort of causal link between degree of

01:02:03.759 --> 01:02:06.329

more polarization and I think there's a

01:02:06.329 --> 01:02:06.339
more polarization and I think there's a
 

01:02:06.339 --> 01:02:11.549

01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559
you know a great exact on policy
 

01:02:11.559 --> 01:02:14.579
you know a great exact on policy

there has been very little policy effect

there has been very little policy effect
what it does do though is it has served

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:20.380
what it does do though is it has served
 

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.589
what it does do though is it has served
to politicize the scientific community

01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599
to politicize the scientific community
 

01:02:22.599 --> 01:02:26.609
to politicize the scientific community
has undercut the legitimacy that leading

you take a look at polling data over the
 

01:02:32.469 --> 01:02:35.130
you take a look at polling data over the
last 15 years one trend that is

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:35.140
last 15 years one trend that is
 

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.620
last 15 years one trend that is
consistent across Republicans Democrats

course is the belief that the scientific

01:02:42.719 --> 01:02:42.729
course is the belief that the scientific
 

01:02:42.729 --> 01:02:45.420
course is the belief that the scientific
community exaggerated seeeeee claims on

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:45.430
community exaggerated seeeeee claims on
 

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:48.420
community exaggerated seeeeee claims on
climate change and that's partly a

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:48.430
climate change and that's partly a
 

01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:50.009
climate change and that's partly a
reflection of the idea that this has

01:02:50.009 --> 01:02:50.019
reflection of the idea that this has
 

01:02:50.019 --> 01:02:53.819
reflection of the idea that this has
just become a politicized issue you see

01:02:53.819 --> 01:02:53.829
just become a politicized issue you see
 

01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:55.289
just become a politicized issue you see
this you mean raise the issue of

01:02:55.289 --> 01:02:55.299
this you mean raise the issue of
 

01:02:55.299 --> 01:02:59.789
this you mean raise the issue of
hurricanes the science of hurricanes you

01:02:59.789 --> 01:02:59.799
hurricanes the science of hurricanes you
 

01:02:59.799 --> 01:03:00.500
hurricanes the science of hurricanes you
know

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:00.510
know
 

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.270
know
looking back in time there are

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280
looking back in time there are
 

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.190
looking back in time there are
projections we can have more intense

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200
projections we can have more intense
 

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.110

hurricanes going forward but looking

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:06.120
hurricanes going forward but looking
 

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.820
hurricanes going forward but looking
back in time the science of Hurricane it

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:07.830
back in time the science of Hurricane it
 

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:12.110
back in time the science of Hurricane it
is not rocket science counting

01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:12.120
is not rocket science counting
 

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.520
is not rocket science counting
hurricanes is pretty straightforward you

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:13.530
hurricanes is pretty straightforward you
 

01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:15.350
hurricanes is pretty straightforward you
don't you don't miss them when Sandy

01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:15.360
don't you don't miss them when Sandy
 

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.730
don't you don't miss them when Sandy
comes through New York you see that it's

01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:16.740
comes through New York you see that it's
 

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.860
comes through New York you see that it's
here so counting up the number of

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:18.870
here so counting up the number of
 

01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:21.100
here so counting up the number of

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:21.110
hurricanes that have made landfall
 

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:22.910
hurricanes that have made landfall
historically is pretty straightforward

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920
historically is pretty straightforward
 

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:25.400
historically is pretty straightforward
science and the reality is there has not

science and the reality is there has not
 

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:29.360
science and the reality is there has not
been an increase in those storms might

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:29.370
been an increase in those storms might
 

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.130
been an increase in those storms might
there be in the future very possibly so

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:31.140
there be in the future very possibly so
 

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.200
there be in the future very possibly so
in fact right now we're in the longest

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:33.210
in fact right now we're in the longest
 

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.600
in fact right now we're in the longest

and it's just a throwaway line I know
 

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.630
and it's just a throwaway line I know
and he says you know we're having more

he did his radio address he actually
 

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:02.750
he did his radio address he actually
said hurricanes and not a single climate

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760

say well he actually got this point
 

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.040
say well he actually got this point
wrong not one of them says that it's

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:10.050
wrong not one of them says that it's
 

01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:11.810
wrong not one of them says that it's
assigned to me that there's something

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:11.820
assigned to me that there's something
 

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.940

not quite right in the scientific

not quite right in the scientific
 

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.680
not quite right in the scientific
community because you can imagine if

the world is not warming you can imagine

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:25.950
the world is not warming you can imagine
 

01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:27.230
the world is not warming you can imagine
that the scientific community would have

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240
that the scientific community would have
 

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:30.830
that the scientific community would have
gone nuts to correct that error I think

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:30.840
gone nuts to correct that error I think
 

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:32.480
gone nuts to correct that error I think
the scientific community gains

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:32.490
the scientific community gains
 

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:35.680
the scientific community gains
legitimacy by being fair-minded about

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:35.690
legitimacy by being fair-minded about
 

01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:40.100

statements by public officials even if

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:42.510
statements by public officials even if
 

01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:46.040
statements by public officials even if
they support the cause so I think that

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:46.050
they support the cause so I think that
 

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:48.620
they support the cause so I think that
the disaster issue is one there's a long

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:48.630
the disaster issue is one there's a long
 

01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:50.600
the disaster issue is one there's a long
story that I relate in the book and it's

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:50.610
story that I relate in the book and it's
 

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:52.070
story that I relate in the book and it's
gotten longer since the book was written

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:52.080
gotten longer since the book was written
 

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.150
gotten longer since the book was written
about how the IPCC has had very

01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:55.160
about how the IPCC has had very
 

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.320
about how the IPCC has had very
difficult times with a disaster issue

they finally did get it right in 2012

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:00.170
they finally did get it right in 2012
 

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:04.220
they finally did get it right in 2012
but the scientific community has become

01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:04.230
but the scientific community has become
 

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.720
but the scientific community has become
wrapped up in the politics and I think

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:05.730
wrapped up in the politics and I think
 

01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:07.430
wrapped up in the politics and I think
that hurts the science and I don't think

01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440
that hurts the science and I don't think
 

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.220
that hurts the science and I don't think
it's particularly to the policy issues

01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:10.230
it's particularly to the policy issues
 

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:12.830
it's particularly to the policy issues

you for the talk I'm wondering you
 

01:05:31.769 --> 01:05:34.279
you for the talk I'm wondering you
talked a little bit about in your book

01:05:34.279 --> 01:05:34.289
talked a little bit about in your book
 

01:05:34.289 --> 01:05:36.650
talked a little bit about in your book
about the kind of the role of scientists

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660
about the kind of the role of scientists
 

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:38.120
about the kind of the role of scientists
and how in many ways science is kind of

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:38.130
and how in many ways science is kind of
 

01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:39.410

getting this tendency to exaggerate
things or not do the things that you

01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:41.579
things or not do the things that you
 

01:05:41.579 --> 01:05:42.799
things or not do the things that you
believe they should do and I'm just

01:05:42.799 --> 01:05:42.809
believe they should do and I'm just
 

01:05:42.809 --> 01:05:44.989
believe they should do and I'm just
wondering in order to deal with this

01:05:44.989 --> 01:05:44.999
wondering in order to deal with this
 

01:05:44.999 --> 01:05:46.609
wondering in order to deal with this
climate change issue it seems like

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:46.619
climate change issue it seems like
 

01:05:46.619 --> 01:05:48.979
climate change issue it seems like
almost people often say that the science

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:48.989
almost people often say that the science
 

01:05:48.989 --> 01:05:51.319
almost people often say that the science
is already done there the scientists

01:05:51.319 --> 01:05:51.329
is already done there the scientists
 

01:05:51.329 --> 01:05:52.910
is already done there the scientists
concluded the science we know what the

01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920
concluded the science we know what the
 

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.370
concluded the science we know what the
science is it's going to happen so I'm

01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:55.380
science is it's going to happen so I'm
 

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.959
science is it's going to happen so I'm
wondering what do you think the role the

01:05:56.959 --> 01:05:56.969
wondering what do you think the role the
 

01:05:56.969 --> 01:05:59.989
wondering what do you think the role the
scientists should be from here on fourth

01:05:59.989 --> 01:05:59.999
scientists should be from here on fourth
 

01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:02.299
scientists should be from here on fourth
if in fact you assume that this science

01:06:02.299 --> 01:06:02.309
if in fact you assume that this science
 

01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:04.339
if in fact you assume that this science
is already known conclusively this

01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:04.349
is already known conclusively this

climate change issue is really an issue

01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359
climate change issue is really an issue
 

01:06:06.359 --> 01:06:08.689
climate change issue is really an issue
worth dealing with yeah that's a great

01:06:08.689 --> 01:06:08.699
worth dealing with yeah that's a great
 

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:10.279
worth dealing with yeah that's a great
question and you know I Tim it's really

01:06:10.279 --> 01:06:10.289
question and you know I Tim it's really
 

01:06:10.289 --> 01:06:11.959
question and you know I Tim it's really
important to say I mean and I I do give

01:06:11.959 --> 01:06:11.969
important to say I mean and I I do give
 

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:13.999
important to say I mean and I I do give
the scientist a hard time I think

01:06:13.999 --> 01:06:14.009
the scientist a hard time I think
 

01:06:14.009 --> 01:06:17.329
the scientist a hard time I think
deservedly so but but the scientific

01:06:17.329 --> 01:06:17.339
deservedly so but but the scientific
 

01:06:17.339 --> 01:06:20.089
deservedly so but but the scientific
community really over almost a half

01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099

to the public's attention a challenge a
problem that the public would not

01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559
problem that the public would not
 

01:06:28.559 --> 01:06:32.930

established that humans affect the
 

01:06:34.319 --> 01:06:36.979
established that humans affect the
climate system and that effect could be

climate system and that effect could be
 

01:06:36.989 --> 01:06:39.019
climate system and that effect could be
very negative going forward and we have

01:06:39.019 --> 01:06:39.029
very negative going forward and we have
 

01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:40.819
very negative going forward and we have
the scientific community to thank for

01:06:40.819 --> 01:06:40.829
the scientific community to thank for
 

01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:42.469
the scientific community to thank for
bringing that to our attention what that

01:06:42.469 --> 01:06:42.479
bringing that to our attention what that
 

01:06:42.479 --> 01:06:44.299
bringing that to our attention what that
does is it opens up a space of

01:06:44.299 --> 01:06:44.309
does is it opens up a space of
 

01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:46.699
does is it opens up a space of
possibility where the scientific

01:06:46.699 --> 01:06:46.709
possibility where the scientific
 

01:06:46.709 --> 01:06:48.469
possibility where the scientific
community got into trouble wasn't then

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:11.430
to expand the issue let's put energy
 

01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:13.070
to expand the issue let's put energy
access at the center try that for a

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:13.080
access at the center try that for a
 

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.380

while see if that gives us more

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:15.390
while see if that gives us more
 

01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:19.099
while see if that gives us more
motivation for energy innovation will it

01:08:19.099 --> 01:08:19.109
motivation for energy innovation will it
 

01:08:19.109 --> 01:08:21.370
motivation for energy innovation will it
work I have no idea is it better than

01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:21.380
work I have no idea is it better than
 

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.660
work I have no idea is it better than
cap-and-trade yeah I'm very convinced

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:23.670
cap-and-trade yeah I'm very convinced
 

01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:25.970
cap-and-trade yeah I'm very convinced
about that but I would love to see the

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:25.980
about that but I would love to see the
 

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:28.340
about that but I would love to see the
scientific community in wholesale

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:28.350

you don't believe there's a problem the

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:47.730
you don't believe there's a problem the
 

01:08:47.730 --> 01:08:49.730
you don't believe there's a problem the
second level is the climate impact

01:08:49.730 --> 01:08:49.740
second level is the climate impact
 

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.170
second level is the climate impact
deniers these are the people who don't

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:51.180
deniers these are the people who don't
 

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.060
deniers these are the people who don't
believe that the impacts are severe and

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:53.070
believe that the impacts are severe and
 

01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:55.400
believe that the impacts are severe and
at the third level are the climate

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:55.410
at the third level are the climate
 

01:08:55.410 --> 01:08:57.680
at the third level are the climate
policy deniers there against the

01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:57.690
policy deniers there against the
 

01:08:57.690 --> 01:08:59.360
policy deniers there against the
framework convention on climate change

01:08:59.360 --> 01:08:59.370

now once you equate belief in science

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980
now once you equate belief in science
 

01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:04.190
now once you equate belief in science
with belief in a single policy I think

01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:04.200
with belief in a single policy I think
 

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.750
with belief in a single policy I think
something's gone very wrong and how we

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:05.760
something's gone very wrong and how we
 

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:09.320
something's gone very wrong and how we
deal with sticky issues without a lot of

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:09.330
deal with sticky issues without a lot of

hi so I like the fact that you brought
up energy access to the forefront it's

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239
up energy access to the forefront it's
 

01:09:22.239 --> 01:09:24.809
up energy access to the forefront it's
very important one of the millennial

01:09:24.809 --> 01:09:24.819
very important one of the millennial
 

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:27.809
very important one of the millennial
goes so my question is more than human

01:09:27.809 --> 01:09:27.819
goes so my question is more than human
 

01:09:27.819 --> 01:09:32.099
goes so my question is more than human
aspect if energy access was afforded to

01:09:32.099 --> 01:09:32.109
aspect if energy access was afforded to
 

01:09:32.109 --> 01:09:33.959
aspect if energy access was afforded to
everyone on the planet if it was

01:09:33.959 --> 01:09:33.969
everyone on the planet if it was
 

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:36.510
everyone on the planet if it was
renewable if it was carbon free egg be

01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:36.520
renewable if it was carbon free egg be
 

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.329
renewable if it was carbon free egg be
done in a day would there be anyone to

01:09:39.329 --> 01:09:39.339
done in a day would there be anyone to
 

01:09:39.339 --> 01:09:42.150
done in a day would there be anyone to
stop it would it be adopted freely by a

01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:42.160
stop it would it be adopted freely by a
 

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:47.070
stop it would it be adopted freely by a
people so here's the the big challenge

01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080
people so here's the the big challenge
 

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:52.370
people so here's the the big challenge
is that it would be nice if we had the

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.380
is that it would be nice if we had the
 

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.900
is that it would be nice if we had the
technologies at scale that were

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:54.910
technologies at scale that were
 

01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:57.870
technologies at scale that were
carbon-free that were technologically

01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880
carbon-free that were technologically
 

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:01.100
carbon-free that were technologically
ready economically affordable and

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:01.110
ready economically affordable and
 

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:05.780
ready economically affordable and
politically acceptable we have a

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:05.790
politically acceptable we have a
 

01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:12.120
politically acceptable we have a
technology that provides lots of energy

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:12.130
technology that provides lots of energy
 

01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:15.000
technology that provides lots of energy
is reasonably safe that it's sharply

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:15.010
is reasonably safe that it's sharply
 

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.430
is reasonably safe that it's sharply
contested nuclear power right the world

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440
contested nuclear power right the world
 

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.680
contested nuclear power right the world
could set on a path of saying we're

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:19.690
could set on a path of saying we're
 

01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:23.100
could set on a path of saying we're
going to replace every coal plant

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:23.110
going to replace every coal plant
 

01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:24.990
going to replace every coal plant
worldwide with the nuclear power plants

01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:25.000
worldwide with the nuclear power plants
 

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.310
worldwide with the nuclear power plants
would it cost money yeah it would cost

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320
would it cost money yeah it would cost
 

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.400
would it cost money yeah it would cost
money a lot of climate advocates would

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:29.410
money a lot of climate advocates would
 

01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:30.630
money a lot of climate advocates would
probably say it's cheaper though given

01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640
probably say it's cheaper though given
 

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:32.880
probably say it's cheaper though given
the costs and benefits the externalities

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:32.890
the costs and benefits the externalities
 

01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:36.479
the costs and benefits the externalities
and so on so what do you do with nuclear

01:10:36.479 --> 01:10:36.489
and so on so what do you do with nuclear
 

01:10:36.489 --> 01:10:39.209
and so on so what do you do with nuclear
proliferation issues what do you do with

01:10:39.209 --> 01:10:39.219
proliferation issues what do you do with
 

01:10:39.219 --> 01:10:41.310
proliferation issues what do you do with
the Middle East what do you do with

01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320
the Middle East what do you do with
 

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.320
the Middle East what do you do with
nuclear waste what do you do with

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:43.330
nuclear waste what do you do with
 

01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:47.820
nuclear waste what do you do with
technology transfer we could build large

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:47.830
technology transfer we could build large
 

01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:50.729
technology transfer we could build large
dams Africa has a lot of places where

01:10:50.729 --> 01:10:50.739
dams Africa has a lot of places where
 

01:10:50.739 --> 01:10:52.260
dams Africa has a lot of places where
you could still build very large dams

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:52.270
you could still build very large dams
 

01:10:52.270 --> 01:10:56.100
you could still build very large dams
for hydropower you could build solar

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:56.110
for hydropower you could build solar
 

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:59.610
for hydropower you could build solar

the most contested issues in Australia

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:02.050
the most contested issues in Australia
 

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.110
the most contested issues in Australia
and in great britain right now is the

01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:04.120
and in great britain right now is the
 

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.720
and in great britain right now is the
siting of wind farms people don't want

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:06.730
siting of wind farms people don't want
 

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:10.530
siting of wind farms people don't want
them so the energy issues they very

01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:10.540
them so the energy issues they very
 

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:13.040
them so the energy issues they very
rapidly involve much more than just

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:13.050
rapidly involve much more than just
 

01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:15.330

energy technology does constituency for
 

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:20.910
energy technology does constituency for
and against so my reading of that is

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:20.920
and against so my reading of that is
 

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:22.350
and against so my reading of that is
that the politics are such that there

01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360
that the politics are such that there
 

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.780
that the politics are such that there
isn't a global consensus on either

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:24.790
isn't a global consensus on either
 

01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:27.140

Germany is right now deciding they would
 

01:11:31.679 --> 01:11:33.229
Germany is right now deciding they would
rather have co2 emissions in nuclear

01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239
rather have co2 emissions in nuclear
 

01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:35.780

power is that acceptable in a democracy

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:35.790
power is that acceptable in a democracy
 

01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:38.450
power is that acceptable in a democracy
I don't know so it becomes really

01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460
I don't know so it becomes really
 

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:45.470
I don't know so it becomes really
difficult really fast hmm thank you yeah

the hungry world and stuff like that and
 

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:56.120
the hungry world and stuff like that and
how you know these other kinds of you

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:56.130
how you know these other kinds of you
 

01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:58.070
how you know these other kinds of you
know non grandiose things can motivate

01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080
know non grandiose things can motivate
 

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.910
know non grandiose things can motivate
important action but like if the energy

01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920
important action but like if the energy

access problem is happening in the

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:03.330
access problem is happening in the
 

01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:04.700
access problem is happening in the
poorest parts of the world like what's

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:04.710
poorest parts of the world like what's
 

01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:06.020
poorest parts of the world like what's
the strategic concern that's going to

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:06.030
the strategic concern that's going to
 

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.610
the strategic concern that's going to
make rich countries do something about

01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.620
make rich countries do something about
 

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:11.930
make rich countries do something about
it particularly when I mean you know I

01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:11.940
it particularly when I mean you know I

mean the other part of that book says

01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560
mean the other part of that book says
 

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.459
mean the other part of that book says
that part of the solution is the

01:12:16.459 --> 01:12:16.469
that part of the solution is the
 

01:12:16.469 --> 01:12:17.780
that part of the solution is the
strategic thing but also the way you

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:17.790
strategic thing but also the way you
 

01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:19.430
strategic thing but also the way you
frame the problem you know like was

01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440

global hunger actually solved no not

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:21.030
global hunger actually solved no not
 

01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:24.979
global hunger actually solved no not
really right right um and I mean you

01:12:24.979 --> 01:12:24.989
really right right um and I mean you
 

01:12:24.989 --> 01:12:26.209
really right right um and I mean you
know it's like we've made a lot of

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:26.219
know it's like we've made a lot of
 

01:12:26.219 --> 01:12:28.880
know it's like we've made a lot of
expenses with you know health and things

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:28.890
expenses with you know health and things
 

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:30.770
expenses with you know health and things
like that but like malaria is unsolved

01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780
like that but like malaria is unsolved
 

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.479
like that but like malaria is unsolved
because it's not of interest to

01:12:32.479 --> 01:12:32.489
because it's not of interest to
 

01:12:32.489 --> 01:12:35.240
because it's not of interest to
pharmaceutical companies so well I mean

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:35.250
pharmaceutical companies so well I mean
 

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:36.620
pharmaceutical companies so well I mean
what do you see being that thing for

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:36.630
what do you see being that thing for
 

01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:38.479
what do you see being that thing for
energy access in the dark parts of the

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:38.489
energy access in the dark parts of the
 

01:12:38.489 --> 01:12:40.700
energy access in the dark parts of the
world now China and India yeah I mean

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:40.710
world now China and India yeah I mean
 

01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:43.370
world now China and India yeah I mean
it's a great question and I have some

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:43.380
it's a great question and I have some
 

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.140
it's a great question and I have some
numbers I just roam down from memory i

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:45.150
numbers I just roam down from memory i
 

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:46.610
numbers I just roam down from memory i
don't know if they're correct i tweeted

01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:46.620
don't know if they're correct i tweeted
 

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:47.870
don't know if they're correct i tweeted
them around from i was at a meeting

01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880
them around from i was at a meeting
 

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.959
them around from i was at a meeting
earlier this week on energy access so

01:12:50.959 --> 01:12:50.969
earlier this week on energy access so
 

01:12:50.969 --> 01:12:54.110
earlier this week on energy access so
take pakistan pakistan has and I think

01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120
take pakistan pakistan has and I think
 

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.250
take pakistan pakistan has and I think
these are right you can check me but

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260
these are right you can check me but
 

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.770
these are right you can check me but
they're approximately correct seven

01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780
they're approximately correct seven
 

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.320
they're approximately correct seven
thousand megawatts have installed

01:12:59.320 --> 01:12:59.330
thousand megawatts have installed
 

01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:01.490
thousand megawatts have installed
electricity capacity for 90 million

01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:01.500
electricity capacity for 90 million
 

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:05.860
electricity capacity for 90 million
people seven thousand for 90 million

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:05.870
people seven thousand for 90 million
 

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:10.580
people seven thousand for 90 million
Virginia the state of Virginia has forty

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:10.590
Virginia the state of Virginia has forty
 

01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:13.939
Virginia the state of Virginia has forty
thousand megawatts 47 million people so

01:13:13.939 --> 01:13:13.949
thousand megawatts 47 million people so
 

01:13:13.949 --> 01:13:16.610
thousand megawatts 47 million people so
I would say do you think energy access

01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.620
I would say do you think energy access
 

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:19.510
I would say do you think energy access
has anything to do with the geopolitical

01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520
has anything to do with the geopolitical
 

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.990
has anything to do with the geopolitical
situation that Pakistan finds itself in

01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000
situation that Pakistan finds itself in
 

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.419
situation that Pakistan finds itself in
and relations between Pakistan and the

01:13:26.419 --> 01:13:26.429
and relations between Pakistan and the
 

01:13:26.429 --> 01:13:31.880
and relations between Pakistan and the
United States and so on i would say that

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:31.890
United States and so on i would say that
 

01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:34.280
United States and so on i would say that
there are a lot of related issues they

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:34.290
there are a lot of related issues they
 

01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:36.110
there are a lot of related issues they
may not be linear and they may not be

01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120
may not be linear and they may not be
 

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:40.979
may not be linear and they may not be
directly causal issues for which

01:13:40.979 --> 01:13:40.989
directly causal issues for which
 

01:13:40.989 --> 01:13:44.759
directly causal issues for which
energy access plays a key role the

01:13:44.759 --> 01:13:44.769
energy access plays a key role the
 

01:13:44.769 --> 01:13:46.049
energy access plays a key role the
previous questioner mentioned the

01:13:46.049 --> 01:13:46.059
previous questioner mentioned the
 

01:13:46.059 --> 01:13:47.160
previous questioner mentioned the
Millennium Development Goals it turns

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:47.170
Millennium Development Goals it turns
 

01:13:47.170 --> 01:13:49.080
Millennium Development Goals it turns
out that energy access was not a

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:49.090
out that energy access was not a
 

01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:50.879
out that energy access was not a
millennium development goal I wasn't

01:13:50.879 --> 01:13:50.889
millennium development goal I wasn't
 

01:13:50.889 --> 01:13:52.919
millennium development goal I wasn't
involved in process I don't know why I

01:13:52.919 --> 01:13:52.929
involved in process I don't know why I
 

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:54.959
involved in process I don't know why I
think it will be going forward I think

01:13:54.959 --> 01:13:54.969
think it will be going forward I think
 

01:13:54.969 --> 01:13:57.000
think it will be going forward I think
the next decade is the UN is targeted to

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:57.010
the next decade is the UN is targeted to
 

01:13:57.010 --> 01:13:59.600
the next decade is the UN is targeted to
be the International decade of

01:13:59.600 --> 01:13:59.610
be the International decade of
 

01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:04.410
be the International decade of
sustainable energy for all but it has

01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:04.420
sustainable energy for all but it has
 

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.419
sustainable energy for all but it has
not been at the center of discussions

01:14:06.419 --> 01:14:06.429
not been at the center of discussions
 

01:14:06.429 --> 01:14:10.350
not been at the center of discussions
like climate change has been like other

01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:10.360
like climate change has been like other
 

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.359
like climate change has been like other
issues have been and I would say if you

01:14:12.359 --> 01:14:12.369
issues have been and I would say if you
 

01:14:12.369 --> 01:14:14.759
issues have been and I would say if you
know for the students here think about

01:14:14.759 --> 01:14:14.769
know for the students here think about
 

01:14:14.769 --> 01:14:16.169
know for the students here think about
it what how much time do you spend

01:14:16.169 --> 01:14:16.179
it what how much time do you spend
 

01:14:16.179 --> 01:14:18.720
it what how much time do you spend
debating worrying about discussing

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:18.730
debating worrying about discussing
 

01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:20.790
debating worrying about discussing
policy options for energy access versus

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800
policy options for energy access versus
 

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.459
policy options for energy access versus
climate change why is it what is it

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:23.469
climate change why is it what is it
 

01:14:23.469 --> 01:14:25.020
climate change why is it what is it
about the issue that has led to one

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:25.030
about the issue that has led to one
 

01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:29.759
about the issue that has led to one
versus the other and I think that energy

01:14:29.759 --> 01:14:29.769
versus the other and I think that energy
 

01:14:29.769 --> 01:14:31.560
versus the other and I think that energy
access as I you know provided the

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:31.570
access as I you know provided the
 

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.330
access as I you know provided the
numbers provides a really compelling

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:33.340
numbers provides a really compelling

justification for innovation policy for
 

01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:39.270
justification for innovation policy for
spending money on innovation policy but

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280
spending money on innovation policy but
 

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.939
spending money on innovation policy but
one that the majority of the world can

one that the majority of the world can
get behind in a way that they are very

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:44.170
get behind in a way that they are very
 

01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:48.569
get behind in a way that they are very
wary about climate policy thank you very

01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:48.579
wary about climate policy thank you very
 

01:14:48.579 --> 01:14:51.779
wary about climate policy thank you very
much for joining us here I just have a

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:51.789
much for joining us here I just have a
 

01:14:51.789 --> 01:14:54.750
much for joining us here I just have a
quick question in terms of the emphasis

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:54.760
quick question in terms of the emphasis
 

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:59.660
quick question in terms of the emphasis
on energy axis so you know your time out

01:14:59.660 --> 01:14:59.670
on energy axis so you know your time out
 

01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:01.910
on energy axis so you know your time out
putting a lot of investments into

01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920
putting a lot of investments into
 

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.339
putting a lot of investments into
renewable energy research more so than

01:15:05.339 --> 01:15:05.349
renewable energy research more so than
 

01:15:05.349 --> 01:15:08.489
renewable energy research more so than
focusing on mitigation or mitigation by

01:15:08.489 --> 01:15:08.499
focusing on mitigation or mitigation by
 

01:15:08.499 --> 01:15:10.979
focusing on mitigation or mitigation by
changing people's behaviors yet the

01:15:10.979 --> 01:15:10.989
changing people's behaviors yet the
 

01:15:10.989 --> 01:15:13.979
changing people's behaviors yet the
statistics that you put up there seemed

01:15:13.979 --> 01:15:13.989
statistics that you put up there seemed
 

01:15:13.989 --> 01:15:17.520
statistics that you put up there seemed
a little bit unrealistic in terms of

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:17.530
a little bit unrealistic in terms of
 

01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:20.669
a little bit unrealistic in terms of
what we have to achieve and the progress

01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:20.679
what we have to achieve and the progress
 

01:15:20.679 --> 01:15:22.229
what we have to achieve and the progress
that we have currently and especially

01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239
that we have currently and especially
 

01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:23.520
that we have currently and especially
seem like some of the biggest sleeps

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:23.530
seem like some of the biggest sleeps
 

01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:26.479
seem like some of the biggest sleeps
like Japan and the UK for instance in

01:15:26.479 --> 01:15:26.489
like Japan and the UK for instance in
 

01:15:26.489 --> 01:15:29.689
like Japan and the UK for instance in
energy intensity efficiency was due to

01:15:29.689 --> 01:15:29.699
energy intensity efficiency was due to
 

01:15:29.699 --> 01:15:32.000
energy intensity efficiency was due to
outsourcing so pretty much you're like

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:32.010
outsourcing so pretty much you're like
 

01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:33.989
outsourcing so pretty much you're like
pushing these energy-intensive

01:15:33.989 --> 01:15:33.999
pushing these energy-intensive
 

01:15:33.999 --> 01:15:35.939
pushing these energy-intensive
industries to other countries that have

01:15:35.939 --> 01:15:35.949
industries to other countries that have
 

01:15:35.949 --> 01:15:38.370
industries to other countries that have
worse infrastructure that are more

01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:38.380
worse infrastructure that are more
 

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.529
worse infrastructure that are more
inefficient that have less access to

01:15:40.529 --> 01:15:40.539
inefficient that have less access to
 

01:15:40.539 --> 01:15:45.270
inefficient that have less access to
renewable energy and given this process

01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280
renewable energy and given this process
 

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.330
renewable energy and given this process
seems that this that focusing on that is

01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:48.340
seems that this that focusing on that is
 

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:51.450
seems that this that focusing on that is
not going to reach the levels that we

01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:51.460
not going to reach the levels that we
 

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.399
not going to reach the levels that we
need especially given that solar and

01:15:53.399 --> 01:15:53.409
need especially given that solar and
 

01:15:53.409 --> 01:15:53.820
need especially given that solar and

our kind of really cost and efficient

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:57.010
our kind of really cost and efficient
 

01:15:57.010 --> 01:15:58.490
our kind of really cost and efficient
right now without severe subsidies

01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500
right now without severe subsidies
 

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.750
right now without severe subsidies
nuclear power is highly contested and

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:00.760
nuclear power is highly contested and
 

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.760
nuclear power is highly contested and
hydroelectric power is very limited in

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:02.770
hydroelectric power is very limited in
 

01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:05.070
hydroelectric power is very limited in
terms of work can be placed so my

01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.080
terms of work can be placed so my
 

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.170
terms of work can be placed so my
question would be how are you supposed

01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:07.180
question would be how are you supposed
 

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.200
question would be how are you supposed
to in just and emphasizing this how are

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:10.210
to in just and emphasizing this how are
 

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:12.330
to in just and emphasizing this how are
you supposed to meet the goals that have

01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:12.340
you supposed to meet the goals that have
 

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:15.480
you supposed to meet the goals that have
been set forward for reaching carbon

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:15.490
been set forward for reaching carbon
 

01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:17.730
been set forward for reaching carbon
neutrality like how more some policies

01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:17.740
neutrality like how more some policies
 

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.500
neutrality like how more some policies
that we can look to more specifically

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:19.510
that we can look to more specifically
 

01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:21.360
that we can look to more specifically
yeah right so i'll give you let me just

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:21.370
yeah right so i'll give you let me just
 

01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:23.880
yeah right so i'll give you let me just
give you two answers one of them is to

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:23.890
give you two answers one of them is to
 

01:16:23.890 --> 01:16:26.250
give you two answers one of them is to
repeat to do the math yourself when you

01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:26.260
repeat to do the math yourself when you
 

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:31.260
repeat to do the math yourself when you
have a chance the uncomfortable reality

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:31.270
have a chance the uncomfortable reality
 

01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:33.540
have a chance the uncomfortable reality
is if you want to stabilize carbon

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:33.550
is if you want to stabilize carbon
 

01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:36.270
is if you want to stabilize carbon

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.070
wind pickier it mathematically it has to
be that way now you might say well I

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080
be that way now you might say well I
 

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.500
be that way now you might say well I
want efficiency to play a big role and I

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:52.510
want efficiency to play a big role and I
 

01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:54.030
want efficiency to play a big role and I
want to reduce the amount of energy we

01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:54.040
want to reduce the amount of energy we
 

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.370
want to reduce the amount of energy we
consume okay let's say you reduce

01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:56.380
consume okay let's say you reduce
 

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:58.230
consume okay let's say you reduce
today's energy can some of that 500

01:16:58.230 --> 01:16:58.240
today's energy can some of that 500
 

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.810
today's energy can some of that 500
quads to 250 fifty percent reduction

01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:00.820
quads to 250 fifty percent reduction
 

01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.400
quads to 250 fifty percent reduction
nobody thinks it's possible let's just

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:02.410
nobody thinks it's possible let's just
 

01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:05.460
nobody thinks it's possible let's just
say that we posited what have you done

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:05.470
say that we posited what have you done
 

01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:07.670
say that we posited what have you done
now only eighty percent of your energy

01:17:07.670 --> 01:17:07.680
now only eighty percent of your energy
 

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.520
now only eighty percent of your energy
has to come from carbon free sources so

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:11.530
has to come from carbon free sources so
 

01:17:11.530 --> 01:17:14.070
has to come from carbon free sources so
you don't really change the nature of

01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080
you don't really change the nature of
 

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.990
you don't really change the nature of
the task we have to get the vast

01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000
the task we have to get the vast
 

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
the task we have to get the vast
majority of our energy consumption from

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:18.010
majority of our energy consumption from
 

01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:21.180
majority of our energy consumption from
carbon free sources this is something

01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:21.190
carbon free sources this is something
 

01:17:21.190 --> 01:17:22.770
carbon free sources this is something
that I think we need to have very

01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:22.780
that I think we need to have very
 

01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:25.050
that I think we need to have very
crystal clear is that all of the

01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:25.060
crystal clear is that all of the
 

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:26.520
crystal clear is that all of the
instruments that we talked about cap and

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:26.530
instruments that we talked about cap and
 

01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:29.370
instruments that we talked about cap and
trade carbon tax the purpose of all of

01:17:29.370 --> 01:17:29.380
trade carbon tax the purpose of all of
 

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:30.780
trade carbon tax the purpose of all of
these instruments is to motivate

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:30.790
these instruments is to motivate
 

01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:33.420
these instruments is to motivate
innovation and energy systems so that we

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:33.430
innovation and energy systems so that we
 

01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:35.940
innovation and energy systems so that we
get to that ninety percent and so the

01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:35.950
get to that ninety percent and so the
 

01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:38.070
get to that ninety percent and so the
debate is really about the means to

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080
debate is really about the means to
 

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.080
debate is really about the means to
achieving this larger goal what I'm

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:40.090
achieving this larger goal what I'm
 

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:41.280
achieving this larger goal what I'm
trying to do is put that larger goal

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:41.290
trying to do is put that larger goal
 

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:44.940
trying to do is put that larger goal
right in front of you because if if we

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:44.950
right in front of you because if if we
 

01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:47.930
right in front of you because if if we
can't do that then we will have failed

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:47.940
can't do that then we will have failed
 

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:50.190
can't do that then we will have failed
when you talk about what policies do we

01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:50.200
when you talk about what policies do we
 

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.300
when you talk about what policies do we
do I would go back to human lifespans

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:53.310
do I would go back to human lifespans
 

01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:56.400
do I would go back to human lifespans
agricultural production and people are

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:56.410
agricultural production and people are
 

01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:59.480
agricultural production and people are
too wrapped up and how we finish the job

01:17:59.480 --> 01:17:59.490
too wrapped up and how we finish the job
 

01:17:59.490 --> 01:18:02.760
too wrapped up and how we finish the job
how do we get to ninety percent I have

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:02.770
how do we get to ninety percent I have
 

01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:05.100
how do we get to ninety percent I have
no clue and now you know really I don't

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:05.110
no clue and now you know really I don't
 

01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:07.680
no clue and now you know really I don't
care what I care about is how we get

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:07.690
care what I care about is how we get
 

01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:09.330
care what I care about is how we get
from thirteen percent where we're at now

01:18:09.330 --> 01:18:09.340
from thirteen percent where we're at now
 

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:12.210
from thirteen percent where we're at now
to fifteen percent and from fifteen

01:18:12.210 --> 01:18:12.220
to fifteen percent and from fifteen
 

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:15.150
to fifteen percent and from fifteen
percent to twenty percent until we make

01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:15.160
percent to twenty percent until we make
 

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.510
percent to twenty percent until we make
those first little steps then it's it's

01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:18.520
those first little steps then it's it's
 

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.580
those first little steps then it's it's
irrelevant to talk about that and the

01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:20.590
irrelevant to talk about that and the
 

01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:21.690
irrelevant to talk about that and the
world's going to look different when

01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:21.700
world's going to look different when
 

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:23.070
world's going to look different when
we're going from fifty percent to

01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:23.080
we're going from fifty percent to
 

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:26.490
we're going from fifty percent to
fifty-five percent so this is the the

01:18:26.490 --> 01:18:26.500
fifty-five percent so this is the the
 

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:29.250
fifty-five percent so this is the the
comprehensiveness and hubris associated

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:29.260
comprehensiveness and hubris associated
 

01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:32.100
comprehensiveness and hubris associated
with solving the climate crisis in one

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:32.110
with solving the climate crisis in one
 

01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:34.530
with solving the climate crisis in one
big bite is one of the factors that have

01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:34.540
big bite is one of the factors that have
 

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:37.520
big bite is one of the factors that have
kept us at thirteen percent for 20 years

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:37.530
kept us at thirteen percent for 20 years
 

01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:40.410
kept us at thirteen percent for 20 years
how are we going to feed the world of 10

01:18:40.410 --> 01:18:40.420
how are we going to feed the world of 10
 

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:42.290
how are we going to feed the world of 10
billion people who want to eat like

01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:42.300
billion people who want to eat like

billion people who want to eat like
Americans in 2050 I have no idea and

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:45.970
Americans in 2050 I have no idea and
 

01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:49.590
Americans in 2050 I have no idea and
most agricultural experts don't either

01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600
most agricultural experts don't either
 

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.540
most agricultural experts don't either
but they know how we improve

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:51.550
but they know how we improve
 

01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:53.400
but they know how we improve
agricultural productivity and we go from

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:53.410
agricultural productivity and we go from
 

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:55.740
agricultural productivity and we go from
a world of 7.5 billion to a world of

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:55.750
a world of 7.5 billion to a world of
 

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:58.520
a world of 7.5 billion to a world of
seven point eight billion and so I think

01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:58.530
seven point eight billion and so I think
 

01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:02.910
seven point eight billion and so I think
part of effective policy design is a

01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:02.920
part of effective policy design is a
 

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.290
part of effective policy design is a
recognition of where we're just

01:19:04.290 --> 01:19:04.300
recognition of where we're just
 

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:07.020
recognition of where we're just
fundamentally ignorant and just in being

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:07.030
fundamentally ignorant and just in being
 

01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:09.330
fundamentally ignorant and just in being
okay with saying we don't know how we're

01:19:09.330 --> 01:19:09.340
okay with saying we don't know how we're
 

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:12.120
okay with saying we don't know how we're
going to finish the job so that's that's

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:12.130
going to finish the job so that's that's
 

01:19:12.130 --> 01:19:13.380
going to finish the job so that's that's
what I would say about policy let's

01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:13.390
what I would say about policy let's
 

01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:15.900
what I would say about policy let's
let's forget about the 2050 what are we

01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:15.910
let's forget about the 2050 what are we
 

01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:19.410
let's forget about the 2050 what are we
going to do to 2020 and until we can

01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:19.420
going to do to 2020 and until we can
 

01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:21.000
going to do to 2020 and until we can
move that dial on that thirteen percent

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:21.010
move that dial on that thirteen percent
 

01:19:21.010 --> 01:19:23.540
move that dial on that thirteen percent
then we're just spinning our wheels

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:23.550
then we're just spinning our wheels
 

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:29.130
then we're just spinning our wheels

hi um I'm curious as to where the United

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:34.280
hi um I'm curious as to where the United
 

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.140
hi um I'm curious as to where the United
States's and your analysis because I saw

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:38.150
States's and your analysis because I saw
 

01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:40.480
States's and your analysis because I saw
some you know interesting analysis of

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:40.490
some you know interesting analysis of
 

01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:44.590
some you know interesting analysis of
the UK and a lot of talk about China but

01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:44.600
the UK and a lot of talk about China but
 

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.750
the UK and a lot of talk about China but
China is actually the fastest

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760
China is actually the fastest
 

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.820
China is actually the fastest
decarbonizing country in the world right

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:48.830
decarbonizing country in the world right
 

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:51.850
decarbonizing country in the world right
now and we're definitely not and on a

01:19:51.850 --> 01:19:51.860
now and we're definitely not and on a
 

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.890
now and we're definitely not and on a
per capita basis we're still emitting

01:19:53.890 --> 01:19:53.900
per capita basis we're still emitting
 

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:57.880
per capita basis we're still emitting
way more than China is and in terms of

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:57.890
way more than China is and in terms of
 

01:19:57.890 --> 01:20:00.550
way more than China is and in terms of
the energy access argument I think it

01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560
the energy access argument I think it
 

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.850
the energy access argument I think it
really comes in here because so agarwal

01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:03.860
really comes in here because so agarwal
 

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:06.160
really comes in here because so agarwal
in terrain back in 1991 made the

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:06.170
in terrain back in 1991 made the
 

01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:09.160
in terrain back in 1991 made the
argument about luxury emissions versus

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:09.170
argument about luxury emissions versus
 

01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:11.650
argument about luxury emissions versus
survival emissions the energy access

01:20:11.650 --> 01:20:11.660
survival emissions the energy access
 

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:14.620
survival emissions the energy access
argument is about survival emissions

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:14.630
argument is about survival emissions
 

01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:16.630
argument is about survival emissions
it's about you know the basic

01:20:16.630 --> 01:20:16.640
it's about you know the basic
 

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.760
it's about you know the basic
necessities of life and how many people

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:18.770
necessities of life and how many people
 

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:21.580
necessities of life and how many people
in the world are denied that and the

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:21.590
in the world are denied that and the
 

01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:24.490
in the world are denied that and the
counter balance of that is how many

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:24.500
counter balance of that is how many
 

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:27.520
counter balance of that is how many
people in the world have way way past

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:27.530
people in the world have way way past
 

01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:30.460
people in the world have way way past
the necessities of life and the

the necessities of life and the
 

01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:33.970
the necessities of life and the
incredible wastefulness of the way that

01:20:33.970 --> 01:20:33.980
incredible wastefulness of the way that
 

01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:36.280
incredible wastefulness of the way that
this society is constructed and it seems

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:36.290
this society is constructed and it seems
 

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:37.450
this society is constructed and it seems
to me that there's a very strong

01:20:37.450 --> 01:20:37.460
to me that there's a very strong
 

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:40.360
to me that there's a very strong
argument to be made about the united

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:40.370
argument to be made about the united
 

01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:42.910

that china is decarbonizing faster than
 

01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:13.930
that china is decarbonizing faster than
the u.s. actually china is the primary

01:21:13.930 --> 01:21:13.940
the u.s. actually china is the primary

and so has their carbon intensity so

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040
and so has their carbon intensity so
 

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:53.010
and so has their carbon intensity so
look the emissions in the UK in Germany

01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:53.020
look the emissions in the UK in Germany
 

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:55.600
look the emissions in the UK in Germany
what else did the five countries that I

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:55.610
what else did the five countries that I
 

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:57.370
what else did the five countries that I
had up there are about equivalent to the

poor we could take the United States off

01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:09.350
poor we could take the United States off

the map pretend it doesn't exist and it
 

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.660
the map pretend it doesn't exist and it
really doesn't change the mathematics of

with this distinction survival emissions

01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000
with this distinction survival emissions
 

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.260
with this distinction survival emissions
and luxury emissions you know in kind of

01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:23.270
and luxury emissions you know in kind of
 

01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:25.600

climate campaigners would like to make
better higher-quality poor people but

01:22:33.250 --> 01:22:33.260
better higher-quality poor people but
 

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:34.720
better higher-quality poor people but
still poor people they kick around the

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:34.730
still poor people they kick around the
 

01:22:34.730 --> 01:22:36.490
still poor people they kick around the

the light at night they have their four
 

01:22:38.210 --> 01:22:39.790
the light at night they have their four
hours of light bulb but they don't have

01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:39.800
hours of light bulb but they don't have
 

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.650
hours of light bulb but they don't have
dishwashers they don't have washing

01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:41.660
dishwashers they don't have washing
 

01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:47.410

machines they don't have iPads I mean we

01:22:47.410 --> 01:22:47.420
machines they don't have iPads I mean we
 

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.050

you start with the light bulb and then

01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:50.060
you start with the light bulb and then
 

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:52.180
you start with the light bulb and then
you get to the dishwasher and the

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:52.190
you get to the dishwasher and the
 

01:22:52.190 --> 01:22:53.590
you get to the dishwasher and the
washing machines only the reason that

01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600
washing machines only the reason that
 

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.370
washing machines only the reason that
that energy access is not a millennium

01:22:57.370 --> 01:22:57.380
that energy access is not a millennium
 

01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:58.570
that energy access is not a millennium
development goal is because they were

01:22:58.570 --> 01:22:58.580
development goal is because they were
 

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:01.870
development goal is because they were
set in two thousand and clean water was

01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880
set in two thousand and clean water was
 

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.730
set in two thousand and clean water was
considered a far more important goal

01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:03.740
considered a far more important goal
 

01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:06.970
considered a far more important goal
than energy access there you know it's

01:23:06.970 --> 01:23:06.980
than energy access there you know it's
 

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:09.490
than energy access there you know it's
one of many problems yeah you know I

01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:09.500
one of many problems yeah you know I
 

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.200
one of many problems yeah you know I
don't know why energy axis was a lot of

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:11.210
don't know why energy axis was a lot of
 

01:23:11.210 --> 01:23:13.120
don't know why energy axis was a lot of
discussion and debate about why it

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:13.130
discussion and debate about why it
 

01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:14.350
discussion and debate about why it
wasn't on there it's not that it wasn't

01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.360
wasn't on there it's not that it wasn't
 

01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:16.900
wasn't on there it's not that it wasn't
proposed but that's the simple reality

01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:16.910
proposed but that's the simple reality
 

01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:19.210
proposed but that's the simple reality
right now is that twenty percent of the

01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:19.220
right now is that twenty percent of the
 

01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:21.460
right now is that twenty percent of the

world's population uses eighty percent
 

01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:24.040
world's population uses eighty percent
of the energy and you could say well

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:24.050
of the energy and you could say well
 

01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:26.170

two-thirds you still have the other
 

01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:33.130
two-thirds you still have the other
eighty percent and just do that ask you

01:23:33.130 --> 01:23:33.140
eighty percent and just do that ask you
 

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:35.860
eighty percent and just do that ask you

know I I think you're right that energy
 

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.940
know I I think you're right that energy
access is a compelling issue but you

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:49.950
access is a compelling issue but you
 

01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:51.320
access is a compelling issue but you
can't on the one hand say that energy

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:51.330
can't on the one hand say that energy
 

01:25:51.330 --> 01:25:52.670
can't on the one hand say that energy
access is a more compelling issue than

01:25:52.670 --> 01:25:52.680
access is a more compelling issue than
 

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.860
access is a more compelling issue than
climate change and at the same time hold

I think correctly that climate change is

01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:56.490
I think correctly that climate change is
 

01:25:56.490 --> 01:25:57.800
I think correctly that climate change is
already kind of compelling enough I mean

01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:57.810
already kind of compelling enough I mean
 

01:25:57.810 --> 01:25:59.570
