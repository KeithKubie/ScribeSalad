00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.550
So let's look at this
matrix a little bit more.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.840
This is a matrix,
the size here is m x n.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.310
That's because we have m rows from 1,
2, 3 all the way going up to m.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.110
And we have n columns.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.670
So if you look at 1 2
all the way up to n.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.140
The first row we know corresponds
to the user 1 that we have.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.120
Similarly, the second row is going to
correspond to user 2, user 3, and

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.140
the last one is going to be for user m.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.670
Similarly if we look at the columns,
remember these were for objects or

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.510
resources.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.540
So this is for Object 1, this is for
Object 2, and all the way to Object n.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.750
So we are talking about ACM U, O.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.030
So that's going to be
some entry like this.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.520
So if you take a look at it,
this is are ACM 3,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.110
because it's user 3 that we
are talking about and object 2.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.040
So this entry A32,
which is basically going to describe

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.780
how user three, or U3,
is allowed to access object O2.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.650
If it happens to a file, it could
be read access or write access or

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.770
execute access.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.920
Things like that.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.300
So this is what we just discussed for
the case where there m users, n objects.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.860
So this is an m by n matrix,
a row here corresponds to user,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.160
a column here responds to object.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.360
So again if you focus on a particular
entry in this one, remember,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.790
this is what axis does user 3 have for
object 3, A33 is.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.760
So this is going to be
a subset of the axis right.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.920
How this object can be accessed.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.050
Object O3 for example here,
user 3 we have here.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.760
So depending on what kind of object
this is, so we've been talking about

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.560
file objects that contain data
which can be read or written, so.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.960
The access rights for
a file may be read write and execute.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.500
So this can be some subset.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.538
This could be nothing.

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:12.700
That means user 3 could not
access object O3 in any way.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.715
If it just has read then we
know that reads are allowed.

00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:21.355
User 3 cannot write or
execute a file that is object 3.

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:26.275
If it read write execute then of course
user 3 is allowed to read or write or

00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:29.439
execute this file that
corresponds to object O3.
