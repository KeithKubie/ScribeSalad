00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.160
 we have to practically develop the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.130
 our application and therefore us there 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.330
 we need to focus only on the code is 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.340
 we do not have to do it 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.800
 worry about that of the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.869
 infrastructure then configure the i 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.630
 our servers put the software on it 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.970
 that serves to put load balancer to understand 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.770
 how to make them scale how to manage 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.360
 updates understand how to do it 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.610
 put more disks less disks more 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.410
 space in a space these things here that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.690
 anyway, someone might like it 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.940
 generally a developer says instead 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.530
 no guys let me make me do one then 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.290
 once one than those who are 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.940
 the guidelines of how to develop 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.400
 application on app engine that in 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.660
 the reality is very few for the rest 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.579
 think of google to handle it all 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.489
 the infrastructure behind app 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.100
 engine works using app engine 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.049
 works with four different run times 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.860
 so you can develop using 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.920
 java using python using pcp 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.880
 php and experimentally you can also 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.470
 use or pattern paradigms that you 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.820
 they use are the same for all 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.170
 then platforms then change 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.999
 simply the language with which it is 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.880
 gone implement and few other things 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:26.039
 but basically what you learn 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 with a language it is worth most 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.270
 sometimes even with others 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.399
 as I told you the app engine has the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.380
 possibility to scale automatically 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.329
 so you can say ok I leave with 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.340
 a china application and use a 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.649
 my friend and another who is there then later 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.149
 I do not know of ideas in universities I praise the 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.619
 work tell your friends about 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.929
 application circulates begins to become 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.999
 a thing used however is not yours 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.409
 problem in the sense that that too 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:51.840
 platform that manages it for you 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.539
 so be careful is the ideal platform 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.630
 to scale to millions of users but also 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.880
 for products it seems therefore video kay I have to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.009
 do this thing here as i do the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.869
 put on you see if base does not go if then 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.539
 you do not like it and throw away everything or not 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.009
 you lost time to understand how then 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.119
 I have to put on a server I have to do 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.810
 update configurations 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.849
 etc 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.540
 so you can use it for many 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.000
 things and different types of storage that you 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.319
 you can use relational databases 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.379
 non relational sky 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.060
 cloud provider still google also 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.950
 for himself parts with a closed platform 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.439
 which remains only within the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.969
 google cloud platform more and more a 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.219
 po all from google cloud platform is 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:36.340
 composed of pieces that you can 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.389
 use together or in contexts 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.579
 completely different 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.019
 obviously if you use it together they are 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.730
 all residents in the 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.200
 in google infrastructure so you have 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.000
 of speed performances 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.769
 more because they are machines that more or 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.659
 the less they are in the obviously is not 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.879
 a real LAN but here is to give you a little 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.950
 an idea, however, nothing prevents you from taking 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:57.340
 use these tiles in others 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.930
 contexts and beyond we say it to yours 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.790
 application server app engine cries 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.409
 a whole series of services as per 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.449
 example a scheduler crohn 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.310
 mail management queues 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:09.340
 users coming out many other things 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.019
 and you have the opportunity to do the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.459
 versioning of your applications e 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.719
 then we will see it, that is of you 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.159
 this application is here at the version 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.620
 1 this application is the version here 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.750
 2 and the version that is served of 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.699
 default is version 1 but a 5 per 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.799
 a hundred of my traffic also goes 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.239
 version 2 then slowly if you have 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.829
 developed something new you can 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.290
 introduce a user wrong to this 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.389
 new version is passing in a manner 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.000
 soft to the new version without di 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.859
 lucca the day zero I turn off a 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.120
 address and turn on another and who knows 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.879
 what happens instead like this 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.310
 softly you can go on and on 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.359
 you have a set of tools that you 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.340
 allow you to test yours 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.840
 so the local application without 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.810
 having to deploy every time in the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.069
 cloud and there are also a whole range of 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.859
 tools that allow you to program 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.530
 only in the cloud for example being able to is a 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.609
 editor that however is not google however it is 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.109
 a product that I see that you are 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.799
 evolving a lot where you have yours 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.819
 the positives do not have to configure 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.530
 nothing from your car 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.489
 simply by accessing the site 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.719
 you have your own environment 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.099
 programming and then you can also do 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.689
 deploy directly to appengine 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.409
 therefore in any place in the world 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:16.120
 you connect do and on app engine ci 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.609
 they are also very many frameworks ed 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.380
 extensions that slowly the community 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.250
 he is creating for example the java part 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.280
 you have spring for the part in 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.510
 python you have everything django and there are 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.220
 so many other extensions so it's not that 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.840
 one says ok hug app engine owe me 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.610
 Forget everything else Do not embrace ten 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.380
 gene at most 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.500
 you need to bring some bookstores 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.970
 what in app engine but what is there 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.170
 often and willingly for with 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.970
 language there is also usable in 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.400
 app engine just to give you a 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.610
 fast and architecture we have 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.390
 practically everything there is 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.740
 inside app engine 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.510
 so the president is an application 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.040
 master who decides who does things 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.930
 user requests arrive from here 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.730
 there are in front of the manage 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.900
 so they go can not that takes in 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.660
 load I make you take charge 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.100
 from another he continued to etcetera 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.800
 and here are all the services therefore 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.890
 we don't know data store 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.690
 we have for the part of network we have 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.520
 the ussr matches the messaging part 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.710
 by channel 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.810
 you can send daily mail you have all the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.480
 services to manage the information directly 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.270
 images and user identities 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.770
 news search map services and the like 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.030
 storage as I told you before there are 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.700
 lots of solutions available and has 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.880
 place since the introduction let's start with 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.160
 the code first thing to one then today 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.630
 I will talk about the java part then there will be 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.640
 alex that will show you something in 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.550
 python and then there will be michele that will make you 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.380
 see a bit in php then how to say 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.370
 everyone is there we will be able to see the 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.030
 platform in its various 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.450
 facets 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.580
 for the java part or anyway for all 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.590
 for all type of development appengine 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.540
 we need to install the east of gay lesbians 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.570
 and contains all the tools necessary for 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.520
 all the run times however more for java 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.320
 if you want you can install this plugin 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.990
 for eclipse that adds some 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.970
 precisely integrated features 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.550
 in the editor ie in the eclipse editor 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.200
 so I don't know you don't have to go to 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.210
 launch things from command line more 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.490
 however since this plugin is 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.750
 just a front end for gay people 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.550
 actually if you have yours 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.710
 international content environment 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.450
 yours your maven and your scripts 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.010
 of what to deploy what you want 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.110
 no problem 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.030
 you can integrate into the former gay 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.290
 because in any case it is command line 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.330
 if you have the with the command line at 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.340
 end one makes the worst magi and therefore 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.890
 however developed ie downloaded here 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.940
 the gay ones do a little of everything and the first one 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.970
 thing to do 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.490
 create an application the application 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.960
 it is the container of all that 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.610
 you will go on to develop inside 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.440
 the application ok anyway every 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.930
 application registered to an account 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.220
 google and now then we'll see it enough 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.650
 practically defined the name of the 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.180
 project is an indie project and you have 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:58.470
 created your first app engine app 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.270
 name of the project you can put that 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.150
 you want project andy must be 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.860
 design of unique for all 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.510
 app engine applications created in the world 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.100
 which means all applications 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:12.180
 app engine and run on the domain 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.950
 dott ap spot dot com and then this one 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.510
 project and becomes the third domain 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.960
 level so in this case it will be 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:21.390
 jeanclaude dconf punto up spot.com e 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.970
 this will be the address of your app 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.370
 ok then if you want to have for example the 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:29.400
 your domain to render traffic 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.960
 and then a arrives www.rai.it and in 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.400
 reality goes on this part of 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.810
 application however remember that 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.260
 this is the address of your app 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:39.000
 here once you have water grenade 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.890
 immediately available a console that there 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.130
 shows a wealth of information that 

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:46.140
 then we will go on to analyze later 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:49.800
 in addition you also have the app staff that does 

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:51.990
 see 150,000 different parameters e 

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.460
 measurements of what makes yours 

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.980
 therefore act when called 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.080
 rl workload etcetera 

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.390
 because this is because app engine 

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.180
 despite the free quotas it has anyway 

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.740
 a type of billing not only use two hours 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.270
 I use it a day but on resources 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.010
 consumed 

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.630
 so if you want for example you have billing 

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.730
 on the network part on the part of 

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.090
 storage on the CPU side and many others 

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.610
 what's this 

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:17.340
 this because because it ensures instead of 

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.380
 wheel 28 point and just pay only 

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:22.890
 what you really are using e 

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:24.800
 all these consoles etc will serve you 

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.060
 also to understand how eventually 

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.250
 optimize your application 

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.169
 because maybe you know that anyway 

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:33.060
 the same things can be done 

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:35.159
 be done in various ways maybe 

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.719
 it is better to use a service or 

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.890
 one pattern rather than another 

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:39.900
 because after all it makes you 

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.669
 save a little as you see it 

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.589
 through all these tools here 

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.450
 otherwise one should shoot a little 

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:46.670
 blindly 

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.280
 then 

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:51.770
 finished the part of hello world we go to 

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:56.270
 so do our card then 

00:08:51.770 --> 00:09:00.170
 I'm already connected with my heidi 

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:03.740
 you see it's here i can create a project 1 

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:05.000
 and 2 finished ie as a view the slide 

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.280
 puts yours in your design 

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.530
 perceived and done at this point 

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:14.360
 once I create it for security and 

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:16.820
 I have already created here it opens 

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.980
 here it is, sorry here, the la opens 

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.900
 console of your app as you see 

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.120
 this is the new google cloud console 

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.350
 so however the new version of the 

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.030
 first there was another console 

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.490
 here are a whole series of 

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.500
 information about your project 

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.840
 and then if you click here app engine 

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.370
 go to open the specific section 

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.900
 for app engine because inside the 

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.330
 same project you can also put on 

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.250
 all other cloud technologies you can 

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.630
 decide which google enable short 

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.490
 here do a little bit of everything 

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.440
 once you open the app part 

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.690
 engine you get this thing here that a 

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.210
 people we saw before as you see me 

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.980
 gives some statistics and tells you and then 

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.380
 we will understand what I am here 

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:57.050
 below in the lower part that is now 

00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:00.080
 going up we find those that are a bit 

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:03.950
 all the various quotas consumed as 

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.570
 you see these are and the free screws 

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.310
 ok so you can see that i'm not for 

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.530
 example for the network you have a gigabyte e 

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.990
 every day for the computation sees a 

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:14.030
 tot of hours of viewing room etc. 

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.370
 more or less these are rejected at 

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:20.090
 10 Italian then every day at 10 

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:22.100
 to take oneself aside from head we go to 

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.790
 see how 15 3 is our first 

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.570
 application 

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:28.340
 I have my eclipse here. I already have the 

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.630
 plugin app engine installed faith ie ie 

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:34.220
 this g here in front 

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:36.800
 here it is then seen at this point 

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:43.220
 that I have the plugin installed if I do 

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:45.320
 new and I go up to give you see me here 

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.800
 a google and / or web entry appears 

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.670
 application project which application 

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.680
 project 

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:58.610
 ok i hope you see ok here i can 

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.690
 put project name and packaging 

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.270
 put what you want 

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.650
 what people here use what 

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.120
 you want based on how you are 

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.360
 therefore working the java standard then 

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.610
 to be able to fine tune point returns 

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.410
 what you want here goes well i am 

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.420
 eclipse settings and then whether to create 

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:15.500
 the project in the box space or from 

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.360
 another part 

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.360
 and here we begin to see the first le 

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.670
 first the first own configurations 

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:26.420
 for appengine app engine included 

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.890
 however the support with then in 

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.230
 In this case, however, I take it off because not 

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.480
 I need it and then here it is, it uses the app 

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:35.090
 engine and also put the version 

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.740
 the one you have at runtime this here 

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:40.910
 eclipse and already configures it all by itself 

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:48.760
 then you can already put your own feet 

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:52.430
 of opening is what I created here 

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:54.980
 from this here design of hd via 

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:56.900
 this appears projects of you colleague 

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.510
 of your status app and developing 

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.920
 boiling hicks with the project you have 

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.390
 created here on the cloud console then 

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.980
 then when you're going to deploy 

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:07.070
 application from inside the gleeks 

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.840
 automatically the gay locations will go on to say 

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.240
 ok this student follows this is yours 

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:14.080
 perfect appeals here I have to put yours 

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.610
 runtime and directly deploy 

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.830
 you can then also have other fields ad 

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:20.270
 example the use of cloud storage e 

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.100
 many other positive ones 

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:24.050
 you can also generate code from 

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.970
 example and then appengine of gray 

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.630
 an application for example very much 

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:31.220
 simple but already how to say of 

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:34.670
 already clarifies the basics 

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:37.040
 of the platform and here it is this one 

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:41.540
 I've already done some for you 

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:44.180
 everything then how app engine works 

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:46.610
 app engine uses the standard you see 

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:50.089
 the child character of you use it 

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:53.030
 standard java http serves lett then you 

00:12:50.089 --> 00:12:56.720
 you need to extend an http server class 

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:58.850
 and then answer the 2nd place 

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.630
 so this is the very basis 

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:05.930
 minimum to start then the user goes 

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.910
 on a certain vrl to this vrl for 

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.800
 example matches this piece of 

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.170
 code then we will see how to associate it and 

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.100
 this piece of code does things in 

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.290
 this case 

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:17.890
 you see that pretty much the 7 type of 

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:23.990
 reply to text and write hello 

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:26.300
 ok specifically 

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:30.230
 we return here every app app 

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.700
 engine to a very important dinner file 

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:35.600
 this is the most important one 

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:38.060
 of all that defines precisely what is the 

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.190
 behavior of the pa and then says 

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:42.800
 when the user arrives on the domain 

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:47.050
 so in this case today glauber comp 

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:49.790
 punto up spot.com you serve this file 

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:56.030
 index.hu ml 

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:58.250
 let's get index.hu ml and see 

00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:04.510
 which is an html is very simple 

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:09.680
 ok there is a title, etc. then here is a 

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:11.030
 link that opens beautiful is that puts me 

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.410
 with this name therefore practically 

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:16.520
 when i bleyl when the user 

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:18.440
 will click here will go on the rl is it 

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.630
 let's see what it corresponds to 

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:23.690
 this url which however always in the file 

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:26.690
 and look at a little but here is one but one 

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:29.930
 mapping that says when the user goes up 

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:32.590
 nice opened this black series with me 

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:38.630
 this name and this name here 

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:41.000
 corresponds to this class that looks 

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.000
 case it is just the class we were 

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.590
 looking first 

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.730
 ok so now if i start 

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:51.380
 I expect everything to start 

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.090
 I'll show you how I'm doing 

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.340
 leave the whole place so I have mine 

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:57.320
 development server that is created that 

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.760
 will be available at this address here 

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.920
 therefore an instance of a is graded 

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.660
 server very similar to what the 

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.680
 platform and if I'm going to this 

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.990
 address 

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:11.740
 I see what I have available 

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:11.740
 I'm going to copy this way 

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:19.079
 I open it here and this was it 

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.399
 excused a demo I have already seen 

00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:24.750
 the group here in milan a few days ago 

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:26.399
 then reshuffle the change and if I click 

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:31.920
 see below here you can see little anyway 

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:33.810
 that address is beautiful and rich or 

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.579
 the world what we have seen before 

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:38.519
 which is in the code of course if I here 

00:15:35.579 --> 00:15:41.610
 I go into the code I take off the world and there 

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:47.730
 I put something else to it 

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:50.089
 example this this the firm comment 

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.089
 all 

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.240
 I lost a piece 

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.400
 Oh well 

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.120
 here it is 

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:32.519
 ok black to the window stopped all the 

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:36.160
 I restart this is broken down 

00:16:32.519 --> 00:16:38.949
 I go back and open this page e 

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.660
 this time or see you see a little one 

00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:43.420
 but the idea is that I have mine again 

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.860
 message that now ostomate and this is 

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.199
 just the base and now if this page is 

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.130
 is visited by 5 10 100 million 

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:50.230
 you people need not worry 

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.079
 of course, to write something beautiful 

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.100
 something is not that it is proper 

00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:55.839
 let's say the application that gives more 

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:59.940
 everyone's satisfaction we go to see 

00:16:55.839 --> 00:16:59.940
 how to start complicating things 

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.780
 no development manages to have the re 

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.000
 deploy static pages then type 

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:15.209
 annoying of the html it immediately goes beyond in 

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:19.689
 java still this thing is not ok here 

00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:25.439
 colleges and spi according to me yes all 

00:17:19.689 --> 00:17:28.030
 you know if there is ok then yes then 

00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:30.850
 let's go as I told you to see some 

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:32.740
 something very slightly more complex 

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.669
 at no we see the last beautiful part done 

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.320
 this application 

00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:37.600
 I want to give to the whole world I want to do it 

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.659
 from all my appeal as I do 

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.640
 click here I always go up on the item 

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:47.290
 google that was created specifically 

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.890
 from the plugin and from all on the fly to app 

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.200
 engine 

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.520
 as I told you before in 

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.350
 project set the name 

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.020
 application I tied with 

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:58.090
 this tooth on eclipse and he knows then 

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.309
 how to make the association automatically 

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.870
 the branded code plugin compiles it there 

00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:04.929
 he does all those things he has to do 

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:07.840
 upload in the cloud and and automatically 

00:18:04.929 --> 00:18:09.640
 I will have my application available now 

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:12.549
 let's see first to be sure 

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:16.120
 what is my name bastad and I go here 

00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:19.990
 under google under app engine eog 

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:21.940
 cloud.com test ok so then see here 

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:23.020
 there is also a version is a bit versions 

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.210
 which I told you before however we have a 

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:29.290
 see how it works then I do 

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:29.890
 google by plauto app engine I go with the 

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:32.049
 blog 

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:36.630
 he takes all his things now 

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:42.270
 compile and I will have available on 

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:45.480
 cloud dev.com test point ap spot 

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:48.020
 ap sport.com this is definitely not 

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.020
 written like that 

00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:00.930
 he takes it from me to the one you see here 

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.930
 if I peak 

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:08.760
 this application if it is no longer local 

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:11.400
 to be able to see worldwide, etc. here 

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:13.230
 we have a version number then me 

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.970
 I explain real things, however, it serves reality 

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.530
 we could also take it off 

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.600
 and so now we go now another 

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:20.160
 version then there because always the 

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.380
 mess I made with giulio statue 

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.360
 already ahead then let's see how 

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:29.520
 do things a little more 

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:32.760
 complex we open this page here is the 

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.830
 first thing we say everyone teaches us 

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.929
 never mix the logic part with 

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.429
 the presentation part then you 

00:19:36.929 --> 00:19:39.990
 you can also put all that 

00:19:38.429 --> 00:19:42.000
 must appear on your html page 

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.270
 inside that code that server that 

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.320
 we have seen however we say that it is a lot 

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:47.929
 ugly and also very difficult 

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.450
 keep etc. and so on 

00:19:47.929 --> 00:19:53.910
 then we begin to separate the part of 

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:56.490
 logic from the presentation part ok 

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:59.250
 pina appengine as well as being able to provide you 

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:01.260
 a server in backhand so you do 

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.510
 all your work exposes with 

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.550
 of the most rai via cloud and then if there 

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:08.400
 will then show alex also all one 

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:10.800
 part of front end so it could do 

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.900
 just from the web server for what 

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:15.929
 you want to serve so here is you 

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:18.240
 you can then use jsp already 

00:20:15.929 --> 00:20:20.820
 You can also turn the template page 

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:25.170
 use your back end has been created 

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:26.790
 with cloud endpoints then with del 

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.340
 rest the ipods and also use not 

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:33.059
 so englehart js on the front end that 

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:35.010
 consumes the most exposed from your back 

00:20:33.059 --> 00:20:37.770
 end then actually what there 

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.480
 put in front of you really is between you 

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.190
 the other as you can as I said before 

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.160
 they can be used like many others 

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:50.280
 bricks then as we have seen here 

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:52.050
 there is already the whole part to do the there 

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.490
 already the whole part to do the part of 

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:56.240
 web server then or for example mine 

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:59.670
 folder with images or a series d 

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:01.500
 do similar things but you can too 

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.030
 milo that the web server elsewhere 

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.950
 and put your application there 

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.480
 consumes and exposed services of yours 

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.160
 back end realized in app engine 

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.200
 here you have also here separates the two 

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.210
 so things really are very flexible 

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.460
 it's up to you to decide how you want 

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.660
 do it anyway in this specific case 

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:19.020
 what did I do? 

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:21.480
 I created two java template pages then 

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.460
 not server page because I like it anyway 

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.200
 more always remove the logic from the 

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:29.160
 code for in here 

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:32.550
 I told him look what you need to render 

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:35.910
 rwe these parameters that will arrive to you 

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:37.410
 from the back end ok sky be for this 

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:40.710
 page here that we see for that other 

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:42.600
 but just how it all works 

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:45.780
 then we always start from our web 

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.520
 punto xml and let's see what is the 

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.020
 file that is served first then 

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.000
 when the user enters the domain mi 

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:55.710
 will show show check itself show check 

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:58.950
 ins corresponds to this serve et che 

00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.720
 corresponds to this class that the axis 

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:06.570
 of the project then you find it easy 

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:09.750
 let's see what it does then that already 

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:12.510
 we see the use of one of the services of 

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:14.310
 what app engine makes available is the 

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:16.890
 user service you want to do 

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:18.840
 an application that has its own 

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.580
 that is, its users 

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.410
 you can safely make the 

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:25.200
 your authentication system then 

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.760
 the resistable sernet password storage 

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.040
 safely at this rate 

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.470
 protection from external attacks and 150 thousand 

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:35.670
 other things or app engine integrates 

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:38.280
 natively with users of google e 

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:40.350
 for google oxford domaines then the 

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.730
 your gmail users to understand each other or 

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.770
 if you have a google app domain if with i 

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.780
 your google app domain teeth 

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:47.460
 so you won't have to manage 

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.780
 no other password etc. always the 

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.880
 usually talk a whole series of 

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:53.160
 services are integrated there you arrive 

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.420
 right away though if you want you can anyway 

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.750
 do what you want 

00:22:54.420 --> 00:23:00.000
 in this specific case this user 

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.030
 service factory that creates me one says 

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.160
 service and from the jis service user service 

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.960
 I go to see these in more which 

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.220
 the current user has lengthened if not 

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.419
 is 

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:13.549
 for safety this user service 

00:23:11.419 --> 00:23:16.549
 if you access your gmail account 

00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:19.309
 it is not that he then has access to yours 

00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:21.190
 profile on google plus or your mail 

00:23:19.309 --> 00:23:25.100
 or else has granted access to yours 

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:27.380
 username then your username 

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.669
 nickname that is often the same 

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.159
 and to your email 

00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:32.960
 enough then here from here you can 

00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:38.120
 just take username and substantially 

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:39.679
 mail finished which says ok though 

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.720
 I'm using a gmail user is not that 

00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:43.280
 then I expose to the world all that 

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.330
 there is only this in my profile 

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.299
 two things 

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:50.299
 so what the code does here checks 

00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:51.950
 if the user authenticated or not 

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:56.030
 there are so many ways to control it 

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:59.000
 I could also use user service point 

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:04.010
 see here we have several months user 

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.179
 logged in so I can both check 

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.010
 if the user when he arrived on this 

00:24:05.179 --> 00:24:09.620
 page is logged using this 

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.030
 service method or for example 

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.220
 going to see directly in the king 

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:16.010
 quest if there is already a user for this king 

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:18.470
 so here too there are several 

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:20.840
 mode then if yes let's go to 

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:24.530
 examine the code if the user is signed 

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:26.840
 I get his username creates one 

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:28.370
 collection of places in this case I have 

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.900
 made just a quick memory thing 

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.090
 but here your logic can go 

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.770
 as defined it takes it from a db la 

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:37.570
 he took around the world and so on 

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:39.919
 etc. and I put these attributes 

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:44.080
 inside the hard this is therefore m 

00:24:39.919 --> 00:24:47.740
 current user put placement logout rl e 

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:52.880
 rigid this quest out of place there a 

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:56.240
 this gsp here in itself point gespi se 

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:59.539
 the user is not logged in compile this 

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:02.630
 this attribute which is login new rl and la 

00:24:59.539 --> 00:25:03.980
 stiff to user not love her gespi after 

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.570
 that I do for words and I say ok 

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.700
 this thing sends here on the page 

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:09.049
 so see how I put one here already 

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.890
 logic to go and get the data that 

00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:12.620
 I need 

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:15.230
 and then however all the rendering then the 

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:18.020
 I display these data and delegate them 

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:20.029
 it has a page on clumps 

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.489
 then html in this case 

00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:24.889
 let's see the pages we take 

00:25:22.489 --> 00:25:26.719
 user not logged that the simplest 

00:25:24.889 --> 00:25:28.759
 as you see instead only a location 

00:25:26.719 --> 00:25:31.729
 to do above the rest is everything 

00:25:28.759 --> 00:25:34.879
 html codes normalissimo except that 

00:25:31.729 --> 00:25:36.590
 this piece here that enters here 

00:25:34.879 --> 00:25:39.019
 the rendering mechanism of the game is in play 

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:42.349
 java template page and then put them here 

00:25:39.019 --> 00:25:44.570
 that attribute we saw before 

00:25:42.349 --> 00:25:46.840
 so if I'm going to be a spider 

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.840
 my application 

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.410
 ok 

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.990
 obviously being under eclipse you have 

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.970
 also the possibility of doing in the bug 

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:13.820
 so you put break point and then 

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.500
 you see the code by hand examine the 

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.020
 code examine the status of your 

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:21.290
 application as it is performed 

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:27.830
 then here again the sky come back on 

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:29.210
 my localhost and here it is that has 

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:31.160
 played at moncalieri will know 

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:34.310
 certainly a famous one rarely in the picture 

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:39.710
 and tells me that you can always log in 

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:44.830
 log in this login if I go here 

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:46.730
 you see is the dynamically created login 

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:49.700
 unfortunately small however created 

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:51.410
 dynamically from my logic like 

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:53.900
 strategic is redirected here 

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.400
 on the page I tell myself about the logins 

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.990
 since I am in the deployment server 

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.690
 becomes presenting a screen of 

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:01.790
 login fake otherwise it would come 

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.260
 the authentication screen with the 

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.850
 your google account or if you are 

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.790
 already logged in I don't even get ways 

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:10.790
 pass directly I put the name of the user 

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:12.710
 in this case I put I don't know alfredo here 

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:16.070
 you can put what you want 

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:17.330
 and here we go to take that one 

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.940
 other page check in 

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:21.020
 see that there are rome and london with 

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.900
 two cities I had loaded inside 

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.100
 of my page and now I can 

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.140
 also logout this is 

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.600
 an image that I didn't put in 

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:32.360
 management logic but it is an image that 

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.130
 is directly in the front end part 

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.870
 wishing I could say then on the side 

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.270
 back end loads to the image that a 

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:40.610
 this vrl here so anyway here I can 

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:42.560
 do 150,000 here is this very example 

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:44.990
 simple I just needed to make you 

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.780
 understand as if how you can separate the 

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:50.150
 rendering logic of that logic 

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:52.160
 because otherwise they would hit with app 

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:54.470
 engine as I do as I do not have to 

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.660
 to keep everything inside, etc. 

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:58.520
 you have a thousand solutions and this is one 

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.350
 of the thousand available or for example 

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.850
 in python there is all django then 

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:04.610
 use all the template logic of 

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:06.620
 django there is also another engine of 

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:11.660
 rendering template in short, the choices 

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:15.040
 there are quite a few here too 

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:19.410
 I can do something nice that it is 

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:22.300
 the deployment however this time instead 

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:23.680
 then this one is always the same 

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.640
 the applications and therefore the same 

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.670
 application he was using 

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.110
 first this time I go with the 

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:33.450
 version 2 

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:33.450
 ok i'm deploying people 2 

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:44.110
 ok he now takes everything as before 

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:47.940
 what he has to take is examining 

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:50.320
 a little his things and in the same serve 

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.840
 then to the same address 

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.720
 I will have version 1 of the application e 

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:57.220
 version 2 of the application that later 

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.840
 simultaneously exist app 

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.490
 engine takes care of versioning 

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.220
 of the runtime code that you 

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:05.170
 upload if you also use the date 

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.060
 store or other things of course that 

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:09.220
 you have to think about inventing a 

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:12.580
 different mechanism, therefore if in the 

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:15.130
 version 2 clean all the database is 

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:17.860
 normal that you also clean the tracklist 

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:19.570
 of version 1 so be careful with that 

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.220
 that you do however with certain strategies 

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:24.390
 you can still separate them 

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:28.360
 everything now see here this time is 2 

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:29.530
 I go with the login I am already signed because 

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.410
 it was my user he was using 

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:34.720
 to deploy first and here I have 

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:36.970
 checked in Rome and London 

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.400
 now to see that indeed it is so 

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:44.320
 I go here on google.it also okay 

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.990
 then you will see that I am already signed with 

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.370
 a new doodle today then let's see what 

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:50.080
 there is 

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.150
 you see that I am also already stretched with 

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.380
 my test user what 

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:57.840
 I'm using to do the tests for 

00:29:53.380 --> 00:30:00.640
 show them that it's really something 

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:01.450
 real you see that now they are not there is not 

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.610
 plus the sign 

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:06.670
 so what the logout is really 

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:08.890
 as if you are using a login 

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.700
 normal logout within the whole 

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.190
 google domain 

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:14.890
 ok google and google app for domaines 

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:16.240
 so if you have to do the same 

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.040
 speech 

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:20.940
 at this point, however, we have done the 

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:23.940
 login breathes already done the lockout 

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.940
 dwell 

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:42.950
 ok let's go to browse inside the 

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:45.340
 my application I go here and see that 

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:47.750
 the dashboard is reloaded e 

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:51.889
 above all I am told that for 

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:53.980
 example in the last we see three hours 

00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:57.019
 this was the traffic generated here 

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.399
 ok if you all connect to now 

00:30:57.019 --> 00:30:59.600
 that address we see earlier is not 

00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:01.519
 do because then we have another more 

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:03.169
 nice to connect to practically 

00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:04.519
 so they are shown to me 

00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:06.440
 show everything that happens 

00:31:04.519 --> 00:31:09.919
 I am shown the consumption of the 

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:11.360
 resources as you see is that is okay 

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:14.179
 obviously the application does nothing 

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.159
 therefore practically apart from a minimum of 

00:31:14.179 --> 00:31:17.929
 static fi that are those two images 

00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:20.360
 which we have loaded and little else is not 

00:31:17.929 --> 00:31:22.100
 that all the rest is consumed however 

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:26.570
 it is useful to see then also all 

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:33.289
 the logs etc log consob and then 

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:37.279
 questions up here clear excellent 

00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:39.769
 then let's quickly see what 

00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:44.120
 there's bunello world when you create 

00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:46.909
 an app a google col. application 

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:49.220
 console is told me if you want pre already 

00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:54.080
 upload one of one of the two demos 

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:56.470
 available a demo is photo photo photo 

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.539
 share up is another is mobile back end 

00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:01.460
 this first photo feed excuse java up 

00:31:59.539 --> 00:32:04.039
 this first demo is nothing more than a 

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:05.570
 application that president 1 the opposite 

00:32:04.039 --> 00:32:07.730
 photos and others can comment 

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:09.620
 on the photos super innovative service at 

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:11.029
 however, a lot comes today 

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.980
 useful to understand already a whole series of 

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:15.710
 reasoning that can be done with 

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.779
 this platform to do it you there 

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:22.090
 I show super fast 

00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:22.090
 create a new project go here 

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:26.510
 oh well this project is fine here 

00:32:24.019 --> 00:32:28.039
 violet generated automatically it takes 

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:29.840
 a moment to create it anyway then when 

00:32:28.039 --> 00:32:31.190
 enter the project tells me I can do you 

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.510
 directly the blog of one of the 

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:35.330
 samples and you 

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:38.450
 ok and he is already doing the deployment directly e 

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:40.190
 I for convenience or already created an eccolo 

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:42.200
 here, however, I already have a project 

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.789
 see here is the sample you do 

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.419
 click here or here that I am 

00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:50.359
 two available and he what does it take 

00:32:47.419 --> 00:32:53.359
 already all the runtime does the 

00:32:50.359 --> 00:32:55.549
 deploy links and more life to go 

00:32:53.359 --> 00:32:56.749
 to take as an example the project where 

00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:58.999
 there is the code where there is everything I have done 

00:32:56.749 --> 00:33:01.249
 all for you I have already taken the code of the 

00:32:58.999 --> 00:33:05.899
 project downloaded it and opened it 

00:33:01.249 --> 00:33:07.220
 inside ibx and inside the vips meanwhile it 

00:33:05.899 --> 00:33:10.779
 make up so we don't waste time later 

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.779
 is this here 

00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:14.809
 here it is as you already see a project 

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:16.190
 a bit of articulate that contains a little 

00:33:14.809 --> 00:33:18.440
 more than six roulette etc. 

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:21.320
 this project has a very thing 

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:24.259
 bellina which is a pattern that allows you 

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:27.349
 to choose how to manage storage of 

00:33:24.259 --> 00:33:29.570
 your data so you can use a 

00:33:27.349 --> 00:33:30.830
 database no sequel then the given a 

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:34.399
 app engine store than what comes 

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:37.099
 default if using a cloud sequel 

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:38.419
 than another piece of the cloud 

00:33:37.099 --> 00:33:42.259
 platform that allows you to have the 

00:33:38.419 --> 00:33:45.470
 your special sequel database ever 

00:33:42.259 --> 00:33:47.029
 sequel to the cloud so you can 

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.710
 choose whether to do everything using a 

00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:51.470
 pergine or if you lean back 

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:53.269
 well sequel and this pattern 123 these 

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.369
 training space here define 

00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:58.159
 through a series of interfaces and 

00:33:55.369 --> 00:34:00.289
 generix how to then runtime go to 

00:33:58.159 --> 00:34:02.149
 choose one of two data providers 

00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:04.549
 nice to see why they are there anyway 

00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:07.549
 two collective in what, however, there 

00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:10.250
 then it is interesting to go and see how 

00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:16.159
 the service the service this already done 

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:22.960
 the deployment g cloud dev.com punto spot.com 

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:22.960
 so we go here point up spot.com 

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:28.280
 here is our photo sharing demo this 

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:29.780
 is of another fear that I had done the 

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:33.290
 people have already uploaded some 

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:34.849
 imagine if you want go ahead to this 

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:36.349
 address with your phone has 

00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:37.159
 started uploading photos or the 

00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:39.559
 your computer 

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:40.760
 so we see that then here in real time 

00:34:39.559 --> 00:34:42.169
 they are updated and above all there 

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.849
 we find some traffic so we go 

00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:46.460
 to see then nice things about 

00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:48.379
 statistics this demo that this 

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.419
 we have the pattern open here 

00:34:48.379 --> 00:34:51.980
 which I told you before is one thing 

00:34:50.419 --> 00:34:52.940
 particularly nice to the management 

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.319
 of images 

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.520
 because it says ok how do I memorize 

00:34:54.319 --> 00:34:57.620
 pictures 

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.510
 other things uploaded by user app 

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.250
 engine provides a whole 

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:03.710
 set of tools to make it a lot 

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:06.110
 very easy and substantially so 

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:10.100
 we have two we have the blog store that is 

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:12.110
 a kind of storage for files that don't 

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.090
 they may be sequential institutions 

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:16.430
 other things so he throws that into it 

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:17.570
 that looks like text images or others in 

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:20.120
 this case images 

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:22.730
 we have an email service lines g service 

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:24.380
 if you put a giant image for 

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:26.690
 example allows you to generate a tab 

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:28.190
 mail on the fly so you don't have to 

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:31.490
 go and resize yours 

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:34.040
 image and say ok now I need 400 

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:35.450
 800 and 600 so I have to memorize 

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.620
 these three images but beams of the minis 

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:38.720
 tell him then service 

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:40.280
 then there is the blog store that has an image 

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.680
 thousand per thousand 

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.510
 ok now i need 200 x 200 apple servants 

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:47.600
 this greatness 

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:54.020
 in fact we go if I then go to see 

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:55.820
 vr l ok this would be the image in 

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:58.310
 full screen is however we can see then 

00:35:55.820 --> 00:36:00.760
 as also are generated here is here 

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:03.440
 there were also others etc. then 

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:08.930
 we quickly see the code of this one 

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:10.670
 app is the service part then the 

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:12.530
 upload part 

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:15.580
 here you can explore them a bit to see how 

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:19.870
 it is done however it simply comes 

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:23.960
 created a vrl to upload 

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:26.900
 then through this blog for service 

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:28.850
 you leader appengine give me 1 rl you 

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:31.310
 you will use to upload my 

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:34.160
 image therefore he already knows everything there 

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:35.510
 exposes a real with some options that 

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:39.170
 could be I don't know you put one in 

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:43.280
 cloud using google cloud storage 

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:45.680
 rather than internally and back to me 

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.900
 this user will upload the image 

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.040
 on this when the url happens when 

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.870
 the image of the image upload 

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.640
 it is managed by people there from the app engine 

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:55.280
 when the image upload is 

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.930
 finished you will be called a few 

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.390
 what then another war l there 

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:00.800
 will allow for example to save lynch 

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:02.300
 sorry to save the date 

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.010
 image to do all your 

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.299
 work etc. and so on 

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:09.150
 so then very much 

00:37:06.299 --> 00:37:11.609
 easy you don't have to think about how 

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:16.499
 instead to generate the Tamil 

00:37:11.609 --> 00:37:17.849
 even here I start from a birth practically 

00:37:16.499 --> 00:37:20.609
 from an image service 

00:37:17.849 --> 00:37:22.319
 I have a blog key then 

00:37:20.609 --> 00:37:24.929
 first uploaded the image to the image 

00:37:22.319 --> 00:37:27.059
 is managed by the engine that returns to it 

00:37:24.929 --> 00:37:28.979
 the key to the blog store where the image 

00:37:27.059 --> 00:37:31.619
 you memorized this key you can 

00:37:28.979 --> 00:37:33.869
 putting it in 150,000 is up to you 

00:37:31.619 --> 00:37:36.119
 in this specific case therefore return neither 

00:37:33.869 --> 00:37:40.380
 key then I go to create go to 

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:42.779
 tell him that he creates this object here 

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.630
 options I tell you for example I want 

00:37:42.779 --> 00:37:47.749
 the image that has this dimension 

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:52.170
 I want the image collapsed or 

00:37:47.749 --> 00:37:54.809
 resized and he on the fly with 

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:59.429
 thanks to these ingenera mail service 

00:37:54.809 --> 00:38:01.319
 a url to see get serblin scream with 

00:37:59.429 --> 00:38:04.140
 the options you have passed will need 1 

00:38:01.319 --> 00:38:07.289
 rl which contains the image you have 

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:10.949
 decided to put little baby big 

00:38:07.289 --> 00:38:12.509
 crusade resized with maybe one 

00:38:10.949 --> 00:38:14.189
 color depth and minor because 

00:38:12.509 --> 00:38:15.269
 maybe you want it to be lighter 

00:38:14.189 --> 00:38:18.469
 so here is one of many 

00:38:15.269 --> 00:38:21.479
 services you can also here if you want 

00:38:18.469 --> 00:38:22.920
 create your engine the boss 

00:38:21.479 --> 00:38:25.799
 algorithm for resizing images 

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.869
 you are free to do it app engine 

00:38:25.799 --> 00:38:29.130
 however, he already puts it at your disposal 

00:38:26.869 --> 00:38:31.949
 however it is up to you to choose this 

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:33.630
 service or to implement it because 

00:38:31.949 --> 00:38:35.400
 maybe you have special logics and 

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:37.529
 this is for example used to do 

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:38.729
 watermarking machines 

00:38:37.529 --> 00:38:40.859
 images when so maybe there 

00:38:38.729 --> 00:38:42.589
 overlap something in short then 

00:38:40.859 --> 00:38:44.699
 so many processing can be done 

00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:46.810
 let's see if anyone has it here 

00:38:44.699 --> 00:38:49.750
 shouted something as you were 

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:50.680
 fiddling perfect then to this 

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:54.190
 point 

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:57.280
 back to our cloud console e 

00:38:54.190 --> 00:39:06.790
 let's see our project on 

00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:10.500
 app engine I take it here track and see 

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:10.500
 that's in the dashboard 

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:25.870
 it takes a moment to load it 

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:32.680
 because here I am already laughing 

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:35.890
 this one then we see for example 

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:38.050
 in the last 30 minutes 

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:40.870
 see there are for example peaks of 

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:42.850
 use and tells me that for example I have 

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:44.590
 already consumed a certain amount of my band 

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:46.750
 available tells me that they are already there 

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.980
 state of sweaty reed operations 

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:51.190
 stories like things 

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.840
 in the data store, they wear sequels 

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:55.570
 that just use with app engine a 

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:58.120
 which you very interface with 

00:39:55.570 --> 00:40:00.220
 simple that allows you to understand all 

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:02.740
 the objects that are immunized to 

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.530
 its inside then you also have the logs you can 

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:07.990
 see which job clans are running 

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:09.790
 you have task views id the cures are 

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:12.070
 another thing about app engines in the sense 

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:14.770
 that you when the user arrives on an rl 

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:17.710
 by definition this must be 

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:20.410
 served within 60 seconds because why 

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:24.820
 for scalability needs and also for 

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:26.560
 the speech of a tooth waits at 2 

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.630
 60 seconds in front of a page 

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.190
 it's generally 30 seconds ago already 

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:33.340
 passed to the next page 

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:35.560
 so you can also say ok I do 

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:38.140
 a page that is what maybe 

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.850
 I write then waits in the background 

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:42.010
 these pockets are thrown in pockets 

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:44.200
 do their thing and then the result of 

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:46.180
 these pockets through is already absolute of 

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:49.710
 the other techniques that are there can 

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:52.750
 be displayed on the page on which 

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:53.110
 in front of which the user is one of 

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.270
 these 

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:58.000
 a way to send a pocket in the background 

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:59.830
 and general task you with job 

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.570
 I think you all know it for example in 

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:04.420
 this in this app 

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:06.640
 there is a chrono job that runs every night a 

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.380
 a certain time is 

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.059
 here, however, we see that there are the 

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.920
 there are various entities there are comments 

00:41:10.059 --> 00:41:14.529
 the photos so for example take here 

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:16.000
 and he returns with all the users 

00:41:14.529 --> 00:41:18.029
 these things can obviously be seen here 

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.720
 only the administrator of 

00:41:18.029 --> 00:41:21.250
 the application is therefore only one then 

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.450
 go online once it's lengthened 

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:24.369
 he sees them, I can see them because they are 

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:26.829
 the person who deployed you can 

00:41:24.369 --> 00:41:29.049
 also assign a certain number of other accounts 

00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:31.450
 then as an administrator then you can 

00:41:29.049 --> 00:41:35.529
 have an account that manages the app e 

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:38.049
 delegate some permits and can 

00:41:35.529 --> 00:41:40.299
 create administrative pages in the 

00:41:38.049 --> 00:41:42.039
 your app is only who it is 

00:41:40.299 --> 00:41:45.180
 administrator will be able to access that 

00:41:42.039 --> 00:41:49.329
 peace therefore flexibility 

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:51.789
 quite large I told you about the crohn jobs 

00:41:49.329 --> 00:41:54.099
 this is a great job that is performed 

00:41:51.789 --> 00:41:56.799
 every night at midnight also sees the 

00:41:54.099 --> 00:41:58.539
 with job simply a rl when 

00:41:56.799 --> 00:42:00.369
 this is called will match one 

00:41:58.539 --> 00:42:02.319
 serves as what we have seen 

00:42:00.369 --> 00:42:06.579
 first and the serve you can follow her 

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:08.859
 things and comfortable certain care on job can 

00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:10.230
 also run for up to ten minutes 

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:12.970
 because he feels pockets in the background 

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:14.680
 however they have more freedom because up to 

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:16.599
 ten minutes always in this case for 

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.039
 the needs for scalability because this 

00:42:16.599 --> 00:42:19.690
 is a platform that can scale then 

00:42:18.039 --> 00:42:21.160
 if every user who uploads a photo to us 

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:24.609
 for example we add the watermark 

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:27.640
 it takes over ten minutes over 

00:42:24.609 --> 00:42:30.130
 means that if there are 100 thousand users 

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:32.200
 that are reaching 100 thousand photos 

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:33.609
 he had practically lasted after a while 

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.009
 all available resources because yes 

00:42:33.609 --> 00:42:37.630
 no nice google infrastructure scale 

00:42:36.009 --> 00:42:39.819
 megagalattics all over the world however like 

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:41.980
 we know there is a physical limit to everything 

00:42:39.819 --> 00:42:43.420
 then to continue to maintain the 

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:47.200
 scalability and speed of 

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:49.779
 platform however it is necessary to give 

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:52.779
 of the constraints by which the 

00:42:49.779 --> 00:42:54.130
 platform can climb anyway 

00:42:52.779 --> 00:42:56.829
 you solve them easy because you can 

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:58.720
 launch for example ask or with job 

00:42:56.829 --> 00:43:00.789
 concatenate therefore when you see a 

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.619
 piece of processing launches ad 

00:43:00.789 --> 00:43:04.809
 another that continues from where that 

00:43:02.619 --> 00:43:06.460
 piece was finished and this in the end 

00:43:04.809 --> 00:43:08.109
 also good because with this type i 

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.240
 approaches also manage to hold the 

00:43:08.109 --> 00:43:12.549
 quite compact code and exit 

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:14.890
 so also to test it very well a lot 

00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:15.660
 quickly all the server 

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:17.760
 of 

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:19.230
 local and also very useful to do for 

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.970
 revive your tests because when 

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:23.549
 I started doing gen unit of yours 

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:24.720
 application or other goes on the server e 

00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:27.630
 follow everything you need to follow 

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.789
 and then the server is closed so no 

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:32.160
 you must necessarily make the unit law 

00:43:29.789 --> 00:43:33.839
 deploy etc. you can do others 

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.400
 test types in this case but you can 

00:43:33.839 --> 00:43:38.579
 also test everything locally then 

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:42.119
 you can also do developing tdd 

00:43:38.579 --> 00:43:45.329
 an application bra appengine then me 

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:47.160
 I more or less tell you just that 

00:43:45.329 --> 00:43:52.460
 then this is the application we have it 

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:56.490
 vista va well yes there was this stuff here and 

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:58.619
 we have seen all this code 

00:43:56.490 --> 00:44:00.299
 then if you want more and more advanced 

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:01.950
 I can recommend the cloud and bones 

00:44:00.299 --> 00:44:05.670
 which then Alex will also talk about just 

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:07.740
 after me and that allows you to create 

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:09.150
 of clothes 3p ai without writing code 

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:12.569
 but simply putting some 

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:15.270
 annotations above your classes and is 

00:44:12.569 --> 00:44:16.859
 the example of those two we saw 

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:19.680
 just big the application presents 

00:44:16.859 --> 00:44:20.760
 these serious point is mobile back end that 

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.380
 offers you a lot of infrastructure 

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.470
 simple to make yours communicate 

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:27.690
 mac back end with the mobile client also 

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:30.150
 to sending data from the client to the server 

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:33.720
 and both the server alerts by push 

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:36.720
 notification your clients informed 

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.579
 being a database in the sequels is that 

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.339
 what do you want and therefore already with this 

00:44:38.579 --> 00:44:42.450
 skeleton you have a minimal one 

00:44:41.339 --> 00:44:44.700
 infrastructure to create 

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:46.440
 a client server application where 

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:48.390
 to be able to exchange messages that type 

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.890
 chat application or do some things 

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:52.410
 more elaborate 

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:53.640
 there is also this video that you still have 

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:58.380
 I recommend to see what explains you 

00:44:53.640 --> 00:45:00.180
 use all these things here and how 

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.859
 I told you there is always the starter pack 

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.510
 so if by any chance you have developed 

00:45:01.859 --> 00:45:05.430
 your app on app engine vi 

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:08.309
 you realize that you are going beyond 

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:10.619
 free daily limits however 

00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:12.599
 through this this link this code 

00:45:10.619 --> 00:45:14.460
 managed to get a thousand euros of 

00:45:12.599 --> 00:45:16.170
 credit code per thousand dollars 

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:18.089
 sorry for app engine credits and 

00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:23.910
 $ 1,000 of computer credits 

00:45:18.089 --> 00:45:25.109
 gene and resources are on the link that 

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:27.400
 I make his representations then 

00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:29.109
 then there are much more advanced papers 

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.700
 many discussions on how to use apps 

00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:33.839
 engine etc. 

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.839
 I'd say that's all
