let's say and I would say what was
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.980
let's say and I would say what was
happening is that because they were

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
happening is that because they were
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.679
happening is that because they were
questioning their axioms at the most

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689
questioning their axioms at the most
 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.749

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.610
techniques with visionary techniques
which he which

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
which he which
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.559
which he which
did a lot and there is a period of his

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569
did a lot and there is a period of his
 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.410
did a lot and there is a period of his
life where he was having constant a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420
life where he was having constant a
 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.180
life where he was having constant a
constant stream of visions which he

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190
constant stream of visions which he
 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.770
constant stream of visions which he
wrote down in a book called the red book

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780
wrote down in a book called the red book
 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.050
wrote down in a book called the red book
but at the same time he was still

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060
but at the same time he was still
 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.610
but at the same time he was still
functioning as a psychiatrist and

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620
functioning as a psychiatrist and
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.100
functioning as a psychiatrist and
operating normally in the world and so

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110
operating normally in the world and so
 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.559
operating normally in the world and so
you know people have suggested that what

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569
you know people have suggested that what
 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.119
you know people have suggested that what
he had was a psychotic break but that's

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129
he had was a psychotic break but that's
 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.220
he had was a psychotic break but that's
ridiculous because you don't know that's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
ridiculous because you don't know that's
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.050
ridiculous because you don't know that's
not how it works man if you're having a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060
not how it works man if you're having a
 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.550
not how it works man if you're having a
psychotic break you you know I've been

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560
psychotic break you you know I've been
 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.619
psychotic break you you know I've been
an effective psychiatrist those things

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629
an effective psychiatrist those things
 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.360
an effective psychiatrist those things
do not go together especially not for a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370
do not go together especially not for a
 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.670
do not go together especially not for a
long period of time and so there there's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680
long period of time and so there there's
 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.759
long period of time and so there there's
the possibility of extreme experience

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769
the possibility of extreme experience
 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.860
the possibility of extreme experience
without psychosis psychopathology and so

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870
without psychosis psychopathology and so
 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.530
without psychosis psychopathology and so
and elenberg says much the same thing

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
and elenberg says much the same thing
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.569
and elenberg says much the same thing
about Freud and about Charles Darwin as

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579
about Freud and about Charles Darwin as
 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.699
about Freud and about Charles Darwin as
well who underwent a terrible period of

well who underwent a terrible period of
 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.190
well who underwent a terrible period of
of mental confusion I would say as a

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200
of mental confusion I would say as a
 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.470
of mental confusion I would say as a
consequence of formulating his theory of

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480
consequence of formulating his theory of
 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.030
consequence of formulating his theory of
evolution which was really hard on him

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040
evolution which was really hard on him
 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.559
evolution which was really hard on him
because he was a he was a die-hard

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569
because he was a he was a die-hard
 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.319
because he was a he was a die-hard
Christian and he knew what he knew what

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329
Christian and he knew what he knew what
 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.479
Christian and he knew what he knew what
the implications of his theory word he

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489
the implications of his theory word he
 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.649
the implications of his theory word he
didn't know what to do about that you

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659
didn't know what to do about that you
 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.809
didn't know what to do about that you
know so it was very very hard on him so

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819
know so it was very very hard on him so
 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.909
know so it was very very hard on him so
it's quite common for people of genius

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919
it's quite common for people of genius
 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.449
it's quite common for people of genius
to go through an intense crisis

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459
