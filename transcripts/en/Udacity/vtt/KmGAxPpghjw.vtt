00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Question 2--consider the same world as before with 4 states.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now we're facing a situation in which there are 5 particles in A, 3 in B, 3 in C, and 1 in D.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We will now take a motion step. This is not about measurements, just motion.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Our robot moves with a 50% probability horizontally.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For example, if it was in D, it would move to C.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It moves with a 50% chance vertically but never diagonally,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and it never stays in the same cell.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
After 1 motion step, how many particles do we expect in cell A, B, C, and D?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Answer the same for the asymptote.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If we move infinitely often, what is the distribution that we expect this to converge to?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I somewhat sloppily wrote "after infinite steps."

00:00:50.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is really what does it converge to in the end.
