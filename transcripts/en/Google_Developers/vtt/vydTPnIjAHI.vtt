We started Fancy to connect people to the
things they love and people who share their

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.070
tastes.
We wanted to create an experience where you

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.650
could find the coolest things curated by the
coolest people, all available in one place.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.930
Google Plus Sign-In is a better and more secure
way to connect with our site.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.820
You already have a Google account, so you
don’t have to create a whole new username

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.270
and password.
You just click the button and you’re ready

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.560
to go.
Finding the things you love from the people

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.390
you trust.
Privacy is very important to users.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.230
Sometimes you just want to share with your
friends.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.399
Sometimes you just want to share with your
family.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.589
So signing in with Google gives you full control
over who you share with.

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.219
Sharing is not just about viewing.
It’s also about taking action.

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.809
So, you’re not just sending your friends
back to the app.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.879
You’re inviting them to buy, or follow,
or contribute right there from the post.

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.949
And of course, mobile integration is huge.
With one click on the website, you can download

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.879
the app to any of your Android devices and
continue the experience on the go.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.780
Google Plus Sign-In means simplicity and security.
And as we’re trying to connect you with

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.030
our site, we want to do that in the easiest,
most trustworthy way possible, so you can

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.310
focus on finding the things you love.
