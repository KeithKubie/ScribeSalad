SONAM THUNDEN: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.990
My name Sonam Thunden.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.770
And on behalf of Google
Mindfulness and Buddhism--

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.370
Buddhist at Google
Groups, I would

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.030
like to welcome our two
guests, Khenpo Tsultrim

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.709
Lodro and Professor David
Presti to Google today.

00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:21.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:25.740
Khenpo Tsultrim Lodro,
or Khenchen Rinpoche,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.230
has emerged as one of the most
prominent Tibetan Buddhist

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.150
scholars living today.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.700
He oversees the education
of about 40,000 monks,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.450
nuns, and lay students at Larung
Gar in Eastern Tibet, which

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.820
is perhaps the largest monastic
community in the world.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.300
What I found fascinating
was that more than half

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.020
of those who come to study
there are female Buddhist

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.055
practitioners.

00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:53.520
Khenchen Rinpoche has
also worked tirelessly

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.090
to preserve Tibetan culture.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.440
He has started libraries
and built schools.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.260
Khenpo is also a widely
published author.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.630
His books range
from commentaries

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.210
on classic Buddhist
philosophical texts

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.240
to a book about inspiring
advice to both monastic and lay

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.564
audiences.

00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:13.480
I had the fortune of
meeting Khenchen Rinpoche

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.680
last year here at Google.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.560
At that time, we talked about
developing Google Translate

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.580
for the Tibetan language.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.220
I have a day job in
finance, but I also

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.310
moonlight as the unofficial
in-house Tibetan translator

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.255
whenever necessary.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.960
One of the challenges that
Google Translate is facing

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.270
is the lack of
high-quality data.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.020
I discovered that
Khenpo has co-authored

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.420
several Tibetan-Chinese-English
dictionaries that primarily

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.730
focuses on building a collection
of modern Tibetan terms.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.320
This is the first
dictionary of its kind.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.660
So when we met with
Khenpo last year,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.190
he had promised to
provide us data,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.910
and today, he has done so.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.910
So we are very grateful.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.092
Thank you.

00:02:00.092 --> 00:02:03.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.360
He is also well-known for his
compassion towards animals.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.910
He is a dominant ethical voice
among the Buddhist religious

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.880
teachers when it comes to
promoting vegetarianism.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.660
He advocates a vegetarian
diet, and puts great effort

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.980
into life saving and the
life release of animals

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.130
procured to be killed.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.860
He sponsors annual
summer life releases

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.230
to save vast numbers of lives.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.170
Khenchen Rinpoche has rescued
more than 100 million lives

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.240
so far.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.900
And for that work,
he's sometimes

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.780
known as the Life
Release Khenpo.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.480
Based on Buddhist values
and ethical principles,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.590
he's establishing a
vegetarianism movement,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.860
animal rights movement, which
is extraordinary for someone

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.360
from Tibet, where
meat has historically

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.540
been a main staple of the diet.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.560
Professor David Presti is a
neurobiologist, psychologist,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.910
and cognitive scientist at
the University of California,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.370
Berkeley, where he
has taught since 1991.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.620
Between 1990 and
2000, he has worked

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.770
as a clinical psychologist
in the treatment of addiction

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.010
and of post-traumatic
stress disorder

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.920
at the Department of Veterans
Affairs Medical Center

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.290
in San Francisco.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.850
He holds doctorates in
molecular biology, biophysics,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.220
and clinical psychology.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.750
Since 2004, he has been teaching
neuroscience to the Tibetan

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.460
monks and nuns in India, part
of a dialogue between science

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.740
and religion initiated
by the Dalai Lama.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.700
Professor Presti's
expertise include

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.750
human neurobiology
and neurochemistry,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.780
the effects of drugs on
the brain and the mind,

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.420
the treatment of addiction,
and the scientific study

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.880
of mind and consciousness.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.690
Khenchen Rinpoche
has, for a long time,

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.080
had a great interest
in modern science,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.220
including physics,
biology, and neuroscience.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.370
In our world, there
is often a divide

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.510
between science and
religion or spirituality,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.040
but rather than distancing
himself from science,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.830
Khenchen Rinpoche
has immersed himself

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.350
in the study of
science, and often draws

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.680
on science to help elucidate
important Buddhist concepts,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.440
at times breathing new life
into ancient Buddhist concepts.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.120
However, Khenchen
Rinpoche also seems

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.720
to be very well-aware
of the fact

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.390
that science still has
not understood everything,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.960
and in fact may still
have some catching up

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.090
to do with Buddhist science.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.940
So today, we have
to have a fruitful

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.160
dialogue between these two great
minds on the topic of Buddhism

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.970
and science and where this
conversation between Buddhists

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.950
and scientists is
going, and what

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.020
needs to be done in order to
move this conversation forward.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.140
So without further ado, please
welcome Khenpo Tsultrim Lodro

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.882
and Professor David Presti.

00:04:49.882 --> 00:04:53.818
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.950
And I can't help but offer this
traditional Tibetan welcome

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.538
khatas to both Professor Presti
and Khenpo Tsultrim Lodro,

00:05:03.538 --> 00:05:05.210
[TIBETAN]

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.950
MALE SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.690
So given the Chinese-speaking
audience here,

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.450
I would like to
give an introduction

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.775
or welcome speech for
Khenchen Rinpoche in Chinese.

00:05:16.775 --> 00:05:19.687
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:29.199
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.580
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:42.895 --> 00:06:44.490
INTERPRETER: Khenpo
is very happy

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.915
to have this chance to engage
in a dialogue with such

00:06:47.915 --> 00:06:51.855
an expert scientist as yourself.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.310
DAVID PRESTI: And I
too am greatly honored

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.840
to engage in this dialogue with
a scholar such as yourself who

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.450
also has a very strong
interest in science,

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.240
and to making connections
between the Buddhist tradition

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.720
and the worldview and
tradition of science.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.848
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:50.190
INTERPRETER: I'm of
the view that there

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.960
are many points of contact
between Buddhism and science.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.310
Even though they have their
own respective topics or fields

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:04.720
of research, there is much
commonality between the two.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.360
For example, in
terms of the methods

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.520
they go about researching their
respective topics of research,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.165
and the principles that
underpin the way they

00:08:17.165 --> 00:08:18.165
go about their research.

00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:23.560
DAVID PRESTI: That
also is my impression.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:29.420
And I feel that this
conversation that

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:35.570
has been happening in various
different ways between Buddhism

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.110
and science over the
last several decades--

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.679
I mean, it may go back even
further, more than 100 years,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.780
but more robustly over
the last several decades--

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.750
has been a very healthy
thing for introducing

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.080
some innovative new
ideas in science,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.222
and I hope a healthy
thing also for Buddhism.

00:08:57.222 --> 00:08:59.518
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:04.196 --> 00:09:09.410
INTERPRETER: Is the main
topic of our conversation

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.372
today that of consciousness.

00:09:11.372 --> 00:09:12.080
DAVID PRESTI: Is?

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.100
INTERPRETER: Is it?

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.770
Could it be?

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.090
DAVID PRESTI: I hope so.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:18.416 --> 00:09:22.542
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:42.655 --> 00:09:44.460
INTERPRETER: Khenpo
is of the opinion

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:52.000
that research into consciousness
is research into humans.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.600
And whatever method we use
to conduct this research,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.330
it is research
that is not solely

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.230
relevant to religious
realms, but has

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.170
a relevance beyond this.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.210
DAVID PRESTI: I absolutely
agree with that.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.980
I feel like investigations
of consciousness

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:18.540
are perhaps the most interesting
question in all of science--

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.110
there are many interesting
questions-- because really

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.960
consciousness is about
who we are as humans

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.780
and how we experience
our connection

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.880
with the rest of reality.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.046
And what could be more important
and more interesting than that,

00:10:38.046 --> 00:10:41.310
than to try to better
understand who we are

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.425
and how we're connected with
what we think reality is.

00:10:45.425 --> 00:10:48.470
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:10:59.762 --> 00:11:05.630
INTERPRETER: Khenpo has heard
that some scientists disregard

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.190
the idea of consciousness,
and have even said

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.540
that it's not necessary to have
this word in the dictionary.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.930
What would your
thoughts on this be?

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:22.940
DAVID PRESTI: That's a
pretty extreme perspective.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.070
The truth is that all
we know, everything

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.950
that we experience is
by way of our awareness,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.080
is by way of our capacity
to have what we're calling

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.330
consciousness here, have a
connection with what we're

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.410
calling consciousness.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.690
So it really is
all that we know,

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.210
and anything that we
conclude about the world

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.190
is coming through this
vehicle of our consciousness.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:57.830
So to dismiss it is not really
a very tenable position,

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.490
although it can
often be dismissed

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.470
as being something that
is beyond our capacity

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.110
to effectively study
scientifically,

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.960
that it's hard to design
experiments that will really

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.330
give us useful information
on what consciousness is

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.160
and where it comes from.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.430
And so therefore,
it's perhaps better

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:24.640
to work on other things
that may be more directly

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.522
leading to some kind of new
innovation or new measurable

00:12:30.522 --> 00:12:34.156
phenomena in nature,
or something like that.

00:12:34.156 --> 00:12:37.700
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:13:30.688 --> 00:13:35.160
INTERPRETER: Khenpo
started off by saying

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.120
that currently among scientists,
the mind or consciousness is

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.960
considered to
exist in the brain,

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.350
or as a function of the brain,
that consciousness or mind

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.260
is explained as a brain process.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.670
But he's heard of
an experiment where

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:57.100
mice, laboratory mice
whose-- the memory component

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.140
of their brain was removed.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.660
So previously, they
had been trained

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.820
to find their way around a maze.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.550
And then the memory component
of their brain was removed,

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.670
and yet they still knew how
to find their way around

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.340
without having this component
of their brain there.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.290
How would you-- what would you
think about this experiment?

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.800
Have you heard of it?

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.030
DAVID PRESTI: Yeah,
I would have-- no, I

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.450
don't know that experiment
particularly, specifically.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:34.310
I know that there are
experiments of that nature that

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.460
suggest that whatever--
if memory in the brain,

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.310
which is the
conventional viewpoint

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.090
in contemporary
neuroscience, then

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.340
it's going to be
distributed in a way

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.360
that it makes it very
difficult to selectively remove

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.420
some part of the
brain or inactivate

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.420
some part of the brain and be
assured that you have erased

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.300
every aspect of that memory.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.200
So it could be that
that specific experiment

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.290
may be addressable in that way.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:13.820
However, that being said, the
question about where does mind

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:19.580
come from and how do mind
and consciousness relate

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.260
to brain physiology is a
deeply mysterious thing.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:30.090
And although no one would argue
that the brain is necessary

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.160
as-- the brain and our
body and our nervous system

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.950
and all of this is necessary
for our experience of awareness

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:44.150
as we understand it, it
may not be the only way

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.010
that that awareness
can be maintained or be

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.970
manifest in some
way, that there may

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.790
be aspects of what we're calling
mind and consciousness that

00:15:54.790 --> 00:16:00.820
go beyond the body in ways that
contemporary neuroscience has

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.470
not even begun to address.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.890
And this is a very-- this
is a very interesting area

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:12.173
for future-- hopefully
present and future discussion.

00:16:12.173 --> 00:16:15.360
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:53.615 --> 00:16:58.880
INTERPRETER: So for example with
the experiences of suffering

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.670
and compassion, scientists
explain these as operating

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.030
as the same kind of electro
current in the mind.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.579
And even though you could
say that maybe compassion

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:14.290
and suffering as feelings
have maybe some similarities,

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.960
in actual fact we understand
them to be very different.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.550
So do you think
that there will be

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.859
another way of going
about explaining this

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.754
or researching this?

00:17:24.754 --> 00:17:27.180
DAVID PRESTI:
Well, from-- again,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.890
from the perspective of
contemporary neuroscience,

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:37.360
it would-- the framework
for which we currently

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.060
have to understand experiential
phenomena like compassion

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.870
and suffering is by way
of physiological processes

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.120
in our body and in our brain.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.820
And so that-- the
paradigm that's

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.980
used in contemporary
science is just

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.760
to keep pushing that
as far as we can go.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.550
And at this point, what's
known about things-- what's

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:08.150
known about the
neuroscience, the underlying

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:13.360
physiological processes
of emotions like suffering

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.960
and compassion, is very limited.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.430
And so everybody
thinks we're only

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.790
at the beginning of being
able to better understand

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.620
what's going on inside the
brain and inside the body when

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.113
these things happen.

00:18:27.113 --> 00:18:32.170
And those directions should
certainly be pursued.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.290
What would also
be interesting is

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:39.860
whether you have other
ideas about ways that

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.460
could be investigated using
the methods of science--

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.980
and by the methods
of science, I simply

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.370
mean asking questions
and looking for answers

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.000
and trying to make
sense of observations

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.330
and looking for
patterns, not being

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.690
stuck in one particular
theoretical way of describing

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:04.800
something-- whether you have
other ideas about how one might

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.930
usefully investigate
things like compassion

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.886
and suffering that
might be helpful.

00:19:10.886 --> 00:19:13.532
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:31.356 --> 00:19:35.220
INTERPRETER: Khenpo feels that
if the current methods that

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:40.980
are used to investigate emotions
like suffering and compassion

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.390
are not improved significantly,
then it is quite difficult--

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.830
it will be quite difficult
for us to make advancements

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.650
into this kind of research.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.510
However, if these methods
were improved significantly,

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.584
then it may be possible to.

00:19:56.584 --> 00:19:57.643
DAVID PRESTI: Yeah.

00:19:57.643 --> 00:19:58.550
Yeah.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.700
I would agree with that.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.767
INTERPRETER: Yeah.

00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:01.600
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.570
DAVID PRESTI: What
really interests

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.260
me very much about the
conversation that we're

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.000
having and the larger
conversation between science

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.260
and Buddhism is
ways that-- I feel

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.540
like the most interesting
thing for science

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:23.360
is when we are forced
to completely shift

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.170
our paradigm in some way,
our worldview, because

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.890
of what we're observing.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.890
And this really has happened
only a very small number

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.790
of times over the entire
history of science,

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.130
like when people like
Copernicus realized

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.570
it's better to
think of the earth

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.660
as not the center
of the universe,

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.690
that other things are
configuring in a way that

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.560
puts the earth in the
periphery somewhere, that

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.900
led to a whole new
revolution in science.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.560
And Einstein's ideas about
relativity and quantum physics

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.170
and evolution, these were
big changes in the way

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.520
that people thought
about reality.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.330
And I'm thinking that
we may be on the verge

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:13.400
of similar big changes in the
way of thinking about mind

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:19.730
and consciousness, and that this
conversation that is happening

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.790
can bring in some
really new ideas

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.880
into the study of
mind and consciousness

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.020
that have not really
been part of science

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.570
as we've done it so far.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.775
And I'm wondering what
you think of that.

00:21:33.775 --> 00:21:36.690
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:43.581 --> 00:21:46.800
INTERPRETER: Khenpo
feels that, in order

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.440
to contribute-- if we're
talking about contributing

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.950
new ideas and new methods to a
new paradigm shift in this way,

00:21:55.950 --> 00:22:01.220
that the ways we go about
currently researching matter

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.149
are probably not sufficient.

00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:04.940
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.102
INTERPRETER: Material matter.

00:22:08.102 --> 00:22:11.712
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.785
INTERPRETER: So
for example, if we

00:22:20.785 --> 00:22:24.050
are talking about images
or visual information,

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:25.580
we can see this with our eyes.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.929
However, sounds
are not something

00:22:27.929 --> 00:22:28.970
we can see with our eyes.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.566
We need our ears
to perceive these.

00:22:31.566 --> 00:22:34.640
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:42.270
INTERPRETER: Khenpo feels
that actually we don't need

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.180
to make things so complicated.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.010
If we're talking about
understanding the mind,

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.710
probably using the mind
to understand itself

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.830
is the best way.

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:52.750
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.595
INTERPRETER: What would
you say about this?

00:22:56.595 --> 00:22:59.410
DAVID PRESTI: I think that
sounds pretty reasonable.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.718
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:00.718 --> 00:23:02.190
INTERPRETER:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.030
DAVID PRESTI: Yeah.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:11.256
The kind of place
that science is at

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:17.200
is that we have a set of
methodologies and a paradigm

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.050
that nobody can argue with.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.680
It works really well.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.360
Even Khenpos have iPhones.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.870
You know, it's like
everybody has a smartphone,

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.430
everybody has a computer.

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.190
These things came from the
way that we study matter

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:37.780
and understand matter.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:43.230
So but is that enough to get
us to the next level of insight

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.150
about the nature of mind?

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.460
I don't think so.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.370
And it'll only be
part of the picture.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:55.630
And some of the ideas that
you bring from your tradition

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.940
and history I think will be
very valuable for taking us

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.562
to the next step.

00:24:00.562 --> 00:24:03.356
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:24:49.052 --> 00:24:52.800
INTERPRETER: Khenpo feels
that the current methods that

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.770
are used for
researching the mind,

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:59.280
if the idea is to proceed
on this foundation

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.236
and keep going with
these kind of methods

00:25:02.236 --> 00:25:04.610
to research the mind, we're
never going to get to a point

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.370
where we have a
paradigm breakthrough.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:08.900
So the paradigm
breakthroughs that

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.715
have been seen in
biology or that

00:25:10.715 --> 00:25:13.220
have been seen in physics,
that in terms of understanding

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.640
the mind, say, in psychology,
that using the current methods

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.242
are just not going to produce
any kind of breakthrough.

00:25:20.242 --> 00:25:23.040
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.680
INTERPRETER: Khenpo just agreed
with what you said before,

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.560
that essentially what we
need is a complete paradigm

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.940
shift in our approach
to this in order

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.880
to make a breakthrough about--
or in regards to researching

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.920
and understanding the mind.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.080
MALE SPEAKER 2: Google being a
place full of very inquisitive

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.850
minds certainly has a lot of
opportunities for questions

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:03.600
from the audience.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.340
And so to prepare
for your talk, we've

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.470
asked Google at large,
all around the world,

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.390
to submit questions.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:16.300
And we will also take some live
questions from the audience,

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.550
as well.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:21.661
But to-- as inquiring
minds want to know,

00:26:21.661 --> 00:26:23.800
I thought maybe we could
take this opportunity

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.200
to move into this format.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:32.960
So the first question
that we have here is

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.560
can artificial intelligence
ever achieve sentience?

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.666
If consciousness can enter
a body, why not a machine?

00:26:42.666 --> 00:26:44.272
DAVID PRESTI: Well--

00:26:44.272 --> 00:26:48.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.310
For me, that's an easy
question to answer because it's

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.850
an empirical question for the
future-- at least to start

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.930
the answer-- you can
back off for a minute

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:03.730
and say, we can never know
anything about consciousness

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:07.835
except for our own
consciousness, at some level,

00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:10.090
that the only thing I
am absolutely sure of

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.960
is that I'm conscious and the
only thing you're sure of,

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.050
perhaps, is you're conscious.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:19.680
However, if we're willing
to take for granted

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:25.510
that maybe we can share
a belief that we all

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.740
have some kind of consciousness,
then whether a machine can

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:34.140
become conscious is a
question for the future.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.610
Certainly, AI will continue to
be more and more elaborated.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:43.010
We will certainly continue to
have endlessly more intelligent

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.230
machines.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:48.270
Whether they will ever develop
any kind of awareness--

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.890
if I had to bet one way or
the other at this point,

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.170
I would say no, because
biology, I believe,

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.250
is way more complicated
than anything

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.240
we're likely to build in
even the distant future.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:04.010
I think a lot of questions about
the likelihood of sentience

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:08.390
in constructed
systems underestimate

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.380
the complexity of biology.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:15.170
You know, biology has
been evolving on Earth

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:17.370
for billions of years.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.020
Nervous systems and brains have
been developing for hundreds

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.090
of millions of years.

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:25.850
The level of complexity
inside a single cell

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:30.810
is beyond our capacity to
even grasp, let alone describe

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:31.950
at this point.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.890
And so the idea that
we're going to somehow map

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:38.520
every cell in the brain and
build a silicon replica of that

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.850
and it's going to have
the capacity to upload

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:42.590
consciousness into
it and anything

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:46.960
like that, it just ain't
going to happen anytime soon,

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.100
and maybe never.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.190
But it's an interesting
empirical question,

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:54.720
and we will continue to
pursue that avenue certainly.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.820
And so I'm excited to see
where it takes us just

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.620
in the next few decades,
let alone thousands of years

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:04.196
from now if we
continue to do this.

00:29:04.196 --> 00:29:07.090
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:08.630
INTERPRETER: Khenpo also
feels that this would probably

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:13.720
be quite unlikely at the moment,
or unlikely in the future given

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.370
that even though
Buddhism regards

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:22.130
the-- consciousness as something
that is beyond the body,

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:26.980
nevertheless for it to exist
on the base of another thing,

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.440
such as for it to exist on
the base of a human body

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.260
or anything-- for
example, a flower-- there

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.060
are many, many infinitely
complex conditions that

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.420
would need to be in
place for this to happen.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.320
However, one possibility he
could imagine in the future

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.760
is, if a sufficiently
sophisticated device were

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.430
designed that could hook
up a person to a computer

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.070
and, through a
process of meditation,

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.890
a person were able to
transfer their consciousness

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.066
to the machine.

00:30:55.066 --> 00:30:58.874
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:00.302 --> 00:31:01.746
DAVID PRESTI: I like that.

00:31:01.746 --> 00:31:03.120
INTERPRETER:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.690
DAVID PRESTI: I'm always
looking forward to your answer.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:11.460
MALE SPEAKER 2: And Rinpoche
has demonstrated his prescience,

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.820
for the next question
similarly has

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:19.120
to do with the transference of
consciousness or mind stream

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.210
not necessarily from
human to machine,

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:26.790
but the question is, is science
doing anything at this point

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:30.140
to understand the possibility
of the mind stream

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.320
coming into this life
from a previous life,

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.450
or incarnating from this life
into the next life after death.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:38.780
Is anything happening in
the scientific community

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.060
to understand this
question, and what

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.400
is the understanding of this
question from the Buddhist

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.120
standpoint?

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.670
DAVID PRESTI: Within the
scientific community,

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:52.530
a little is being
done, but very little.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.990
There are a small
number of researchers

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.660
around the world that
are interested in trying

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:02.900
to empirically document
stories that small children

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:08.000
spontaneously tell of detailed
information of someone else's

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.390
life.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:15.970
And some of those stories
are very well-documented,

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.200
and really check
out to the extent

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.920
that they can be investigated.

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.060
There have been some very
prominent researchers

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.930
historically-- Ian Stevenson,
a professor at the University

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:30.280
of Virginia, now
deceased, and his protege

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.250
and now the leader
of the research there

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:36.690
in this area, Jim Tucker--
so there is an attempt

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.780
to really do good
science around this,

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.330
but it's a very small number
of people and it's not-- it's

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.610
mostly not known about.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.050
And to the extent that
people have heard about it,

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:53.190
they really don't know
what to think of it,

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:58.220
and primarily because we
have no way to explain it.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.780
We have no way to
account for this

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.260
in our current biophysical
understanding of the body

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.630
and the mind and all of this.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.210
And I think this is one of
the most interesting areas

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:14.870
to pursue for the future,
to look for things like this

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.390
that we can't explain.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.633
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:34:43.422 --> 00:34:46.120
INTERPRETER: Khenpo
has also paid attention

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.580
to the research that's
being done at UVA,

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.100
and in Tibet has himself
conducted research

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.280
into past and future lives.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.550
And what he found
through his research

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.320
was exactly the
same as that which

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:04.190
has been found in other research
that has been undertaken.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:06.940
So for example, children
of-- young children

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:11.270
of two years of age being able
to tell stories of their past

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.300
lives without any
other prompting.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.476
And these recollections
would endure

00:35:16.476 --> 00:35:18.850
to a period of when they were
eight or nine years of age,

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.330
and then slowly they
would forget these things.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:26.230
And Khenpo says that this is
the same all over the world,

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.920
that this is how people
recollect their past lives

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.997
all over the world.

00:35:30.997 --> 00:35:32.580
They remember them
when they're young,

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.840
then they gradually
forget the details.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.420
And the fact that this is
observable and in many cases

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:42.400
all over the world
indicates that this

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.410
is, in fact, a true phenomenon.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:49.760
It's a real phenomenon, and
it should be taken seriously.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.240
Khenpo notes that
Professor Stevenson,

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:58.050
that before he died he said
that one of his greatest regrets

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:02.400
was that his research had not
made an influence on mainstream

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.080
science.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.700
Khenpo thinks that, in general,
the very strict, rigorous

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.630
approach that science takes
to its research is good,

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.490
it's appropriate, but
there are some areas

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:19.993
in which it could really do
well to open its mind a little.

00:36:19.993 --> 00:36:24.125
DAVID PRESTI: I
agree completely.

00:36:24.125 --> 00:36:27.030
AUDIENCE: I have a
question mostly for David

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.800
about cognitive scientists
and neuroscientists

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.920
who comment on this
question in the public.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.240
A lot of them are telling us
very forcefully and repeatedly

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:39.030
that there is definitely
no such thing as free will,

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.390
and there is certainly no
such thing as consciousness.

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.550
My question for you
is, how pervasive

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:46.880
is this line of thinking
among cognitive scientists?

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.830
Please tell me they
don't all think this.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:50.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.180
DAVID PRESTI: I can assure you
they don't all think that way.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:37:01.920
And I think it, in part,
boils down to the difficulty

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.380
with trying to design good
experimental strategies

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.830
to address these questions.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.950
You know, something like
free will very quickly

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:17.290
spirals into a convoluted morass
of being hard to kind of know

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:18.390
how to grasp this.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.530
Consciousness, I believe,
is much more tenable.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:27.830
And I also believe that these
are the kinds of things that

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:32.740
motivate us to look for
phenomena which are clearly

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:36.840
relevant to things
like consciousness,

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:41.230
but that are currently outside
of the explanatory framework,

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.960
the previous thing
that we just talked

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.660
about in the sense
of past life memories

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.540
being an example of that.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.760
Because if that were to be
better studied empirically,

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.360
it would force us
to expand the way

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.120
we're trying to explain
things, and it truly

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:03.480
would be a paradigm-shifting
expansion of our understanding

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.436
of reality.

00:38:05.436 --> 00:38:08.870
If that gets at
what you're saying.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.160
AUDIENCE: I thank
you also for coming.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.095
And I have a two-part question,
the first-- mostly for David,

00:38:14.095 --> 00:38:14.595
again.

00:38:14.595 --> 00:38:18.720
The first is, you alluded
to some research that

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.100
suggests a possibility of
consciousness not originating

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.980
from outside the brain, but
possibly having some existence

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:26.740
outside the brain.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.894
And I was wondering if you could
indicate what research you--

00:38:29.894 --> 00:38:31.810
if I understood that
correctly-- what research

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.370
you're alluding to there.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:36.735
And the second part
is, research that I--

00:38:36.735 --> 00:38:38.110
I don't know too
much about this,

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:41.250
but I've heard of research
like Dr. Rupert Sheldrake's

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:43.910
morphic resonance,
which I'm aware

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:46.020
has been roundly discredited.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:50.730
But I've not found a really
solid discreditation.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:52.980
So I was wondering what you
thought of that, if you're

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:53.938
aware of that, as well.

00:38:53.938 --> 00:38:55.880
DAVID PRESTI: Yeah,
well I-- first of all,

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.410
I think it's-- those
are excellent questions

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:04.660
and comments, and it's important
to appreciate that what we know

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.720
from contemporary physical
science and neuroscience is

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:14.160
that our bodies and our brains
and our nervous system are

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.140
certainly necessary for
our capacity to function

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:22.540
in the world, including
to be consciously aware,

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.570
and that whether that's the
whole story is completely

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:27.910
unknown.

00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:29.310
It's an assumption.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:32.560
It's only an assumption
that it is the whole story.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:40.900
And it's very much analogous
to the old image of,

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.060
well, if all you
have is a television

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.690
and you're watching
what's on the TV,

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:50.660
then you just assume that
it's all coming from that box.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.890
And of course, that's
not even-- of course

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:58.890
the box is necessary for the
construction of those images,

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:01.660
but everything is coming
from somewhere else.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.900
And there's no way we
can say that that's not

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.660
the case with us, that we're not
simply some kind of receivers

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.980
that are connected
up with a larger

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:14.810
matrix of interconnectivity
that we don't have any capacity

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:16.960
to investigate at this point.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:22.700
You can't-- that hypothesis is
consistent with everything we

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.130
can say from our science.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:28.790
And so to entertain that as
a working hypothesis is not

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:29.700
at all unreasonable.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.770
In fact, it's very reasonable.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:33.990
And that is what
really underlies

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.844
things like morphic
resonance and stuff

00:40:35.844 --> 00:40:37.260
like that, that
there is some kind

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:42.570
of profound interconnectivity
that is linking things together

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:45.250
in ways that we just
don't have a grasp of yet.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.700
So I'm completely open to that.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:52.570
So at that point, then,
you want to say, OK,

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:56.880
what kinds of empirical data
can you find in support of that.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.440
And the past life stream
stuff is certainly

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.670
one aspect of that.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:04.560
If there is some way that
information about one's

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.540
being can get communicated
after they die,

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.990
and that suggests that
something is going on that's

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.890
beyond the body.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:15.590
Other kinds of
phenomena that suggest

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:21.430
some kind of interconnection
between people over distances

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:24.860
or time spaces
that are not-- that

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.600
wouldn't normally be explicable,
there's plenty of evidence

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.880
that things like that happen.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.800
But it's not taken seriously
by mainstream science.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.180
So those are things
that I feel push us

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:40.880
in the direction of
needing to at least look

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.470
at some kind of expanded
way of describing things.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.580
I'm the first to admit I have
no idea really what's going on.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.970
I just-- the only
thing that I know

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:56.470
is that we have a paradigm
that works really well.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:00.950
It gives us the internet and
smartphones and all of that.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.040
But is it the whole story?

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.050
Well, I doubt it.

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:06.590
It's never been the case
that our scientific way

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.020
of describing things
at some moment in time

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.317
is somehow the whole story.

00:42:11.317 --> 00:42:12.400
That's a lot to translate.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.128
Sorry about that.

00:42:14.128 --> 00:42:15.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:22.120
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:08.532 --> 00:43:12.040
INTERPRETER: In terms of
particularly in relation

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:17.930
to past and future lives,
within the realm of Buddhism

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:22.820
there is a great amount of
evidence concerning this.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.300
So not just only the
recollections and memories

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:29.380
of people, but
also, in many cases,

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:32.010
people are able to
prove they've got

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.040
physical evidence of
actions and activities

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:39.840
that they have conducted
in previous lives, too.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.720
So from a Buddhist
point of view,

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.160
from a religious
point of view, this

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.420
is-- there is a lot of evidence.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:50.600
However, this is
something that remains

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:55.000
very difficult for science
to research seriously

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.409
using its current methods.

00:43:57.409 --> 00:44:00.420
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:44:20.115 --> 00:44:23.130
INTERPRETER: So for example
in Tibetan Buddhism,

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:26.540
in the case of
treasure revealers

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:31.640
who discover treasures that
were planted in previous lives,

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.260
this is precisely
the kind of activity

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:39.620
that involves treasure
revealers tapping into knowledge

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.760
from previous lives.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.360
So this is one type
of evidence that

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:47.905
is regarded as valid from
a religious point of view.

00:44:47.905 --> 00:44:49.890
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:45:01.042 --> 00:45:04.710
INTERPRETER: Khenpo feels
that if the existence

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:09.010
of past and future lives
was able to be understood

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:12.470
and therefore able to be
accepted, that this would open

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:15.930
up a great scope for
doing further research

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:21.050
into other aspects or
other aspects of the mind

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:24.034
existing beyond the body.

00:45:24.034 --> 00:45:27.330
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:01.352 --> 00:46:03.270
INTERPRETER: For
example, in the--

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:06.400
in terms of treasure
revealing, Khenpo

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.760
has seen with his own
eyes-- and not just himself,

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.160
but many have seen with
their own eyes-- for example,

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:19.126
Khenpo's own teacher actually
go about revealing treasures,

00:46:19.126 --> 00:46:23.230
so recovering treasures from
lakes and from other places,

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:27.640
as well, revealing--
taking out vessels or items

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.340
and opening them and finding
within them pieces of paper

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.100
on which symbols were written.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.620
And this kind of
action is very much

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:38.620
one that is based on
a consciousness that

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:43.150
transcends the body and
connects past lifetimes

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:44.370
to the present lifetime.

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:46.520
So Khenpo feels that
this is something,

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.700
if properly
investigated, would yield

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.694
a lot of useful information.

00:46:51.694 --> 00:46:53.780
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:12.350
INTERPRETER: Khenpo feels that
a research methodology that

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:15.700
relies primarily on
researching the brain

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:20.030
to understand consciousness is
an extremely narrow and limited

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:22.380
approach from the point
of view that we still

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.090
don't understand the brain.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:27.230
So if we're using an organ that
we don't yet fully understand

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.180
to understand this
kind of thing,

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:32.910
then it seems from the outset
that it's quite limited.

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:36.380
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:14.310
INTERPRETER: Another example
is near-death experiences,

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:17.110
which is something that Khenpo
has also done a bit of research

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:21.500
into, as well, where people
who have such an experience,

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.530
their consciousness leaves
their body for a period of time

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:27.330
and, during the period
that it has left the body,

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:32.550
does various things and is
effective in various ways.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:37.270
This is something that there
is quite clear-- or there's

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:40.710
a lot of evidence for, and
that is possible to understand

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.246
quite clearly.

00:48:42.246 --> 00:48:45.152
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.620
INTERPRETER: Do
you think-- what's

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.680
your opinion about
near-death experience?

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:59.194
Do you think it is
something that's true?

00:48:59.194 --> 00:49:00.290
DAVID PRESTI: Yes.

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:03.960
And I also believe
that that is one

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:09.730
of the other very powerful
places where we can investigate

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:15.230
empirically things that are
happening with consciousness

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:17.440
that are currently
not explicable.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.550
If it can be
empirically verified

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:24.870
by what people are saying,
that their awareness has

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:27.330
left their body for
a period of time

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:30.220
and experienced this or that
and then comes back and then

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.600
that's empirically verified.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.620
And there are people who are
attempting to do that-- again,

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:38.230
a very small number--
and it's good science.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.470
It's just so hard to do
these kinds of projects

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:45.210
because scientists
like to set up things

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:49.780
that they can reproduce in some
nice, neat way in a laboratory.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.401
You can't do that with
a near-death experience,

00:49:52.401 --> 00:49:52.900
you know?

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.220
They're very-- they
have their own agenda.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:58.108
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:00.930
You know, I just
want to say that I'm

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:06.970
very optimistic about the
future of this encounter

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.930
between these
traditions, and where

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:13.460
this might lead for expanded
ways of appreciating

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.349
the intricate activity
of all beings.

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:17.140
KHENPO TSULTRIM LODRO:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:36.600
INTERPRETER: Khenpo
also feels that,

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.080
for the future collaboration
between Buddhist researchers

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:44.510
and practitioners between--
in terms of collaborations

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.550
between them and
scientists, he also

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:51.550
feels extremely optimistic
about the potential here.
