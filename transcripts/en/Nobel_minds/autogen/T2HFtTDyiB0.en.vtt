the human immunodeficiency virus this is
 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.580
the human immunodeficiency virus this is
a very controversial area it's been a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
a very controversial area it's been a
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.910
a very controversial area it's been a
subject of much high level debate and

we provide the price for the discovery

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
we provide the price for the discovery
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.579
we provide the price for the discovery
of the virus because that is the

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589
of the virus because that is the
 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.849
of the virus because that is the
paradigm shift in these signs they

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
paradigm shift in these signs they
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.340
paradigm shift in these signs they
provided this virus isolate to a number

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
provided this virus isolate to a number
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.770

the disease were the cells that actually

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
the disease were the cells that actually
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.310
the disease were the cells that actually
were infected so they not only isolated

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320
were infected so they not only isolated
 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620
were infected so they not only isolated
the virus they also provided explanation

for why the immune impairment occurred

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179
for why the immune impairment occurred
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.140
for why the immune impairment occurred
what their findings actually allow so

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
what their findings actually allow so

two different drugs that have
 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.300
two different drugs that have
revolutionized the care of these

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310
revolutionized the care of these
 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.420
revolutionized the care of these
invaders infected individuals now get

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430
invaders infected individuals now get
 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.670
invaders infected individuals now get
immune reconstitution and cannot go back

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680
immune reconstitution and cannot go back
 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.860
immune reconstitution and cannot go back
to a normal life and almost have a

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870
to a normal life and almost have a
 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.920
to a normal life and almost have a
normal life expectancy we can also

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930
normal life expectancy we can also
 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.200
normal life expectancy we can also
prohibit mother-to-child transmission of

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210
prohibit mother-to-child transmission of
 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.500
prohibit mother-to-child transmission of
this virus by these drugs diagnostic

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510
this virus by these drugs diagnostic
 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.780
this virus by these drugs diagnostic
tools that have bevelle own have also

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790
tools that have bevelle own have also
 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.270
tools that have bevelle own have also
allowed us to restrict the pandemic by

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
allowed us to restrict the pandemic by
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.220
allowed us to restrict the pandemic by
now screening blood products and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230
now screening blood products and
 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.170
now screening blood products and
infected individuals for potential

infected individuals for potential
 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.770
infected individuals for potential
infection and so just a sort of recap a

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780
infection and so just a sort of recap a
 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.420
infection and so just a sort of recap a
bit is what there was there was a lot of

bit is what there was there was a lot of
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.100
bit is what there was there was a lot of
scientific effort going on the field of

scientific effort going on the field of
 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.920
scientific effort going on the field of
time why why why was this the particular

discover you so it's a paradigm shift

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190
discover you so it's a paradigm shift
 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.860
discover you so it's a paradigm shift
but there was also the linking of the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870
but there was also the linking of the
 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.800
but there was also the linking of the
order of the virus to AIDS so could you

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810
order of the virus to AIDS so could you
 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.450
order of the virus to AIDS so could you
sort of go into a little bit as why you

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460
sort of go into a little bit as why you
 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.250
sort of go into a little bit as why you
focused on this discovery rather than

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260
focused on this discovery rather than
 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.430
focused on this discovery rather than
the linking of the virus to that seems

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440
the linking of the virus to that seems
 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.200
the linking of the virus to that seems
because the discovery of the virus was

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210
because the discovery of the virus was
 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.690
because the discovery of the virus was
really the most important thing without

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700
really the most important thing without
 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.150
really the most important thing without
the discovery of the virus you could

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160
the discovery of the virus you could
 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.010
the discovery of the virus you could
never have done the exact identification

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020
never have done the exact identification
 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.310
never have done the exact identification
or the course of the disease the cause

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320
or the course of the disease the cause
 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.650
or the course of the disease the cause
of the disease was then the central

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660
of the disease was then the central
 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.770
of the disease was then the central
paradigm shift the establishment that

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780
paradigm shift the establishment that
 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.080

scientific groups in the world
contributed to the definite proof that

contributed to the definite proof that
 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.080
contributed to the definite proof that
HIV causes AIDS and so the the discovery

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090
HIV causes AIDS and so the the discovery
 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.990
HIV causes AIDS and so the the discovery
of the human immunodeficiency virus was

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000
of the human immunodeficiency virus was
 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.600
of the human immunodeficiency virus was
made 25 years ago why has it taken up

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610
made 25 years ago why has it taken up
 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.490
made 25 years ago why has it taken up
