00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:02.711
- [Voiceover] The number
of branches of an oak tree

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:06.087
and a birch tree since
1950 are represented

00:00:06.087 --> 00:00:08.351
by the following tables.

00:00:08.351 --> 00:00:11.077
So for the oak tree we
see when time equals zero

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.443
has 34 branches.

00:00:12.443 --> 00:00:15.131
After three years it has 46 branches,

00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:16.605
so on and so forth.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:18.602
And in the birch tree
they give us similar data.

00:00:18.602 --> 00:00:21.609
At the beginning has eight branches.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.521
In 10 years has 33 branches
and they give us all of that.

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:26.751
What I want to think about in this video

00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:28.690
is how should we model these?

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.295
If we want to model these with functions

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:31.929
and the choices we'll give ourselves,

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.241
there are other options,

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.211
but the choices we'll give
ourselves in this video

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:38.722
are linear, and linear

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:41.123
versus exponential functions.

00:00:41.123 --> 00:00:43.669
Which of these are going to be better

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.990
for modeling this data?

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.988
So let's first look at the oak tree.

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:53.287
A key to realization is,
whenever I have a fixed

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:54.947
increase in time, so each of these steps,

00:00:54.947 --> 00:00:57.466
this is plus three years.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.265
So it's a fixed increase in time.

00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:01.135
What happens to my number of branches?

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:03.455
Is it going to be a fixed change,

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:05.597
or roughly a fixed change in which case

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:07.250
a linear model might be good,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.409
or is it going to be a
change that's dependent

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.988
on where we were?

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:12.219
So what am I talking about?

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.491
So 34 to 46, that is plus 12.

00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:20.997
46 to 59 is plus 13.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:25.290
59 to 70 is plus 11.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.353
70 to 82 is plus 12.

00:01:29.353 --> 00:01:31.689
So at first you mention,
well this isn't exactly

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:32.569
a fixed change.

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.066
These numbers they seem to
average right around 12,

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.687
but when you're looking at real world data

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:40.974
you're never gonna get
something that is exact.

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:43.900
The models are just going
to give us a good fit.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.839
Are going to give us a good approximation

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:49.376
of the behavior of the
number of branches over time.

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:53.515
For me, this is pretty close
to a constant 12 branches

00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:54.591
a year.

00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:56.889
So I would construct a linear model here.

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.871
I would say here branches

00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:01.310
as a function of time.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.389
Let me be clear, this
isn't 12 branches per year,

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:07.361
this is 12 branches every three years.

00:02:07.361 --> 00:02:09.437
This is 13 branches over three years.

00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:11.099
This was 11 branches over three years.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.173
We're going to average 12
branches over three years.

00:02:14.173 --> 00:02:16.240
So the number of branches we have,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.036
we're gonna start at 34 branches

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:21.754
and then minus.

00:02:21.754 --> 00:02:23.544
If we have 12 branches every three years,

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:26.351
that's four branches every,

00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:27.500
or I should say plus.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.495
Four branches every year.

00:02:30.495 --> 00:02:31.633
And you could test this out.

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:34.454
B of zero is gonna give us 34 branches.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:35.735
B of 12.

00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:38.935
Let's just really test out
the extreme part of the model.

00:02:38.935 --> 00:02:43.888
B of 12 is going to be 34 plus 48,

00:02:45.768 --> 00:02:47.872
which is equal to 82.

00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:50.217
So this model works quite well.

00:02:50.217 --> 00:02:51.076
It's gonna have a couple of places

00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:53.258
where it's not exactly fitting the data,

00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:55.313
but it fits it quite, quite well.

00:02:55.313 --> 00:02:57.019
This is the linear model.

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.633
So this one is linear.

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:00.572
We also got the birch tree.

00:03:00.572 --> 00:03:04.986
So time equals zero, so
fixed change in time.

00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:09.167
Alright, so we have a fixed change in time

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:13.527
every time we are moving
into the future, a decade.

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.501
Let's see, our change in branches.

00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:17.602
We go from eight to 33.

00:03:17.602 --> 00:03:18.577
So what is that?

00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:21.758
That is plus 25 branches.

00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:24.939
Then we go from 33 to 128.

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.170
Well that's way more than 25 branches.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.445
That's going to be what?

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:32.108
Five less than 100.

00:03:32.108 --> 00:03:35.858
So that's gonna be plus 95 branches.

00:03:35.858 --> 00:03:39.404
So this clearly is not a linear model.

00:03:39.404 --> 00:03:41.644
And so let's think in terms
of an exponential model.

00:03:41.644 --> 00:03:43.897
How much do we have to
multiply to go from...

00:03:43.897 --> 00:03:44.581
Did I do that right?

00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:47.101
128 minus, yeah, if it was 133

00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:48.123
then it would be 100

00:03:48.123 --> 00:03:49.794
and it's five less than that, okay.

00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:50.781
So now let's think about it in terms

00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:51.767
of an exponential model.

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:53.996
In terms of an exponential model

00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:56.055
what do we have to multiply

00:03:57.285 --> 00:03:58.559
for each step?

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:00.021
So if we have a constant step in time,

00:04:00.021 --> 00:04:02.622
what do we multiply for how much

00:04:02.622 --> 00:04:04.282
we increase our branches?

00:04:04.282 --> 00:04:06.906
So if we go to eight to 33,

00:04:08.576 --> 00:04:11.015
it's gonna be approximately four.

00:04:11.015 --> 00:04:13.058
It's gonna be a little bit more than four.

00:04:13.058 --> 00:04:16.193
33 to 128,

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:18.921
well that's gonna be a
little bit less than four,

00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:20.999
but it's approximately four.

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:24.876
33 times four would be
132, so we're close.

00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:29.629
128 to 512, that's exactly four, right?

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:34.187
That's exactly 120 times four is 480

00:04:34.187 --> 00:04:37.642
plus 32, yup, that is exactly four.

00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:39.051
So times four.

00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:41.814
And so it looks like we
keep multiplying by four

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.310
every 10 years that go by.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.897
So one way to think about it is

00:04:47.897 --> 00:04:51.772
we could say here, BFT, the branches of T,

00:04:51.772 --> 00:04:54.950
our initial condition,
our initial state is eight

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.069
and now we could say our
common factor is four.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.098
But if we want T to be in years,

00:05:04.098 --> 00:05:08.219
well every 10 years we
multiply by a factor of four.

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:11.122
So T has to go to 10 before we increase

00:05:11.122 --> 00:05:13.285
the exponent to one,

00:05:13.285 --> 00:05:16.220
or has to go to 20 until
this exponent becomes two.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.422
So eight times four to the T over 10 power

00:05:19.422 --> 00:05:23.149
seems like a pretty good model.

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:25.703
And you could even verify
this for yourself if you like.

00:05:25.703 --> 00:05:28.872
Try out what B of 30 is going to be.

00:05:28.872 --> 00:05:33.409
B of 30 would be eight times four.

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.571
30 divided by 10 to the third power

00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:38.333
and what is that going to be?

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:42.396
That's going to be four
to the third is 64.

00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:43.815
64.

00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:46.623
Eight times 64 is,

00:05:46.623 --> 00:05:48.375
it's 480 plus 32.

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:49.839
It is 512.

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:53.189
So once again, this exponential model

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:55.892
for this data does a pretty good job.
