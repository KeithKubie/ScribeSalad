00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is the answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A minus B corresponds to 3, because this is all the elements that are in A but not B.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We haven't filled in this area.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A or B is number 2.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
All of the elements are either in A or B.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
A &amp;amp; B is number 1. I filled in this middle area corresponding to both sets.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The symmetric difference of A and B is 4.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
All the elements that are in A or B but not in both, and I've left out this region.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Okay, so now that you understand the basics of set theory, we can implement this in Python.
