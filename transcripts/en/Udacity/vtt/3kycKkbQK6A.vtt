00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.230
When you want to use a database
in your application,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.375
first you need to create
the database and give it a name.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:09.240
You'll use the create
database command for this.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.270
The name you give it here is the same
name you'll use to connect to

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.360
the database from your code.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.850
The opposite of create in SQL is drop.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.300
I'm not sure why.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.190
Maybe database programmers
used to be really clumsy.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.280
Anyway, the way to remove
a database is drop database.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.330
And the way to remove
a table is drop table.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.920
All of these commands have options.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.670
You can look up in the documentation
if you ever need them.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.630
When you drop a database or
table, there's no confirmation.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.830
No, did you really mean to do that,
warning.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.750
So, don't do it if you
don't really mean it.
