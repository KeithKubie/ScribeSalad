1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:00,871
Okay.

2
00:00:00,871 --> 00:00:05,280
Jocko many times he said that liking a
fight or liking to fight should be a part

3
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:08,520
of every man's personality.
Could you expand on that?

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,650
I've always been
interested in martial arts,

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,390
but I've always been reluctant to
fight and I would do anything not to.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,090
Does that make me less of a man?

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,840
So obviously this was pretty
fitting question for the situation.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,780
So this is obviously a good
question. Uh, and a fitting question.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,830
Talking about being a man.
Uh,

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,920
I don't know if I said liking to fight
should be a part of everybody's every

11
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:42,171
man's personality or if I said that it
is part of every man's personality and,

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,430
and it, I think I said is part of
their personality. And if I said that,

13
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:51,900
what I think I should have
said is most right? Most men,

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,870
uh, have in their personality some
level of interest of fighting,

15
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:02,400
right? We wrestle, we box, we scrap
as kids look at the UFC. Right?

16
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,380
Why is the UFC so popular right now?

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,300
Because it's fighting and we have that,
that's a,

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,110
I read the other, that's a $7
billion organization. That's,

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,940
there's a lot of people
watching those fights.

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,840
A lot of people want to watch those
fights. We have boxing, we have wrestling,

21
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,700
we have Jujitsu, we have
Judy, we have Moitai.

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,770
We've got all kinds of
martial arts schools.

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,470
So while I don't think the desire to
fight is inherent in all men, right?

24
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:31,560
I'm sure there's men out there
that have not into it at all,

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,480
but I think it's definitely a,

26
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,730
a pretty strong part of many men
now for this individual, particular,

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,430
um, do, do I think that being reluctant
to fight makes you less of a man? No,

28
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:48,720
actually I think it's fine. The,
you should be reluctant to fight.

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,890
I think everyone should be reluctant,

30
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:52,470
but there's a lot of bad things that can
happen in a fight. A lot of bad things.

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,620
You know, first of all, you can
get hurt, right? That's bad.

32
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,240
You can get seriously hurt. You
can get killed, you can get killed.

33
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,310
You can get punched one time,
fall down, hit a curb and die.

34
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,740
You can think you're going to
get in a fair fight with someone.

35
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:08,070
They can stab you in the neck and kill
you. Right? These things can happen.

36
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:13,320
Even if it's not that bad, you can hurt
someone else. Now you're getting lawsuit,

37
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:16,590
now you're getting put in prison. Right?
So there's all kinds of bad things.

38
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:21,240
So being reluctant to fight is actually
a good thing and it's something that men

39
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,570
should have. And actually the
more you know about fighting,

40
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:27,120
the more reluctant you will be.
I was way,

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,170
the less I knew in my life about
fighting the more, or sorry,

42
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,390
the more I actually knew about fighting,

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,170
the more reluctant I became to fight
cause I realized all the risks that are

44
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:39,540
involved. Part of that was maturity. Sure.

45
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,590
But the reality is you look
at someone and you go, Whoa,

46
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,530
I don't know who that person is.
A they, they might be training.

47
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,320
I'm over here thinking I've been
training Jujitsu for f eight months.

48
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:51,390
I'm ready to kick this guy's ass.
Meanwhile,

49
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:53,940
you don't know that guy as a purple belt.
Guess what's gonna Happen to you?

50
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,760
You're getting crushed.
Or that guy wrestled in high school.

51
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,780
He's about to double leg you
and slam you on a curb. Yeah,

52
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,210
you're going to die you.
So you should be reluctant to fight.

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,110
That's a good thing. Now, that being said,

54
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,020
I do recommend that you
are prepared to fight.

55
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,280
I definitely recommend that, and there's
going to be a big dichotomy here.

56
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,990
I'm gonna get to, but you
should know some basics, right?

57
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,810
You should understand threats. You should
know how to contend with other people.

58
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,940
You should. You should know some
boxing. You should know some wrestling.

59
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,320
You should know some boys.
I should know some Jujitsu for sure,

60
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,720
because here's the dichotomy. This
is the, this is a big dichotomy,

61
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:37,450
and think about it. It's 100% true. This,

62
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,020
this individual says he would
do anything not to fight,

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,310
would do anything not to fight.
Let me tell you,

64
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:50,311
the best thing you can do as a human so
that you don't have to fight is actually

65
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,540
learn how to fight.

66
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,990
That is the best way to not have to
fight as if you know how to fight.

67
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,000
If you know how to fight,
people aren't gonna want to fight you.

68
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,160
You don't even have to say anything.
They can tell.

69
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,600
You can tell when you meet somebody. You
can tell if that person, oh, if you're,

70
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,660
if you're ready to fight,
people don't want to fight you.

71
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,720
The more eager you ought to fight,
the less people want to fight you.

72
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,590
If you don't know how to
fight and and bullies,

73
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,670
because that's what we're talking about.

74
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,430
Bullies see that you don't want to fight.
Guess who they're coming after.

75
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,370
You now guess what?
Now you have to fight.

76
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,580
But if you know how to fight and you
have that confidence and you have that

77
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:28,070
understanding and you learn simple
things like avoidance and you learn,

78
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,860
you have better situational awareness,

79
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,460
you become a threat to the
people that want to fight you.

80
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,670
If you become a threat to them just
by just by your knowledge alone.

81
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,150
So No,

82
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,690
you're not less of a man because
you were elected to fight.

83
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,250
You actually should be reluctant to fight,

84
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,810
but you should learn how to fight
because the best way to avoid fighting,

85
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:52,840
the more equipped and
prepared to fight you are,

86
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,360
the less you will have to fight,

87
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,520
the less you will be put in positions
where you have to fight and the better the

88
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:04,510
outcome will be if it
does happen to occur.

89
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,620
Yeah. Yeah. Interestingly,

90
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,830
like a lot of the people
that you meet in Jujitsu or,

91
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,560
or just like this where I'm interested
in martial arts but I'm not interested in

92
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,170
fighting. No, for sure. For sure.
And then they learn and then I get,

93
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,150
well there's a strong
component of nerds in Jujitsu,

94
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,530
right? Strong component.
Really strong of of,

95
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,230
you know I'm saying it jokingly,

96
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:33,220
but there's just a studious type students
type people that aren't super physical

97
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:36,850
there. More cerebral than
they are physical. There's
a ton of people like that.

98
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,200
And you know what? They'll do choke you
out. They will end up being real good.

99
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:43,600
Yeah. They wind up being real good cause
they're like, Oh I, I understand this.

100
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,970
There's a,
this is a game that I can learn.

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,510
And then I can crush and that's good and
now I have more confidence on him for

102
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:52,690
worry about it anymore. Again. It's
interesting how that third or that,

103
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,650
that additional element that they're not
really used to like how you say nerds

104
00:05:56,651 --> 00:06:00,560
and you know, we'll just say like people
who are more cerebral within physical.

105
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,790
Yeah. It's that maybe they didn't play
high school sports, right? Yeah, totally.

106
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,180
We're studying because they
were working on a computer,
right? Yeah. Cool. Right on.

107
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,020
Yeah. They were playing music,
right? Yeah. Whatever. Yeah.

108
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,830
And then now they get into this highly
physical situation cause just to,

109
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,990
let's face it, that's physical.
That's your whole body.

110
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,760
It is physical as well as the book can
be and but you get in and you're just

111
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:26,570
finding success just by learning it.
It's not like football where it's like,

112
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:29,900
sure I know how to catch.
I can't run fast though and I can't,

113
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:32,960
I'm not big and strong or whatever, so
I'm just getting smashed, you know, I can.

114
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,120
But this,
it's kind of like the more you know,

115
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:38,540
the better you are kind of thing and sure.
Physical attributes help you for sure.

116
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:43,250
But even that much, yeah, there's,
there's you being stronger as great.

117
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,830
Yeah. You know, Dean was talking
about the city on the map.

118
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,170
The stronger guys not always going to win.

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,720
The more athletic guys not always
going to win. Sometimes they do.

120
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,510
There's various categories
that will bring you a victory.

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,080
One of the strongest categories that
you could have. Well the, this strong,

122
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,140
the strongest category is your technique
because no one wants to do because no

123
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:03,350
one wants to do.
And so you're smart people,

124
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,070
your cerebral people that come
in and go, oh, I can apply,

125
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,840
I can apply this knowledge the same
way I apply my skills in accounting.

126
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,460
James Nielsen, world's toughest
accountant, he's an accountant,

127
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,320
he's a back.
So that's just the reality and yeah,

128
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:24,350
and that's why, so now they're in,
that's why people get addicted to,

129
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,460
because it's like this element of
physicality, like a physical fighting,

130
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:32,280
more fighting sport by the way, combat
sport. And now they're in the end,

131
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,123
they're good at,

132
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,350
they're good at something physical for
the first time and they're still smart as

133
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:37,980
smart can be. You know,
like they always were.

134
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:41,540
So now they got that and that
additional, um, like pay off, you know,

135
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,670
that's where they get it
to additional power. Yeah.

136
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,520
I recognize that with the
kids that come to Jujitsu,

137
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,790
the oftentimes,
and it's not an always,

138
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,880
oftentimes the kids that get really into
Jujitsu are kids that are smart and,

139
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,640
but they haven't done a
lot of other sports yet.

140
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,820
And it's exactly what you're saying.
It's very noticeable with kids.

141
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,460
The kid that played baseball his
whole life and he comes in there,

142
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,570
he actually doesn't like it at first
and maybe doesn't even want to do it

143
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,850
because he's getting choked by someone
that seems all nerdy to him. Yeah.

144
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,220
And he knows I could throw a baseball
further than this guy and so it makes him

145
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:18,110
mad and he doesn't want to train.
Yeah.

146
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,250
But oftentimes it's the kids that come
in that really haven't done too much

147
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,940
athletically and you know, they're,
they got picked on. We got, we've,

148
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:28,670
I've had a lot of bullies come to mind,
Jujitsu kids program.

149
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,800
The reason they're there is
because they got bullied.

150
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,560
And once I started training six months,
they're not getting bullied anymore,

151
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,010
and a year later they're a different
person. Yeah. There are different kid,

152
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,200
confident, assured themselves not
backing down, not being jerks,

153
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:47,150
not being bullied themselves, but
just confident. Yeah. So yeah.
