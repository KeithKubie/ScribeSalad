the foundation of immunosuppression so

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
the foundation of immunosuppression so
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.420
the foundation of immunosuppression so
it's been since 1983 since we've had a

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329
 
 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.079
 
the first drug that we started to work

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089
the first drug that we started to work
 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.959
the first drug that we started to work
with with ctla4 IG that was that fusion

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969
with with ctla4 IG that was that fusion
 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.430
with with ctla4 IG that was that fusion
protein that blocked the immune system

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440
protein that blocked the immune system
 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.049
protein that blocked the immune system
and that proved to be very effective in

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
and that proved to be very effective in
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.090
and that proved to be very effective in
experimental systems in mice short

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100
experimental systems in mice short
 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.859
experimental systems in mice short
courses of that treatment could lead to

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869
courses of that treatment could lead to
 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.219
courses of that treatment could lead to
very prolonged survival of mouse

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
very prolonged survival of mouse
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.980
very prolonged survival of mouse
transplants in mice of course what we

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990
transplants in mice of course what we
 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.210
transplants in mice of course what we
really wanted was a drug that was

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220
really wanted was a drug that was
 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.300
really wanted was a drug that was
effective in people and so we began to

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310
effective in people and so we began to
 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.359
effective in people and so we began to
explore that same drug at the Yerkes

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369
explore that same drug at the Yerkes
 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.570
explore that same drug at the Yerkes
primate center and in those experiments

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580
primate center and in those experiments
 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.180
primate center and in those experiments
we were very disappointed to find that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190
we were very disappointed to find that
 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.789
we were very disappointed to find that
that drug ctla4 IG had had really

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799
that drug ctla4 IG had had really
 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.789
that drug ctla4 IG had had really
minimal effects in preventing transplant

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799
minimal effects in preventing transplant
 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.160
minimal effects in preventing transplant
rejection so that led to an effort to

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170
rejection so that led to an effort to
 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.050
rejection so that led to an effort to
really understand the biology a little

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060
really understand the biology a little
 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.639
really understand the biology a little
bit better and to see if we could come

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649
bit better and to see if we could come
 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.559
bit better and to see if we could come
up with alternatives so again working

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569
up with alternatives so again working
 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.380
up with alternatives so again working
with scientists at bristol-myers peter

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390
with scientists at bristol-myers peter
 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.740
with scientists at bristol-myers peter
linsley and and robert peach we started

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750
linsley and and robert peach we started
 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.380
linsley and and robert peach we started
to understand how effective that bla

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390
to understand how effective that bla
 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.749
to understand how effective that bla
drug was at blocking the immune system

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759
drug was at blocking the immune system
 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.990
drug was at blocking the immune system
did it bind tightly enough to block the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000
did it bind tightly enough to block the
 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.669
did it bind tightly enough to block the
immune system and it turned out in

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679
immune system and it turned out in
 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.919
immune system and it turned out in
retrospect it didn't bind very tightly

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929
retrospect it didn't bind very tightly
 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.740
retrospect it didn't bind very tightly
to the target that it needed to and so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750
to the target that it needed to and so
 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.749
to the target that it needed to and so
an effort was undertaken to see if we

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759
an effort was undertaken to see if we
 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.359
an effort was undertaken to see if we
could introduce mutations or changes in

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369
could introduce mutations or changes in
 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.490
could introduce mutations or changes in
that drug to change its binding

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500
that drug to change its binding
 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.859
that drug to change its binding
characteristics and it turned out one of

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869
characteristics and it turned out one of
 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.199
characteristics and it turned out one of
those called le a 29 y which

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209
those called le a 29 y which
 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.630
those called le a 29 y which
subsequently became Belet acept bound

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640
subsequently became Belet acept bound
 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.240
subsequently became Belet acept bound
much better to its targets and so it's

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250
much better to its targets and so it's
 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.339
much better to its targets and so it's
similar doses it would have 10 times the

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349
similar doses it would have 10 times the
 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.850
similar doses it would have 10 times the
effect in in vitro or test-tube studies

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860
effect in in vitro or test-tube studies
 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.800
effect in in vitro or test-tube studies
and it was that drug that we went back

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810
and it was that drug that we went back
 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.640
and it was that drug that we went back
and tested in the primate and there the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650
and tested in the primate and there the
 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.240
and tested in the primate and there the
effects were much more market and so it

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250
effects were much more market and so it
 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.320
effects were much more market and so it
appeared that it could be an alternative

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330
appeared that it could be an alternative
 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.020
appeared that it could be an alternative
to the cyclosporine class of drugs so

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030
to the cyclosporine class of drugs so
 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.059
to the cyclosporine class of drugs so
Belet a Supt was a second generation

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069
Belet a Supt was a second generation
 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:43.100
Belet a Supt was a second generation
version of ctla-4 IG

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110
 
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.290
 
the cells of the immune system that

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300
the cells of the immune system that
 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.060
the cells of the immune system that
cause rejection are called T cells and

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070
cause rejection are called T cells and
 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.540
cause rejection are called T cells and
they need to get two signals to become

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550
they need to get two signals to become
 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.370
they need to get two signals to become
activated and cause that immune response

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
activated and cause that immune response
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.620
activated and cause that immune response
they need to recognize things as foreign

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630
they need to recognize things as foreign
 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.080
they need to recognize things as foreign
that's the t cell receptor and then they

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090
that's the t cell receptor and then they
 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.600
that's the t cell receptor and then they
also get the second signals which we

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610
also get the second signals which we
 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.360
also get the second signals which we
call co-stimulatory signals if a t-cell

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370
call co-stimulatory signals if a t-cell
 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.150
call co-stimulatory signals if a t-cell
gets both of both of those it'll expand

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160
gets both of both of those it'll expand
 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.480
gets both of both of those it'll expand
divide and attack the the transplant if

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490
divide and attack the the transplant if
 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.670
divide and attack the the transplant if
you deprive the t-cell of those

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680
you deprive the t-cell of those
 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.470
you deprive the t-cell of those
co-stimulatory signals with a

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480
co-stimulatory signals with a
 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.660
co-stimulatory signals with a
co-stimulation blocker that's what Belet

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670
co-stimulation blocker that's what Belet
 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.790
co-stimulation blocker that's what Belet
a Supt is then it'll get the recognition

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800
a Supt is then it'll get the recognition
 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.970
a Supt is then it'll get the recognition
signal but not the second signal or

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980
signal but not the second signal or
 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.650
signal but not the second signal or
co-stimulatory signal and then they

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660
co-stimulatory signal and then they
 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.449
co-stimulatory signal and then they
won't become fully activated in fact

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
won't become fully activated in fact
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.690
won't become fully activated in fact
most of those t-cells will go on to die

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700
most of those t-cells will go on to die
 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.970
most of those t-cells will go on to die
and so that allows us to prevent the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980
and so that allows us to prevent the
 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.500
and so that allows us to prevent the
immune response specifically to the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
immune response specifically to the
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:38.750
immune response specifically to the
transplant
