00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.640
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.263
is come up with a more rigorous
definition for continuity.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.420
And the general idea of continuity,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.980
we've got an intuitive idea of the past,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.660
is that a function is
continuous at a point,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.350
is if you can draw the
graph of that function

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.240
at that point without
picking up your pencil.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.790
So what do we mean by that?

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.730
And this is...

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.520
What I just said is not that rigorous,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.520
or not rigorous at all,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.930
is that well, let's think about
the point right over here.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.690
Let's say that's RC.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.320
If I can draw the graph at that point,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.560
the value of the function at that point

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.390
without picking up my pencil, or my pen,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.430
then it's continuous there.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.770
So I could just start here,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.590
and I don't have to pick up my pencil,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.440
and there you go.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.710
I can go through that point,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.750
so we could say that our
function is continuous there.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750
But if I had a function that looked

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.440
somewhat different that that,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.850
if I had a function that looked like this,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.330
let's say that it is
defined up until then,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.990
and then there's a bit of a jump,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.120
and then it goes like this,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.373
well this would be very hard to draw at...

00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:07.750
This function would be very hard to draw

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.580
going through x equals c
without picking up my pen.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160
Let's see, my pen is touching the screen,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.150
touching the screen, touching the screen.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.530
How do I keep drawing this function

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.060
without picking up my pen?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.540
I would have to pick it up,

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.090
and then move back down here.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.620
And so that is an intuitive sense

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.200
that we are not continuous
in this case right over here.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.330
Well let's actually come up

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.190
with a formal definition for continuity,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.590
and then see if it feels intuitive for us.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.630
So the formal definition of
continuity, let's start here,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.930
we'll start with continuity at a point.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.260
So we could say the
function f is continuous...

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.100
Continuous at x equals c.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.580
If, and only if...

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.470
I'll draw this two-way arrow
to show if, and only if,

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.950
the two-sided limit of f of x,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.880
as x approaches c,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.690
is equal to f of c.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.550
So this seems very technical.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.900
But let's just think
about what it's saying.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.820
It's saying look,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.680
if the limit as we approach c

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.180
from the left and the right of f of x,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.680
if that's actually the
value of our function there,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.750
then we are continuous at that point.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.420
So let's look at three examples.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.270
Let's look at one
example, we are, we're...

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.390
By our picking-up-the-pencil idea,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.460
it feels like we are
continuous at a point.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.190
And then let's think
about a couple of examples

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.270
where it doesn't seem like
we're continuous at a point,

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.460
and see how this more
rigorous definition applies.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.410
So, let's say that my function...

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.680
So let's say this right over here

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.810
is y is equal to f of x.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.260
And, we care about the
behavior right over here

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.390
when x is equal to c.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.280
This is my X-axis, that's my Y-axis.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.100
So we care about the behavior
when x is equal to c.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.010
And so, notice,

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.180
from our first intuitive sense,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.720
I can definitely draw this function

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.110
as we go through x equals c
without picking up my pencil,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.610
so it feels continuous there.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.000
There's no jumps or
discontinuities that we can tell.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.570
It just kind of keeps on going.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.830
It seems all connected, is
one way to think about it.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.960
But let's think about this definition.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.960
Well, the limit as x approaches
c from the left, it is...

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.580
As we approach from the left,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.570
it looks like it is approaching...

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.760
It looks like it is approaching f of c.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.760
So this is the value,
f of c right over here.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.920
And as we approach from the right,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.530
as we approach from the right,

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.410
it also looks like it's
approaching f of c.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.520
And we are defined right at x equals c.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.150
And it is the value
that we are approaching

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.910
from both the left or the right.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.140
So this seems good in this scenario.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.480
So now let's look at some scenarios

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.370
that we would have to pick up the pencil

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.010
as we draw the function through
that point, through that...

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.998
Through that...

00:04:11.998 --> 00:04:14.840
When x is equal to c.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.933
So let's look at a scenario.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.830
Let's look at a scenario where we have

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.870
what's often called a point discontinuity,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.000
although you don't have
to know at this point,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.540
no pun intended, the
formal terminology for it.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.970
So let's say we have a function that...

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.737
Let's see, this is c.

00:04:32.737 --> 00:04:35.690
Now let's say our function
looks something...

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.500
Something like this.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.260
So we go like this,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.630
and at c let's say it's equal to that.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.660
So, f of c is right over here.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.610
F of c would be that value.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.300
But what's the limit as x approaches c?

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.020
So the limit as x approaches c,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.610
this would be a two-sided limit of f of x.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.270
Well, this is, as we
approach from the left,

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.860
it looks like we are approaching
this value right over here.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.890
And from the right,

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.460
it looks like we are
approaching that same value.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.073
And so, we could call that L.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.960
And L is different than f of c.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.740
And so, in this case, by
our formal definition,

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.350
we will not be continuous at, for...

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.930
F will not be continuous for x is equal...

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.530
Or at the point x...

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.780
Or when x is equal to c.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.770
And you can see that there.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.160
If we try to draw this, okay,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.380
my pencil is touching the paper,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.080
touching the paper, touching the paper.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.740
Uh oh, if I needed to keep
drawing this function,

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.200
I'd have to pick up my
pencil, move it over here,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.730
then pick it up again and
then jump right back down.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.580
And but this rigorous definition

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.720
is giving us the same conclusion.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.160
The limit as we approach x equals c

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.370
from the left and the right,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.640
it's a different value than f of c.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.340
And so, this is not continuous.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.900
Not...

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.203
Not continuous.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.140
And let's think about another scenario.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.370
Let's think about a scenario...

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.810
And actually, maybe let's
think about a scenario

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.980
where the limit...

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.600
The two-sided limit doesn't even exist.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.830
So, there are my axes, x and y.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.670
And let's say it's doing
something like this.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.560
Let's say it's doing something like this,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.490
and that it does something
like this and goes like that.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.190
And let's say that this
right over here is our c.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.183
And so let's see, this is
f of c right over here.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.740
That is...

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.290
Lemme draw a little bit neater.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.010
That is f of c.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.220
And it does look like the limit,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.500
as x approaches c from the left,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.130
so from values less than c,

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.483
it does look like that
is approaching f of c.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.360
But if we look at the limit

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.310
as x approaches c from the right,

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.130
that looks like it's
approaching some other value.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.240
That looks like it's approaching
this value right over here,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.370
let's call it L.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.370
That's approaching L,

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.270
and L does not equal f of c.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.430
And so in this situation,

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.370
the two-sided limit doesn't even exist.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.410
We're approaching two different values

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.500
when we approach from the
left and from the right.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.510
And since so the limit
doesn't even exist at c,

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.890
this is definitely not
going to be continuous.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.370
And this matches up to our expectations

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.820
with our little
do-we-have-to-pick-up-the-pencil test.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.880
If I have to draw this,
I can leave my pencil,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.150
it's on the paper, it's on the paper,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.590
it's on the paper, it's on the paper.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.610
How am I going to continue
to draw this function,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.500
this graph of the function,
without picking up my pencil?

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.737
Pick it up, put it back down,
and then keep drawing it.

00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:42.737
And so once again, this right
over here is not continuous.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.920
Both intuitively, by our
pick-up-the-pencil definition,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.310
and also by this more
rigorous definition where,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.510
in this case the limit,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.240
the two-sided limit at x
equals c doesn't even exist,

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.920
so we're definitely not
gonna be continuous.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.570
But even when the
two-sided limit does exist,

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.010
but the limit is a different value

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.190
than the value of the function,

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.020
that will also not be continuous.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.340
The only situation that
it's going to be continuous

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.300
is if the two-sided limit
approaches the same value

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.640
as the value of the function.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.310
And if that's true, then we're continuous.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.610
If we're continuous,
that is going to be true.
