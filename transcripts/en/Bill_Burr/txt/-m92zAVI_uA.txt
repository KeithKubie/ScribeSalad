Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? And spilled burn is time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and Jess jacket.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Yay.

Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Do you, how was your week going? Is it going well? I am in gloomy, rainy, Vancouver, British Columbia home with the BC lions, the Vancouver Canucks and no fucking Westminster dog show know there's someplace out here at Westminster. And I learned today that they do have a big dog show up here, but I don't think they are one in the same. I can't remember if Westminster takes place in Beverly Hills or in New York City, but all I know is that you have to be a particular level white person to be invited. I learned that because I thought I was white enough, you know, and they were like, uh Oh no, you are not. And uh, my dream of attending it was over. Um, I just think it's funny. I like dogs. And then it's just funny when they get them all like, you know, oh, shampooed up and they're prancing around, you know, and I don't know, there's always like that thought of what if the owner false just adds to the tension, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:01:25       Um, anyways, I'm up here in Vancouver. I'm having a great time. Uh, this past weekend I went to a wedding, uh, awesome wedding, tremendous wedding. Two people that should be getting married. They totally had the connection. Is there anything worse unless you just really into shine Freud. Um, when you go to a wedding and you just see two people and you're like, this fucking thing is not going to last the weekend I've been to two of those and one of them, the marriage lasted two years maybe. And then the other one, as far as I know, they're still together. Um, the first weird wedding that I went to, I think the bride was having second thoughts because the groom was standing up there forever

Speaker 1:          00:02:14       and then she just showed a, walked down the hall, walked on down the hall, right. Walk down the aisle was there dad and did not have that look that, you know, somebody usually has on their wedding day. Um, and then when she went up to the altar the whole time they were doing the vows, she was laughing uncontrollably. Um, which, you know, sometimes it's just a form of nervousness, but, uh, they didn't even kiss. And as they walked out, they went ahead and kiss. But uh, as far as I know, they're still together. And then another one was, uh, someone I was in business with when I first got in to New York City and I went to this person's wedding and I remember we went out there and, uh, the mother-in-law we got there like what was traffic when we got there right before the wedding was going to start, it was in the backyard of these rich people's, uh, state, right?

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       This guy married into money and he wasn't rich, so I think they didn't like him. So she was, we pulled up, she was outside walking the dog dressed the way you would walk a dog. Like she wasn't really even ready. It was like sort of this nonverbal protest of what was going on in there and uh, that seemed weird. I was like, wow. You know, the inlaws usually never liked the fucking person that daughter's marrying. They never think that he's good enough. Right. So it didn't really, you know, it wasn't much of a red flag. But then I just remembered when, uh, the groom apps to where they got married, he went to, uh, give a toast as to why he loved his wife and it was fucking brutal. He was like, uh, she, cause she gave some big toast to him. So then he goes, okay, uh, and Dan to you, my lovely wife, you, uh, you, you, you make me laugh.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       Uh, where the background like lighter your life reason you get up in the morning, like trying to help him out. It was one of those things where everyone was smiling like this is going to be great. And then it just became like, everyone just started looking down, going to wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up. And that one lasted like two years and it was such a fucked up marriage. I remember him telling me that they just had this big fight and they were both kind of exhausted and one of them was just kind of like, what are we doing? And the other one who was his psych, yeah, do you like not want to do this anymore? And the other one was like, no. And then the other one was like, really? Because I don't either. And then they started laughing like a bad fucking movie and they had a really amiable divorce. And I think he was cool. He didn't try to take any of her fucking money and they just went their separate ways.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       Having said that, this wedding that I went to, I always have that in the back of my head because as much as I like to do standup, I don't literally like to be living in a bit when I'm at a wedding, you know? Um, I don't know. I just saw them interacting right before the wedding and you know, it's super stressful if you've ever gotten married and they just seem chill and relaxed. So it was like, oh good, good. Um, what was funny about this wedding was there was also another bulb, ginger at the wedding with a red beard, like my doppelganger. And um, I went there and I had a drink and then I had another drink and then I was just like, Eh, you know, that's good. I'm going to stop there. And I started drinking water. Now on the other hand, the other guy was acting like me last year.

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       Well before I took four months off for drinking and this fucking guy got fucking loaded, right? So I saw it was kind of swaying in the breeze and I'm like, Ugh, you know, Ben there, I'm not going to judge. He's having a good time, whatever. Right? So the fucking guy, next thing I know, I'm looking outside and this guy, like this wedding was so perfect, was in this really cool restaurant and slash bar and so up front was the bar and they had these ceiling to floor windows and the evil version of me at some point staggered outside and I just felt everybody looking and they looked and he just fucking puked in the street in front of like a third of the wedding was up at the bar, like a giant puddle of fucking puke. So all his friends rush outside and their fucking suits to help about, and somebody brought a chair out.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       Oh, they sit the guy down and I'm not laughing at the guy, I'm just laughing cause I've been there. I mean, not in a fucking, not have at all wedding that I was just that looking at me. But you know, we've all had our moments. I remember one time I was somewhere down the Cape Fucking Cape Cod joke, best fucking potato chips. Um, I somehow passed out on a bluff that was headed down towards the ocean. I was just like the middle of the day and uh, I forget where my buddy was. He was the one driving, he was somewhere else. It came home, something happen with the car. Um, and we were just passed out on like the fucking, this, it was a bluff. Why I just like saying that word. I've never used it properly. And all of a sudden I was laying there, the son felt good and everything. I was passed out and like it felt like a day later, all of a sudden they just here and out there. That is where the Nina, the Pinta and it fit that in his Santa Maria came in back in 14 fucking blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then I had this little kid's voice go, Mommy, why is that guy sleeping there? And there was like some sort of fucking tore going on and a, I vaguely remember changing a tire and I didn't put the Jack Underneath the frame and it went and like writing through the floorboard.

Speaker 1:          00:08:38       So there you go. All right. I'm not judging this guy, but it was funny as fucking hell. So this fucking guy fucking just, you know, Great Lakes Yak, you know, puke all over the streets. If somebody brings a chair out and they sit him down and he's sitting at hanging his head like, you know, Jordan was sitting when he had the flu and they put the towel over his head. He was sitting like that minus the towel over his head. So then they start calling like an Uber or Lyft and these cars keep pulling up and they pull up to this bald dude with the red beard sitting with his head hanging down in a giant puddle of puke. And everybody would just pull out and be like, yeah, it's fucking, guy's not getting my car. They would drive away. And, uh, it just became this thing like, do you got to move them down the street?

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       You got to get them away from the puke. And Anyway, somebody finally came along and took him home. But, uh, he was definitely the highlight of the evening. So, uh, I want to, I don't know who that guy was, but I want to thank him for the, uh, the free entertainment. So anyways, let's get back on track here. I'm up here in our Vancouver and uh, as I mentioned before, I don't know if I mentioned, uh, I was talking to a number of people up here that listen to this podcast, that fly helicopters and one of them had access to the, uh, Cabri g two. I hope I'm saying that right cabaret or is it Cabrini? I think it's Cabri g two, which is basically like the Robinson r 22 that I fly at. But it has, you know, any safety issues that the Robinson may or may not have, you know, that it does have, I'm just not trying to shit on it because I fly it all the time and I do like that helicopter.

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       These people took it to the next level. It's like the next iPhone, except it didn't try to like, you know, capture your fucking face. Um, it was new and improved, so I wanted to try this thing out and um, these people had access to it. So I was going to rent a car today and his drive about an hour outside of Vancouver. Um, but then I got a text from the guy who was going to fly with today. There's a guy here, he's a big fan of yours. He's got a fucking, he's got a 66, we'll pick you up right at the heliport downtown. I was like, fuck it, let's do it. So I show up, this dude named Chris, I want to thank him. Great guy picked me up to tell me all the way out there. And I was telling him, he goes, so how did you get into one of the fly?

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       Uh, the Cabri g two? And I was like, well, you know, I read all about, you know, the low, Geez, you know, situations, the mass bumping. I got a little freaked out. Vietnam helicopter pilots. I just kind of feel like it's a bit of a safety issue and they just sort of taught pilots how to fly out of it rather than fix it. But what the fuck do I know? I only have 160 hours. Right? But that was just my gut feeling. So I want to check this thing out, see what the deals with this thing. So we land at the airport and as we land, one of those Cabri g twos is coming in. And I immediately loved it. I loved the shape of it. And when it landed, seeing this little two seater with the fully articulated main rotor system was like, I mean that's, that's been the dream.

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       Um, you know, cause with the our 22 you've got to lead with the, a collective with, with those things, you can just push the stick forward, which, uh, it's still, whenever I something like that, when the guy just goes, okay, no, sit forward. I always have to make the joke that, you know, I usually don't hear that, you know, flying a Robinson. So anyways, um, the thing lands and as it lands, I see this guy getting out who looks just like the dude that I saw on the youtube video and it's like that the guy who uploaded the video video that did the whole, the whole thing from nose to tail review of it, he goes, yeah, that's him. And it was so surreal because I didn't know I was going to meet this guy. It was like literally the guy that was the reason that I wanted to fly it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:27       I ended up not only going to his place, I ended up getting a fly with them. Uh, it's BC helicopters and the guy's name is Misha Gilb and he was incredible pilot. He did an auto rotation at the end that was just was unreal for those of you who fly Robinson's, there's no watching your rpms going too high, too low. It's just he just put the collective down and steer it and he landed this thing like, like, like a fucking daisy. It was incredible. And um, so anyways, he, he was filming the entire time that we will outline and um, I was flying horribly. I could barely even, I couldn't even hold a hover in the thing because the main road had turned the exact opposite way. And as much as I told myself, ignore your muscle memory, just, Oh, you know, correct. Whichever way the nose is going. And it was also super sensitive. It felt like the sports suspension on a car, like a sports car, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:13:23       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       Where it was so hypersensitive that I just kept over correcting. And then it was, it took me back to when I had like under 10 hours flying and was just the first time trying to hold a hover. But, uh, of course, by the end I got way better than where I was at, but by then his GoPro had ran out. So you can guys can have a fun time laughing at me flying this thing like a fucking salmon going up seats upstream. It was pretty bad in the beginning, but, um, I really, really loved it and I got to fly up.

Speaker 3:          00:13:55       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       You know, I mean it was definitely a cloudy day and everything, but I thought it was kind of cool that it was raining out and all that just to fly in something different and um, got to go all along the, uh, the whole skyline of Vancouver, all the way up to where all these rich people live and shit. And then, uh, we flew back and on the way back we flew up this river bed, which I hope he keeps that footage. That's one of the coolest things I ever did.

Speaker 3:          00:14:22       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:23       I felt like I was on like the discovery channel. Like I should have been chasing a bunch of gazelles or something or watching hippos, you know, fighting alligators to something out on the Serengeti. It was amazing. And, um, we ended up landing off airport up there. We landed off airport and uh, just some farmer's yard. And that's when I was just like, I had it. The thing was all over the place when I was flying. Um, but anyways, just want to thank everybody at BC helicopters eyes. I had such a great time and I will definitely be back. And uh, for those of you who do fly, if you get a chance to check out one of those Cabri g two is a pretty fucking amazing. Um, and uh, and that's it. And then I got two more shows tonight at the Queen Elizabeth Theater here and um, and then I immediately go back to go hang with the family because that's the new me, right?

Speaker 1:          00:15:16       I fly in the day of the Gig and then I do the Gig the next day. And then I immediately leave cause uh, I got my, you know, my lovely wife and my daughter, I gotta I gotta get home too. So fun. Now if I only leave for like two days, I don't have that much guilt where you feel like an absent absentee father, you know. Um, so anyways, um, what time do we got here?

Also do a voice on the wonderful cartoon. F is for family. Allison Janney who did the voice of our misses plasta where, uh, she won an Oscar for the Tonya Harding movie. And then Sam Rockwell who does the voice of a Frank's number six, even though he does, he's not even aware that he's this nemesis. Vic Reynolds one for three billboards. Um, so that's pretty cool. You know, I think that upped the ante of our show.

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       The status anyways too. I know, I'm throwing that in. Who Does your show? Who Do you do your show with? O two Oscar winners. Allison Janney and Sam Rockwell. Right. Laura dern, Justin Long. Dave Kouchner. I'm hearing I can go on forever. Um, by the way, I'm really loving the, I don't want to jinx it, but this season three, I know I'm teasing it early, but, uh, we've been laughing our asses off in the, uh, the edit room. But I got to tell you yesterday I came in landed and I was really tired because uh, I did a show the night before to, uh, for Hsas show down at the Improv and I had a beer or two after at the end of the, um, at the end of the show and he didn't get home til like, you know, one in the morning or something like that. And then my daughter, my daughter gets up at like a quarter to six, six o'clock. It's hilarious.

Speaker 4:          00:19:00       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       it just come downstairs. He can't, you know, in that this point, like the reason why I drink so little now is now I don't know what happened. Like if I have like, like one beer or two beers, like the next day,

Speaker 4:          00:19:12       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       my daughter wakes me up and it's just like, I feel it some waking up just not like hung over, but it just feeling like less energized

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       and you know, she's talking all this jibberish out there and I just opened the door and the second I opened the door she just goes, hi. I don't know if I told you is like high as her words for everything. High means high, high means I want that. Or if she wants attention, she does like this frantic like hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Like if she sees two people talking and she wants to be, it's a really like her being like, hey, hey, hey, hey, little help over here. Um, I want to get out of this fucking chair. So, um, anyways, so I didn't get a lot of sleep and then I had to go to the airport and then I flew up. And whenever you fly in the plane this way, it's always like everybody wants to sleep except for that one person who has the window open and then I can't fall asleep. So I get to the hotel and I'm like, all right, I'm just going to lay down here for like a half an hour. And I had south park on speaking of, you know, animated shows, just total next level. Absolutely fucking hilarious. And I was watching this episode where Cartman had stolen a bunch of votes

Speaker 1:          00:20:32       and, uh, I still, I fell asleep and I woke up a little later on. I opened my eyes and South Park was still on. I didn't realize that they had a marathon going on, like they did like three or four episodes in a row. Long story short, my pickup for the seven o'clock show is at six 20 and I am asleep and all of a sudden the phone rings super loud in my room and I opened my eyes is pitch black in the room and I was like, oh fuck. And I was trying to find my way out and I couldn't, I literally opened the door that went into a closet and then verse, he called me and I saw it was six 30.

Speaker 4:          00:21:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:09       And I literally just threw my clothes on, didn't even iron my shirt, got to the venue, sipped a little stroke Coty and went out on stage. Had a great set though, but I was like really? A, it was weird. I was like,

Speaker 1:          00:21:26       I wasn't tired cause I slept for like three hours. So I felt refreshed, but I also felt like I just woke up. So, um, I dunno if the first 10 minutes the show felt like an outer body experience, but, uh, I've never slept like, like that close up until like almost like missing a show or something like that. But, uh, fortunately, uh, you know, it went well. I don't know. I kind of went nowhere, you know, I almost missed my show, but I didn't. And then the show went well, like, did I really need to fucking tell you all of that? Was there a reason for that? I apologize that this recording sucks. I bought at an external mic for my iPhone that, uh, Kevin shake the hilarious Kevin Shay who came on my show. That's right. It came on the Monday morning podcast, promoted his special and told me all about this.

Speaker 1:          00:22:16       Mike going, I love this fucking microphone. I'm gonna have to talk to him about it cause I ordered it off the Internet there, the inner web. And, uh, it was only 20 bucks. I'm like, how the fuck is the microphone that only cost $20 is going to be good. And guess what? It isn't. It fucking sucks. So I must be using it wrong. Cause Kevin Shades is smart guy so he's got to teach me how to use the fucking thing cause it sounds worse than if I just hold the phone up like I am right now. If that makes any sense.

Speaker 4:          00:22:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:44       But anyways, I, oh my God, I have to tell you this fucking stupid tee shirt that I saw and there was like some corporation up here, you know, selling clothes. One of those.

Speaker 4:          00:22:52       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:22:53       well I'm one of those fucking close the place. And on the mannequins they have all these fucking political tee shirts about equal pay for women. And it says like enough is enough and something about a quality and all that. And it's just like I just can't like these fucking assholes. It's like you were, the guy's not fucking paying people. Like why am I getting a fucking leg? My voice cracking it. What the fuck are you, how do you get off selling those fucking shirts? I don't understand why these feminist groups don't go in there and be like, okay, you're selling enough is enough. T shirts, uh, why you sell and let's look into your fucking history of paying people.

Speaker 4:          00:23:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:37       That's like this new, this new fucking thing. What it is, is that a new thing? This is what people always do when a movement happens and they get freaked out by what they eventually do is they join it and once they join it, they have like a level of control or they could just act like they fucking agree with it. So then like you don't, nobody's looking at you like you're a problem. You basically, you just sort of send it down the line like, no problem. Here, look, we have a, I'm not this enough t shirts. Um, I actually have an uh, an enough is enough thing, uh, enough is enough as far as just going after what guys do to women. How about we balanced it out, you know, and so on. All this shit that fucking women through to guys, you know, ah, that'll never happen.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       Ah, you can't do that. If you do that, then you're a fucking sexist. We're going to fix the male female dynamic by only examining the behavior of men, because those ladies are perfect. I would love to know what sweatshop makes those enough is enough. T shirts, what do fuck is Michael Moore urban lately? We'll actually, it's a tee shirt sold here in Canada and God knows he blows everybody north of fucking Minnesota. He just thinks that they, you know, like every like Canada can do no wrong despite the fact it's one of the most overtly racist places I've ever been to, um, the entire country. You know what I mean? But all you gotta do is put on a silly hat and take some syrup out of a fucking tree. And then Michael Moore's just like, oh my God, these people are amazing. Um, oh, pill. Why would you do that?

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       Why, why, why would you have such a nice friendly podcast? And then, you know, just have to pick on, you know, punch up bill, why can't you punch up? So what I've learned here about Vancouver, uh, other than it's, it's beautiful and that they like, they like buildings that look like the buildings that Godzilla steps on. I've noticed that, um, there's a lot of, a lot of money from China here, you know, I don't know what the fuck happened in China, but some sort of crackdown happened and there was a bunch of rich Chinese people where they were just like, oh fuck, we gotta get our money out of this country. And they started buying up property along sunset strip bunch of places in the United States and evidently here in Vancouver and I gotta, I gotta commend

Speaker 3:          00:26:01       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       Chinese people with money. Those people know where to fucking buy. You know, although I think Vancouver's smarter than La with the global warming, without, you know, it's lush land up here with all the water, you know, lakes and everything. It's absolutely beautiful.

Speaker 3:          00:26:19       Um, I dunno,

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       that must be incredible to leave China and come to Vancouver. We can actually have space, but then it'd be weird because you'd miss, you know, you'd miss your country. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:26:31       But, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:26:33       I know just haven't been over there how crowded it is and how dirty the air is. It's got to be fucking incredible because I think it's incredible just coming up from la you. Um, and it was like a fucking zillion people. All these people coming out here login, that Goddamn skis skiing is fucking incredible. But I gotta tell you literally have to be like your own Roadie, you know? And there was all these people like, you know, you got to go snowboard man. You can just have that like a backpack. Just throw it over your fucking shoulders. Right. It seems to be like I was just sort of analyzing it, like skiing scares the shit out of me cause it's like every year is some fucking guy around my age, jubilee, people my age, you know, late forties, early fifties. And they just come down a trail and they hit a tree and then that's just fucking it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:24       But the last time I skied, I was in Utah and, uh, doing a gig out there and the comedian I was working with wanted to go skiing. So we went, I fucking dislocated my thumb and like nine times I thought I was going to blow out my niece and I vowed I would never go again. And if I did, I would go snowboarding. I would much rather deal with a broken tailbone or fucked up risks than a blown out knee. Um, you know, in my, if my advanced age. Um, so anyways, I am going to go over to the venue right now because, uh, they allegedly, they got a drum kit backstage at that place. So I think I'm gonna go over there and go jam man and some fucking tunes. Good, clean fun. And then I'm going to do my two shows and listen to this.

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       I come home, I go to bed and then I have to get up at four in the morning because I have to call. Uh, I got a call back east cause I got a big show coming up in Boston and I got to sell a bunch of tickets. So, and they want me to come on the radio live. And uh, so that's going to be my day. So I'm gonna wake up at four in the fucking morning, do that shit, and then go to the goddamn report and then come home. And my daughter's going to be like, fucking bouncing off the walls ready to play. But you know what? It's going to be great. You know what's cool is she, uh, we have this doorway to our house where it's got like, you know, you got the door and then along both sides that has like these, those old fashioned like little windows that go from the top all the way down to the bottom.

Speaker 1:          00:28:57       So, uh, it's the greatest thing ever when you'd come home, cause she's looking through smiling at yet. But it's the worst when you leave, you know, cause she has like the saddest look on her face because now she actually understands when you're leaving. So, um, and I got a feeling it's only gonna get worse. I just don't want to get to the point where it's like, I'm never want to be the point where I leave so much that it's no big deal. You know, like I remember long time ago, Danny Gans, the late Danny Gans told a story of how we ended up in Vegas is his kid drew a family portrait and it was the mother and all the kids. And then he goes, oh, that's great. Where's Daddy? And then she pointed and she had drawn an airplane and he was on the airplane flying away.

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       It was like, oh, fuck. Um, but what am I going to deal? This is what the fuck I do for a living. Uh, we also announced some dates over, uh, two dates, um, one in Dublin and one in, uh, London. And I know I got some shit from people. Why don't you come here? Why don't you come there? I'm going to do more of an extensive tour through Europe. Uh, at some point I just have to figure out, I got a balanced my new life here with the waste and kid, um, by definitely want to get to places that had been before in places that I've never been a, I just had to figure out how to do it. But when I go to, um, that Dublin in London Gig, that's, that's the week of my 50th birthday. So I'm doing Dublin, uh, first and then I'm doing Royal Albert Hall, which is insane.

Speaker 1:          00:30:33       Then I'm going to be there. I can't believe it. And that's going to be for my 50th birthday. And uh, then I'm taking a week off and I ain't going with, you know, my wife and kid and everything and that's how I'm going to celebrate. I'm turning 50, man. What the fuck? So I don't know. Most, a lot of my friends didn't make it this far, so I'm not going to bitch about it, but if it's a big number. Okay. Hey, that's some rough one. All right. All right, well that's the podcast. Thank you guys for listening. Thank you everybody up here in Vancouver, they came up to the show last night and are coming tonight. Amazing crowd last night and I think it's going to be more of the same tonight. Have a great weekend yet cunts and I'll talk to you on that.

Speaker 4:          00:31:54       [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:32:05       hey, what's up everybody? It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast from Monday, March the eighth 2010 Oh my God. Could you believe the Oscars last night? I can't believe that Kelly Wigan and faith didn't get best supporting cont for a let's make a fucking Afghan in the 18 hundreds do you know I'm actually still in San Jose right now and I was supposed to have a show tonight. I'm actually recording this on Sunday. I was supposed to have a show tonight, but it got, because everybody evidently is watching the fucking Oscars. I can understand if you're abroad and you want to watch that shit, I get it. That's like your Superbowl. We get to sit there and watch the different dresses in which couple is with which couple and who just broke up and are they there with their new boyfriend or girlfriend and oh my God.

Speaker 5:          00:33:02       Did they ignore each other on the red carpet and look at some fucking twats Yank back face as she talks about their shoes. I get that. But where the fuck were the men and San Jose who I, we had enough fucking balls left and their relationship to be like, you know what? I'm not going to your stupid fucking Oscar party. Okay. Cause I don't want to listen to fucking 98 different reads of Oh my God. You know. Oh my God, why is he wearing that chest? Oh my God, she looks so beautiful. Oh my God. That was like the best speech Aba. Huh? Is that what you did? He's sitting in a cubicle right now as a man. Is that what you did last night? Cause if he did, he should be hanging in your fucking head. Huh? What happened? Let's go down memory lane. Okay, go all the way back to high school when you're still at a set of balls between your fucking legs.

Speaker 5:          00:33:52       Remember that they were brand new and they were ready to go. I've got a question for you. Where the fuck did they go? Cause you different, you definitely didn't have them. Men of San Jose because you weren't at my fucking show last night to the point it had to be canceled. Granted, I'm not going to lie. About a fucking month and a half ago, a married couple came out of a bar, got into with the Bouncer, cops showed up and he fucking tased the dude's wife and shot the guy in the abdomen. And the dude damn near bled out right in front of the Improv here. Look it up online. They got the picture. You know, after there's a shooting, they clean up the mess. There's always the fucking old ketchup stains on the sidewalk and a couple of articles of clothing and it's fucking hilarious. And then right, right next to it they had the marquee and it still said Eddie Griffin.

Speaker 5:          00:34:44       It was funny. So yeah, I guess that isn't good for fucking business. But, um, I gotta tell you, man, I had a great time coming up here and I've avoided coming to San Jose because I was worried that, uh, basically what happened Sunday night, I thought it was going to happen all week because I don't know what is about California. I just feel like if you're not, if you're not a fucking Latino comic, you know, I just don't or are super famous. You're not gonna sell any tickets out here. Cause you know, people put that in my head. Um, but no, a lot of people came out on a Saturday night and they actually had a balcony. That was the thing about on Friday, nobody showed up. Right. So there I am. I'm standing in this huge fucking theater in the entire upper deck is empty. I felt like I was performing at a fucking royals game.

Speaker 5:          00:35:31       You know, I felt like I should've been like singing the national anthem or something like that and then yelling at my manager wondering what happened to my fucking music career that I couldn't at least sing it like an angel's game. All those fucking idiots gotta come out there with their, they have their deck, goddamn noise makers. How lame are you, his fans that the ownership is basically saying, you know what? You guys have such a lack of passion. We need them. We need to, to invent something to make it sound like you guys care way more than you really do here. Here's a couple inflatable fucking plastic balloons. Just slam them together. We'll even get a monkey. I have a crazy monkey out there. Fucking angels.

Speaker 5:          00:36:16       Um, anyways, what am I doing here? What the fuck am I talking about? Um, I actually, I had a great weekend and uh, believe it or not, you wouldn't know it from my voice and I found a great Sushi place out here at checkout. Smile. Susi Sushi. If you get a chance to, I don't know where the fuck it is, but you have the Internet, right? Let me, I'm fucking walking around right now. I'm looking out the window. They got a museum across the street and they have a star trek exhibition. And you should have seen these fucking nerds. You should have seen these fucking nerds just, just, just standing outside, like waiting for a museum to open. That's when you know you're a fucking nerd. Okay. Everybody's gone to museum. But who the fuck has ever stood outside of museum with your face pressed against the glass, waiting for the fucking thing to open up. You know, Jesus cry. I mean, I I see back in the day you're what? You're waiting for fucking concert tickets. You know what I mean? Back in the day when they used to have like actually have record stores and the artists would come through and you'd be standing outside strawberries records and tapes, you know, waiting to have your cassette signed by Brian Adams.

Speaker 5:          00:37:27       What did I pick? Bryan Adams. I'll tell you why. Because I am staying at a very nice hotel as I've made it to that level in this business. All right. I am on the 14th floor, the Penthouse fucking level. Although I just have a suite. I haven't gotten to that level yet and I'm looking out the barren fucking landscape here as far as people go. Anyways. Um, but anyways, I went down to the fucking place to have breakfast in the second I walked in. Right. All I see is his cloth napkins in leather bound menus. So right there, you know, it's going to be like 58 bucks for an Omelette. So all I want to do is stop and turn around and get the fuck out of the place. But do I, of course I don't. You know why? Because there's so few people in there that everybody looked at me when I came in and it reminded me of this time when I went to this titty bar in Troy, New York, I believe it was Troy, New York was called the cloud night and he perverts out there.

Speaker 5:          00:38:22       You know what the fuck I'm talking about. It's not really, it's sort of a strip club, sort of a guy's house. I would have to describe it as, I just remember there was an upstairs when he came walking in that literally look like some old lady should it down in her house coat and just be like, all right, can you, can you stop all that strapping? I'm trying to sleep. Um, and then some sort of double wide trailer that's sold videos that was attached to the other side of it. But anyways, long story short, I went in there with two other people who will remain nameless, cause I don't name names in the fucking podcast because I'm old school. Um, so I can't even fucking remember who they are. Anyways, I've talked to my cell phone so fucking much. So anyways, I walk into the goddamn place, we all walk in and the second we walk in, all we want to do is turn around and walk out.

Speaker 5:          00:39:06       But there's so few fucking people in there. Everybody's looking at us, the dancer, the fucking Dj, the fucking, uh, porky guy who runs the goddamn place and the two fucking, uh, immigrant truckers who was sitting in there, I believe they will Yugoslavian. I can't remember what. So, you know, you just fucking go in and sit down. So I went in and I sat down at this fucking breakfast place. I'm back to the breakfast place or I try to keep up. I'm playing these fucking brain games on the Internet. All right. My fucking brain is sharp. It's coming back. Um, got, I'm lonely. Anyways. Um, so I sit down at this fucking breakfast place and uh, there's this a medium size woman who suffers from vocal fry. And for those of you who didn't major in communications and didn't have to take a career speech class, vocal fry is basically, uh, a way of speaking where you're not, you're not forcing enough air through your vocal chords.

Speaker 5:          00:40:02       So you start your talk like this. Have you ever, you ever heard people talk like that? Oh my God, I was up at Amy's house the other day and I just felt like she was giving me this vibe. Or you have the other people who start off where they, they, they, they, they, they push enough air through their vocal cords, but then towards the end they, they, they taper off. Today everyone, we're going to be reading about a lady who, yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Bababa mad at that fucking drives you nuts. And never used to bug me until I took a class on it. Now I can't stop hearing. So this fucking idiot is sitting there talking like the typical, like, I dunno, she sounded very intelligent, but all she was talking about was like us magazine Shit. And meanwhile I was listening to a instrumental of a Brian Adams song over the fucking radio, you know, and Brian and his first came out and he had the Fonzi leather jacket.

Speaker 5:          00:41:01       Right. And you're like, wow, this guy's good. He's got some decent tunes, you know. Got My first meal, 60, remember that? And when he was so young, you thought that that actually rocked, but it wasn't bad for pub. And then he just fucking jumped the shark where it's just like, you know what? I can't fucking do this anymore. My face is breaking out. I can't fucking do it anymore. I'm just going to sell out. I want to write a song for chicks. Richard Marx can do it. So can I, and then he had that song. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:41:29       Okay. [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          00:41:35       it up. [inaudible] that song I chair. Yeah, that stupid fucking song. They used to make receptionist tear up all across this country when it would come on and a dental office. Um, they had an instrumental version of that going on as I ate my fucking scrambled eggs and listen to this fat fuck. Talk about little house on the prairie with vocal fry. So that was probably the low point of the weekend. Um, I don't even know what I'm talking about. You know what I did want to hype. I want it to hype. Jesus Christ. That was only 10 minutes. There's no fucking way I'm making this one. This one's going to be short and sweet everybody or shortened mediocre, however you want to fucking call it. Let's hit the refresh. Pray page. Let's see how the Bruins and the penguins are doing. Bruins need to win this one.

Speaker 5:          00:42:24       Got To make sure we make the playoffs so we can fucking lose in the first round. Still one to one. After two periods, two friends of mine, Billy Gardell and Randy Bowman or Bauman are at the, uh, at the penguins game right now. Randy Bowman from a Jim and Randy showed WTV in Pittsburgh. Have a fucking listen. They're sitting there talking shit, texting me, talking shit. You know, right before the game about how the penguins were going to kill the Bruins. You know, we're having an off year and lo and behold, you know, an hour goes by, there's no shit talking. So I go on the Internet and there it is zero zero after the first fucking period fucking asshole penguin. So you know, Harry sending of the Bruins was actually debating suing the Pittsburgh Penguins when they switched to black and gold for stealing the Bruins colors. You know, I'm going to pause here and let the people in Pittsburgh exhale

Speaker 7:          00:43:16       be like, hey, look at Pittsburgh Steelers. You tried to do too.

Speaker 5:          00:43:19       Ruins had been around since before the fucking stealers and the Steelers back in the day used to basically have yellow uniforms. They're that big stupid yellow helmet. That's what they had. All right. And the only black you had was a couple of little stripes. That's all it was back then. When you play the old 23 skidoo the long, I say the long pass when you were doing that shit. So I don't want to hear it. Um, and plus, you know what I mean? Who, who fuck takes the exact same colors as another team in the same league. Okay. You started off with your gay little baby blue fucking penguin. You know, first of all your penguins. Why am I talking? Shit, I'm going to get hit with the obvious one was the last time. You guys want a cup 19 here. We need to then shut the fuck up bill. Fine. I will. All right. You just keep joy. That fucking whiny pussy. He's not a pussy, but have you ever seen, I haven't seen anybody wine the way Cindy Crosby wine since fucking, he's like Danny Ainge on skates pow, pow goes, saw played fucking hockey and was a good looking guy with full ruby red lips from Nova Scotia.

Speaker 5:          00:44:28       All right, so whatever, let's hit refresh again. Do at least make the end of the fucking period here. Come on. Berlin's. There we go. The end of two. One to one. What do you guys say now they have Billy Gardell fucking cock sucker. All right. Um, what was I trying to say here? Um, oh, I know I wanted to hype is, uh, one of the fans here on the podcast who will also remain nameless, um, has started a fan page for the Monday morning podcast. Okay. So I'm actually going to the next level with this podcast. Um, a lot of times I make references and uh, you know, people, you know, don't have time to look them up or maybe you don't want to go all over the internet trying to figure out what the fuck I'm talking about. This guy has a bunch of uh, you know, has links to some of the references.

Speaker 5:          00:45:15       He, you know, does all that Photoshop stuff. He does all that computer stuff that I don't know how to describe. But basically if you'd like to check it out at the end of the podcast or maybe follow along, you can go to a page called www.themmpodcast.com www.themmpodcast.com. No spaces. Okay. And now you go, I'm hyping that for the week. Um, see, this is why I don't hype Shit. Now I just, whatever flow I just fucking head is out the goddamn window. What else did I do here? You know what I like about San Jose is it is actually a hockey town. Like I'm in my hotel, they have the NHL Channel and I was sitting there watching hockey night in Canada, which is Saturday night. Um, and I, what the fuck was I watching? I was watching Toronto verus Ottawa and a that had to go do my show. But coming up they had a, the La kings verse to Canadians with any luck, they fucking beat him.

Speaker 5:          00:46:18       Did they beat him? You know what? I'm going to check. God knows I've got nothing else to talk about on this fucking podcast. Um, no. You know what, let's continue this sports theme just so we can get rid of all the people who aren't into sports and are into other things like politics. The fuck is up with that once the deal with people who are informed. Um, on a number of weeks ago, I actually, I ripped Peyton manning a new asshole. And upon listening back to it, you know, I actually sounded like half of fucking retard. I will definitely admit that. But I still stand by my opinions and I kept bringing up a guy by the name of Terry Bradshaw who has four Superbowl rings and uh, you know, everybody hit me dude. The only two from like 20 plank, I can fucking huge. Well they have a great article on Terry Bradshaw in a sporting news magazine this week or this month.

Speaker 5:          00:47:07       I don't really read this magazine, but I'm, that kid from Nebraska was on the cover that uh, Dima Dima Tamu Kong, Su Damo Kong sue. I don't know. He's got a great fucking name and uh, the Patriots needed defensive tackle, but I know we're not going to draft high enough to get that guy. But I just wanted to read about, cause I figured maybe they talk about other defensive tackles that were available because I have no life. Um, but anyways, I opened it up and Lo and behold, there was a great article about Terry Bradshaw, which basically backs up what the fuck I was talking about. At least in my world. It does. And uh, and they mentioned right in the beginning it said a Bradshaw won his fourth and final Superbowl ring with an MVP performance for the Steelers at the rose bowl among quarterbacks. Only Joe Montana has that record and it's quite possibly none will ever surpass it.

Speaker 5:          00:48:02       Okay. All you Peyton manning fans out there, do you think he's going to get five fucking rings? They'll get four. I think he could possibly get three. He's not getting four though. All right. And this is coming from fucking Terry Bradshaw, a man who played the game. This is what, this is a quote from the article. The only thing that matters in the prose is winning the Superbowl. I've never had anyone come up to me in my life and say, hey Terri, how many yards did you throw? Four. How many touchdown passes do you have? It's all about rinks. Does that sound familiar? Go listen to the fucking February 8th podcast. Maybe Terry listens to my podcast. Oh, fucking arrogant. Is that? Um, but then he says, uh, he says it's all about rings, but dude, the shit that this guy took, you know, I knew in the beginning of his career that this guy had a rough time in Pittsburgh and everybody, you know, basically treated him like a dumb redneck and, uh, kind of like what they did with John Rocker.

Speaker 5:          00:49:02       Oh, always fought John rocker got a bum deal because I was living in New York and they were basically calling this guy a fucking moron, redneck and not so many words. And then he comes out and starts trash in New York. And then typical media, they get to step away. Like they didn't insight any of it, you know, and all the mets fans get to act like they weren't fucking yelling shit at him. I used to be doing a bit about that. That, uh, that of the punchline was basically you had date rapists and wife beaters throwing batteries at a bigot. That was basically, that was my little fucking social commentary on the John Rocker incident. Let me get back to this shit and not supporting anything that John Rock has said, but you know what I mean? It's like, you know, if you're going to FAU fucking throw rocks, rocks at a, at a, at a Hornet's nest. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Dad did I almost just say you're going to get stung. You know what I almost just created, there was one of those southern fucking expressions that I love so much faster and Turkey shit through a tin horn. I'll tell you that boy, that boy fuck a rock up. You thought a snake was under it. Anybody from down south can just send me a whole list of those fucking things. If I already done this on the podcast and I don't remember, I absolutely love those fucking expressions that Boyd fuck mud.

Speaker 5:          00:50:25       I don't even know what they mean. That boy would fuck a rock if he thought his snake was under it. How does that make any sense? But, but, but when I love about is, even though it doesn't make sense, you, you understand what the person is saying and there's a genius to that. So anyways, um, let me, uh, let, let's read about Terry Bradshaw's Er, er, the early part of his fucking career basically. Yeah, they were, they were shitting all over it. Well, why don't we have Terry it here. You said you have to understand something. My first five years were not the best. I had shit thrown in my face. I was booed, criticized, called stupid and dumb players talking about, we're saying this is players on his teams were saying, ah, we win. In spite of him, he stutters in the huddle. I had so much of that shit thrown at me.

Speaker 5:          00:51:10       I got bitter about it. And my coach, who I thought never defended me in public chuck, no. Um, the thing was, I was never his chosen one. I had to sit back and come to grips with all that and it was very painful for me. It wasn't a storybook career. So I take a great deal of pride and being the quarterback of the team that won all those super bowls. Yeah. And the guy never gets to fucking respect. Do you know before Superbowl 13? Uh, Thomas Hollywood Henderson said Terry Bradshaw couldn't spell cat if you spotted them to see in the a. So they asked Bradshaw about this and if you watch football, you know, we always comes off like this guy just being all silly and joking around, but he goes, well, it tick me off. The thing that ticked me off was nobody defended me. Who came out on my team and said, bullshit.

Speaker 5:          00:51:54       He calls the place, he sets it up. Who defended me? Chuck Noll didn't, didn't defend me. The only guy knows, said something was Joe Greene. And then here I got to deal with this thing going into the Superbowl. What the hell am I going to do? I'm smart enough to know not to get in that argument with Hollywood Henderson through the media because it's a distraction. Um, I don't have time for that shit. Okay. So I can't spell cat. If you spot me the c and the t, uh, that's some good shit. Congratulations. Then you go out and you kicked our asses. How much? How's my spelling look now you're the one who had to go to prison.

Speaker 5:          00:52:29       Hey, chuck it there. Terry's an angry mother fucker or whatever. I love it. I love it. You know, something that he never went back to Pittsburgh. I didn't even notice that shit when he was done. He just left. He doesn't even talk to any of the players. And he said, he goes, I mean, it's kind of a failure of my personality. I don't know. It's a really interesting article because if you watch him on a, whatever the hell this show is called, the NFL pregame, he still plays it up. Like he says, you know, this, this just, just this country boy. But he isn't, he's fucking sharp as attack. And uh, he didn't like the way he was treated in Pittsburgh. And I enjoy that. I enjoy that considering those guys, uh, how seriously they take their team and their fucking quarterback at game four super bowls.

Speaker 5:          00:53:10       He treated them like such shit. You know, I just like, I like when teams do that to their fucking players cause it makes Boston fans look better cause God knows where bunch of fucking assholes, you know, kind of like when Montreal booed Patrick was out of town. I love bringing this shit up and then he goes out to fucking Colorado in immediately wins a Stanley Cup and then like four years later wins another one. I love that now Montreal hasn't been a factor since fucking 1993 I love that too. It's over there. Last dynasty was 1979 they dominated a 16 league that spilled over into the expansion six and then everybody got their shit together and you haven't heard anything from those motherfuckers sense and they're still walking around with their chest puffed out about some shit that they did back in the three stooges error. You know, it's fucking over 30 years ago.

Speaker 5:          00:54:03       It's been 30 years since you guys dominated the fucking Nhl. All right, so get off your goddamn high horses. All right dad out to get me a couple of emails. Okay. Let's continue on with the, with the podcast here. Um, here's a couple of videos. If you want to watch this one that I wanted you guys to check out. Um, there's a video of your van Halen Fan. Go on Youtube and check out van Halen and it's a song in the cradle will rock. If you just search that, a bunch of videos will come up and click on this second video down and uh, just look what David Lee Roth is wearing. It's absolutely fucking hilarious. But I'm telling you, as funny as it is, there's going to be a part of you being like, God dammit, I wish I could get away with wearing something like that.

Speaker 5:          00:54:49       Can you imagine the amount of pussy I would get if I wore something like had the balls to wear something like that? For those of you who aren't near a fucking, I'll basically describe it, who aren't near a fucking computer right now. Maybe you're on a treadmill trying to work off that Burgee to Carl's Jr at two in the morning. No one, you shouldn't have done it. We woke up this morning feeling like you had a fucking anchor in your stomach. It goes fucking sweat it off. He's basically wearing a picture. If you, if you, if you had a zoot suit made out of Spandex and all you were wearing was the pants. So they basically came up right underneath your fucking chest. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:55:30       And then you remember those, you remember those fucking, and they're in their purple sparkle to all right. And then that's it. You don't have anything else on other than, do you remember those boots that those whores used to wear an aspen in like the late seventies early eighties where they look like they skinned a woolly mammoth. He has on White, wooly, mammoth snow boots. And the greatest thing is the crowd is just fucking stick cause it's early on in their career. I don't know if it's from another country. I have no fucking idea. I haven't watched it in awhile, but I was just remembering it and I wanted you guys just check it out. Jesus Christ. I told that fucking story in real time. All right, here's another one. Another youtube video. Somebody sent me, it says a checkout Dwarf midgets killer movie Tie, m. U. A. T. H. A. I, this is basically, it's, it's very, uh, very accurately descriptive.

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       Uh, described it. It's one guy is a dwarf and the other guy's a midget or a little person as the new way class that they invented a little person and they are, uh, they're fighting somewhere, I'm going to guess, and maybe the Philippines and it's a Muay Thai fight and it starts off funny. Then you think it's fake because the midget keeps hitting the door off with the exact same fucking punch. The dwarf keeps trying to kneel knee, neither midget and the chest and the midget keeps coming with an overhand right. And I was kept thinking, why the fuck is he keeps, why the fuck does he keep throwing the same punch? This must be fake. But then I realized that the boxing gloves on the midget actually go beyond his elbow. So he couldn't throw a hook if he wanted to. And then after that, it just becomes sad.

Speaker 5:          00:57:11       There's something about the dwarfs face where he just really looks like he's getting, he's physically at paint. The midget has, you know, we still got that, that Christmas twinkle in his eye. He seems like he's having a good time. He's got a little bit of swagger in his water. She's probably getting some pussy after the show, you know. And uh, that's a good question. Would you have a lot of Midget Bang you women out there? I know some guys have banked a little person, but I was just wondering, you know, if he just laid down on your stomach and you just felt like that, like that at wiggle and eight year old riding you from behind,

Speaker 5:          00:57:51       do you know how long your hair would have to be so you could actually pull it in that position? Why am I being such an asshole this week? I don't know why. All right, next, uh, next youtube video. I'll tell you why. Because I don't have a fucking show. I don't have a show tonight and I'm waiting to take a red eye, JetBlue, JetBlue, back to a f. Jfk. I'm not looking forward to going back to New York this time of year with that fucking weather. I really have not missed the winner whatsoever. That's a big thing they asked in the east coast. Don't you miss the four seasons? What Frankie Valli and those guys here, is that when you say, do I miss the four seasons? No, I don't. No, I don't. I like it. I like being old and being in the retirement community that is Los Angeles. I like it.

Speaker 5:          00:58:36       It's, you know what La is like, it's like a, it's like Florida for somebody who's still middle aged, you know, you go to Florida, does it die? That's the last place I'll go, go out there and get me a gator boat, you know, that's what I'm going to do. That's how I'm going to parachute out of my life. I'm going to, uh, yeah. I'll probably get a divorce and just say, listen, I'm cashing in my chips. I can't do this. We had kids all rights fucking over there out of the house. What do we do? Stare at each other for the rest of fucking time. So I sit there and watch watching you slowly gumming those waffles that used to be able to tear through an English muffin in a minute and a half. Now we sit here for fucking 37 minutes as I watched.

Speaker 5:          00:59:17       I don't want to live that life with you. Okay? We had a great time. I give you a high five, but I'm afraid I'm going to break his shoulder and then I'll go. Then I'm going to go down to Florida and I'm just going to get one of those fucking boats with the fan on the back. And I'm going to give, I'm going to give everglade tours is I want to play some Pentair and some ACDC. I'm going to have on affected southern accent and that's it. And I'm gonna live off my DVD money even though I won't exist anymore. Um, and I'm addressed all in khaki. Okay, let's continue on. Um, the next youtube video that you can look at is, uh, there's one called a public access TV hosts bombarded with prank calls, is the name of it. I don't know if this is the right video.

Speaker 5:          01:00:00       Somebody sent this one to me and I accidentally deleted it. So I just buy him describing it. I think this is the one, so look it up and it's basically a guy in public access trying to talk about gun control. And it's such a low budget that, you know, it's not pre, it's basically live and he puts his phone number up there. So somebody calls in realize is it's, you know, realizes that it's alive and tells them to go fuck himself. And then the entire audience, like a bunch of Goddamn children call in in all they're saying is just the dirty as shit that they can basically think of. The best guys are the ones who actually start talking about gun control for a minute. So this guy actually feels like he's having a discussion and right as the guys starts to engage with them, they tell them to go fuck himself.

Speaker 5:          01:00:47       So if you're an angry prek like me, it's an I, it's actually a a, it's a nice one. So with that, um, I have been on lumosity.com for all of last week, uh, trying to get my BPI score to go up, which is, I don't even know what the fuck it stands for. Basically the higher the number you have, the less a moron. I don't know. I was going to say retarded, but I don't like using that word. Uh, even though I've already said it five times as fucking podcasts, the less dumb you are I guess are the smarter you are, the higher it is. Right. I got confused in the middle of it. I don't know. I'm worried about my brain right now, everybody because it's feeling fuzzy and I think a lot of it has to do with talking on my cell phone too much and I'm trying to cut down on that like a cigarette smoker and I've been going to this, this website, Lumosity Dotcom and has these, these games that challenge your brain.

Speaker 5:          01:01:40       It's fucking awesome. And they got everything out. Any, any type of, any type of stuff that you could be thinking of? I don't know if I talked about this last week, so I'll kind of blow through it. It's Lumosity, l,U , m o, s. I. T, Y. Dot Com. Somebody else also suggested one that was, um, I don't know how to read it because it's a website here. That's all, I don't know how to say it here. It's, it's www.no spaces here. P, O, s. I. T. S. C. I. E. N. C e. So it's posted science, Pos, it, science.com. Um, and they have these brain games and I really think in an a number of years, that's where I did talk about this last week, that the, that they're basically, instead of having all these, these exercise shows at night that involves, you know, getting fucking abs and all that type of shit, they are actually going to be selling stuff late at night.

Speaker 5:          01:02:31       That's going to be basically crunches for your brain. And um, I would recommend it. It's Kinda been my new thing that I do out here. I told you I've been trying to learn, learn how to write with my right hand. I'll tell you about that shit. I'm a lefty and somebody, this comedian was telling me about this book that he was reading that uh, if you actually do things with your opposite hand, it opens up different areas of your brain. And, um, so I've been doing that, you know, I'm writing with my right hand. I've been throwing shit around my, my hotel room with my left hand. I'm kind of fucked up where I, I, I kind of jump back and forth, play guitar left to I play drums, righty. I play sports right handed. I write lefthanded I can use tools either hand fucking rub one out with the left, but in a pinch.

Speaker 5:          01:03:21       Okay, let's plow ahead. So this is the type of Shit I've been doing. So I've been learning how to write with my right hand and I basically, my hand writing with my right hand looks at, looks like my handwriting in like fourth grade. Um, it looks like if I, if I was in the fourth grade and um, I just saw a ghost. That's the way it looks. It's looking very spooky. But, uh, I've also been trying to learn how to become a better speller. I just ain't no something like I always make fun of how the fact that I'm a fucking moron and I'm like Terry Bradshaw, I definitely play up my stupidity, but there's definitely a seed of a, or maybe some people would say a deep well of stupidity that I actually have. And most of it, um, is art. It just laziness. I mean, there's no reason why I should know how to spell the word restaurant at my age.

Speaker 5:          01:04:12       I've been to a bunch of them and I've tried to spell it a million times. And for the life of me, I always forget if the u comes after the first a Oh, the second a and m I've tried this a number of times and I'm going to try to stick with it is I just as I, you know, tried to type an email and rather than just hitting spellcheck and just moving on with my life, I'm trying to actually make a list of words. I don't know how to sell, sell, spell, see how my brain's fucked up. Um, and then what I do is I, then I write, I write the word properly, like 10 times in a row. Um, but I write it with my right hand. So I'm kind of doing two things at once and it's fucking hilarious because I kind of left this shit out and I was just thinking of the poor cleaning lady coming in here.

Speaker 5:          01:04:57       Like one of the words I was learning how to spell was penitentiary. So I have penitentiary written like fucking 12 times in this spooky I'm writing with my opposite hand, fucking penmanship. And I just kept thinking of the shining all work and no play makes jack a dull boy, you know? So, uh, I dunno, trying to become a smarter human being. Am I boring the shit out of you? Because I think that last segment was a little boring, but I'm into this shit man. I'm sick of just knowing stuff about sports. I actually, you know what, I'm going to Europe in two weeks and I desperately do not want to come off as the typical stupid American. At least I'm in shape. Okay. So I'm going to be real, you know, representing us nicely in that category. The fact that I'm 41 years old and I'm still fucking in shape. Jesus Christ, I almost fell backwards on this chair. I didn't understand how far away the curtains were. I should have gone with it. At least it would have been fucking funny. Let me see if I can lean back here. Easy, easy, easy. It's not working. Um, oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Hang on one second. Hello.

Speaker 5:          01:06:08       Hey, let me call you back in like 20 minutes. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:06:14       Okay, cool. All right. But um, so anyways, uh, the fuck am I talking about? I got a, um, I got this magazine, Scientific American because I'm like, I can't keep reading these fucking sports magazines. And two, there was a guy in there, these egg heads when they want to, as much as I'd love trash and people, if you notice, you know, I just insult the way you look and I say fuck a lot, but these guys are actually intelligent human beings and this guy was making fun of people who tell stories. You ever see those stories where people say they died, I was dead for two minutes and then I came back and then they come on and they start talking about the stuff that they saw. But that the way this scientist guy breaks the shit down scientist guy that I really just say that the way this dude just shines, Dude Rye do I break shit down?

Speaker 5:          01:07:07       Um, it's just fucking brilliant. He basically says, you're not dead. You had a near death experience. You were in a a a near death state. You weren't dead if you were dead, you dead. They can't bring you back from being dead. All right. Even if you fucking hard stops just because your heart stops the dying process. This guy was the way he broke it down and he said it can take anywhere from a couple of minutes to a couple of hours to occur depending on the conditions. So even if somebody, unless you get just fucking blown up vaporized, even if somebody shoots you in the fucking heart, your brain is still going to be firing, synapsis and or whatever. The Fox. I'm too stupid to know. What it is, but it still takes another couple of minutes and other stuff like he said, can take up to a couple of hours. So these fucking people who think they're dead or not dead and they're coming on TV talking about the shit they saw, like they, like they were in another fucking, I dunno universe and they weren't.

Speaker 5:          01:08:11       So he basically in the Deepak Chopra is to you know, is on this Larry King show describing what's going on. So the guy basically concludes it with this when a cause one other scientists was actually kind of agreeing with Deek Pock Chopra by saying, you know, there's some stuff out there that we just, you know, science, you know, has no explanation for. And this guy says, so what? The fact that we cannot fully explain a mystery without natural means does not mean it requires a supernatural explanation. It just means we don't know everything. Such uncertainty is at the very heart of science and is what makes it such a challenging enterprise. And in that moment there was a clap of thunder and I realized that science is religion for intelligent people. This guy isn't saying that there's no god, but he's also not listening to some guy half naked dancing around a fucking fire with a chicken foot.

Speaker 5:          01:09:08       You know what I mean? So I think that's what I think. I think science is religion for intelligent people. And I think religion and a lot of ways is science for morons. Whenever they can't explain something, they invent stories of people having, you know, all you can eat fish coming out of a wicker basket or fucking, you know, you got to have faith. You've got to have faith. It's a fucking cop out. You know, if you went to go buy a fucking car and you go, all right, let me look, the car wouldn't start up. Don't worry. Don't worry. One of these days that engine's coming back and it's going to be mad and it's going to be judging you. It's ridiculous. You know, Jesus, I don't want to get off on this fucking rant, but definitely check it out, man. If you want to read some cool stuff, it's called scientific American.

Speaker 5:          01:09:55       And uh, I dunno, I'm kind of on this mission. I'm, I'm sick of being a moron, so it could be in, you know, I'm sick of being fucking stupid. I really am. Um, so anyways, let's get to, uh, let's get to underrated overrated. Um, what are we 38 minutes and look at me. I've really could fucking run my mouth when I want to before I get into underrated. Overrated. I gotta read this one and I'm going to need some help from you guys on this. Um, listen to this one. Uh, this is from some dude. Uh, I believe he's in Italy and he said, um, I kill women's Libidos for a living. All right, here we go. Fucking strap yourselves in for this one. Hey, Bill.

Speaker 5:          01:10:41       I just got out of my second of my two longterm relationships, um, three plus years, both of which eerily started and ended the same. Uh, both of these girls were well above average in their sexual enlightenment when we started dating. I'm not saying they were super freaky, but the kind of girls that have a porno collection that can rival most guys and the toys to match. Also the kind of girls that while you're home visiting your parents for the holidays, we'll want to sneak away from the dinner table and fucking in the bathroom. [inaudible] okay. Anyways, um, it seems that the standards for most of these relations, the standard for most relationship is that you fuck like rabbits during the first year. If you manage to make it past the one year mark, there is an exponential decay in the pussy rationing until you get married or have kids at which time you're pretty much done with the sex except for birthdays in the anniversary.

Speaker 5:          01:11:35       However, the section, these two relationships kept going strong through the second year, at which point it completely dropped off. And I'm not just, I don't, I'm not kidding, I'm talking just done. I had to pull out every trick in the book just to get his sympathy fucking once every couple of weeks. Um, I'm in a committed relationship and love these girls. I guess you were in a committed relationship and you love these girls. So I guess she didn't fuck around. All right. Um, and love these girls enough to put up with the bullshit with the idea that we'll be able to work through the issue and get back on track. However, as I learned, once the pussy is boarded up, it's out of business for good. It's like those fucking horrific strip malls that have been abandoned since the 80s when whatever shit, boom economy in the area made those fucking people think they were going to go somewhere.

Speaker 5:          01:12:19       So inevitably when these relationships and I end up, uh, I get red, my, my fucking straight a report card on how much I'm such a great guy and I'm loved so much and they don't want to lose me as a part of their lives, but they're just not sexually attracted to me anymore. And that is the fucking and that, that, and this is the best fucking part. They don't know why. They don't know why then not sexually attracted to me anymore and really wish they could change it seriously. What the fuck no man wants to admit to himself, let alone an audience that he's not getting alone. They, he's not getting that. He's not getting it done between the sheets. However, I can honestly say that I do. All right. I'm no fucking Ron Jeremy, but I get the job done. I would understand the plight of these woman if I was a Ferb blasting them.

Speaker 5:          01:13:10       I don't know what that means. What does that mean? Just jumping on them like an 18 year old pounding away or wanting to do the same shit over and over again. But I usually make a pretty good damn effort to make sure things stay fun in the bedroom. All right. Okay. Last two fucking paragraphs. Uh, let me just, let me just a paraphrase is he basically says that he's like, uh, William h Macy's character in the cooler. Um, and he's saying that he's getting really bitter and he wants to go out right now and go meet a woman, fuck the shit out of her for three months and then give her the same speech that just happened to him. Um, all right. Okay. First of all, don't do that. Don't deliberately go out and hurt somebody because you dated two people who hurt you. That's just, it's, it's bad.

Speaker 5:          01:13:58       They don't deserve it. They didn't hurt you. So don't do that. All right. Um, I, I don't know what I mean. Yeah. I'd have to have more details of what the fuck's going on, but I will tell you this from, I know a lot of people, they get into a relationship with somebody and it doesn't go right. They find out that it's not what they're looking for. And then they go out and then they immediately basically start dating the same person again. It's not literally the same person, but it's basically, you know, like, just to make it simple, if a woman went out and was Dayton, met some guy at a fucking truck stop and he turns out to be an asshole. He's driving a truck, fucking a bunch of other women around the country. She goes, I'll never fucking get with a piece of shit like that again.

Speaker 5:          01:14:47       And where does she go? She goes right back down to the truck stop, which is the same gene pool of fucking people. And I think it's very interesting that you met two girls who seemed like they were the exact same right down to when they want it to stop fucking you and I gotta admit, okay, I guess a woman having a porn collection is healthy on some level, but that, you know, I don't know as far as I could girl you're going to marry. It's like you want your girl, it's that fine line. You want them to fuck your brains out, but do you really want to bang, have them want to fuck you in your parents house? I mean, I dunno dude. I mean, I, I what I, what I would guess is I would, I would start fishing in a different lake. It sounds to me like you're a fucking goddamn trout.

Speaker 5:          01:15:34       Again. Can't fucking believe it. You know, go out in the ocean, you'll catch something else. You know what I'm saying? I think he got the same person again. I mean, but I mean, I would literally have to fucking be knowing what you're doing in the bedroom, which I don't want to know. Um, well what about you? Do you start taking, I guess you said you don't take her off cause that's another thing that happens in relationships. You know, there's like, you know, big thing with women is they like kissing and uh, guys are very focused on the, on, on the finish line, the goal. So you know, you're getting that relationship like we haven't had sex in a while. You want to have sex when you start getting in that fucking thing it, you know, and you just start scheduling it. I how does your day look? Maybe around four. Okay. Okay. We will fuck at four, you know, and you know, you're not even self conscious so there's no excitement. You just fucking take your clothes off. Like you're getting strip searched on your way to serving time at fucking, uh, some penitentiary. Penitentiary, p e n I t and t I a r y penitentiary.

Speaker 5:          01:16:46       Sorry. It's one of the words I learned this week and I was trying to remember Rikers island and I couldn't at that point. So do it. I don't know what to tell you. The bottom line. I don't give a fuck who you are. How I'm in love you. I was somebody after a while, you're going to get sick of fucking him. That's what happens. Um, I dunno, I dunno what's going on. I don't know if you have some sort of like delayed halitosis where for the two years you have wonderful breath and then all of a sudden it's unbearable. I'm just fucking with you. I want to give you a complex, but I'm just saying, I don't know what I would try to, to meet girls in a different place. I would start with that. And um, I dunno. I Dunno dude. This one is beyond me.

Speaker 5:          01:17:25       I've never, uh, I mean, part of me wants to say you'd be, you're being a little too hard on yourself here. Uh, but whatever, go out there and, uh, you know, I'll go bank some fucking women. Yes. Single, go out there banks and fuck a woman and is always, always talk to women that you think errata eleague always do that shit. The worst thing they can do is say no, but one of them is going to fucking say yes and that'll give you more confidence and you'll keep moving up the draft board. Next thing you know, you polling pussy out of the first round rather than drafting like you're fucking won the Superbowl last year. You know, having that 28th pick, praying that the female version of fucking Dan Marino still around. That didn't make sense. But you know what I'm saying? Um, anyways, am I almost done here?

Speaker 5:          01:18:11       46 minutes in 46 minutes into the podcast. Let's wrap this shit up here. People with a little bit of underrated overrated. Shall we underrated a bill. Last week you got an email from a fan that recounted eh, his sister's Wiccan wedding. Personally, I think the ritual was that was discussed in the wedding. His fucking mind numbingly insane, but part of me has to give it up to the couple that got married. I'll, sorry. Underrated is a having balls. Um, they knew their ritual would, would not be well received, but they did not give a fuck. It was their day, and they had the conviction to do what they wanted, even knowing that their family and guests would not warmly received the whole jibberish chanting and bloodletting. Okay. So there you go. Having the balls to fucking annoyed everyone in your family. Um, and other quick thing, here's some people are traveling to Boston.

Speaker 5:          01:19:01       They know that I grew up there and I also fucking travel around the country and this guy said, hey bill, I'm going there with my wife. She used to, she, um, she used to live there, but I would also, uh, you know, so she knows where to go. I'd like to know, you know, have you tell me where to fuck the gum paraphrasing obviously. Um, I haven't lived there since 1995 dudes. So, um, I'm going to try to tell you to go to some of my favorite places from a back in the day. I would start, go to [inaudible] liquors on route one in saga right before, you know, get a good six pack and you maybe some Michelob and then go up to the, uh, go up to the cow alone. Get some fucking Chinese food.

Speaker 5:          01:19:42       And of course another great liquor store out in, uh, out in the Boston areas out in Brockton, Massachusetts. Go to Blanchard's liquor store. I'll buy the West Gate Mall. You might want to check if that's still there, but I know the bowling alley is, that's a great place. You know, go out there and put on some flock of seagulls and try to talk to some chick with way too much. Uh, who drew a triangle of pink on both of her cheeks? I'm just fucking with you. The penalty. Go to a Bruins game. Go and stop by the penalty box. That's a good bar. It's really alcohol based. Stay away from the freedom trail. Okay. Stay away from the freedom trail. I don't know about you guys, but there's nothing more boring to me anyways. Then the revolutionary war. It is mind numbingly boring. Uh, with the old weaponry. It's like, you know, it's like the original Atari after you saw this playstation shit we've been doing for the last, you know, 50 years. So, oh, you hear that shit? Did she sing it again? Wait a second. Wait for it. Not The fucking game. The violin. Can you hear it? Probably can't fucking hear.

Speaker 8:          01:20:49       No, I

Speaker 5:          01:20:50       blah blah, blah, blah. All right. Um, oh, when somebody sent me something, and this is the last thing I'll tell you guys before I'll, I'll tell you all to have a good fucking week as I always do. Trying to add on a nice positive note. Uh, hey, let me hit refresh here just to see who won this food's one in this fucking game. Come on, refresh Jesus Christ. He isn't it unbelievable how quickly you fucking computer gets old. It's like cool for the first fucking week and then you download a couple of things and then it's like, you know, it's like Brad Pitt at the beginning of that movie where he played the old baby. Anybody see that movie? I don't think I've ever laughed so fucking hard in my life when that guy came in and he was trying to get some pussy and he hears and he looks down, there was that little old baby.

Speaker 5:          01:21:36       You want to talk about killing a fucking a woman's, a guy's libido. The fuck is going on with my computer. I didn't have the thing. I actually have dial up right now. You can believe it. That's probably another one of the problems are right. Here we go. Come on. Come on. You fucking cunts. Two to one. Pittsburg, eight oh four left. I like it though. I forget the name of the guy, but we have a new defense man. Maybe that'll help us to make up for the fact that we don't have Phil Kessel anymore even though for some reason a lot of people don't like him. So anyways, this guy sent me this last thing. I'll read you guys. This guy sent me something about a, you know I was talking about when you going to go buy things and people ask for your phone number and all this fucking information and it fucking creeps me out. Every time they do that, I just think that they should play in the beginning of that iron main song, the prisoner, he remembered that from the eighties do you remember how that thing went?

Speaker 9:          01:22:28       You remember this

Speaker 5:          01:22:32       then new number two was number one. You are number six most cycle laugh ever. Can you imagine if your fucking dad, you would laugh at you like that back in the day. Be like, son, how many beers did you have the night? You're just like, I just had to

Speaker 5:          01:23:04       all right, he just fucking Dallas in the light start and it's going to be over. So anyways, this fucking guy. Does that make any sense by the way? I don't know. I'm fucking sitting here with one microphone. No headphones in a fucking hotel room. This is what you get. All right, so this guy and said, Bill, can you believe how much fucking information people are willing to give away for no to strangers for no reason. He goes, I got my haircut the other day and the first thing they say to me before, hello or what can I do for you is the first thing out of the gate is what's your phone number? So I say, why do you need my phone number? She says, so we know who you are when you come in. Which is bullshit because they don't know you when you come in.

Speaker 5:          01:23:44       They still have to ask what your goddamn number is. C got to love someone who actually fucking uses their brain. So anyway, she goes, he says, I don't want to give you my number. So then she scarfs in his face and says, we don't stand the information out to anyone. It's just to keep track of you here. That's it. Um, and then she says, uh, then okay, then the guy says, he the Guy Rick wrote this really badly here. So then I guess he responds to that doesn't make me feel any better. You don't need my phone number to cut my hair. Then there's slag does this fine, whatever that sounded exactly like your exaggerated impression of a dumb broad. Then she goes, how about your address too? This is fucking, you know what all these corporations are sharing this information to figure out exactly what you buy when you buy it, what you liked the best.

Speaker 5:          01:24:37       So they can just fucking, I don't know what, you know, Jack, the prices of the shit up. So anyways, um, she goes, how about your address? And the guy goes, what are you going to do? Drop the haircut off at my house. Just cut my fucking, ah, now there's three people in line behind me in this worthless tub of come. Jesus leans around me and says, and says, I guess to the people behind them. Sorry. This takes longer when they, then he writes, they, you know, don't give any information and then he says sarcastically. Oh, I see. I'm the one compliment a complicating this transaction and it's not even her fault. It's her. Oh, and it's not even her fault. It's her corporate creep bosses and all the fucking sheep that let people do whatever they want. Sorry, this is so long. Well, you should apologize to my listeners because they had to listen to me read it.

Speaker 5:          01:25:28       Yeah, man. Don't give those people your fucking phone numbers. Don't give him your address. I do that. Can we get your phone number? I had. No, you can't. We're not going to do anything with it. That's fine. That's fine. I know you're not going to do anything with it. I don't want you to have my phone number. We need to call me up and see how my fucking haircuts going. Is it still short and you think you need an adjustment? Did I tell you that story? But when I went into cvs and that guy who, look what the peewee Herman Haircut, there was two, two foreigners in front of me, they barely spoke English and they, he asked if they want to one of those savy saved cards and they said no. And he goes, that's all right, I'll just scan one anyways. And he scans it.

Speaker 5:          01:26:06       So I walk up and I'm ready for this guy. He goes, do you have our little savy safe car? And I say, no, I don't. And he goes, well, I'll just scan it anyways. And I got, no, I don't want you doing. And then he scanned it and I said, I said, excuse me, what did I just say to you? I just said, I don't want that. And you scan it anyways. Why did you just do that? And he goes, it's all right. I want scan it, I'll scan it. And I go, what? What do you get? Like half a cent for every person that you get. You know that, that, that you get on the fucking list there and he goes, no, I don't. It's like, really? Is that why he can't make eye contact with me? You fucking piece of shit. He probably didn't even unscattered the Goddamn thing, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:26:43       I don't understand people that help out corporations. I just don't, have they done anything to demonstrate that they give a flying fuck about you or the drinking water in your town? Don't help those cons. I mean, you can if you want to, but that's just, I would just, I think it would be a better world if these fucking pricks didn't know every goddamn thing about you. You know? Pretty soon you're going to walk in there and they're going to fucking asked if you can put a did it. They can just bug you like gene Hackman in the conversation. Right. All right dude, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. You know what? I'm going to go down and Melissa, this lady singer songs, so I don't have to think there's a nice little crowd down there. Has got to be at least 26 people down there, which I think in downtown San Jose actually constitutes a mob.

Speaker 5:          01:27:26       Maybe somebody will get tased and shot in the abdomen. I don't know what. All right, that's the podcast for this week. Thank you guys so much for listening. I am currently revamping my website and I hope that everything's going to be up to speed. I recently went over 10,000 people on my mailing list, so I'm really excited about that. And, uh, if you want to know what's going on, you know, especially like, you see, you know, when I switched over to a lipsin with the podcast and all that fucking shit, if you were out of the loop, it's because you weren't on my mailing list. I'm not sure. You know how funny is this? How funny is this? Uh, how fucking hypocritical and Mike, I just said, don't give you phone number out to these
