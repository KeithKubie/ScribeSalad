for the entire film and I'm just

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879
for the entire film and I'm just
 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.670
for the entire film and I'm just
thinking to myself I don't agree with

and to me that was a big mistake of the
 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.180
and to me that was a big mistake of the
screenplay because the film tries to set

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190
screenplay because the film tries to set
 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.729
screenplay because the film tries to set
up the dinosaurs as animals that need to

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739
up the dinosaurs as animals that need to
 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.089
