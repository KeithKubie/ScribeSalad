00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.440
Let's say we have
two lines over here.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.160
Let's call this line
right over here line AB.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.600
So A and B both
sit on this line.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.600
And let's say we have
this other line over here.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.410
We'll call this line CD.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.622
So it goes through point C
and it goes through point D.

00:00:15.622 --> 00:00:18.230
And it just keeps
on going forever.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.020
And let's say that these lines
both sit on the same plane.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.930
And in this case, the
plane is our screen,

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.596
or this little piece
of paper that we're

00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:27.020
looking at right over here.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.880
And they never intersect.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.230
So they're on the same
plane, but they never

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.180
intersect each other.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.680
If those two things are
true, and when they're not

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.400
the same line, they
never intersect

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.320
and they can be
on the same plane,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.995
then we say that these
lines are parallel.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.400
They're moving in the
same general direction,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.160
in fact, the exact
same general direction.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.535
If we were looking at it from
an algebraic point of view,

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:57.550
we would say that they
have the same slope,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.200
but they have
different y-intercepts.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.020
They involve different points.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.520
If we drew our
coordinate axes here,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.599
they would intersect that
at a different point,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.584
but they would have
the same exact slope.

00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:09.250
And what I want to
do is think about how

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.380
angles relate to parallel lines.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.870
So right over here, we have
these two parallel lines.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:24.240
We can say that line AB
is parallel to line CD.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.700
Sometimes you'll
see it specified

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.130
on geometric drawings like this.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.920
They'll put a little
arrow here to show

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.457
that these two
lines are parallel.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.290
And if you've already
used the single arrow,

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.040
they might put a double arrow to
show that this line is parallel

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.250
to that line right over there.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.420
Now with that out of the
way, what I want to do

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.750
is draw a line that intersects
both of these parallel lines.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.100
So here's a line that
intersects both of them.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.866
Let me draw a little
bit neater than that.

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.615
So let me draw that
line right over there.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.040
Well, actually, I'll do
some points over here.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.950
Well, I'll just
call that line l.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.030
And this line that intersects
both of these parallel lines,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.370
we call that a transversal.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.050
This is a transversal line.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.970
It is transversing both
of these parallel lines.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.410
This is a transversal.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.790
And what I want to think about
is the angles that are formed,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.210
and how they relate
to each other.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.290
The angles that are
formed at the intersection

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.950
between this transversal line
and the two parallel lines.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.600
So we could, first
of all, start off

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.820
with this angle right over here.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.320
And we could call
that angle-- well,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.530
if we made some labels
here, that would

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.099
be D, this point, and
then something else.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.140
But I'll just call it this
angle right over here.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.480
We know that that's going to be
equal to its vertical angles.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.040
So this angle is
vertical with that one.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.160
So it's going to be equal to
that angle right over there.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.080
We also know that this
angle, right over here,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.120
is going to be equal to its
vertical angle, or the angle

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.820
that is opposite
the intersection.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.830
So it's going to
be equal to that.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.371
And sometimes you'll
see it specified

00:02:57.371 --> 00:03:00.520
like this, where you'll see a
double angle mark like that.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.070
Or sometimes you'll
see someone write

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.760
this to show that
these two are equal

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.655
and these two are
equal right over here.

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:09.030
Now the other
thing we know is we

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.870
could do the exact
same exercise up here,

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.050
that these two are going
to be equal to each other

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.133
and these two are going
to be equal to each other.

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:16.310
They're all vertical angles.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:24.130
What's interesting here is
thinking about the relationship

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.520
between that angle right
over there, and this angle

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.270
right up over here.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.770
And if you just look at
it, it is actually obvious

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.000
what that relationship
is-- that they

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.547
are going to be the same
exact angle, that if you

00:03:37.547 --> 00:03:39.130
put a protractor
here and measured it,

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.060
you would get the exact
same measure up here.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.800
And if I drew
parallel lines-- maybe

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.341
I'll draw it straight
left and right,

00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:47.650
it might be a little
bit more obvious.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.320
So if I assume that these
two lines are parallel,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.990
and I have a transversal
here, what I'm saying

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.970
is that this angle
is going to be

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.050
the exact same measure
as that angle there.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.860
And to visualize that, just
imagine tilting this line.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.920
And as you take
different-- so it

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.420
looks like it's the
case over there.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.110
If you take the line like this
and you look at it over here,

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.106
it's clear that this
is equal to this.

00:04:09.106 --> 00:04:10.730
And there's actually
no proof for this.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.160
This is one of those
things that a mathematician

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.425
would say is intuitively
obvious, that if you look

00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:16.800
at it, as you tilt
this line, you

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.870
would say that these
angles are the same.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.579
Or think about putting
a protractor here

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.530
to actually measure
these angles.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.490
If you put a
protractor here, you'd

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.730
have one side of the
angle at the zero degree,

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.820
and the other side would
specify that point.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.594
And if you put the
protractor over here,

00:04:35.594 --> 00:04:37.010
the exact same
thing would happen.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.760
One side would be on
this parallel line,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.910
and the other side would
point at the exact same point.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.250
So given that, we
know that not only is

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.610
this side equivalent
to this side,

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.634
it is also equivalent
to this side over here.

00:04:51.634 --> 00:04:53.050
And that tells us
that that's also

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.260
equivalent to that
side over there.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.720
So all of these things
in green are equivalent.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.760
And by the same exact
argument, this angle

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.150
is going to have the same
measure as this angle.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.830
And that's going to be
the same as this angle,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.220
because they are opposite,
or they're vertical angles.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.767
Now the important
thing to realize

00:05:12.767 --> 00:05:14.100
is just what we've deduced here.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.330
The vertical angles are equal
and the corresponding angles

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.245
at the same points of
intersection are also equal.

00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:22.620
And so that's a
new word that I'm

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.150
introducing right over here.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.330
This angle and this
angle are corresponding.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.680
They represent kind of
the top right corner,

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.450
in this example, of
where we intersected.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.240
Here they represent still, I
guess, the top or the top right

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.530
corner of the intersection.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.030
This would be the
top left corner.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.180
They're always going to be
equal, corresponding angles.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.730
And once again,
really, it's, I guess,

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.410
for lack of a better
word, it is a bit obvious.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.300
Now on top of that,
there are other words

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.330
that people will see.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.820
We've essentially just proven
that not only is this angle

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.730
equivalent to this
angle, but it's also

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.330
equivalent to this
angle right over here.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.760
And these two angles--
let me label them

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.839
so that we can make
some headway here.

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:04.380
So I'm going to use
lowercase letters

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.910
for the angles themselves.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.410
So let's call this lowercase
a, lowercase b, lowercase c.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.590
So lowercase c for the
angle, lowercase d,

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.750
and then let me call
this e, f, g, h.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.320
So we know from vertical
angles that b is equal to c.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.450
But we also know
that b is equal to f

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.620
because they are
corresponding angles.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.930
And that f is equal to g.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.760
So vertical angles
are equivalent,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.670
corresponding angles
are equivalent,

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.050
and so we also know, obviously,
that b is equal to g.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.032
And so we say that alternate
interior angles are equivalent.

00:06:37.032 --> 00:06:38.990
So you see that they're
kind of on the interior

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.640
of the intersection.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.400
They're between the
two lines, but they're

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.830
on all opposite sides
of the transversal.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.240
Now you don't have to
know that fancy word,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.460
alternate interior
angles, you really just

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.350
have to deduce what
we just saw over here.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.310
Know that vertical angles
are going to be equal

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.344
and corresponding angles
are going to be equal.

00:06:54.344 --> 00:06:56.010
And you see it with
the other ones, too.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.750
We know that a is going
to be equal to d, which

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:06.397
is going to be equal to h,
which is going to be equal to e.
