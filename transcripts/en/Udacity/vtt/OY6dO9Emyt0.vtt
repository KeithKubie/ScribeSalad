00:00:00.265 --> 00:00:02.590
You've made it to the end
of this session on arrays.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.870
Arrays are a wonderful
collection type in Swift.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.600
They're easy to create, easy to modify,
and easy to iterate through.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.320
And rest assured, you'll be using
them a lot in your apps to represent

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.670
multiple values and instances.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.590
We'll see in the next session.
