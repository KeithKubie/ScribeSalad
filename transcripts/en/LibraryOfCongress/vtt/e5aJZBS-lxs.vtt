00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.610
&gt;&gt; Robert Newlen: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.110
And on behalf of Dr.
Carla Hayden the librarian

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.620
of Congress, it's my pleasure
to welcome you to the library.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.310
My name is Robert Newlen.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.810
I have the pleasure of serving

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.150
as the deputy librarian
of Congress.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.010
We are delighted
to be partnering

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.910
with the Kennedy Center and
Washington Performing Arts

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.860
and co-hosting this special
symposium Leading the Change:

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.900
Orchestra Innovation
and the Shift Festival.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.230
There's been a wonderful
buzz about this excellent

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.280
and exciting festival
around Washington this week,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.230
about the great concerts and
events like this one that reach

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.850
out into the community
of music lovers.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.750
And we're really
pleased to be part of it.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.730
I would first like to
acknowledge our partners,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.440
the creators and presenters
of the Shift Festival.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.490
First, the -- and I can only
say the fabulous Debra Rutter,

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.220
the president of the Kennedy
Center who was traveling

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.600
with the National Symphony
Orchestra this week

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.680
in its Russia trip.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.540
Robert van Leer the Center's
vice president for programming.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.230
And Jenny Bilfield,
president and CEO

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.990
of Washington Performing Arts.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.740
I know that among our audience
this morning we have music

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.630
lovers, composers,
arts professionals

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.330
and representatives for several

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.300
of the very top orchestras
in the nation.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.180
And I would like to welcome
particularly Jesse Rosen,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.060
president and CEO of the
League of American Orchestras.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.180
It's very appropriate
for us to host you today

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.360
because great music has a
very strong tradition here

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.050
at the library.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.250
Many of you are probably aware
of our historic concert series,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.640
now over 90 years old.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.010
This wonderful auditorium
that you're sitting

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.100
in that's a bit chilly this
morning, was built in 1925

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.130
by Elizabeth Spregg Coolidge

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.340
in a groundbreaking
public/private partnership.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.410
And it's been the home
of terrific concerts

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.860
over the years, everything
from classical, jazz, pop,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.160
country and much more.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.800
Our stage has seen the premier

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.420
of Aaron Copeland's
Appalachian Spring,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.260
now an icon of the repertoire,
along with performances

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.070
by composers from Bartok to
Bernstein and Stevie Wonder.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.860
And I invite you to spend some
time looking at the display

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.730
of manuscripts our curators
have prepared for you,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.040
just a few of the major
orchestral works in our vaults.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.400
Here at the library we share
your passion for creating superb

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.270
and vibrant programs that open
all our doors to the widest,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.120
most diverse and most
engaged audiences possible.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.440
Like you, we are committed
to innovation and to outreach

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.430
and education and increased
access for young people.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.520
I should mention that a little
later you'll hear a stellar

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.750
youth orchestra group from
Play On Philly which travelled

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.520
down this morning just
to perform for you.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.900
On a personal note, I've been
reading a lot about Shift

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.270
and the kinds of
outreach you do.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.980
As somebody that had virtually
no music education as a child

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.730
or as a teenager, the kind
of work you're doing is

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.450
so important, and I wish I'd had
the opportunity to be exposed

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.790
to the kinds of things
you're doing.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.440
Regarding our current
programs here at the library,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.490
I can't resist by leading
you with mention of something

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.830
that you may have read about in
the New York Times yesterday.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.470
And that is something
that's coming

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.990
to the library the
first week of May.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.130
It's called Biblio-Disco-Tech,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.470
and it's a library-wide
celebration of disco culture,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.520
music, dance and fashion.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.160
So over the week we're going to
have a number of music experts,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.660
panels that are all
open to the public.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.200
Tim Gunn from Project
Runway will be here

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.880
to talk about '70's fashion.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.450
And the week will be
capped on Saturday,

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.840
May 6th with a disco party

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.730
in the great hall featuring
none other than Gloria Gaynor.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.280
So we are so excited.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.400
Miss Gaynor's song I
Will Survive was put

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.150
on our song registry and
got lots of publicity,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.800
so we decided, let's
really celebrate this

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.520
and bring Miss Gaynor
to the library.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.560
So she graciously agreed.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.270
So watch our website.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.140
It is a ticketed event, but
it's free so take a look

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.660
at our website, because I know
tickets will go very, very fast.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.100
So let me state finally that
the Library of Congress music

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.100
of all kinds is a crucial and
vital element in our mandate

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.250
to preserve and present the
best in our American culture.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.310
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.730
If this is your first
visit to the Library,

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.840
I hope it won't be your last.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.550
Check out our website, LOC.gov.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.190
We have programs all
year long and music

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.690
and every other topic
you can imagine.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.990
This is your library.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.390
It belongs to the United
States and to the world.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.060
So we're just delighted
to have you here.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.940
And please enjoy your day.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.510
Thanks again.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:02.040
[ Applause ]

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.340
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Thank you.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.640
Good morning.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.940
I'm Jenny Bilfield with
Washington Performing Arts.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.240
It's wonderful to
see you all today.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.860
Excuse me just one moment.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.280
And thank you so much, Robert,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.710
for the wonderful
introduction of our guests.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.360
We're so happy to be
here, very grateful

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.810
to the Library of Congress.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.110
And I want to welcome
you on behalf

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.410
of Washington Performing Arts,

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.030
the League of American
Orchestras,

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.450
and the Kennedy Center.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.790
I bring greetings from
Debra Rutter my friend

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.970
and collaborator
who is traveling

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.470
with the National Symphony
Orchestra this week in Russia

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.000
and she couldn't be here.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.800
I know that she's
very disappointed

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.960
to miss participating in
a festival that she has

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.300
so strongly believed
in and been committed

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.430
to from the very,
very beginning.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.170
So after two and a half years
of planning, we have arrived

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.440
at this week and it's very
exciting to start it here

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.770
in a place that is of music and
has had such an important impact

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.070
in the cultural life
of this country.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.420
I wanted to give you a little
bit of a background about Shift.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.060
And it was really founded
based upon a vantage point

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.360
of optimism.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.890
Optimism about orchestras
and the sense

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.000
that orchestras are the hubs
of culture and learning within

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.800
and outside their institutions.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.010
You know, very often
orchestras make the news

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.210
when there is some strife,
when there's a strike

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.650
or a negotiation or
something is going poorly.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.460
And in contrast, Debra
and I felt very strongly

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.500
that there were wonderful
stories to be told,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.670
and that orchestras were doing
some of the most creative,

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.940
energizing and energized
work within the arts world.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.530
And we wanted to
tell that story.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.020
We also believed that if
audiences could experience this,

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.360
they might actually shift their
perceptions of orchestras.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.430
So for that reason,
Shift was the name.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.470
A shift in mindset, a
shift in perception,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.770
a shift in experience.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.360
So I hope if you travel
through the whole week with us,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.360
you will have that
experience yourself.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.440
We were inspired by
the multi-year series

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.070
of orchestral performances
in New York under the name

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.320
of Spring for Music that were
presented at Carnegie Hall

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.820
by Tom Morris, Marylou Falconi
and David Foster, and designed

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.800
to highlight creative
programming.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.470
We are very grateful for
their example and the impact

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.550
of their work and their lifelong
commitment to orchestras.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.940
From the get-go,
Washington Performing Arts

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.530
and the Kennedy Center
wanted to think expansively

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.710
and to extend the
notion of a festival

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.910
to many residencies
within a festival.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.950
And that's what this
week is about.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.560
We wanted to focus on orchestras
of all sizes, as you'll see.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.110
And we wanted to in some
way transpose the great work

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:29.870
that orchestras do
in their hometowns

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.510
and cities to our DC community.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.760
We believed that we had the
institutional commitment,

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.690
scale and partners
to undertake this.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.200
And we thought of
course what better place

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.870
to showcase this work than
in the nation's capital,

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.170
the seat of government,

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:45.510
the center of diplomacy
and policymaking?

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.050
And quite an extraordinary
arts community as well.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.790
Orchestras that applied to our
national call for proposals rose

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.820
to the occasion and the offered
programs and residency plans

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.350
that were ambitious,
specific and completely

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.430
and utterly reflective
of what they do well

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.850
and what they value.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.010
The ideas leapt off the
page, and coincidentally,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.390
all seemed to express
their unique identity

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.120
through very specific
collaborations, commissions,

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.060
partnerships and a healthy dose
of contemporary American music.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.180
American orchestras coming
to the nation's capital

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.230
with a bumper crop of American
works, we were inspired.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.240
Today's symposium
will give us a chance

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.830
to discuss why Shift
is important not just

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.200
in this hyper-focused lens
of a one-week festival,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.350
but more broadly in the
context of orchestras' value

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.830
within their communities.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.990
We'll look at the risks
and rewards of innovation,

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.880
explore what's gotten us to this
point, and we'll have a chance

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.640
to actually hear music with a
Play On Philly chamber ensemble.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.550
I'm very happy to have
music at the centerpiece

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.800
of this festival
and the symposium.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.330
From the get-go, the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation supported our

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.190
vision and provided
generous seed funding

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.820
that enabled us to
green-light Shift.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.390
And I'm very pleased that
Susan Fader can be here

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.930
to see how this all unfolds.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.830
Mellon support was matched by
Tina and Gary Mather, Michael

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.490
and Naomi Nidorf and the
Centine Charitable Foundation,

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.460
the DC Commission on
Arts and Humanities

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.060
which is an agency
supported in part

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.590
by the National Endowment
for the Arts.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.700
And also by the Abramson
Family Foundation,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.880
Betsy and Robert Fineburg,
Morton and Norma Lee Funger

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.050
and Daniel R. Lewis
among other donors.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.480
We're very grateful
for their support

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.060
and we could not have done
it without them, literally.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.300
Huge thanks to our teams,
boards, our partners

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.900
and to the participating
orchestras, the staff,

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.830
musicians and their boards.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.820
A special shout-out
to Samantha Polluck

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.950
from Washington Performing Arts,
and Jamie Brumus, counterparts

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.540
who worked so closely and
really bore the lion's share

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.980
of organizing this.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.280
They are treasures.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.450
And when you see them, thank
them, give them a squeeze.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.030
They deserve every good wish
and our great appreciation

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.700
for their efforts in
putting this together.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.830
And to Kathy French who
believed in this idea

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.170
from the very beginning.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.740
She was part of Spring
for Music and she is here

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.810
in Washington DC, and a
lifelong friend of the arts

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:01.550
and a longtime CEO of the
League of American Orchestras.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.650
Jesse Rosen is her successor.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:07.670
We're very grateful, Kathy,
for your support early on.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.970
We're so happy that so many of
you who believed in this early

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.790
on are here with us today
to see how this is launched.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.340
We're very grateful.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.100
So I'll play the role of MC
today, as you may have gathered.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.280
And very soon moderator
for the first panel.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.760
But right now it gives
me great pleasure

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.370
to introduce Rhona Wolfe
Friedman who is commissioner

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.910
on the DC Commission
of Arts and Humanities.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.570
She is one of our city's
most emphatic evangelists

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.640
for the arts and she's
a cherished friend.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.580
She's an attorney
with master's degrees

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.880
in clinical psychology
and decorative arts.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.220
She's hardly an underachiever.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.980
She's a remarkable and
accomplished woman.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.590
The focus of her advocacy and
commission tenure have been

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.890
in arts education policy
and also around quantifying

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.690
and growing the creative
economy in Washington DC.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.110
She is on the board of
THEARC, which is an acronym

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.490
for the Town Hall Education
Arts and Recreation Center.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:11:59.790
And she served on the boards

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.620
of the Washington
Ballet and Lab School.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.240
She is fiercely committed

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.030
to this community
and to its citizens.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.880
We've asked her to open
our symposium by speaking

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.030
about the importance
of Shift and orchestras

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.550
as an essential civic asset in
strengthening our communities.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.510
Please join me in welcoming
Rhona Wolfe Friedman.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:25.320
[ Applause ]

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.760
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
Good morning.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.290
I'd like to thank the
Library of Congress

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.870
for hosting this
wonderful symposium.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.560
And a huge debt of gratitude
to the Kennedy Center

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.890
and Washington Performing
Arts and the League

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.640
of American Orchestras for
their collaborative efforts

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.090
in presenting Shift, the
festival of American orchestras.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:51.420
How lucky we are in our nation's
capital to have a week-long,

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.680
immersive musical experience.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.210
The concept of Shift
defines what is happening

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.000
in the arts today.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.860
The Shift festival here
celebrates American music,

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.910
highlights different
size orchestras,

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.390
where they perform
and whom they serve.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.720
This focus on American
orchestras allows audiences

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.470
and participants to
educate themselves

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.300
about music perhaps
not familiar to them.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.420
At the same time, it affords
participating orchestras the

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.670
chance to showcase
new compositions

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.470
and perform their finest works.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.050
What a winning combination
we have here,

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.600
music and distinctive
outreach programs.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.420
We think about the
shifting landscape.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.720
I would like you to think

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.840
about President John F.
Kennedy's quote: "Art means more

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.280
than the recitation of the past.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.650
It means the free and
unconfined search for new ways

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.260
of expressing the
experience of the present

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.530
and the vision of the future."

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:03.450
In the broadest sense, the arts
including the humanities can be

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:08.350
thought of as the four
C's: curiosity, creation,

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:11.520
connection and communication.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:18.720
In 1943, Abraham Maslow proposed
a theory of human motivation,

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.860
now called the hierarchy
of human needs.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.440
It encompassed eventually
innate curiosity.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.740
He formed a pyramid with
base needs at the bottom.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.280
Safety, moving up the
ladder to love, belonging,

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.640
esteem and finally
self-actualization.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.620
I submit that the arts play
a vital role in meeting

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.440
so many of our human needs.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.720
They help provide an
understanding of our emotions,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.950
increase our self-awareness
and bridge the gap

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.030
between different cultures.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:58.190
How would a society be able to
preserve and share its culture,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:03.110
progress and valued
traditions if not for the arts?

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:07.700
People connect, thrive and
prosper through the arts.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.670
In our complex world today,
the arts are a necessary tool

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:17.070
to help manage the shifting
dynamic issues we face.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:21.430
We cannot replace the arts, nor
allow them to be diminished.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.230
They are a lens from
which to look at the past

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.070
and look forward to the future.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:31.670
Without the arts, we become
a silent society unable

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.560
to accurately evaluate
our surroundings.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:42.530
Orchestras as an indispensable
art form play an important part

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.830
in American life.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:48.060
They are part and parcel of
our life today in both large

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.790
and small communities.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:54.510
They improve the quality of the
cultural fabric of a community

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.410
and foster pride in
local neighborhoods.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.250
In 2016, Ian David
Moss discussed the arts

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.720
in the Stanford Social
Innovation Review.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.130
He suggested using a holistic
approach, tying the arts

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.220
into wellbeing and
quality of life.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.450
We can use this same approach
to expand the definition

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.620
of what an orchestra
is: promoting wellbeing

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.980
and enhancing the
quality of life.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:30.740
Orchestras are a critical
resource for arts education.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.470
Playing different instruments,

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:37.170
they demonstrate teamwork
at its highest level.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.790
Older models of music
education are shifting today.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.230
Schools with orchestra-based
programs are demonstrating

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.390
that their populations
have greater skills

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.930
than students lacking
a musical education.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.400
While students develop
musical talents,

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.780
they're also increasing
competencies in subjects

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.950
such as math and reading.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.910
To be pragmatic,
the arts make money.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.960
They are a critical
economic driver

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.480
and force in this country.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:14.260
Orchestras play a key role
in an economy of a city.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.360
They help populations develop
skills that are transferrable

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.680
and assist in the
revitalization of neighborhoods.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.520
Both large and small orchestras
understand that they need

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.460
to be relevant to
their communities.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.140
Today, they're engaging in
novel ways to include residents

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:38.430
with varying economic, racial
and social backgrounds.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.980
A necessary shift is
transforming the way orchestras

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.120
strengthen, broaden and
deepen their relationships.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.070
The shift is multidimensional.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:53.060
Orchestras are connecting
and serving the community not

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.610
by exclusivity but
by inclusivity.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:01.100
Orchestras should keep
advancing a very basic concept:

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.470
that a healthy community
must have an orchestra,

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.370
and demonstrate that this
orchestra is a powerful tool

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.570
to form connections and
promote vibrancy throughout

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.870
the community.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.570
Some approaches an
orchestra may consider

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:21.580
to remain relevant are
one, act with a purpose;

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.270
one that's directed outside
of the orchestra itself.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.870
Pursue goals that
serve community needs.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:33.200
Evaluate; evaluate what
works and what's dead weight.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.710
Move ahead with strategies that
are working and stay focused.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.450
Play towards strength.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.210
Reality can bite.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.900
Lessen the sting with realistic
goals that allow for shifts.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.080
Leverage the power of
orchestra leaders and musicians

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.730
to forge dynamic community
interactions through education,

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.630
networking and engagement.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.800
And last, reboot.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.020
Reboot to help work
for a paradigm shift

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.090
in the way a community
views orchestra.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:13.240
Encourage experimentation
in thought and action,

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.930
which brings me back
to the Shift Festival.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.110
Focusing on orchestras

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.990
in our nation's capital
is a powerful reminder

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.610
of their importance.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.120
This does not detract

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.230
from non-orchestral
musical expression.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:33.510
This creative festival moves
forward with goals, purpose

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.570
and community involvement.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:39.230
It demonstrates how music
can lift the human spirit,

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.330
how orchestras are
involved in our community

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:47.270
and for a $25 ticket, how people
can connect with an art form

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.850
that has withstood
the test of time.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.640
And finally, I would
be remiss as the member

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.730
of an arts commission
that receives money

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:57.820
from the National
Endowment for the Arts

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:02.650
if I did not offer a reminder
of how critical the NEA is

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.060
for sustaining the arts.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.820
Not just here, but in every
community in this country.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.010
The NEA sends grants to
every congressional district

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.310
in the nation.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.750
It's imperative to
fight for its survival.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:20.510
Thank you and please
enjoy the Shift Festival.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:30.100
[ Applause ]

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.400
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield:
Thank you, Rhona.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.880
That was such a perfect
introduction

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.360
to the topic of this panel.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.100
And I would love, having had
a chance to introduce Rhona,

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.160
to also introduce
the other panelists.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.330
To Rhona's left we have Thomas
Wilkins, the music director

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.550
of the Omaha Symphony,
principle conductor

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:48.100
of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra,
who also holds a chair

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.040
with the Boston Symphony for
family and youth concerts.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.510
He is so active nationally,
a very inventive programmer,

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.240
and I've had the pleasure
of watching his work

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.910
over many years,
and my kudos to you.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.390
I know that you're
equally committed

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:06.280
to community development
and arts education,

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.310
but well beyond the
arts as well.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.420
I was interested to see
that you're on the boards

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.190
of the Greater Omaha
Chamber of Commerce,

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.580
the Charles Drew
Health Center in Omaha,

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.810
the Center Against Spouse Abuse
in Tampa Bay, and the Museum

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.310
of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg,
which is very expansive.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.610
And I hope you'll speak

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.750
about how all these different
commitments and interests

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.390
and passions intersect
in your musical work.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.260
I'm also delighted that you have
studied at Shenandoah University

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.010
which is a source of wonderful
training and many musicians,

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.330
and also the New
England Conservatory.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.830
So you grew up not terribly
far from Washington.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.130
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Right.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.430
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Thank
you so much for being here.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.630
And then to my right, Stanford
Thompson who's a trumpeter

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.730
and executive director and
founder of Play On Philly

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.220
which you'll have a
chance to hear a little bit

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.770
in about 45 minutes or an hour.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.720
In 2010 he founded the El
Sistema-inspired program

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.260
in Philadelphia where
he currently serves

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.730
as executive director.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.920
And he secured over
$9 million in funding

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.140
which has definitely
impacted the lives of hundreds

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.540
of children in Philadelphia.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.990
He believes orchestras offer
us lessons in leadership,

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.010
innovation, diversity
and inclusion.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.150
And his work absolutely
speaks to that.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.180
His vision is very
sharp and focused.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.970
He's trained as a
professional trumped,

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.270
active across many ensembles.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.180
He performs and teaches,
collaborates,

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.480
conducts master classes.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.170
He's a native of
Atlanta, Georgia.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.140
So one of your orchestras
is coming to visit.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.640
I love that this
all ties together.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.110
Yes. And he holds degrees from
the Curtis Institute of Music,

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.070
New England Conservatory's
fellows program.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.120
He serves on the boards of
the Curtis Institute of Music,

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.260
Interlochen Center for the
Arts, the Philadelphia chapter

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.030
of the American Composers
Forum, and the El Sistema USA

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.450
and the Philadelphia
Wind Symphony.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.040
So thank you all for being here.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.670
Many different experiences and
approaches to our discussion.

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:53.970
I will sit down.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.770
I wanted to do a more
formal introduction.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.070
But thank you.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.370
And I was wondering if you
could speak a little bit

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.430
to what this shift if
from your vantage point.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:06.230
What's happened in the past ten
years that is noteworthy to you

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.990
and important to reflect upon at
this moment in this gathering?

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.290
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson:
Good morning.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:20.650
[Laughs] I think for me it
goes back a little bit longer

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.530
than just the past ten years.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:27.450
I think it's really important to
understand that the orchestras

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:32.740
that we enjoy today were built
around a social mission back --

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:37.240
gosh, starting in the
1880's, especially going

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.780
into the beginning
of the next century.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.060
These were immigrants that
were coming to America.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.390
They were setting
up new communities.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:50.130
If it was Minneapolis or Chicago
or Boston or Philly or Baltimore

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:54.830
or New York or Cincinnati or
Cleveland, what was important

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.320
to keep those communities
together was their culture

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.620
and their identity.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.920
And a lot of that revolved

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.530
around classical
music and orchestras.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.150
The musicians played an
important role in making sure

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.440
that community music
schools were set up,

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.170
that orchestras were established

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.820
and that they were actually
working hand-in-hand.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.770
Philadelphia's a
perfect example.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:14.840
1900, the orchestras form.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.620
1904, the Settlement
Music School.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.830
They were teaching kids in the
community for a nickel or less.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.130
And then they found out
20 years after that,

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.570
some of the kids
were pretty good.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.320
So they created the
Curtis Institute of Music.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.520
And for the first four years,

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.450
tuition was $500 a
year, a lot of money.

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.150
And they thought that was pretty
crazy because of course a lot

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.290
of the families could
not afford to pay it.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.700
So the woman who
founded the school,

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.170
who also founded the Settlement
Music School and also helped

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:46.240
to found the Philly Orchestra,
put down $12 million in 1928

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.010
to make sure that there
was a tuition-free policy.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.020
And there is this connection
between the musicians

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.940
that played and taught and
mentored, and it was all

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.440
around trying to in many ways
keep body and soul together.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.780
So all of that stuff
just blossomed.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.190
In the '60's it was wonderful

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.270
because then you had Wallace
Foundation and Ford Foundation,

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.570
a couple of others
that said, "You know,

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.610
I think that these musicians and
the music that they're providing

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:15.750
to the community should
be made more available."

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.980
So they turned orchestras
into full-time gigs, 52 weeks.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.710
And there was a shift.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:24.290
And the money shifted
towards those musicians.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.590
Endowments were created.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.220
Orchestras were more healthy.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.930
But the public, they
were picking up the cost

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.600
and making sure that
kids had access

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.130
to music in all the schools.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.320
And that worked,
until the early '80's.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.050
And of course that
infrastructure

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.320
in the public schools
started to fall apart

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.760
to what we are now experiencing.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.260
And it's at a point where
there's not enough public money,

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.990
but sure these [inaudible]
have a bunch.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.720
And that's where the money is.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.020
And I work with organizations
where we're trying

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.270
to I think collectively among
several of the boards that I'm

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.400
on -- we're trying to raise
half a billion dollars

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.700
for endowments.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.830
Now not to say that the
orchestras don't deserve them,

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.900
and they do, but when we
watch the infrastructure

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.410
for music falling
apart, knowing that used

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.640
to be a really strong
connection,

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.600
and it was important, then

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.580
of course what will
the shift be now?

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:24.990
So you know, I just think
that half a billion dollars

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:29.240
in Philadelphia for
example, that organizations

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.130
between the orchestra and Curtis
-- half a billion that they need

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:37.500
for their endowments -- I think
half a billion invested in youth

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.770
in the city would
definitely go a long way

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.390
with of course making
classical music

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.050
and orchestras much
more relevant.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.330
I think it would also open
up, and as we have found

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.660
in even the money that we
have raised, a vast majority

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.500
of that money comes
from education

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:58.120
and social service
private funders that want

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.770
to see something different.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.420
There's more money there.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:06.200
So when I look at the
Shift, I hope that the shift

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.700
that we make is that we
can no longer divorce those

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.900
who play music and those
who teach the music.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.880
Because I think both of those
actually working together is

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.270
exactly the infrastructure and
foundation that we really need

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:22.170
to build and grow professional
orchestras in the country.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.470
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Thank you.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.770
And I want to come back
to some of the themes

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.720
and give Tom a chance
to weight in too.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.400
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: There
was a time in my life

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.870
when I was really irritated
by the word relevance.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:35.940
Because I believed
-- and to your point,

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.650
it really goes back further
than the last ten years.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:43.140
We came with the word
relevant in our industry

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.880
because we were losing traction.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.670
And we were indeed losing
traction of funders as well,

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:53.180
but we were losing
interest in the population.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:58.170
And so we had to come up with
a way to justify our existence,

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:01.260
and so we started using
this word relevant.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.960
But I'm not convinced

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.150
that across the board we
were committed to relevance.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:12.020
I thought maybe a different
word would have been engagement

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.240
or deeper connection.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.750
I've wanted to be a conductor
since I was eight years old.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:25.000
And I first heard an orchestra
when I was eight years old.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.270
And I was born to a
single mother on welfare,

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.090
living in a housing project.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:33.100
And when I talk to funders
and leaders in communities

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.040
about this, I say that music
literally saved my life.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:40.150
And so I come at music from
a different perspective.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:44.330
If I believe that it is
life-affirming and life altering

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:48.320
in my case as it surely
is, why would I want

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.970
to leave anyone behind
in a community?

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.100
I'm not worried about Mozart's
ability to take care of himself,

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.350
or Beethoven's ability
to take care of himself.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.440
There's a reason why we still
listen to that music today.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.470
What I was worried about was
how we get that music to people

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:06.260
so that it can be life-altering
and life-affirming.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.200
And so I have always
believed that relevance had

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.570
to be earnest, and that meant
that we had to find ourselves

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.490
in places other than
a concert hall.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.700
And we had to be okay with that.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.790
And we had to be
comfortable with that.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.330
Because if you can't get past
need, you'll never believe

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.100
that this music is as
transformative as it is.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:32.520
And so I would like to think
that this idea of Shift means

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:37.170
that orchestras all across
this nation are really figuring

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.910
out that if this music is
as life-changing as it is,

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:46.570
it is incumbent upon us to
get it to as many entities

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.920
and people groups as possible.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.350
I often say that I try to
take my music more seriously

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.730
than I take myself.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.830
So I don't mind if I'm
sitting in a community center

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.410
at the Omaha Housing Authority
with kazoos and a room full

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.460
of people who don't
have any options.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:07.040
But now all of a sudden, here
is one that they do have.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.590
And it's the only one
that we have to offer,

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:10.890
but it's the best one.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.190
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Rhona,

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:14.540
is there something
you'd like to add?

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:15.840
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
Well, I know that as part

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.370
of the commission,
that's our goal,

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.460
is to reach out into
the communities,

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.600
especially in DC
east of the river

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.280
which is the underserved
communities in DC.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.460
And as a board member,
that's what we do.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:33.830
We bring music, art,
theater across the river.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.550
And I agree with
you wholeheartedly.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:39.630
I think if you don't reach out
into the community and connect,

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:46.150
and connect, not just reach out,
that music endeavors will fail.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.450
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Yeah.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.900
I think that part of it was --

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:53.710
I gave a speech to MOLA which
is the Major Orchestra Libraries

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.400
Association, because
my librarian

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.850
in Omaha hosted it one year.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.710
And it was called No
Excuses Necessary.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:03.910
And what I did just for fun
was I played three recordings.

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:12.540
One was Tchaikovsky and
another was something by Grieg.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:15.840
And when I played
those excerpts,

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.300
you could see all the
librarians in the room

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.860
and they were going, "Oh yeah."

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.000
And then I played the last

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.020
of Bernstein's Three
Dances from on the Town.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.020
Ba-ba-ba-ba-de-ba-da-ba-do-da.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.030
And you could see them
all kind of looking

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:32.330
at each other and smiling.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:33.630
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield:
Guilty pleasure.

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:35.000
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: And
my point was, you know,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.390
the Tchaikovsky is
actually a drinking song.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:40.430
"I found a coin,
I want a drink."

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.050
Forgive me, I don't know
what the exact title is.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:45.160
I Have a Coin, I Want a Drink.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.050
Those composers like
Tchaikovsky and Beethoven --

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:53.890
not so much Beethoven,
but Mozart for sure,

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:55.190
Marlor for sure --

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.900
they understood that if
their music was going

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.400
to have a mass appeal
to the general public,

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.860
it had to relate to them.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.060
And that's why we have
Klesber and Marlor

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.360
and that's why we
have folk music

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:10.310
and the whole nationalistic
sort of school of composition.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:15.120
But we in America almost feel
as if we have to apologize

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.770
when Americanism finds
itself in our music.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.400
We come up with words like,
"It's a synthesis of jazz."

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.900
You know, so that it
sounds intellectual.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.660
And I'm thinking, "Why should
we apologize for that?"

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.510
Why? Because we have always
believed that we operate

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.490
in basically a western
European tradition.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.030
And we believe that if
we don't live our lives,

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:41.660
speak our language and carry
our attitudes in that tradition,

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.490
that people aren't going
to take us seriously.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:45.790
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Right.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.090
And you've hit on so many
interesting things here.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.970
The first I want to
touch upon is this shift

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:55.090
from the let's call it
relevance from the purview

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.430
of one department, the
education community outreach

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:58.730
is responsible.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:00.030
And then the rest of
the orchestra does this

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.840
to actually shifting the
institutional DNA to be one

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:08.900
that is much more porous and
has that sense of excitement

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.020
from the top, from the
directors, the founders,

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:16.630
leaders, to feel and to be
very present with the community

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.280
and in the community and
to have the community feel

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.580
as if it's monolithic.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.880
But to have members

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.960
of the community feel very
part of the orchestra.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.630
And it's not simply to secure
that grant or to check a box.

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:33.660
It's actually to
fundamentally rearrange the DNA

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.560
of an orchestra to be a
community, a living, breathing,

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.860
evolving community institution.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.540
So that's a very
big shift as well.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.210
Ironically, in speaking
with European orchestras

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:46.510
which are the ones

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.150
that theoretically
American orchestras have

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:54.210
in the past tried to emulate,
some of the most adventuresome,

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.690
well-resourced education
programs

00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:00.300
and community-based
programs, are on display

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.680
with European orchestras.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.660
So as American orchestras,
our building that sense

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:08.410
of porousness -- so many
European orchestras have been

00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:11.910
in the vanguard of that through
very imaginative collaborations.

00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:15.060
I would love it if both of
you would speak about some

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:19.050
of the things that have
excited you most musically

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:23.440
when you have really been at
sort of the most open, engaging,

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:29.670
porous, as music directors, as
creative innovators yourselves.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:33.690
What are examples of moments
when that's come together

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:35.820
and just been so satisfying?

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.630
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson: Oh wow,
we shared one in Detroit.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.270
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield:
Okay, tell us.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.570
Perfect.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:42.870
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson:
This last month?

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:44.170
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: I think so.

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.470
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson: Right.

00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:46.770
Wow, yeah, last month.

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:50.240
This was at the SINCS
Conference and Competition.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.500
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield:
Explain what SINCS is.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.730
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson: It's a
20-year-old organization founded

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:04.260
by Aaron Dorkin who is now
the dean of the music school,

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.360
art school at University
of Michigan.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.000
But they've been focused over
the past 20 years in really kind

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.300
of pushing the diversity
and inclusion conversation

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.390
in the field of classical music.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.400
So a lot of success that they
have seen over that amount

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.450
of time, but they host
every year a competition

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:27.890
for string players, both
pretty much high school

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.610
and college age students.

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:35.680
And they also run side by side a
conference called SINCS Connect.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.570
And at the competition, after
the competitors were there,

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:45.770
we performed a piece by
Gerald Thomson, The Last Words

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:49.880
of the Unarmed, which literally
took the last words of people

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.900
like Trayvon Martin,
Eric Garner.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.930
But there were I believe seven
people that were highlighted.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:01.730
But it literally took the last
two or three words and put it

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:05.340
into a really, really
powerful 15-minute piece.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:10.380
And I will say it was the most
powerful experience I've ever

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.710
had on a stage.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:15.900
We all have been around
the conversations.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.410
We've seen everything
on the news.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.790
We've heard all the
arguments from all sides.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:23.530
But to have that
artistic display --

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.720
I'll never forget
the first rehearsal.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:32.470
I was playing the
trumpet in the orchestra.

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:36.190
But sitting there,
I mean it was tough.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.080
I mean, that first
rehearsal for everybody

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.310
in the orchestra was really
difficult to get through.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.350
And I believe the
connection that we made

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.980
at that performance was
something I've never felt,

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.280
I've never seen.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:53.100
And I just think when something
is -- to not use relevant,

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.980
but something that is that
engaging, that puts a spotlight

00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:00.520
on a really big problem that
we're having and that we've done

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.810
that through the
medium of an orchestra,

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:06.030
I believe that we made a
really powerful connection

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.260
that I think a lot of people
that were in that hall

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:12.390
that day will be
able to build upon.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:14.520
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: There
are several that I think of,

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:19.330
but we have in Omaha what
we call community partners,

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:23.080
and they range anywhere
from Nebraska Medical Center

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.870
to Girls, Inc., the
Omaha Housing Authority.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.610
So there are a lot
of things that we do

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.850
that are less attached to a
performance and more attached

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:36.450
to either delivering music or
delivering access to music.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.290
But for me, I still
have to go back

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:43.290
to this Omaha Housing Authority
example where we send musicians

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:46.390
out -- there's a retirement
center that exists there,

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:50.280
and these are indeed people
who have no options left.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:55.600
And most are elderly,
but some are not.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.840
This is just where they land.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.230
And so we send musicians
out on a regular basis

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.360
and our education person asked
if I would be willing to go out.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.750
I said, "Yeah, but
let's do something fun."

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.320
And we literally
brought in kazoos.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.780
I'm not kidding.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:17.300
And my job was to conduct
this now kazoo orchestra.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:21.090
And I must say that we
spent more time laughing

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:26.680
because there was nothing more
ridiculous than that scene.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:31.380
But what really sort of blessed
my heart was when they got

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.370
to come to my concert.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:37.060
Now in Omaha we have now
-- it's ten years old,

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:42.140
but at the time it was newer
-- $100 million concert hall.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.780
And these people didn't
even know where it was,

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.840
let alone walk in the building.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.260
And so not only were
they at the concert,

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.090
but then we closed
the hall afterwards

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:56.190
and we spent time together
in the room in the hall.

00:38:56.190 --> 00:39:02.630
And what was so poetic was that
here was this group of people

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:06.290
with no predisposition
to this music.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:09.740
All of a sudden,
this room was theirs

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.000
and this orchestra was theirs,
and this conductor was theirs.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.720
And in fact, one
of the ladies said,

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.010
"I feel as if this is all ours."

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.470
I mean, she literally said that.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:24.160
And you know, are they going
to buy a ticket down the road?

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.460
No, they're not.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:26.760
But we have done our job

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:29.110
in making sure that
they understand.

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.090
I mean, one of the great gifts
of music is that it tells us

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:34.300
that we were built for something
greater than the despair

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.120
that we probably experience
on a regular basis.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.650
And this was one
of those moments

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:40.900
when they could say,
"You know what?

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.930
I was made for something
better than this."

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:47.100
So for me that was my
best memory to date.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.530
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Yeah, I
mean two very profound moments

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:52.840
around music and shared space.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.200
And through the eloquence
of kazoo.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.090
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Or some
maybe even more profound, right.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:00.390
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Or
a commissioned work,

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:04.160
but in a very different
context, different repertoire,

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.150
but with a sense of
vision and leadership

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.670
that helped define that.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:13.800
And how well equipped are
orchestras to initiate

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.830
that conversation or
comfortable, confident reaching

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:22.770
out to partners who are perhaps
better equipped than they are?

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:29.660
Because not every institution
has a smooth transition

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.050
to new leadership,
to partnerships.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:36.510
Especially if an orchestra
is a dominant institution

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.240
in a community, sometimes
the messiness

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.180
of partnership can
be unfamiliar.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.760
So how do orchestras
embrace that?

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.780
And you've created an orchestra
and we would love these sort

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.370
of different perspectives
as you're starting up

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:57.900
and asserting a vision and
a presence and a mission.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.200
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Sure.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.930
Yeah, I think there's
a lot of fear.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:05.300
I mean, I remember when we
started, people were like,

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.600
"Are kids going to sign up?

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.130
Are they going to show up?

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:10.970
Are they going to drop
out in big numbers?

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:14.770
Why would they want to in our
program spend three hours every

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:18.620
day after school learning music,
especially classical music?"

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:25.540
And the same thing goes for our
I think partnerships all around.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:29.340
For example, what the
Philly orchestra does is

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.420
that they present
groups from the community

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.480
in the lobby before
performances.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.080
And there was some interest
from Simon Rattle to work

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.830
with our kids five years ago,

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.860
four and five years ago
when he was in town.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.890
And instead of having him
come up to the school,

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.820
he agreed to put the
kids on the stage right

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.930
at the beginning of the concert.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.940
The orchestra wasn't
going to play an overture,

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.780
but the kids were going to play.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.050
And it was a really scary thing
to go back and forth between,

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.600
"Should they be in the lobby or
should they be on the stage?"

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:06.030
The patrons did not pay to
hear students from west Philly

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:08.280
that had only been
playing a year and a half.

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.850
What would the union do?

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:13.030
And of course the musicians
have to warm up on the stage

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.480
for a certain period of time.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.790
And then what happens
if there's overtime?

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:19.300
And there were all
these questions.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.830
But I mean, it was
wrapped in a lot of fear.

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:25.060
Like how would the
kids handle that?

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.900
How would the audience
handle that?

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:28.720
Would it be uncomfortable?

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.820
Not to say the kids were
playing perfectly in tune.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.460
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: All the
negatives of fear, yeah.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:34.760
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Right.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.060
And what ended up happening is

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.970
that actually it was a
very magical experience.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.750
We even talked about
concert tickets.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.910
The orchestra makes
a lot of money

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:43.960
when Simon Rattle's in town.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:49.620
But parents bought tickets at
$90, $130 to be in the room.

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.080
When that sold out, we
opened up an overflow room.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.920
We set up a TV so that more
families could come in,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.290
and that room was packed.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.580
And in many ways there
was this connection

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.550
between the parents see
how hard their kids work.

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.850
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Yeah.

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.450
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: And of
course being able to now connect

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.800
that to a professional
orchestra and put that work

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.650
into perspective of what's
going on that's powerful.

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:16.990
The other part of it, to be
completely honest and candid,

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:22.530
there are not many opportunities
where a room full of people

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:28.650
who typically look like the
typical white audience in a city

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:31.760
like Philadelphia are ever on
their feet clapping for a group

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.190
of kids in west Philly.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:35.490
Honestly.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:36.790
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Yep.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:38.090
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: And
to see that connection

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:39.390
between kids standing up,
accepting that applause

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.680
at the end, saying, "They're
all clapping for me,"

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.180
and watching the parents
feel, "They're all clapping

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.420
for my kid," you know, I mean
that was a really powerful bond

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.760
that was connected and I think
has allowed our relationship

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.060
and partnership with
the orchestra

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.360
and many others to flourish.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:59.090
So a lot of it is we also both
organizations received big

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.220
donations after that.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.520
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Yes.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:04.820
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins:
In the seven figures.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.470
And it just was a
good thing to do.

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:09.420
It was a great experience.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:10.850
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: We've
done some of that here too

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.080
at Washington Performing Arts.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:17.300
We don't have the ensemble of
an orchestra on a regular basis,

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.600
but when there's an opportunity

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:23.260
to showcase either our
gospel choirs or some

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.520
of the young performers in our
education programs, we do it

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.210
and we do think about that.

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:30.820
Because we'll get
the nasty-gram --

00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.820
I will usually get the
nasty-gram from someone who paid

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.120
for one thing, they got another.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.320
And my response is
always, "You know what,

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.080
I'm so glad that you
came to the performance

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.620
and had the opportunity to
hear some of the young artists

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.590
who are working towards
perhaps being in the audience

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.030
or onstage in the future.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:49.330
It's part of our mission."

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:53.090
If there has been a residency
activity in the community,

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:56.120
I speak about it from the
stage every single time

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.240
because I think people
understand the finished product

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:01.290
because they come and
the lights and the stands

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:02.590
and everything is set.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:05.060
They don't necessarily
understand the granularity

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.360
of the process.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.310
They don't understand or they're
not even aware of the role

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:14.470
of the teachers in the classroom
playing side-by-side, the buses,

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:17.300
the parents driving,
the catering,

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.880
the kids taking time off
from studying, you know,

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.410
coming out early in the
morning, staying late at night.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.630
There's a process and
in some ways I worry

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:29.470
that we have orchestrated such
a polished finished product

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:33.040
that we've done it at
our own disservice.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:37.780
Because it's hard
to make the urgency

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:41.640
of supporting the finished
product really articulate

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.470
without showing the
process where the real time

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:47.250
and cost and investment are.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:50.390
And so I think with the question
of how all of this is going

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:54.300
to happen, we simply have
to say it is going to happen

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.050
and it's going to be awesome.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:59.670
And you're going to be really
sad that you missed it.

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.270
And it's that sort
of confidence.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:05.530
There will be cranky people,
people and organizations

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:07.230
that are insecure about it.

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.270
But it's the leaders of the
organizations who have to take

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:13.030
that deep breath and do it.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:15.450
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: We
at the Hollywood Bowl,

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:19.780
we on a regular basis are
joined by YOLA, Youth Orchestra

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.200
of Los Angeles, on stage.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.500
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Yes.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.340
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: I have had
them several times playing

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.950
by themselves and also
playing with the orchestra.

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:31.980
And we spoke in our
sort of pre-meeting,

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:34.320
we talked about this a little
bit, about how important it is

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:38.390
for us to give words to people
who are not in our business,

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:39.830
because they don't
know our language.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.550
They're not supposed
to know our language.

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:42.850
We shouldn't expect them to

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:45.110
and we shouldn't feel
bad that they don't.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:46.410
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Yes.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:47.710
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: It is our
job to teach them our words.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:52.640
And I will often say to the
audience, to the audience,

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:57.230
when they applaud for those
kids, how grateful I am

00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:59.480
that they took the time
to say to these kids,

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.040
"We are surrounding you.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.530
We believe in you and we want
nothing but the best for you."

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:07.940
And at that moment the audience
has nothing better to do

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.780
than to take that
responsibility.

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.030
And they sit up a little
taller in their seats and go,

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:13.330
"Oh yeah, that's right.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:14.630
That's what we're doing."

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:15.930
Therefore it is now
important to them

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:18.000
and now they understand
why YOLA is there.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.300
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Right.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.600
And consistently.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.900
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Right.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:23.200
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: It's
not just a one-off.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.500
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Right.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:25.800
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: It
becomes a regular diet

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.100
so that it's integral
to the organization.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.400
Rhona, I would love if you
would speak about the role

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.650
of the commission in supporting
so many important arts programs

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:35.400
that reach schools and kids
and professional musicians.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.040
It's a very wide
range of support

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.690
that the commission
provides to do much

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.770
of this sort of activity.

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.070
&gt;&gt; RWJ: We do.

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:45.800
We started with a very small
budget in a couple of millions.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.780
And we went up to $18
million and we're hoping

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.510
to go up to $25 million.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.510
Do you hear that?

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.160
[ Laughter ]

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:58.040
And we support a whole range
of different programming

00:47:58.040 --> 00:47:59.450
through our granting program.

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:02.000
We're a granting organization.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.010
And what we do is we have
different categories of grants.

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:07.770
We have startup organizations.

00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:10.270
We have large, we have a
heritage grant for those

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.520
that have been in existence.

00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:17.530
And people apply and through
a panel grants are awarded

00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:18.830
throughout the city.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:21.950
And we have a separate program
as I mentioned before for east

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:26.240
of the river to help empower
underserved communities.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.700
And you were mentioning
before about how you reach

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.630
out into the community.

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:38.370
And I want to take your point
of those of us, me included,

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:43.740
who were not raised in a musical
background, you do have to reach

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.580
out to the audience
and make them feel

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:51.010
that they're important despite
the fact that they know nothing

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:55.700
about the musical
instrument, the composition,

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.240
the notes on the page.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.860
And with that I think comes
-- and I call it connection.

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:02.190
I don't call it relevancy.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:06.700
I think it becomes a partnership
and I think it's important

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:10.710
for audiences to
partner with orchestras

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:14.170
and with musical events too.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:16.320
And that's what WPA
does so well.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:21.170
They go out into the
community and they reach

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:24.350
to all different
types of populations,

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.370
and they bring them
into their fold.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:28.110
Welcome them into their fold,

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:31.600
and that to me is why
WPA is so successful.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.900
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Thank you.

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.200
I mean one of the things --

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.580
and this was the
mantra of our founder.

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.970
And I was very pleased
to hear that the Library

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:38.270
of Congress actually has some

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:40.950
of Patrick Hayes' archives
on display outside.

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:42.770
I'm looking forward
to seeing them myself.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:45.580
But Mr. Hayes is remembered
for intoning the phrase

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:47.500
of "Everybody in, nobody out."

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.840
And so when we began to
design this festival,

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.690
we wanted the musicians
to be very visible

00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:55.740
and accessible to the audience.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.020
We wanted the price of
course to be accessible.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.600
We wanted to present
an experience

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.900
that would be really different

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.580
in the Kennedy center concert
hall and on our series.

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:07.060
And all of that agency
went to the orchestras.

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.240
But interestingly, as you'll
see throughout the week,

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.900
you're going to find
musicians at the title basin,

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.380
at the Hamilton, coaching at
schools, in galleries of art.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:22.320
The sense of finished product,
of accessibility is going

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.020
to be teased out in
very different ways.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.190
And every orchestra
and the musicians

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.620
who are making those commitments

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.060
to doing the residency
events were really excited

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.930
about doing it because
it's a way for them to get

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.500
to know our public,
to get to know you,

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.460
and to be very much themselves.

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.070
This is something that the
orchestras do organically

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:41.370
and well.

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:45.570
&gt;&gt; RWJ: And to build on
that is, in this city,

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:49.040
performing in different
venues is critical.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.780
As opposed to maybe smaller
cities or different cities.

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.530
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: And different
neighborhoods and communities.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:51:00.710
&gt;&gt; RWJ: Theaters, clubs, concert
halls, not just in a large,

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:05.890
expensive, ticket-based event.

00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:07.320
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield:
Yeah, and to your point,

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:10.940
there are many audiences who
come to an outdoor stroll-to

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:14.080
who might not wander
inside to a performance.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.380
&gt;&gt; RWJ: That's right.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:16.680
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: But
they've had an experience

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:17.980
that they might like to.

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.890
And we certainly see that
with our summer camps.

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:23.040
Kids have a first-time
experience with people who come

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.270
to some of our outdoor
performances.

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:27.120
We never know who's
in the audience

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.690
and when there's a chance
to get them excited.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:33.930
And that's something we think
about a lot as a presenter.

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:38.250
That experience has to compete
with what people experience

00:51:38.250 --> 00:51:42.120
on TV, the radio, what
they can dial up at home.

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:45.520
So it's about the musicians,
the creativity, the connection

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.000
that drives people to
experience this together.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.840
So when you said sharing the
space, I think that's something

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:56.510
that even more than relevant is
perhaps the most profound thing.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:00.360
It's the sharing of space
whether it's indoors

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:01.660
or outdoors.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:02.960
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson: Right.

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.760
I also want to add to that,
I think there are needs

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.870
of the community that also
need to be listened to.

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:11.920
And I think some of
that is people's voices.

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.220
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Right.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.520
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson:
When I think about --

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.280
I just don't understand
this blue team

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:18.550
versus red team,
urban versus rural.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:20.980
I mean, schools are
bad in both places.

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:23.390
Kids don't have what
they need in both places.

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:26.040
There are not enough jobs
or opportunities to grow.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.590
We're all in the same
boat and we're paddling

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:30.100
in different directions.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.890
And it's really easy
to say, "Well,

00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:33.690
I think we need another
youth orchestra.

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.420
We need another music camp.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.560
We need to curate
another performance."

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:44.030
And quite frankly what I'm
hearing from my parents

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:48.500
and from the kids is that
you, kids need an opportunity.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.530
I mean, their kids need
opportunities to grow,

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:53.870
to be challenged, to
be in an environment

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.220
where the bar is set
really high for them.

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:57.520
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Right.

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.820
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson:
Kids want activities.

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.120
They want to connect
with one another.

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.530
They want to feel
proud about something

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:04.300
that they have really
accomplished as a team.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:08.860
And I think that they want to
be seen in a positive light.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.270
They want their voices
to be heard.

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:13.300
That was powerful about
that performance in Detroit.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:18.050
We're saying we are
important in many ways.

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:19.350
We gave voice to that.

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:20.650
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Right.

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:21.950
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson: And we
did that through the orchestra.

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:23.310
Then you have everybody
that sure --

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:25.390
I mean, we need more taxpayers.

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:28.450
And we need safer
streets and we need people

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:29.750
that are more responsible

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:31.790
and that are contributing
back to society.

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:33.980
And we can give that back.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:38.350
But I just feel that when I
look at my Facebook news feed,

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:41.420
the big problem is what a
lot of artists are having.

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:47.480
And I just think that that's
not necessarily the solution.

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.670
It's really to say, what do
the people around us need?

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:53.470
And if we take care
of that first,

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:55.500
I know that we will be okay.

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.940
It's just, do we have
the will to do it?

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.820
Do we even have the
will to listen?

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.120
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Right.

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:05.210
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson: If not,
we will continue to create stuff

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:07.130
that folks just don't need.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:10.480
And they're not even there in
the audience to even hear it.

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:13.470
And then we rely on
a very small group

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:16.200
of people to keep this afloat.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:21.760
And I just don't think that
that's going to really get us

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.870
into the next 20 years
thinking that we're going

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:27.500
to be even more healthy.

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:28.800
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Yeah.

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.100
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: May I say,
just because I want to make sure

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.030
that it gets said, almost
to both of your points.

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:36.390
But you said something that made
me think of it, and that is --

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:39.420
it was actually your
notion about being willing

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:40.860
to play in different places.

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.180
What I say to my orchestra
is that we're not going

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.730
to run away from
our versatility.

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:47.660
We're going to run
towards that versatility.

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:48.960
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Yes, yes.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.460
&gt;&gt; Thomas Wilkins: Because you
mentioned in our phone meeting

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.400
that the orchestra
is like a community.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.700
It's a diverse group

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.700
of individuals working
together for a common good.

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:58.120
But at least in the
orchestra world,

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.660
we can become one
thing one night --

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:03.390
two weeks ago, we did Ben
Folds the first night,

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:06.240
Pete Martini the second night
and Chasiko the third night.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.020
Now those weren't all the same
people groups, but we were able

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:11.400
to be this for this
people, this for this people

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.230
and this for these people.

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:16.450
And we sacrificed
nothing in the process.

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:20.090
And sometimes that finds
itself away from the stage,

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:24.690
but in any case, it really is
more about us being willing

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:26.810
to be different things
at different times.

00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:29.400
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: So ultimately
we want our organizations

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.700
to thrive.

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:33.860
And you know, every generation
would say they're at sort

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:38.490
of an existential crossroads of
doubling down and understanding

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:41.700
and articulating what
they can do uniquely.

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.890
There's a very different
level of engagement

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:47.560
and frankly I think it's one

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.390
of the most exciting parts
certainly of our work here,

00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:52.850
is that there are so
many fantastic musicians

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:56.460
and creative people living
and working in Washington DC.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.180
As a former music publisher,
I knew from the numbers

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:02.260
that it had one of the highest
musical populations per capita

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.950
of any place in the country.

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:05.250
So many choirs here.

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:06.990
So many people making music.

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:09.640
And as I moved here and heard

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.290
and saw what people were
creating in clubs, the bands,

00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:17.090
the ensembles, the culturally
specific community performances,

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:19.190
I was blown away
and I thought, "Wow,

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:21.740
that could really inform
what we choose to program

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.180
and what we do together."

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:26.190
So we created a whole program
called the Mars Urban Art

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:30.370
Initiative where local artists
and visiting artists connect

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:34.070
and make music together, are
featured on our main stage,

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:37.760
are featured in free
performances, paid performances.

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:42.900
It's something that
it's not contrived.

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:47.770
It's a way for us
to be more fully --

00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:50.280
a fuller, more dynamic
organization.

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:54.420
Because we have local
artists who are fantastic

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:56.760
and who we can discover
and grow through.

00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:01.230
I mean the whole Go Go movement
here, we had David Harrington

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:05.660
with the string quartet
visiting a couple weeks ago.

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:07.510
And he's traveled
all over the world.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:09.980
I think many of us have
discovered new music

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:14.010
through his sort of cultural
anthropological lens.

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:17.370
And one of the little
girls in the class

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:20.500
that the quartet played
for raised her hand

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.440
after they had played music
from Armenia and Azerbaijan,

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.530
and she said, "Do you
play any Go Go music?"

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:29.380
And he said, "Well,
what's Go Go music?"

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:30.980
And she described it.

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.720
And then he came into my
office afterwards, he said,

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.500
"I have to hear about
this Go Go music."

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:37.880
And so we played
some Chuck Brown

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.930
and some covers and
he said, "Okay.

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:42.370
I'm always learning.

00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:43.670
I'm always learning.

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.540
And of course it would be a
10-year-old in the class."

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:50.710
And he had that sense of
curiosity and sense of curiosity

00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:53.850
about place and the
specificity of communities,

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:55.850
and learned something
at that moment.

00:57:55.850 --> 00:57:59.120
And that little girl who had
the courage to raise her hand

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:02.160
and push him perhaps pushed
him in a creative direction

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.680
that will inform
a future program

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:07.010
that we will bring
to our stages.

00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:09.800
And we presented the Go
Go symphony in the past,

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.680
but this could be an
interesting new collaboration.

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.540
So I think that's a
wonderful sense of discovery,

00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:17.330
if you feel it authentically.

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:18.720
We're always learning.

00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.450
Communities change,
evolve in different ways.

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:27.360
And I love that you're finding
resonant ways to support

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.640
that in your own
programming and work.

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.940
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
I wanted to say something

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.620
about arts and arts education,

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:34.700
which is very near
and dear to my heart.

00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:37.650
You mentioned about bringing
opportunities to youth.

00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:41.100
When the ARC was built as a
$28 million beautiful glass

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:45.270
structure in southeast, and it
houses Living School of Music,

00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:49.080
Washington Ballet -- it was
the Corkrane, now it's going

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:52.880
to be the Philips Boys and Girls
Clubs, and just a whole host.

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:56.850
And I was on the board of a
dance company at that time

00:58:56.850 --> 00:59:03.040
and we were really worried, if
we build it, will they come?

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.340
And we built it.

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:08.530
And they opened it and we said,
"Oh God, if we have ten kids

00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:12.050
to start in music and if we
have five kids in dance,"

00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:15.860
especially we wanted some
boys, not just all girls.

00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:21.980
We opened the doors and had
like 200 people the first day,

00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.100
400 within the first week.

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:26.350
And it's of course
pay what you can.

00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:28.360
But it was bringing
the opportunity

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:32.820
and giving people a
chance to do something

00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:36.570
and introducing an art
form to them, music, dance.

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:41.990
And it really changed the
landscape of the community.

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:43.460
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Yeah.

00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:46.050
So I know that we have a
performance to look forward to.

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:48.830
Are there sort of some final
words you'd like to share?

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:52.800
Or should we jump into your
introduction of Play On Philly?

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:54.320
&gt;&gt; Rhona Wolfe Friedman:
Jump into music.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.510
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Well, thank
you for a wonderful discussion.

00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:08.040
[ Applause ]

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.340
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson:
So we are really excited

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.470
to perform a brief
piece for you.

01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:15.020
First of all, I am
really, really proud of all

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.520
of our students at
Play On Philly.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.470
We brought about 50
or so down yesterday.

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:23.610
They performed at the
ARC and also made a stop

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:27.900
at Howard University, and
then I believe were running

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.770
around the monuments
late at night, till 11:00

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:32.210
or midnight or something.

01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:34.450
I can't remember what it was.

01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:38.840
But I'm really, really
proud of our students.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:44.040
They represent -- you'll see
about 20 or so on this stage.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.520
There's about 50 that came.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.940
There's several of our
students here on the front row

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.330
and several in the back.

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:52.180
So if you all could
give all of our kids

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.510
that are here today a
big round of applause.

01:00:55.510 --> 01:01:08.120
[ Applause ]

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.750
And also very, very thankful
for our teaching artists

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:14.440
that are here, and our staff.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.200
Especially Ryan Crump who
runs our high school program

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.300
and Chris Santentasio
who will be the conductor

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.790
of this ensemble.

01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:30.410
So they will perform Therondel
from Bizet's L'Arlesienne.

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:34.030
I grew up in Atlanta.

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:36.040
[ Laughter ]

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.340
I'm sorry.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:41.070
Yeah, I'm not built
for all that stuff.

01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:43.200
But they'll perform
that for you.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.320
I'm pretty sure that we'll
need about two minutes

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.700
to kind of get the stage set.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.240
And if I am correct,
after their performance,

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.200
I believe we'll take
a short break.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.500
Or do we?

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.800
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: We
have one more speaker,

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.100
then we'll take a break.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.400
Yes.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.700
&gt;&gt; Stanford Thompson: Okay.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.000
So just sit tight
for a little bit.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.300
But thank you for having our
students here to perform.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.600
So enjoy that.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.900
&gt;&gt; Chris Santentasio:
Good afternoon.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.750
My name is Chris Santentasio.

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:10.980
I'm the conductor of the Play
On Philly Symphony Orchestra.

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:12.280
Thank you for having us today.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.050
And we'll just begin.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:06:58.510
[ Music ]

01:06:58.510 --> 01:08:10.040
[ Applause ]

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:11.340
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Thank you.

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:13.410
Oh, please continue to join us
for just a short amount more

01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:15.880
and then we'll take a
break in a few minutes.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:18.160
But one of our many
special guests today,

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.550
it gives me great pleasure to
introduce Barbara Comstock,

01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:23.530
Congresswoman from Virginia.

01:08:23.530 --> 01:08:25.920
Although she recently joined
the Kennedy Center board

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.880
of trustees, Congresswoman
Comstock has been a consistent

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.010
and effective advocate
for the arts,

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:33.240
having spearhead the
formation of the Arts Caucus

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.830
in the Virginia House
of Delegates

01:08:34.830 --> 01:08:37.020
where she served in that body.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.060
The congresswoman was
elected this past November

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:40.780
to her second term in the House,

01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:42.740
representing the
nearby Virginia district

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.040
in the House of Representatives.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.890
She has been a supporter
for the arts and many

01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.280
of our local cultural
organizations.

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.900
We welcome her leadership.

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:52.090
In the House of Representatives,
the congresswoman serves

01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:54.160
on the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee,

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:56.880
as well as the Science, Space
and Technology Committee

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.950
where she is chair of the
subcommittee on research

01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:01.490
and technology, the House
Administration Committee

01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:03.100
in the US House of
Representatives

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.490
and the Bicameral Joint
Economic Committee.

01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:08.120
I now join each of you in
expressing our appreciation

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.420
for the strong voice she has
had in Congress on behalf

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:13.020
of northern Virginia and
metropolitan Washington.

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:15.360
We are honored that she is able
to be with us this morning.

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:19.510
Please join me in welcoming
Congresswoman Barbara Comstock.

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:28.060
[ Applause ]

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.230
&gt;&gt; BC: Thank you and
good morning to you all.

01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:33.680
It's a pleasure to be here and
to hear that wonderful group.

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.710
How delightful to see them.

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:38.820
And as I was seeing them walk
out, thinking with this kind

01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:41.980
of mentorship, with this kind of
support, they'll be able to --

01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:43.460
whatever community they go,

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:47.000
hopefully they will
find a music home

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.400
for themselves in
their communities.

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.940
And that's what we're
here celebrating today.

01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:56.390
So I'm honored to be on
the Kennedy Center Board,

01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:59.210
also a member of the Arts
Caucus as was mentioned.

01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:04.080
And also was able to start
an arts caucus in Virginia.

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.710
You know, we know our founding
fathers were patrons of the arts

01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:11.740
and understood what an important
part of our education it is.

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:14.900
Now it's estimated that there
are over 100,000 musicians

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:18.310
who perform and approximately
1,600 orchestras throughout

01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:19.610
the country.

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:21.510
So one of the things
there that I know

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:25.010
from supporting my own
local orchestra in McClain,

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:27.450
Virginia where I live,
just over the river,

01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:31.750
is that protecting
our charitable status,

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:35.190
tax-giving status, helps many
orchestras in our country.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:36.790
Because most of them
are organized

01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:39.980
as 501C3 tax exempt
organizations.

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:45.020
And it's also a great way that
any community, wherever you are,

01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:48.620
can give back and become
part of something local.

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:51.190
I'm also privileged to
have the Wolf Trap Center

01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:53.570
for the Performing
Arts in my district.

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:56.540
And one of the things that
we were able to do when I was

01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:59.290
in the state house
was to utilize

01:10:59.290 --> 01:11:03.330
that arts center
for STEAM education.

01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:06.860
So it's not just about STEM and
the science, but also understand

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:10.750
that arts works together, and
be able to have model programs

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:14.090
that now they are modeling
throughout the program

01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:16.310
and I believe throughout
the world.

01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:18.530
So young people here, we want

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:22.400
to catch them even
younger in the arts.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.680
So we do know we are going
to have some challenges

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.580
on that front coming
up, I imagine.

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:31.670
But I've always been
supportive of that.

01:11:31.670 --> 01:11:35.030
And last Congress, we
supported equitable access

01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:38.170
to the arts education
in the education bill

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:43.330
that we reauthorized, where the
bill sets aside approximately 30

01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:45.440
million to high-risk schools

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.110
so they can develop
an arts program.

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:50.200
Those have been somewhat
in decline and we wanted

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.430
to make sure that we
could reinvigorate that.

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:59.560
Now we also -- when you
have these local orchestras

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:03.230
and local arts groups,
local music group,

01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:06.170
you end up really
providing so much support

01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:09.190
for your youth orchestra
too, and mentoring.

01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:11.490
And they see people
who are engaged --

01:12:11.490 --> 01:12:14.760
I know in our local
orchestra we have a conductor

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:18.270
who not only is the conductor
for the McClain orchestra,

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:19.990
she travels all around
the country

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:21.460
and even all around the world.

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:25.470
So she brings back all of her
experiences and then works

01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:30.710
with her local artists who range
from professional musicians

01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:35.030
who are part of this to doctors
and lawyers and moms at home

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:40.780
who are sort of getting back
into the field in that way.

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:45.130
And I am always amazed when
I go to our local concerts

01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:48.840
to see the variety of people
who are in that program,

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.060
and then the quality
of our youth orchestras

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:53.190
because they are part of this,

01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:55.090
and that's a big part
of their program.

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:57.440
And they understand the
community support that's going

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.300
to be there for them.

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:03.070
So I really appreciate the
opportunity to be here.

01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:07.670
It's really something I
think that is a lifelong part

01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:11.640
of the learning process and
that the passion that is brought

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.660
to all of you who are supporters
of the arts, and transmitted

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:18.360
through all of our
communities and transmitted back

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:24.370
to our children is a very
important part of the heritage

01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:27.180
that we can pass on as
part of our country.

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:31.490
That's our privilege to be part
of the Kennedy Center and many

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:35.610
of my local arts groups in
order to continue that effort.

01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:40.650
So thank you for being here
today, and enjoy your day

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:45.680
and thank you for your support
and patronage of the arts.

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:51.040

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.340
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield:
Hello, everyone,

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:53.640
Jenny Bilfield back again

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.760
to introduce our
wonderful second panel.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.150
Hope that you enjoyed your break
and had a chance to look at some

01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:00.120
of the archives that library has

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:04.120
so generously set
out for us to enjoy.

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.300
It's my great pleasure
to introduce Karen Dillon

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:09.940
who will then introduce her
panel for risk and innovation.

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:12.940
Karen Dillon is a former editor
of the Harvard Business Review

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:15.390
and has long chronicled
the successes and failures

01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:17.490
of businesses and their leaders.

01:14:17.490 --> 01:14:19.540
She's currently a
contributing editor

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.530
to the Harvard Business
Review focusing on topics

01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:23.380
of leadership, managing people,

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:26.190
managing yourself
and entrepreneurship.

01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:27.490
She's a coauthor

01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:29.670
of the bestselling How Will
You Measure Your Life?,

01:14:29.670 --> 01:14:30.970
Competing Against Luck:

01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:33.540
The Story of Innovation
and Customer Choice.

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.860
And she was previously
the deputy editor of Inc.

01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.910
Magazine and served as
editor and publisher

01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:40.310
of the critically-acclaimed
American lawyer magazine,

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:42.300
the London-based Legal Business.

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.850
She is currently a global
ambassador for Legal 500,

01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:47.640
providing in-depth analysis
of the global legal market.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.940
She's a graduate of Cornell

01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:52.200
and Northwestern University's
Medill School of Journalism.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.830
And she was named

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.340
Please join me as she
makes a presentation

01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.010
and then invites
her panel to join.

01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:04.510
Thank you.

01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:12.040
[ Applause ]

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.670
&gt;&gt; Karen Dillon: Thank you
very much for the introduction.

01:15:13.670 --> 01:15:15.090
Good morning.

01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:17.740
Very happy to be here around
all these creative people.

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:19.040
It's very exciting to me,

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.150
especially talking
about innovation.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.420
Innovation, I come
with a business hat on,

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.580
but I know it is
a global problem.

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:28.070
It's a problem for
organizations of all sizes

01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:30.350
and types literally
around the world.

01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:32.030
And it's something
that in the pages

01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:35.350
of Harvard Business Review we've
been writing about for decades

01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:38.010
without showing much
signs of progress.

01:15:38.010 --> 01:15:40.990
It turns out we may be
innovative people and we think

01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:42.510
of ourselves that way,

01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:46.640
but by and large companies
stink at innovation.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.970
Let me show you why.

01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:53.240
This is data from Neilson which
scans all consumer goods sold,

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:55.560
things you might buy at
Target or the grocery store.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:57.660
And over a four-year period,

01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.860
there were 20,000 new
products launched --

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:01.520
these are in the
past four years --

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.810
all of which had smart people.

01:16:03.810 --> 01:16:05.630
They were good ideas, they
were things that seemed

01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:07.350
like they had all the
data and information

01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:09.320
to be sure these would be hits.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:12.460
Only 92 of them were
any definition of a hit.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:14.400
Most of the other
ones disappeared.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.360
That's a terrible
investment rate

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:19.950
for a company that's invested
time, money and energy in,

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:21.900
trying to create
something, a new innovation

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:23.270
that would bring
them more customers

01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:26.730
or make their customers
more loyal to them.

01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:33.340
The global consulting firm
McKenzie recently surveyed

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:36.070
global leaders, and 84%
of global leaders said

01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:38.120
that innovation was
extremely important

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.730
to the success of their company.

01:16:39.730 --> 01:16:43.310
If you look at the Fortune 500
from say 20 years ago and now,

01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:44.610
that will become very obvious.

01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:48.330
Many companies that were Fortune
500 staples then are gone

01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:49.630
from the Fortune 500 now.

01:16:49.630 --> 01:16:51.970
It's critical to
growth and staying alive

01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:53.540
and staying competitive.

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.810
But of those 84% who said
it was extremely important,

01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:59.590
94% of them were very unhappy

01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:02.270
with their company's
performance in innovation.

01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:04.420
For some reason,
really smart people

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:07.980
with good ideas keep
getting innovation wrong.

01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:11.740
What is it that we're not asking
or doing or knowing that means

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:13.040
that we haven't gotten better?

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.250
Organizations have not
gotten better at innovating

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:19.140
over the past decades, even
with all the data we have now.

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:23.220
The technology we can employ,
the way we can analyze things,

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:25.610
we're still not improving
our strike rate.

01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:26.910
Well, I will submit to you

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:30.520
that maybe we're asking
for the wrong things.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.750
How do you know what is going

01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:35.970
to make an innovation
successful in advance?

01:17:35.970 --> 01:17:37.750
Mostly, that 92 hits

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:39.680
out of 20,000 will tell
you it's a little bit

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.070
of a crap shoot, hit or miss.

01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:42.370
Try a lot of things.

01:17:42.370 --> 01:17:43.670
You hope you get it right.

01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:45.010
You think you understand
your customers

01:17:45.010 --> 01:17:46.310
or prospective customers

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:47.740
and you're going to
create something.

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:50.630
But is that really a
strategy: try, hit and miss?

01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:51.930
Is that good enough?

01:17:51.930 --> 01:17:54.180
Especially when you have limited
resources as I'm guessing some

01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:57.060
of your companies
and organizations do.

01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:58.650
Well, I'm going to
tell you a story

01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:01.330
about successful innovation
that has nothing to do

01:18:01.330 --> 01:18:04.540
with technology, has nothing
to do with focus groups.

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.840
It has everything to do

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:08.610
with understanding the
right questions to ask.

01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:10.690
This is a story where the hero

01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:14.380
of our tale is a humble
dining room table.

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:18.260
So there was a Detroit-area
construction and housing company

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.280
that built two-bedroom condos
on the outskirts of Detroit.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.580
And they were really lovely.

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.540
They priced them
competitively compared

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:28.110
to other condo types and things.

01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:29.920
They create all kinds
of features

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.900
that they knew people
would like:

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.240
granite countertops,
chrome appliances.

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:37.270
They aimed at downsizers,
people who were probably looking

01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:40.780
to move from their house into
a nicer, more upscale community

01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.080
that would make them
feel special

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.070
about the condo they were buying
and the life they were living.

01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:49.700
They had many, many people
come and look at those condos.

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.840
And yet very few of them
converted to a sale.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.140
They didn't understand it.

01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:58.370
They convened focus groups and
they asked prospective buyers,

01:18:58.370 --> 01:19:02.720
"What could we add to make
this a more attractive condo

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:05.170
for you to buy?"

01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:07.520
And those focus group
prospective buyers had no

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.300
shortage of ideas.

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:12.710
Bay windows, squeakless floors.

01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:14.460
"I want more options
and cabinets

01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.760
and the pulls on the cabinets."

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.060
They had a lot of ideas.

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:20.480
So they created the
showrooms to do that and show

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.170
that they could create
all of those options.

01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:25.120
Everything the focus
group participants wanted,

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.550
they created a show house,
show condo to demonstrate

01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:30.950
that that was all possible.

01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:32.470
That didn't work either.

01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:34.280
Sales did not improve.

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.160
And they were literally giving
prospective buyers everything

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.180
they said they wanted.

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:40.480
Then they brought
in a consultant,

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.530
a guy called Bob Mesta who was
asked to try to figure out,

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:45.060
how can we improve sales?

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:47.070
They blamed everything:
bad weather,

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:48.440
salespeople weren't good enough.

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:49.740
Maybe the hours were bad.

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:51.820
They tried to fix
all of those things.

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:54.430
And so Bob decided to
take a different approach.

01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:58.690
Instead of asking prospective
buyers what would make them buy,

01:19:58.690 --> 01:20:02.480
he asked people who had
already bought a condo,

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:03.780
"Tell me about the journey

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:06.640
to make the decision
to buy this condo."

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.510
They thought from that
they might be able

01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:12.500
to piece together the ideal
demographic or psychographic

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.800
of a prospective buyer.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.340
Did they all come from
certain zip codes?

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:17.110
Were they all certain income?

01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:20.070
Could you tell by the
car the actual age?

01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:22.920
As they went through
interview after interview,

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.690
they couldn't see a pattern.

01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:26.100
It was really random.

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:29.670
They could not predict based
on any data about that person

01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:32.650
if they were going
to be a buyer or not.

01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:36.750
But this one very strange
clue kept coming up.

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:40.970
People oddly kept mentioning
their dining room table.

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:42.410
"As soon as they
figured out what to do

01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:45.880
with the dining room
table, I was free to move."

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.570
That was sort of an odd thing,

01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:49.950
because in most cases they
were dining room tables

01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:52.970
from the 1970's,
well worn, dinged up,

01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:55.100
chunky old style
furniture, not something

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.390
that would even make sense
to bring into these lovely,

01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:59.390
sleek, two-bedroom condos.

01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:03.300
It was only as Bob
Mesta was sitting

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.920
at his own dining room
table over Christmas

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.330
that he had a revelation.

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:12.520
What does a dining
room table stand for?

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.750
Think about your own.

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:17.960
Family. Sitting at
a dining room table,

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.170
you've probably had
family celebrations,

01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:22.310
birthdays, Christmas, Hanukah.

01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:25.530
In my house we did homework
on it, we made forts under it.

01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:28.680
The dining room table was a
visual reminder of the life

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.550
that these people had built.

01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:32.100
Getting rid of it,
just throwing it out

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.380
or giving it to charity
felt hard.

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:37.400
It was giving away something
that meant so much to them.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.700
It was really a powerful
indicator

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:43.060
of the significance of the move.

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:46.510
With that insight, we
call that the aha insight,

01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:52.050
they realized something
else was going on.

01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:56.000
They weren't in the business
of helping people just move

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.400
to a new condo or buy a condo.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:02.900
They were in the business of
helping people move their lives.

01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:05.480
So when you think about
innovating, what did they need

01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:09.120
to do to those condos to
help people move their lives,

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.040
not just buy a new
place to live?

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.460
That changes the way you think
about what you need to add

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:16.940
or subtract to make
it more appealing.

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:19.080
They might have cared
about chrome appliances,

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.680
but that wasn't going
to trigger them to move.

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.800
But when they figured
out, "Okay,

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:26.970
we need to take something away,
20% of the second bedroom,

01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:29.640
to make room for the dining
room table," that allowed people

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:32.400
to not have to make that
decision about whether

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:34.300
or not they were actually
going to leave behind

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:35.600
that memory of family.

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.000
They could choose to take
it if they wanted to.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.760
They actually raised the
prices of the condos,

01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.940
made the second bedroom smaller

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:45.820
and then they added
a few small things

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:48.430
in that made a powerful
difference to people.

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:52.840
They created on-side storage
so that people didn't have

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.150
to get rid of everything
at one fell swoop

01:22:55.150 --> 01:22:56.470
when they were ready to move.

01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:59.780
They created a sorting
room on sight as well

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:02.930
so they didn't have to go
through every piece of artwork

01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:06.430
from their children's childhood
or calendars and cards,

01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:07.730
things they had saved.

01:23:07.730 --> 01:23:09.450
You could take two
years to do that.

01:23:09.450 --> 01:23:11.850
They increased the price a
little bit, added those services

01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:17.450
in and they were able to improve
their sales by 25% at a time

01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:19.580
when the Detroit area market
was having a very hard

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:20.880
time otherwise.

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.350
They were growing when
everybody else was shrinking.

01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:27.300
The aha is in what they
realized: people wanted

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:30.570
to move lives, not
just buy a condo.

01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:33.600
Now what is the significance
of this?

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.400
This illustrates
something I've been working

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.480
on with Harvard Business School
professor Clayton Christianson.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.420
He's been working
on it for 20 years.

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.520
Clayton Christianson has been
called multiple times the most

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.920
influential management
thinker in the world.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.420
And he's been struggling
for 20 years with the idea

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:51.500
of why are companies so
hit or miss at innovation?

01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:53.470
Why are they so bad at it?

01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:57.420
And that moving company
illustrates his answer

01:23:57.420 --> 01:23:59.300
to the question.

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:03.570
People don't just buy
products or services.

01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:07.300
They hire them, in his
language, to do a job for them.

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:11.370
And what we mean by that is what
we call the causal mechanism

01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:12.670
in academia.

01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:16.270
What causes what to happen is
not anything about the specifics

01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:20.930
of the product; it's about
how it helps them do that job

01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:23.150
that they're hiring it to do.

01:24:23.150 --> 01:24:25.430
Now this may just sound like
a simple language change,

01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:29.050
but we think it's a really
profound and significant change

01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:31.310
in the way you think
about innovation

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:34.890
so that people will actually
hire your product or service,

01:24:34.890 --> 01:24:37.180
in your case your organization.

01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:38.720
We mean something very specific.

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.200
We call it the job to be done.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:43.960
People are looking to bring a
product or service in their life

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.990
to help them make
progress on something

01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:48.280
that they're struggling with.

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.250
It's usually surrounded
with complex social

01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:53.970
and emotional components
as well, and it's always

01:24:53.970 --> 01:24:56.480
in particular circumstances.

01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:00.030
You can innovate successfully
if you understand the job

01:25:00.030 --> 01:25:02.060
to be done for people
who are your customers

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:06.070
or prospective customers and
offer a solution that does

01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:09.030
that job better than
anything else does.

01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:11.300
Now let me illustrate so
that you know this isn't just

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.210
different language
talking about it.

01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:15.390
Thinking about innovation
through the lens of jobs

01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:18.240
to be done changes everything.

01:25:20.410 --> 01:25:22.410
Table equals family.

01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:24.240
You can see the powerful social

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:26.680
and emotional pieces
of that ugly table.

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.880
That's fine, it is
an ugly table.

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.660
But that had nothing to do
with the function or meaning

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:32.150
of a table to dine on.

01:25:32.150 --> 01:25:37.160
It had to do with the emotional
and social pieces of that.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:41.100
Help me make progress -- that is
what people are looking to do.

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:44.580
And if your product or
service helps them do that,

01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:47.400
then you will successfully
bring people to your product

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.130
or service and keep them there.

01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:54.420
So what changes if you put on
the lenses of jobs to be done?

01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:58.160
Look at the problem through
that distinct point of view.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:00.640
Everything changes.

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:03.340
This is a Sony Playstation.

01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:06.750
Who's the competition
for Sony Playstation?

01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:11.440
Xbox, maybe Wii in the old days.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.740
Makes sense, right?

01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:14.040
And I know that they're
often compared side

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.340
by side in sales and prices.

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.780
That's how you look at it
and decide which one to buy.

01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:21.370
What if I told you this
was the competition?

01:26:22.770 --> 01:26:24.070
How about this?

01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:26.030
This is my solution.

01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:28.040
[ Laughter ]

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.190
These are these adult coloring
books, a new innovation.

01:26:30.190 --> 01:26:32.310
Have you seen those?

01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:35.300
These are all competing
for a different job

01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:36.600
than you might have imagined

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.000
when I showed the
Sony Playstation.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.110
They're competing for
the job of help me relax.

01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:43.150
Maybe when I get home from
work or on the weekends,

01:26:43.150 --> 01:26:45.460
help me do something that
will take my mind off

01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:48.080
of whatever else is
stressing me at the moment.

01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.280
Now okay, competing with those,

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.140
that sounds like a theoretical
thing, but is that really true?

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.060
That's exactly what
Netflix understands.

01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:57.410
Reed Hastings who's the founder

01:26:57.410 --> 01:27:00.370
of Netflix was asked how he
saw the competition with Amazon

01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:01.670
and their videos recently.

01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:05.080
And he said, "We compete with
everything you do to relax.

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.460
A bottle of wine may be
our toughest competitor."

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:11.180
If you realize you're not
just competing with things

01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:13.260
that are exactly like you,

01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:16.090
you completely broaden your
opportunities to innovate

01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:17.860
and bring more people to you.

01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:20.630
You are a solution
to a job to be done.

01:27:20.630 --> 01:27:23.300
If it's only something that's
exactly like you that you think

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:24.840
of as your competition,

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.020
you probably haven't fully
understood the reason people are

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:30.740
choosing to hire your service

01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.430
over any other possible
solution.

01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:35.940
The job to be done is complex
and the solution is complex

01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:40.080
and does not line up along
specific category lines.

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.600
And if you can just
begin to think

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.750
about what you're competing
with and open your mind to that,

01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:47.500
you'll be able to offer a
better solution than some

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.670
of those competitions that you
may not realize you're competing

01:27:50.670 --> 01:27:53.410
with in the first place.

01:27:53.410 --> 01:27:54.910
What does better mean?

01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:56.930
I said you'll be able to
offer a better solution?

01:27:56.930 --> 01:28:01.100
This is a little hard to see,
but there's an air mattress

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:04.400
up against the wall
in an empty room.

01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:09.580
This is not better than a hotel
room by most standards, right?

01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:11.270
You probably know
where this is going.

01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:13.320
This is Air BnB.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:16.640
Air BnB was founded not to
compete with hotel rooms,

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.210
which is what you might think.

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:21.460
It was competing with not
making that trip at all,

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:23.830
or staying with friends.

01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:27.100
And the people who hired Air
BnB in the beginning wanted

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.030
to be part of something
and feel local.

01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:31.420
They wanted to be able to attend
a conference or they wanted

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:34.390
to feel like they lived in the
city of Paris for a few days.

01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:36.550
It was competing with
something entirely different.

01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:38.660
It was competing with nothing.

01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:42.290
Competing against nothing
is a really good place to be

01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:43.590
when all other solutions

01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:46.250
for that job are not
better or nonexistent.

01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:48.310
The field is wide open for you.

01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:54.470
You probably know, Air BnB
is now valued at $30 billion.

01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:57.990
It's worth more than the top
several hotel chains combined.

01:28:57.990 --> 01:29:00.510
And maybe now they're competing
with some higher-end offerings,

01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:02.120
but the innovation came

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:05.410
from recognizing a
different job to be done.

01:29:05.410 --> 01:29:09.190
You would never have thought
that possible ten years ago.

01:29:09.190 --> 01:29:11.320
So okay, you might buy it.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.770
I like the idea of
job to be done.

01:29:12.770 --> 01:29:15.460
Well, how do I find
a job to be done?

01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:17.450
How do I locate it in my
community or the people

01:29:17.450 --> 01:29:19.660
that we want to deal with?

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:22.740
What you're looking for is what
people are struggling with.

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.840
You're looking for
struggles to make progress.

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:26.380
It's always about
making progress

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:28.450
in particular circumstances.

01:29:28.450 --> 01:29:32.640
And there are clues that people
give off without even realizing.

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:35.200
Good innovations are
ones that solve problems

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:39.910
that have bad solutions now or
don't have a solution at all.

01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:44.160
If your solution to a job to
be done is slightly better,

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.220
even a little bit more
than slightly better

01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:49.420
than other solutions to the
problem, you're not likely

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:51.410
to win people over to you.

01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:54.990
Slightly better does not
cause people to switch.

01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:57.380
We know from Nobel
Prize-winner Daniel Kahneman

01:29:57.380 --> 01:30:00.760
that people's risk aversion
of loss is so powerful

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:04.310
that they're far more likely
to accept the devil they know

01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:07.040
than to risk losing
that for something else

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.390
that may be slightly better.

01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:13.180
You have to be wildly better
or again, find an opportunity

01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:14.520
to compete with nothing.

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.350
That's where you'll find
innovation opportunities.

01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:22.380
You're looking for workarounds,
things people are doing to try

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.400
to make an existing
solution work for them;

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.860
that may give you a clue
that there's an opportunity

01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:29.710
to develop something
better here.

01:30:29.710 --> 01:30:32.060
This is a quick example
everyone's probably familiar

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.670
with, Quicken's personal
financial software

01:30:34.670 --> 01:30:36.910
which has been around
for a couple decades.

01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:41.490
That was on the market for
four years before the founders

01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:43.840
realized that something
funny was going on.

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:46.590
They got feedback every year
for those first four year

01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:49.540
that people were kind of
creating weird ways to use it

01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:53.010
for small business software,
to use Quicken for that.

01:30:53.010 --> 01:30:56.140
Funny ways, but they were
buying it for that and using it

01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:57.530
for their small business.

01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:59.470
And they ignored
it for four years

01:30:59.470 --> 01:31:02.700
because they thought there is
really good accounting software

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.920
out there that they can buy
that makes your books pristine

01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:08.350
and it's like having a
small accountant on staff.

01:31:08.350 --> 01:31:11.730
Then they kind of realized that
wasn't what people wanted to do.

01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:15.530
They wanted to not have to worry
about doing their books at all.

01:31:15.530 --> 01:31:16.980
They wanted it to be simple.

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:19.240
They weren't competing
with that small business

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.740
accounting software.

01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:22.760
They were competing with
hiring your brother-in-law

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:26.020
to do your books or stuffing
all your receipts in a shoebox

01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:28.580
and kind of getting around to
it at the end of the month.

01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:31.430
They quickly realized
that and corrected it.

01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:35.020
QuickBooks was launched
at twice the price

01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:38.140
of the best small
business accounting process

01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:41.660
and it was the market leader
within months and it still is.

01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:44.680
That whole company Intuit
focuses on the job to be done

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:46.920
with all of their
product innovations now.

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:49.660
Non-consumption.

01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:51.300
Basically you're
looking for something

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:53.760
where people would
rather do nothing than try

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.270
to solve their problems
because they don't like any

01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:57.630
of the solutions out there.

01:31:57.630 --> 01:31:59.730
Have any of you seen
those commercials on TV

01:31:59.730 --> 01:32:01.210
for Southern New
Hampshire University?

01:32:01.210 --> 01:32:03.710
There's a blue bus that's going
around the country handing

01:32:03.710 --> 01:32:05.780
out diplomas to people.

01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:08.430
If you haven't heard of Southern
New Hampshire University,

01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:09.730
SNHU I think they
call themselves

01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:11.120
in the commercials, you should.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:12.560
It's one of the biggest
success stories

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:15.010
in education in the past decade.

01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:17.430
Southern New Hampshire
University was the small,

01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:20.640
nondescript liberal arts
college it is in New Hampshire

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.110
that realized they
were in trouble

01:32:22.110 --> 01:32:23.520
like so many other small,

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:26.540
nondescript liberal arts
colleges not competing

01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:29.950
at the top level
about ten years ago.

01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:33.310
They knew every year exactly how
many students they would get,

01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:34.610
how many they'd compete

01:32:34.610 --> 01:32:36.230
with from these three
other local universities.

01:32:36.230 --> 01:32:38.120
The win and loss rate was
almost always the same.

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.690
There was no prospect of growth.

01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:43.640
And financial survival
was in question.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:46.880
Then they kind of realized they
did have this sleepy beginning

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.150
arm that was doing what
they call distance learning

01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:51.070
for people who didn't want
to come to campus but wanted

01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:53.170
to make progress
towards a degree.

01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:55.230
Their big aha insight was

01:32:55.230 --> 01:32:58.700
that that distance learning
wasn't competing with Harvard

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:02.510
or Yale or even the local
universities around them.

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:04.660
It was competing with nothing.

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:06.960
Those people who were doing
distance learning were trying

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:10.920
to decide if it was worth going
back to school to get a degree

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.380
when they perhaps had avoided it

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:14.210
or never had it in
the first place.

01:33:14.210 --> 01:33:16.310
Maybe I should just stick in
this job for two more years

01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:18.110
and try to get promotions.

01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:19.520
They would rather do nothing

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.950
than accept a really difficult
solution that would require them

01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:24.720
to drive to campus or
take weekends and nights

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.020
that they didn't have to work

01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:28.500
on extra credit projects
and things like that.

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.890
With that insight, you're
competing with "It's better

01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:34.210
to do nothing than to pursue
your education further,"

01:33:34.210 --> 01:33:35.710
they made sure that everything

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:38.230
about their online
program worked for people

01:33:38.230 --> 01:33:41.600
who were working long days,
weekends, maybe sitting

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.660
down at the computer
at 11:00 at night.

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.110
They didn't need to be as
good as Harvard in many ways.

01:33:46.110 --> 01:33:48.800
They needed to be good for the
job people were hiring them

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:52.050
to do, which was
make my life better.

01:33:52.050 --> 01:33:53.560
They've been wildly successful.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.590
They stage on campus I think
five separate graduation

01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:58.890
ceremonies now.

01:33:58.890 --> 01:34:01.230
Not on campus, the town's
biggest place, Verizon Arena.

01:34:01.230 --> 01:34:02.990
Because so many people
who have never set foot

01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:05.380
on campus all their
years towards a degree,

01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:07.360
come for that moment of
getting the cap and gown

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:08.660
and getting their degree.

01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.430
And it's a huge success story.

01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:14.600
They were competing with people
who were choosing to do nothing.

01:34:19.710 --> 01:34:23.230
Oops. My clicker's
not advancing.

01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:24.530
There we go.

01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:26.910
Look for unusual uses.

01:34:26.910 --> 01:34:30.800
Any of you ever knocked back a
couple of spoonfuls of Nyquil

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:33.780
when you really just
wanted a good night's sleep?

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.080
Lots of people do that.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:38.640
It turns out the company
finally recognized it.

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:41.030
They didn't need Nyquil, all
the ingredients in Nyquil.

01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:42.400
They needed sleep.

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.960
Thus, the birth of
Zquil which has none

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:48.340
of those cold medicine
things in it.

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:49.640
That was a clue.

01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:52.940
There was an innovation
opportunity to be had here.

01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:54.300
Jobs in our own lives.

01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:56.380
Most of us actually
know, if you think

01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:57.930
about things you're
struggling with,

01:34:57.930 --> 01:35:00.150
things that you wish
there were solutions for.

01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:03.790
You may be the best beginning
germ of an idea for a job

01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:05.270
to be done that you
can share with others.

01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:07.190
If you have it, others
might too.

01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:09.070
This is an illustration
of Care.com

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:13.280
which is the online babysitter
matchmaking service for parents,

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:15.490
and elder care and dog
care now as it turns out.

01:35:15.490 --> 01:35:17.560
That was founded by a
woman called Sheila Marcela

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:19.720
who was having trouble
finding a solution

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:21.440
for her own day care needs.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:27.200
And she created what is now I
think a $65 million company.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:30.610
Negative jobs, things we
do not want to have to do.

01:35:30.610 --> 01:35:32.990
People don't want to do
this, so any solution

01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:35.680
that makes it easier for
them to not fully do that.

01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:38.040
Think of the last
time you woke up

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.500
and your kid says they
have a sore throat.

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:43.290
You know it's probably
strep throat, but man,

01:35:43.290 --> 01:35:44.600
going to the doctor,
what a pain.

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.080
You have to call, wait
till the office opens.

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.090
You can't go in to
work for a few hours.

01:35:49.090 --> 01:35:50.660
You sit there and you know
they're just going to say,

01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:52.810
"Antibiotics," or whatever.

01:35:52.810 --> 01:35:56.420
Well, CVS Minute Clinic
was born when a dad sat

01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:58.000
in the emergency room
with his daughter

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.510
for just a little too long and
got a little too annoyed having

01:36:00.510 --> 01:36:03.110
to wait for what ended up
being a simple prescription

01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:04.410
of antibiotics.

01:36:04.410 --> 01:36:05.710
That was what we
call negative job.

01:36:05.710 --> 01:36:07.790
I don't want to have to do that.

01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:09.780
There's a solution
that is way better

01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:13.390
than having to do it, found.

01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:15.090
This is really important
to know.

01:36:15.090 --> 01:36:16.640
Jobs are not just tasks.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.700
They're not just
something functional.

01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:21.950
They involve experiences
and that's really important

01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:23.480
to understand, the experience.

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:24.780
This is where the social

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:26.730
and emotional components
of it come in.

01:36:26.730 --> 01:36:28.550
You can't successfully innovate

01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:30.620
if you just served
the functional need

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:33.510
of whatever it is, because the
other things are actually far

01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:35.350
more powerful.

01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:38.190
We believe that if you
actually understand the job

01:36:38.190 --> 01:36:42.180
to be done properly, customers
will pay a premium price

01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:45.500
for a solution that does it
better than anything else.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:48.700
So this is not a race to the
bottom; this is actually a race

01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:52.280
to give people what they most
value and most care about.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.410
Here's my favorite
case in point.

01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:56.580
American Girl Doll,

01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:59.880
the company's been
around for 30 years.

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.340
Many, many people have
tried to compete with it

01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:03.850
by creating similar dolls.

01:37:03.850 --> 01:37:05.150
You'll see them in
Target, you'll see them

01:37:05.150 --> 01:37:07.690
in the Disney Store, Wal-Mart.

01:37:07.690 --> 01:37:11.360
Have any of you ever paid the
current price, I think is $120,

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.150
for an American Girl Doll?

01:37:13.150 --> 01:37:15.340
Me. I've bought several of them.

01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:17.660
And then the wardrobe
on top of that

01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:19.960
which you could buy
an outfit for yourself

01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.700
for some of what you pay.

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.880
Do you think we're paying $120
for a doll because the dolls are

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:28.080
so special, the individual doll?

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.520
They're nice dolls, but I
don't think there's anything

01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:33.440
incredibly special
or unique about them.

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:36.260
We're paying for something else.

01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:39.310
What's the real job of
the American Girl Doll?

01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:42.490
It's a chance to connect
with our pre-teen daughters

01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:45.020
and nieces and children in a way

01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:46.970
that we didn't think
we could before.

01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:49.300
People said there
was no doll market.

01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:51.010
Girls aged out of dolls

01:37:51.010 --> 01:37:54.920
at age seven before American
Girl Dolls were invented.

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.730
And Pleasant Rowland the
woman who started it was told,

01:37:58.730 --> 01:38:00.690
"There's no chance that
this will succeed."

01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:03.030
The only options at
that age and stage

01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:06.460
up to age seven were Cabbage
Patch dolls in those days

01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:08.820
and really hyper-sexualized
Barbies

01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:10.300
and Bratz and things like that.

01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:12.520
And that wasn't a good
enough answer for her wanting

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:14.100
to connect with her nieces.

01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:17.990
American Girl Dolls not only
come in a very special box,

01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:20.450
the experience of going
with your mom or your dad

01:38:20.450 --> 01:38:22.350
to get your doll --
this is a sample.

01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:24.280
I actually took this
off someone's blog

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:25.580
where they were doing highlights

01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:26.880
of their cross-country
trip with their family.

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.180
This is one of their highlights.

01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:30.450
This is the American
Girl Doll restaurant

01:38:30.450 --> 01:38:31.750
where if you don't have a doll,

01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:33.850
you can babysit one
while you're there.

01:38:33.850 --> 01:38:36.150
They have birthday
parties there.

01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:38.490
There's something about
having that special experience

01:38:38.490 --> 01:38:41.580
with your mom and your dad
that people remember forever.

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:43.550
And the dolls all
have backstories,

01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:44.850
historical backstories.

01:38:44.850 --> 01:38:47.240
There's something that makes
us feel good as parents

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:48.970
about giving our children
American Girl Dolls

01:38:48.970 --> 01:38:50.280
because they're substantial

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.710
and maybe we'll have
conversations

01:38:51.710 --> 01:38:53.010
about the feelings.

01:38:53.010 --> 01:38:57.180
$120. I can't think of any
product that you willingly put

01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:58.880
up that kind of money for.

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.100
But this one absolutely
understands the job to be done

01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.690
and everything about the
American Girl Experience is

01:39:04.690 --> 01:39:06.100
tailored to that.

01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:09.010
Again, you put on the lenses
of seeing a job to be done

01:39:09.010 --> 01:39:11.930
and not just the function
of a product or service.

01:39:11.930 --> 01:39:14.030
Everything about
what goes into that

01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:15.990
and how you treat your
customers, how you talk

01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:18.420
to your customers, changes.

01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:20.740
So I'm going to ask you --

01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:22.420
I heard a lot of interesting
things this morning

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:25.030
at the panel discussion
about what job --

01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:27.380
you didn't use those words,
but that's what it was --

01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:30.370
what job orchestras
have to do now,

01:39:30.370 --> 01:39:32.510
or people want to
hire them to do.

01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:34.340
It's changed, clearly,
from the old days

01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:36.920
where perhaps it was clearer.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:39.830
Are you selling a product?

01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:42.560
Or are you solving
a job for people?

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:46.140
One of them will give you
ample opportunity to innovate

01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:48.430
and potentially charge
premium prices

01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:49.730
and competitive advantage,

01:39:49.730 --> 01:39:51.830
all things all organizations
want to have.

01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:53.130
Because people will know

01:39:53.130 --> 01:39:56.040
that you've helped them make the
progress that you want to make.

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:58.760
The other one is just as good;

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.970
the next competitor will
be compared side by side.

01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:05.510
You've reached success when
people don't shop around.

01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:08.350
They just know that they want
to go straight to your service.

01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:10.060
They want to go straight
to what you offer,

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:11.960
because it does the job
better than anybody else.

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:13.790
That's what we call
a purpose brand.

01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:15.320
You want to be a purpose brand

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:17.940
for what job you're
solving best.

01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.690
And I'm going to illustrate
this, the difference

01:40:19.690 --> 01:40:23.350
between talking about the
product you're selling

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:26.790
and selling your
response to a job.

01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:28.160
If you could show
the first video --

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.840
this is an old Snicker's
commercial.

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:35.980
&gt;&gt; Can I help you
enjoy that Snicker's?

01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:40.610

01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:43.310
over chocolate covered
mountaintops

01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:46.140
and waterfalls of caramel.

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:51.960
Prancing nougat in the
meadow sings a song

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.720
of satisfaction to the world.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:55.020
&gt;&gt; The world!

01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:56.320
&gt;&gt; That's right.

01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:05.320
&gt;&gt; Karen Dillon: Okay, we
heard about prancing nougat

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:07.070
and waterfalls of caramel.

01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:08.790
Those are all the
features and benefits

01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:12.410
and the quality ingredients
that go into Snicker's.

01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:13.990
Is that exciting
as a commercial?

01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:16.490
Do you think that makes
anybody want to go?

01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:18.840
Put on your own lenses
for your own organization?

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:20.770
Are you doing a version of this?

01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:23.790
Talking about the
ingredients and the quality

01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:26.990
and all the components
that you know are superior,

01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:30.710
but maybe just add up to a
list of things to offer people.

01:41:30.710 --> 01:41:33.110
Now from a different
perspective, if you put on a job

01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:35.680
to be done lens and you think
about, how are you talking

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:39.260
to your customer, how are
they seeing you as a solution

01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:40.560
to their job to be done,

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.880
you'll approach it
entirely differently.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.120
Snicker's now is one
of the bestselling --

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:48.070
I think it is the bestselling
candy bar in the United States.

01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:52.010
And one critical insight I
think led to that development:

01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:57.730
they recognized when and how
and why -- the job to be done --

01:41:57.730 --> 01:42:00.840
people actually hired
a Snicker's bar.

01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.520
It turns out a lot of us hire
it when we're hungry and angry,

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:07.570
a concept they call
hangry, right?

01:42:07.570 --> 01:42:09.070
It's not necessarily competing

01:42:09.070 --> 01:42:13.020
with Three Musketeers
or any of the others.

01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:15.950
It's competing with
peanuts or food or a meal.

01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:17.660
You're hungry and you
want to be fed quickly

01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:20.360
and you want something that's
going to stop that hangry thing

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:22.040
from taking over really quickly.

01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:24.610
If you watch in airports, you'll
see lots of people buy Snicker's

01:42:24.610 --> 01:42:25.980
and they think it's
people who are racing

01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:27.740
for planes and haven't had food.

01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:31.340
It's a very different job to be
done than just something sweet

01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:34.150
to fill me with joy
at the moment.

01:42:34.150 --> 01:42:36.090
So this is the approach
they've taken.

01:42:36.090 --> 01:42:38.780
It's a very clear job
to be done communication

01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:41.450
about hiring a Snicker's
bar when you're hangry.

01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:43.960

&gt;&gt; Karen Dillon:
See the difference?

01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:20.890
The fact that we all respond
to that second commercial means

01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:22.430
that we understand that concept

01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:25.140
and we might hire a
Snicker's when we're hangry.

01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:27.440
How are you talking
to your customers?

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.790
And your prospective
customers, and the customers

01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:31.190
that are hiring nothing rather

01:43:31.190 --> 01:43:32.850
than solving their
job to be done?

01:43:32.850 --> 01:43:35.630
Do you know what the
job to be done is

01:43:35.630 --> 01:43:36.930
that you've been hired to do?

01:43:36.930 --> 01:43:39.310
If you don't, I would urge you

01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:40.810
to think long and
hard about that.

01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:43.610
Talk to the people who
already have hired you and talk

01:43:43.610 --> 01:43:47.650
to people who haven't hired you
at all to try to identify that.

01:43:47.650 --> 01:43:49.600
Because once you
have that in mind,

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:51.690
it can become a real
guiding beacon for all

Gosh, there's so many
places to jump into this.

01:45:35.410 --> 01:45:38.330
The Snicker's commercial,
the first one

01:45:38.330 --> 01:45:41.640
with the guy singing
actually reminds me

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:47.260
of orchestra press releases and
brochures from not too long ago.

01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:49.780
Where they just heaped
praise and praise

01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:51.560
and praise upon themselves

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:54.500
in describing all the ways they
were wonderful in the same way

01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:56.680
that guy was singing
about the Snicker's bar.

01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:00.310
And now of course orchestras
communicate about themselves

01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:02.630
and express themselves
very differently.

01:46:02.630 --> 01:46:04.560
And maybe it's a place
to jump in to pick

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:09.920
up with Karen's last
question, which is, you know,

01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:12.120
how has our job changed?

01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:16.450
And there was certainly a
time I think when we thought

01:46:16.450 --> 01:46:20.380
about orchestras were doing
products and services.

01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:23.050
We created concerts
and people came.

01:46:23.050 --> 01:46:25.600
Now we kind of think we
maybe have a different job.

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.200
And Sandi, why don't you start
us off, maybe with a reflection

01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:30.500
on where we've been and
where we're going to?

01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:32.010
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald: Actually I'd

01:46:32.010 --> 01:46:33.830
like to reflect on
the presentation.

01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:36.500
What business am I in?

01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:39.130
Or what's the job
I'm trying to sell?

01:46:39.130 --> 01:46:43.450
So I believe that in the case
of the North Carolina Symphony,

01:46:43.450 --> 01:46:47.750
we are not seeking to
be the Chicago Symphony

01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:51.030
or the Cleveland Orchestra
or the Berlin Philharmonic.

01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:55.440
We are seeking to be the
orchestra of our community.

01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:59.000
In our case, we serve the
entire state of North Carolina

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.560
through orchestral
performance as well

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:05.330
as our music education series.

01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:14.570
And so we want to provide music
that is unique to our area,

01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:19.540
to our orchestra, because you
can get the greatest Beethoven

01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:23.240
symphony performed by the
Berlin Philharmonic --

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:24.860
they do that really well.

01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:29.800
But what we do very, very
well is produce concerts

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:33.220
that are meaningful to a North
Carolinian, and you will hear

01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:36.350
that tomorrow night
at our performances

01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:38.170
at the Kennedy Center.

01:47:38.170 --> 01:47:40.630
So my job is to find
those tentacles,

01:47:40.630 --> 01:47:45.580
to find those opportunities
to connect with our community

01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:47.520
in unique and different ways.

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:48.820
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: And is

01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:51.550
that a relatively new
development in orchestras?

01:47:51.550 --> 01:47:53.700
We've been in the field a while.

01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:57.710
Has it kind of been
that way for a bit?

01:47:57.710 --> 01:47:59.250
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald: I
came to North Carolina

01:47:59.250 --> 01:48:00.550
from the Cleveland Orchestra.

01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:06.460
I don't know that we spent a lot
of time talking about connecting

01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:09.190
to the musical DNA
of our community.

01:48:09.190 --> 01:48:10.520
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: Right.

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:12.180
And Kevin, how about you?

01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:15.820
How do you think about the
job of orchestras today?

01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:17.120
&gt;&gt; Kevin Shuck: Sure.

01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:18.750
I think there's a lot of
resonance in how we think

01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:20.510
about it at the Boulder
Philharmonic

01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:22.360
with what Sandi just
said in North Carolina.

01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.260
It's that well, in our case,
about eight years ago --

01:48:26.260 --> 01:48:30.000
so you're asking how
recently these kinds

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.860
of thoughts have been
in the orchestra field.

01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:35.280
About eight years ago our board
had done a strategic planning

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:38.610
exercise, whereas our
goal as an orchestra was

01:48:38.610 --> 01:48:40.050
to reflect those qualities

01:48:40.050 --> 01:48:42.990
that make our community
unique and special.

01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:45.630
Every community is
unique in different ways.

01:48:45.630 --> 01:48:49.990
And so I think in our case we
were just looking to tie music

01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:54.700
into in our case what
makes Boulder unique.

01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:58.400
And you know, I think that's
very much part of the Zeitgeist.

01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:01.460
It's what at League of American
Orchestras conference we're

01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:03.210
talking about a lot these days.

01:49:03.210 --> 01:49:05.610
And it's good to see
orchestras like this week

01:49:05.610 --> 01:49:08.800
that are having some
success in those areas.

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:10.320
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald:
We also codified --

01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:13.650
our board codified our
point of view on programing

01:49:13.650 --> 01:49:18.250
to be uniquely North
Carolina-focused

01:49:18.250 --> 01:49:20.370
and of national significance.

01:49:20.370 --> 01:49:25.290
But we've been doing this
work in the early 2000's.

01:49:25.290 --> 01:49:31.960
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: And Sarah,
a different kind of person

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:34.140
than Sandy and Kevin
and Karen and myself.

01:49:34.140 --> 01:49:35.680
You're a creator.

01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:39.240
And so how do you
think about this?

01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:40.850
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland Snider:
How do I feel about --

01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:42.150
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: How do you think

01:49:42.150 --> 01:49:43.820
about the job you
do as a composer?

01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:45.990
And has that changed for you?

01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:47.290
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland Snider: Yeah.

01:49:47.290 --> 01:49:53.320
Well, as a composer, I
think what drew me to music

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:56.790
from the very beginning
was the power of music

01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:59.570
to communicate and
express emotion.

01:49:59.570 --> 01:50:03.190
And as a child, I was just
utterly fascinated by that.

01:50:03.190 --> 01:50:06.010
And still to this day
I feel that my job is

01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:11.570
to communicate something with
an audience to put something,

01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:15.410
a feeling that you
can't put into words.

01:50:15.410 --> 01:50:19.240
That's what music
can accomplish.

01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:23.730
So yeah, I really see my job
as being one of communication,

01:50:23.730 --> 01:50:27.150
and that's not necessarily
true for every composer,

01:50:27.150 --> 01:50:29.940
but for me it definitely
feels that way.

01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:31.240
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: Great.

01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:35.150
And I'm kind of curious,
thinking about some

01:50:35.150 --> 01:50:38.810
of these changes that
are taking place.

01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:41.410
The question Karen poses
in her presentation

01:50:41.410 --> 01:50:44.420
about how do you know,
and how do you come

01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:48.140
to understand your
constituents, your public?

01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:51.130
And in the arts, this
is kind of a little bit

01:50:51.130 --> 01:50:52.890
of a different question
than it is in business,

01:50:52.890 --> 01:50:56.010
because after all, we're
not exactly prepared to give

01:50:56.010 --> 01:50:59.380
up everything we do in order
to become something else

01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:00.680
because it's more profitable.

01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:02.450
That's not our thing.

01:51:02.450 --> 01:51:06.540
So Kevin, talk a little
bit about this question

01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:08.920
of how do we balance
what we come

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:10.220
to know an audience is looking

01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:14.580
for with what we feel is
somehow defining of who we are.

01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:15.880
What can change?

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:17.180
What can't change?

01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:18.480
&gt;&gt; Kevin Shuck: Sure.

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:20.980
Well, the first thing about
the job that is to be done,

01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:25.100
I think with orchestra concerts,
I think it's a challenge

01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:27.650
because there are
different segments coming

01:51:27.650 --> 01:51:31.010
with different jobs to be
done in a single concert.

01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:34.020
So that makes it difficult to
balance all of these things

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:37.630
and to come up with a
satisfying experience.

01:51:37.630 --> 01:51:40.090
But it is also I think
a great potential

01:51:40.090 --> 01:51:41.930
for a very rich experience.

01:51:41.930 --> 01:51:44.640
And what I mean by that is
there are people that are coming

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:46.660
for the sole purpose
that they want

01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:50.350
to hear the great live jukebox
for this music they know,

01:51:50.350 --> 01:51:51.940
they've learned and they love.

01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:54.060
And I think that's the
traditional job that we think

01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:55.360
of orchestras as doing.

01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:58.290
Well, you can still do that and
at the same time be thinking

01:51:58.290 --> 01:52:02.080
about what are the social
reasons that people are there.

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:06.480
And I think there's
a lot of resonance

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:07.780
to what Sarah was saying

01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:11.550
about the emotional
resonance of music.

01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:15.630
I think orchestras are uniquely
positioned to create community.

01:52:15.630 --> 01:52:20.470
In our current world where it
is highway, suburbia, fast food,

01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:23.160
these things, people are looking
for a place where you can come

01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:25.220
and there is an authentic
connection.

01:52:25.220 --> 01:52:28.760
Orchestras are uniquely
positioned to do this

01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:31.600
because we are bringing together
people in a shared space

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:33.180
for a shared experience.

01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:36.020
It's something very
different from the day-to-day,

01:52:36.020 --> 01:52:40.070
and I think that that is
something that we can harness

01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:45.530
as organizations to really
create something very special.

01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:50.710
And so as far as the job to be
done, I think that you know,

01:52:50.710 --> 01:52:52.910
certainly there's
this relaxation

01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:54.590
or leisure time bubble.

01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:56.740
And so we think, who are
we competing against?

01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:58.600
We're competing against Netflix,

01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:00.430
we're competing against
the couch.

01:53:00.430 --> 01:53:03.500
So really when you look
at this leisure bubble,

01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.990
you're really talking about
there's a subset of that

01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:08.280
which is in some way
people are looking

01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:11.030
for something that's more
fulfilling or enriching

01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:14.340
or special or has a night
out component to it.

01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:18.100
And so I always think that our
biggest struggle is growing the

01:53:18.100 --> 01:53:20.930
piece of that leisure
time relaxation pie

01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:24.670
that people are looking for
those kind of quality outlets.

01:53:24.670 --> 01:53:27.930
And so I think that leads a
lot of the thinking that we do

01:53:27.930 --> 01:53:30.410
about how are we going to
get people into concerts.

01:53:30.410 --> 01:53:32.020
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: So I
know a lot of people

01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:36.170
who would violently disagree
with the idea that going

01:53:36.170 --> 01:53:37.610
to an orchestra concert's
a great way

01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:38.910
to be together with
other people.

01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:40.670
I mean after all,
it's a terrible time.

01:53:40.670 --> 01:53:41.970
It's 8:00 at night.

01:53:41.970 --> 01:53:43.680
You have to rush through
dinner, you get home late,

01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:45.650
you have to listen to music,
some of it you might like

01:53:45.650 --> 01:53:47.750
and some of it you
might not like.

01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:51.340
And it's really expensive and
you can't talk, you can't drink

01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:55.040
and it's formal and
rigid and uncomfortable,

01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:57.380
unlike most other
performing arts experiences.

01:53:57.380 --> 01:53:59.350
So unless I'm --

01:53:59.350 --> 01:54:03.050
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald: Where
do I buy a ticket for this?

01:54:03.050 --> 01:54:05.090
[ Laughter ]

01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:06.390
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: I think
there might be more than one

01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:07.690
or two people who feel that way.

01:54:07.690 --> 01:54:10.300
So how does an orchestra
confront some

01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:13.550
of these very changing
ways that people feel

01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:16.180
about going to concerns?

01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:18.510
&gt;&gt; Kevin Shuck: Well, you've
ticked off a lot of barriers

01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:21.510
that we are always looking
at and talking about.

01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:25.020
I think one way we
think about it is,

01:54:25.020 --> 01:54:27.010
how can you put out
the welcome mat.

01:54:27.010 --> 01:54:30.940
Because yes, if a newcomer
to the performing arts,

01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:33.170
orchestras in particular,
is just looking at it,

01:54:33.170 --> 01:54:36.950
all of those negatives are
just too easy to think of.

01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:38.970
So instead we try
to think about,

01:54:38.970 --> 01:54:41.080
what are the entry points, what
are the doorways we can create,

01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:43.920
what are the welcome
mats we can put out?

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:46.560
And so in our case at
the Boulder Philharmonic

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:50.850
in Colorado, I mentioned
that we are trying

01:54:50.850 --> 01:54:53.250
to reflect the qualities that
make our community special.

01:54:53.250 --> 01:54:57.650
And so a lot of times that means
meeting people where they are.

01:54:57.650 --> 01:55:00.710
In Boulder, that usually
means on a trail somewhere.

01:55:00.710 --> 01:55:04.870
I think last week it was the
city with the highest rate

01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:07.000
of exercising or
something in the country.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.790
It's very overachieving
in many dimensions.

01:55:09.790 --> 01:55:16.470
And so in our case, we thought,
okay, well how do we meet people

01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:19.870
on their turf so to speak and
create a welcome mat there?

01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:26.450
And in our 2013-2014 season
we were exploring works

01:55:26.450 --> 01:55:28.330
that were inspired
by the natural world.

01:55:28.330 --> 01:55:31.250
When you come to Boulder,
that's one of the first things

01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:34.250
that you notice is we have
this very scenic backdrop,

01:55:34.250 --> 01:55:36.290
and that's what draws
a lot of people there

01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:38.560
and that's what people
are actively enjoying.

01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:40.030
So that's part of your
culture and that's

01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:41.980
where people are spending
their leisure time

01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:43.330
and that's what their
interests are.

01:55:43.330 --> 01:55:46.050
How can you then convert that
into a welcome mat to get people

01:55:46.050 --> 01:55:47.760
into the concert hall?

01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:52.310
So since we had a list or
repertoire of composers

01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:53.700
that were inspired by music,

01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:57.020
we were commissioning new
works along this vein as well,

01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:58.800
we had the crazy idea to reach

01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.170
out to our city open
space department

01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:02.920
which is a big deal in town.

01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:05.580
And I wrote them a
letter basically saying,

01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:08.010
"We're performing music
inspired by nature.

01:56:08.010 --> 01:56:09.310
I think we should collaborate."

01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:13.750
And I went ahead and mentioned
a few possibilities for this,

01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:16.890
thinking that they'd either
just laugh me aside --

01:56:16.890 --> 01:56:18.440
but within two days
I was meeting

01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:21.280
with the entire senior staff
of the open space department.

01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:22.780
Because they said,
"That's exactly what we're

01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:24.080
interested in."

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:27.050
So we've been using our
collaboration with them

01:56:27.050 --> 01:56:28.710
to create that welcome mat,

01:56:28.710 --> 01:56:32.610
to kind of put all
those negatives aside

01:56:32.610 --> 01:56:36.430
and actually show that it can
be something that is social.

01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:41.570
People on the trail are enjoying
conversations, sharing music.

01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:43.120
And when they come
to the concert hall,

01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.420
it's the same as well.

01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:47.280
During intermission,
people are buzzing.

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:52.040
I met people that I met
on a hike that we do.

01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.730
Then I'll see them at the
concert hall and it's like,

01:56:53.730 --> 01:56:55.030
"Oh that's just amazing.

01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:58.720
When I heard that piece, I
could just see the geese flying

01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:03.270
over the Sawhill
Pond," for example.

01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:05.130
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald: Kevin
mentioned collaboration

01:57:05.130 --> 01:57:11.210
and I think that is an area
where we invest a good amount

01:57:11.210 --> 01:57:16.110
of our time to create
programs where we collaborate

01:57:16.110 --> 01:57:18.130
with another organization.

01:57:18.130 --> 01:57:24.120
One example is the Museum of
Natural Sciences in Raleigh.

01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:30.120
The museum created visuals that
celebrated the 100th anniversary

01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:34.230
of the state parks
of North Carolina.

01:57:34.230 --> 01:57:37.470
We performed the four seasons.

01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:42.060
And together, this performance
which couldn't resonate

01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:46.200
in any other state
than North Carolina,

01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:48.110
our audience members --

01:57:48.110 --> 01:57:51.990
which expanded to the museum's
audience members as well

01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:54.930
and those people just
interested in the state parks --

01:57:54.930 --> 01:57:57.400
brought together the sum of all
those parts, something bigger

01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:02.640
than any one of us could have
been, and create a performance

01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:05.400
that can't be replicated
by something else.

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:11.050
Listening on the radio -- how
old of me to mention a radio.

01:58:11.050 --> 01:58:13.090
[ Laughter ]

01:58:13.090 --> 01:58:15.400
Or you know, watching
Netflix or doing nothing.

01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:17.290
You had to be there
in that space

01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:20.760
to see those three critical
elements brought together

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.120
in performance.

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:23.730
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: I love it.

01:58:23.730 --> 01:58:25.540
And Sarah, you've
created a piece

01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:28.350
that the North Carolina Symphony
is going to play in a couple

01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:30.490
of nights, on Wednesday night.

01:58:30.490 --> 01:58:33.200
And I understand that that
came together in a way

01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:35.690
that also really
brought people together.

01:58:35.690 --> 01:58:37.330
Could you talk a little
bit more about that?

01:58:37.330 --> 01:58:38.630
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland Snider: Sure.

01:58:38.630 --> 01:58:41.760
Yes, so a few years ago Martin
Share came to me and said,

01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:44.940
"I understand that you have
some family connections

01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:46.240
to North Carolina.

01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:48.850
Would you be interesting for
writing a piece about that?"

01:58:48.850 --> 01:58:50.590
And I jumped at the opportunity

01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:52.720
because North Carolina
has always felt

01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:56.370
like my spiritual home,
my ancestral home.

01:58:56.370 --> 01:58:58.980
My family had been
there for 13 generations

01:58:58.980 --> 01:59:02.650
and my father was the first to
leave and he worked in New York,

01:59:02.650 --> 01:59:03.950
so we lived in New Jersey.

01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:06.280
But we would spend a lot
of time during the year

01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:08.250
in North Carolina and
I really thought of it

01:59:08.250 --> 01:59:10.950
as this place where I belonged.

01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:15.170
So I was very excited to write
this piece, and I thought,

01:59:15.170 --> 01:59:16.580
what should it be about?

01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:20.490
I thought it should be
about those feelings

01:59:20.490 --> 01:59:22.760
of what does home mean?

01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:24.340
And what is a longing for home?

01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:25.640
What does that feel like?

01:59:25.640 --> 01:59:27.140
What is that about?

01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:28.440
You know, is it about family?

01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:29.740
Is it about landscape?

01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:32.810
Is it about the things
that you did there?

01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:36.390
So I decided that I would try to
write a piece about the nature

01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:41.920
of memory and longing
for a place in your past.

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:44.770
And I had this idea that
it might be interesting

01:59:44.770 --> 01:59:49.550
to combine it with a film
component, because so much

01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:53.920
of my memory of North Carolina
was sense memory based.

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:55.700
You know, the way things looked,

01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:57.590
the way the sunlight
cast shadows

01:59:57.590 --> 02:00:03.010
on my grandparents' patio,
the way that the town looked.

02:00:03.010 --> 02:00:05.180
The things that I
did with my family --

02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:06.870
I thought it would be
interesting to look at some

02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:09.960
of that from an abstract,
cinematic perspective

02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:12.790
and to have that
accompany the music

02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:19.400
so that it would be this kind
of dreamy exploration somewhere

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:21.940
between memory and a dream.

02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:24.520
But one that the audience
would have some kind

02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:28.690
of reference point for
the emotionally journey

02:00:28.690 --> 02:00:30.910
that the music was exploring.

02:00:30.910 --> 02:00:33.670
So we went down to
North Carolina

02:00:33.670 --> 02:00:35.960
and shot some footage actually

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:39.250
of my own children
recreating some of my memories

02:00:39.250 --> 02:00:42.350
and my father's memories.

02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:46.690
Yeah, so it became
a real sort of look

02:00:46.690 --> 02:00:49.980
at small-town life
in North Carolina.

02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:53.230
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: And it's been
performed already, right?

02:00:53.230 --> 02:00:54.530
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland Snider: Yeah,

02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:57.140
they performed it several times
last year in North Carolina.

02:00:57.140 --> 02:00:58.810
And also in New Jersey.

02:00:58.810 --> 02:01:00.430
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald:
Your hometown, yes.

02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:02.280
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland Snider: Yeah,
the other co-commissioners,

02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:05.660
the Princeton Symphony
which was the actual place

02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:09.720
of my birth and growing up.

02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:11.020
So that was neat as well.

02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:12.950
But yeah, they performed it too.

02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:14.250
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: Yeah.

02:01:14.250 --> 02:01:15.640
And how did the origin
of the work --

02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:18.970
I mean, when it was finally
performed, what kind of impact?

02:01:18.970 --> 02:01:21.950
What was the significance
of all that led

02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:25.010
up to creating the piece when
it finally came to the public?

02:01:25.010 --> 02:01:27.170
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland Snider: Well
that was what was so remarkable,

02:01:27.170 --> 02:01:29.880
was having all of these
friends and family

02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:31.620
from North Carolina
come to the premier.

02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:34.800
And they felt so
emotionally connected

02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:36.610
to the piece and what they saw.

02:01:36.610 --> 02:01:38.340
And for them it really resonated

02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:41.190
with their own memories
of North Carolina.

02:01:41.190 --> 02:01:43.580
So that was really
extraordinary, just the senses

02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:47.530
of community that was
brought about by the project.

02:01:47.530 --> 02:01:49.830
A number of the people had
participated in the making

02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:52.380
of the film, had recreated a lot

02:01:52.380 --> 02:01:55.400
of these social scenes
that we shot.

02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:59.890
So it really felt like this
galvanizing collective memory

02:01:59.890 --> 02:02:02.270
exercise in a sense.

02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:03.840
And that was really
special, yeah.

02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:05.800
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald: And
we were able to perform it

02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:10.330
in the community that evoked
all of these memories.

02:02:10.330 --> 02:02:12.120
So it was very North Carolina.

02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:16.100
And we've had two performances
of it there and performed it

02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:19.070
in other locations including
our headquarter hall in Raleigh.

02:02:19.070 --> 02:02:20.370
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: Right.

02:02:20.370 --> 02:02:21.670
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland Snider:
And that's what's amazing,

02:02:21.670 --> 02:02:22.970
is actually a lot of people from
North Carolina are traveling

02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:25.180
up for this performance.

02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:26.480
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald: Yeah.

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:27.780
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland Snider:
They feel a sense of ownership

02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:29.080
and investment in it,
which is really special.

02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:32.850
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald:
Sarah is a star.

02:02:32.850 --> 02:02:34.300
[Laughs] I just hear a
job in that right away:

02:02:34.300 --> 02:02:36.520
make me feel proud of
being a North Carolinian.

02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:38.970
And you've checked
all those boxes.

02:02:38.970 --> 02:02:41.070
It's maybe about the music,
but the music is a way

02:02:41.070 --> 02:02:42.610
to achieve the progress, right?

02:02:42.610 --> 02:02:43.910
Make me feel proud of it.

02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:46.600
I hear success and a job there.

02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:47.900
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland
Snider: Thanks.

02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:49.200
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: So I'm
thinking back to Karen's slide,

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.140
the one that showed
92 out of how many?

02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:54.720
&gt;&gt; Karen Dillon: 92 out
of 20,000 products, yeah.

02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:57.860
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: So listening
to you, it sounds like we're

02:02:57.860 --> 02:03:02.570
in the 92 camp, that somehow
we've figured this out.

02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:03.870
&gt;&gt; Karen Dillon: Right.

02:03:03.870 --> 02:03:05.170
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: I mean, people
have written so many books

02:03:05.170 --> 02:03:08.260
about innovation, it must
be hard and complicated.

02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:12.640
So I'm curious, as you
go through these changes,

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:14.060
is there any tension
around this?

02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:16.000
Or is it just you've
got it all figured out?

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.140
&gt;&gt; Kevin Shuck: I think
there's inevitably tension

02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:23.440
when you go outside of the
box of a traditional art form.

02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:28.250
I think that's just kind
of taken for granted.

02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:33.430
But, well, two things about the
words both innovation and risk.

02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:35.480
I really don't like to
think that we're trying

02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:37.060
to innovate all the time.

02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:40.040
That's actually not kind
of the vocabulary we use.

02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:41.370
We're instead trying
to be creative.

02:03:41.370 --> 02:03:45.880
And I think that it's about
looking for the connections,

02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:49.540
looking for ways that music
can reach different parts

02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:50.840
of your community.

02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:53.070
In doing that, the
end result is often

02:03:53.070 --> 02:03:55.730
that your programming
is innovative.

02:03:55.730 --> 02:04:00.090
But we're not pursuing that
in and of itself as our goal,

02:04:00.090 --> 02:04:02.160
because I think that leads
you down the rabbit hole

02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:04.320
where you could be doing
things that are different just

02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:06.510
for the sake of being different.

02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:11.040
Rather than if you are
following from the standpoint

02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:13.910
of where the art takes you,
where that creativity takes you,

02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:16.740
then it leads you into
a more authentic place

02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:18.530
that might happen
to be innovative.

02:04:18.530 --> 02:04:22.890
And I think that as far
as, is there a tension --

02:04:22.890 --> 02:04:27.760
I mean, there are certainly
traditional audience members

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:30.210
who are happy with the
music just the way it is.

02:04:30.210 --> 02:04:33.540
In talking to a lot of
people I hear this, "Well,

02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:36.170
I understand why you're
doing that," because they see

02:04:36.170 --> 02:04:39.360
that our audiences are
growing by leaps and bounds.

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.770
So they see the effect of it,
they are invested in the music,

02:04:42.770 --> 02:04:44.470
they want it to be successful.

02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:46.810
So they get behind it.

02:04:46.810 --> 02:04:49.460
Even though that's not the
job I guess they're looking

02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:51.990
for the concert to
fulfill for them,

02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:54.740
we're able to bring them along,
because they see the effect.

02:04:54.740 --> 02:04:57.370
They see that it is
done in a way again

02:04:57.370 --> 02:04:58.960
which is authentic
and not gimmicky.

02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:00.900
Which again, I think if
you focus on just trying

02:05:00.900 --> 02:05:04.680
to be innovative, that's where
you can end up a lot of time.

02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:07.720
And so that's how we've
been able to manage that.

02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:09.020
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald: I
would just argue though,

02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:10.320
that might be doing
the job for them.

02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:12.040
The job for them might
be, "I want to be a pillar

02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:13.960
of this community and
this is the way I feel."

02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:17.100
If you think narrowly
about what the job is,

02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:20.070
again you think innovation is
a rabbit hole, it might be.

02:05:20.070 --> 02:05:24.960
But if you think about the job
and you only add or focus on how

02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:27.680
to make that experience
better, they still feel

02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:28.980
like a pillar of the community.

02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:30.280
Maybe you've done it better

02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:31.580
because you're a
growing organization.

02:05:31.580 --> 02:05:33.090
It's not an either/or.

02:05:33.090 --> 02:05:37.150
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: So if
the job of orchestras,

02:05:37.150 --> 02:05:40.460
or among the jobs are creating
experiences that connect

02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:43.000
with people, connect
with community

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.480
and move beyond the
transactional product,

02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:50.300
we're selling the concert --
so is this good for business?

02:05:50.300 --> 02:05:51.870
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald: Certainly.

02:05:51.870 --> 02:05:54.080
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: Because you're
running businesses too, right?

02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:55.380
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald: Yeah, yeah.

02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:56.680
We're running business
and we worry a lot --

02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:58.330
I spend a lot of time
worrying about risk

02:05:58.330 --> 02:06:01.900
and limiting the risk,
the financial risk.

02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:07.820
And so we've come up
with some solutions

02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:11.030
that reduce the risk for us.

02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:15.210
So for example, everyone
wants the millennial audience

02:06:15.210 --> 02:06:19.020
and the illusive
millennial audience.

02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:23.770
And so there was a time
we would put on a concert

02:06:23.770 --> 02:06:26.350
that had hybrid music in it

02:06:26.350 --> 02:06:30.820
and our marketing department
would be in the corner stewing

02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:33.540
about selling tickets and where
are they going to come out,

02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:37.550
and let's get food trucks
and let's sell martinis.

02:06:37.550 --> 02:06:41.570
Moving away from actually
what our business is.

02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:46.380
And a couple of years ago we
decided, let's take that money,

02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:49.770
let's eliminate the tension
within the organization.

02:06:49.770 --> 02:06:54.300
Let's talk to our
musicians about a concept

02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:59.900
of giving them money to develop
a program that would be held

02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:06.220
in for example a club in
our case in downtown Raleigh

02:07:06.220 --> 02:07:07.660
that I would not go to.

02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:09.910
Well, maybe Sarah
would go to it,

02:07:09.910 --> 02:07:11.860
but most of us might not go this

02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:15.190
because we wouldn't even
know about the club.

02:07:15.190 --> 02:07:18.920
The marketing would
not darken my door.

02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:23.170
And you know, can we
be more successful

02:07:23.170 --> 02:07:26.100
at reaching an audience
that we're not reaching

02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:28.780
in a traditional performance?

02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:30.920
Close up and personal
with our musicians

02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.780
who have chosen the repertoire
they're going to play,

02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:34.280
who have used their
social network

02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:36.310
to bring people to the concert?

02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:38.560
And let's not charge
a ticket price.

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:42.050
Let's have a cover charge.

02:07:42.050 --> 02:07:45.800
And so those reduce
the financial risk.

02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:48.460
Let's not put these in big giant
halls, because they don't belong

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:49.910
in big giant concert halls,

02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:53.140
and stew about filling
all of those seats.

02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:55.980
And let's make the
connection that way.

02:07:55.980 --> 02:08:01.250
And so that's an example of
it making sense both in terms

02:08:01.250 --> 02:08:07.040
of resource and inspiration, I
posit to our musicians as well.

02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:08.840
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: And are
you seeing positive changes

02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:12.440
in attendance at the
North Carolina Symphony?

02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:13.990
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald:
Over time, we have, yes.

02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:19.080
Yes. We've grown our
ticket revenue by $1 million

02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:21.420
in this planning cycle
that we're in right now.

02:08:21.420 --> 02:08:24.100
We're at the end of a
five-year planning cycle.

02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:27.490
And that's by doing a
variety of different things,

02:08:27.490 --> 02:08:31.570
not just performing Beethoven
symphonies, but making sur

02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:33.890
that we're reaching out
to the entire community.

02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:35.780
Yeah.

02:08:35.780 --> 02:08:37.530
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: Kevin,
how about you?

02:08:37.530 --> 02:08:38.830
Good for business?

02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:41.360
&gt;&gt; Kevin Shuck: Yes,
it's good for business.

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:46.650
Since 2009 our ticket sales have
grown 66%, subscriptions 44%,

02:08:46.650 --> 02:08:49.810
contributive revenue
by similar amounts.

02:08:49.810 --> 02:08:52.100
And I think it's because when
you do this type of work,

02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:56.160
you're increasing the
number of stakeholders

02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:57.950
in your organization
and the community.

02:08:57.950 --> 02:09:00.170
So if you do one of
the collaborations

02:09:00.170 --> 02:09:01.710
like what Sandi was
talking about,

02:09:01.710 --> 02:09:06.440
which is a really key
part in these years,

02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:09.680
45 different organizations
we've collaborated with.

02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:12.050
And some of these are
what you'd expect,

02:09:12.050 --> 02:09:13.810
other performing
arts organizations,

02:09:13.810 --> 02:09:15.670
but some are what
you would not expect,

02:09:15.670 --> 02:09:17.420
like social service
organizations.

02:09:17.420 --> 02:09:21.660
Or nature and science
and youth organizations.

02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:24.730
And every time you do it, you're
going to get new ticket buyers

02:09:24.730 --> 02:09:28.170
in the door, maybe just
for that one concert.

02:09:28.170 --> 02:09:31.690
A certain portion will come
back, but even for the people

02:09:31.690 --> 02:09:35.220
that didn't come to the concert,
they now have a touchpoint

02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:36.630
for your organization.

02:09:36.630 --> 02:09:41.590
So they think that, oh, this
organization supported something

02:09:41.590 --> 02:09:46.230
that I care about,
so it's a checkmark

02:09:46.230 --> 02:09:48.790
in your column for good favor.

02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:50.650
And I think that
community goodwill can't

02:09:50.650 --> 02:09:53.710
be underestimated.

02:09:53.710 --> 02:09:57.520
The snowball effect I
think is really what it is,

02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:59.900
is that each time you
do something like this,

02:09:59.900 --> 02:10:01.370
it's another ripple in the pond.

02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:04.410
You're reaching additional
people.

02:10:04.410 --> 02:10:07.510
And sometimes we go
to a lot of effort

02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:12.040
for something we think is a good
idea, that really makes sense,

02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:15.310
and maybe the impact is not
as big as what we'd hoped for.

02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:19.420
And sometimes it goes beyond
our wildest projections.

02:10:19.420 --> 02:10:21.000
But it's a cumulative effect.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.580
And it's I think committing
to this type of approach,

02:10:25.580 --> 02:10:28.990
systematically and organically
throughout your organization

02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:32.340
which over the long
run has these benefits.

02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:33.640
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: Right.

02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:36.030
Sarah, I'm not going to
ask you about business,

02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:40.860
but I am interested -- as a
creative person working a lot

02:10:40.860 --> 02:10:45.030
with orchestras, what's
the optimum for you

02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:47.350
in a relationship with an
orchestra that allows you

02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:52.030
to fully realize all of
your artistic aspirations?

02:10:52.030 --> 02:10:53.330
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland
Snider: You know,

02:10:53.330 --> 02:10:54.890
I've had a really
extraordinary experience

02:10:54.890 --> 02:10:56.850
with North Carolina
working on this project,

02:10:56.850 --> 02:10:59.260
because we've had
multiple performances,

02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:00.980
multiple rehearsals.

02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:04.310
Getting that kind of time to
get to now a conductor and get

02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:08.020
to know the members of the
orchestra, the administration,

02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:13.160
really enables the project
to go that much deeper and be

02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.460
that much more satisfying.

02:11:14.460 --> 02:11:16.730
I've since revised
the piece a few times,

02:11:16.730 --> 02:11:20.860
and I'll be revising it again.

02:11:20.860 --> 02:11:26.500
So yeah, I think that having
any kind of second performances,

02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:27.800
multiple performances

02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:29.660
for a composer these
days are pretty unusual

02:11:29.660 --> 02:11:30.960
in the orchestral world.

02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:35.620
So having a chance to go deeper
is really pretty extraordinary.

02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:41.840
But I think any time that an
orchestra can take a moment

02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:46.100
to really work with a living
composer is an incredible

02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:47.560
experience for everybody.

02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:49.670
I mean, it's great
for the community,

02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:52.290
it's great for composers
obviously.

02:11:52.290 --> 02:11:56.230
It's great for the orchestra
to feel connected to living,

02:11:56.230 --> 02:11:59.760
breathing music that
they can have a role

02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:01.980
in introducing to the world.

02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:04.390
I just think the more

02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:07.880
that living composers can
be introduced to orchestras,

02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:09.360
the better for everybody.

02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:11.600
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: Yeah, kind of
the center of the whole thing.

02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:12.900
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland Snider: Right.

02:12:12.900 --> 02:12:14.640
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: So Karen, you've
had about three hours to get

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:18.460
to know the wonderful world
of orchestras [laughs].

02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:23.920
From what you've
heard, challenge us.

02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:27.350
You're an expert on this stuff,
on shifting and changing.

02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:29.270
What words of wisdom?

02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:31.670
&gt;&gt; Karen Dillon: One word of
wisdom I would sort of pass

02:12:31.670 --> 02:12:34.020
on from Clayton Christianson
-- they're not original to me.

02:12:34.020 --> 02:12:38.410
But the reason that so many
great organizations ultimately

02:12:38.410 --> 02:12:42.880
fail when faced with competition
from what he calls disruptors --

02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:46.190
small upstarts that initially
you don't see as a threat

02:12:46.190 --> 02:12:48.210
and then little by little
they gain market share.

02:12:48.210 --> 02:12:51.720
Great example is Blockbuster,
now bankrupt, and Netflix.

02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:53.390
Netflix was a disruptor.

02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:56.040
His theory is called the
theory of disruption,

02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:58.270
more famous than the
theory of jobs to be done.

02:12:58.270 --> 02:13:01.710
It's that the incumbent,
the established company,

02:13:01.710 --> 02:13:04.140
in the face of that
competition they get nervous

02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:07.070
and start making their
product better and better,

02:13:07.070 --> 02:13:09.930
more expensive, add
more layers of gold.

02:13:09.930 --> 02:13:11.810
You know, they make
it so that they want

02:13:11.810 --> 02:13:14.110
to make it more valuable
to their customer base.

02:13:14.110 --> 02:13:16.990
But what that does is it makes
them have an increasingly

02:13:16.990 --> 02:13:19.560
smaller customer base
because people start deciding,

02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:20.990
"This is good enough.

02:13:20.990 --> 02:13:22.290
Why should I spend that?"

02:13:22.290 --> 02:13:23.780
So I would just hear --

02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:25.670
I love hearing some of
these creative ideas

02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:29.910
for alternative things here, the
caution to not chase your market

02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:32.720
up further and further to
the point of losing them

02:13:32.720 --> 02:13:35.390
to a disruptor because you
think the best response

02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:37.110
to that threat is
to make ours better.

02:13:37.110 --> 02:13:38.810
Again, I would say
better in what way?

02:13:38.810 --> 02:13:40.110
Better for whom?

02:13:40.110 --> 02:13:41.410
Better for what job?

02:13:41.410 --> 02:13:43.070
Make sure that better
is always focused

02:13:43.070 --> 02:13:44.720
on what those customers want.

02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:46.400
And it's okay if it
comes in the form

02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:49.100
of disrupting yourself
with smaller ideas.

02:13:49.100 --> 02:13:50.760
I mean, you might as
well disrupt yourself

02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:52.060
and get all the revenue

02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:54.040
from both the disruption
and the existing one.

02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:57.440
So just to be careful not to
over-gild the lily in search

02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:00.360
of better when better is when
people come and hear you,

02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:02.130
however you want to be heard.

02:14:02.130 --> 02:14:03.580
Just keep that in mind.

02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:04.880
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: Terrific.

02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:08.040
Well, before a hangry assaults
all of us, let me give each

02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:11.440
of our panelists a minute
to talk about your concert.

02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:14.750
Kevin, yours tonight; Sandi,
Wednesday night; and Sarah,

02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:17.770
you can tag-team
your Wednesday night.

02:14:17.770 --> 02:14:19.600
Tell folks about your concerts.

02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:20.900
&gt;&gt; Kevin Shuck: Okay.

02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:22.200
Well, the Boulder
Philharmonic is honored

02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.530
to kick off the inaugural
Shift Festival tonight.

02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:27.080
Our program is, as I mentioned,

02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:30.730
has an unabashedly programmatic
title, The Nature of Music.

02:14:30.730 --> 02:14:32.730
Which is bringing all those kind

02:14:32.730 --> 02:14:38.820
of initiatives I was
just talking about to DC.

02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:40.930
We open with a new commission.

02:14:40.930 --> 02:14:43.470
It was commissioned
with National Endowment

02:14:43.470 --> 02:14:47.320
for the Arts money, the
Imagine Your Parks Initiative,

02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:51.570
to commemorate the centennial
of the National Parks Service.

02:14:51.570 --> 02:14:54.620
We have an adventurer-composer
who we've worked

02:14:54.620 --> 02:14:55.970
with before, Steven Lias.

02:14:55.970 --> 02:14:58.610
It will be the premier
of his work inspired

02:14:58.610 --> 02:15:00.670
by Rocky Mountain National Park.

02:15:00.670 --> 02:15:05.400
After that we have a mandolinist
from here close in Virginia.

02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:07.880
His concerto is called
From the Blue Ridge.

02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:10.770
So our goal with the
Nature of Music was not just

02:15:10.770 --> 02:15:12.860
to show off Colorado with
lots of pretty pictures

02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:15.520
of our mountains, but also that
these things are universal.

02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:18.390
So we have something from
local audiences here as well,

02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:20.130
from your backyard as well.

02:15:20.130 --> 02:15:23.320
The second half opens
up with a piece,

02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:25.460
Ghost of the Grasslands,
by Steve Heitzig.

02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:29.950
This is about the prairies, the
lesser-known half of Colorado.

02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:33.160
And interesting, percussionist
drummers like Stalks

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:37.040
of Prairie Grass, Bison
Bones, Squeak Toys that Sound

02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.590
like Prairie Dogs, and then that
takes us into the grand finale

02:15:40.590 --> 02:15:43.260
which is Copelands Appalachian
Spring with something

02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:44.620
which is pretty eye-popping.

02:15:44.620 --> 02:15:48.400
Frequent Flyers Aerial Dance
Company we brought with us

02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:51.500
from Boulder do a
beautiful rendition suspended

02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:52.820
above the orchestra.

02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:54.120
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald: Wow.

02:15:54.120 --> 02:15:56.040
And I have my tickets.

02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:58.060
[ Laughter ]

02:15:58.060 --> 02:16:04.310
So the North Carolina
Symphony is bringing a program

02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:06.810
that demonstrates who we are.

02:16:06.810 --> 02:16:13.660
We have two works by Robert
Ward who spent the mature part

02:16:13.660 --> 02:16:16.860
of his life in North
Carolina and was the dean

02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:21.150
of the University of North
Carolina School for the Arts

02:16:21.150 --> 02:16:22.860
and eventually became
an audience member

02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:24.160
of the North Carolina Symphony.

02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:27.090
So we bookend the performance
with two of his works.

02:16:27.090 --> 02:16:32.240
We will be joined by North
Carolina-born Pulitzer

02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:36.190
Prize-winning composer and
performer Caroline Shaw

02:16:36.190 --> 02:16:39.870
who will be the soloist
in her work, Low.

02:16:41.130 --> 02:16:46.010
And let me think -- thank you.

02:16:46.010 --> 02:16:49.310
Mason Bates -- I was going
to hand it over to you.

02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:56.350
Mason Bates work is evocative of
his time spent in the Carolinas.

02:16:56.350 --> 02:17:01.040
I believe he uses
cicada in his sounds,

02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:05.970
in his piece called
Rusty Carolina.

02:17:05.970 --> 02:17:11.200
And then the big centerpiece of
our program is our co-commission

02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:14.800
of Sarah's work, which maybe
you could tell us a little

02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:16.100
bit about.

02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:17.400
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland
Snider: Oh, okay.

02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:20.050
I felt like I gave you a lot
of information, but the name

02:17:20.050 --> 02:17:21.590
of the piece is Hierite.

02:17:21.590 --> 02:17:25.530
That's Welsh word that means a
longing for a time or a place

02:17:25.530 --> 02:17:29.360
in your past that you
can no longer return to.

02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:32.190
So yeah, I'm excited about that.

02:17:32.190 --> 02:17:34.080
&gt;&gt; Sandy MacDonald: And then
on Thursday night we'll be

02:17:34.080 --> 02:17:41.850
at the Cogod Gallery or
the auditorium, thank you.

02:17:41.850 --> 02:17:43.330
Space. Courtyard, there you go.

02:17:43.330 --> 02:17:47.860
Space. And with a program that
we performed at an art museum

02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:55.150
on Saturday night that featured
Sarah's piece Unremembered

02:17:55.150 --> 02:17:59.280
that has been traveling
the globe.

02:17:59.280 --> 02:18:04.060
And so her piece
with our orchestra,

02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:07.550
and as well a piece called
By and By, by Caroline Shaw.

02:18:07.550 --> 02:18:11.410
That program is an example

02:18:11.410 --> 02:18:13.200
of the North Carolina
Symphony getting

02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:15.840
out of a traditional concert
hall which we do frequently

02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:19.010
and performing our works
in a different space.

02:18:19.010 --> 02:18:20.310
&gt;&gt; Sarah Kirkland Snider:

02:18:20.310 --> 02:18:23.170
I think it's worth highlighting
too that something special

02:18:23.170 --> 02:18:26.710
about North Carolina Symphony
is that they like to go deep

02:18:26.710 --> 02:18:28.130
with the composers
they work with.

02:18:28.130 --> 02:18:33.340
So they do multiple pieces by a
certain set of composers rather

02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:36.750
than lots of pieces by
lots of different composers

02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:38.050
which I think is really special.

02:18:38.050 --> 02:18:41.120
Because it enables the community
to get to know artists better

02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:44.580
and feel a stronger connection
to each piece that they hear,

02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:47.120
because they have a
little more context for it.

02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:48.420
&gt;&gt; Jesse Rosen: Right.

02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:51.620
You know, earlier today
some of us right here

02:18:51.620 --> 02:18:54.060
in this library were looking
at the original manuscripts

02:18:54.060 --> 02:18:57.750
of Mozart and a lock
of Beethoven's hair

02:18:57.750 --> 02:19:01.390
and Bartok's manuscript
from the concerto orchestra

02:19:01.390 --> 02:19:02.820
Heiden Symphonies.

02:19:02.820 --> 02:19:06.320
And I couldn't help thinking
about this great sense

02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:09.570
of tradition and old stuff.

02:19:09.570 --> 02:19:11.960
And here we are hundreds
of years later,

02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:13.620
we're still playing
the same music.

02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:15.660
We're still playing
the same instruments

02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:17.590
and the same orchestra.

02:19:17.590 --> 02:19:19.780
And it reminded me -- this
will sound a little crazy --

02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:22.570
but I've been watching the
hearings for Judge Gorsuch

02:19:22.570 --> 02:19:25.570
and so the word originalist
which I didn't know before --

02:19:25.570 --> 02:19:27.550
now I know what an
originalist is.

02:19:27.550 --> 02:19:30.190
But the tension around
you know, the past

02:19:30.190 --> 02:19:33.420
and how does the past live
as you go into the future,

02:19:33.420 --> 02:19:34.730
is a question that kind of runs

02:19:34.730 --> 02:19:37.000
through so many aspects
of our lives.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.400
And I think the work
happening in orchestras

02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:40.870
of asking those same questions,

02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:43.380
we know this incredible
tradition.

02:19:43.380 --> 02:19:47.160
We learn from it, we revere
it, we're in awe of it.

02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:48.460
And yet we're also

02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:50.900
in a completely different
place and a different time.

02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:54.210
And so how do we make that
alive and real for today?

02:19:54.210 --> 02:19:57.290
And I think that's kind of the
journey orchestras have been on,

02:19:57.290 --> 02:19:59.340
along with probably
the rest of America.

02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:01.420
So anyhow, thank you
for being with us,

02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:03.510
and a big thanks to our panel.

[ Applause ]

02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:18.380
&gt;&gt; Jenny Bilfield: Many thanks

02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:19.810
to our panelists
and participants.

02:20:19.810 --> 02:20:21.110
Thank you for being here.

02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:23.520
And just a final word, if
we have piqued your appetite

02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:25.510
and you don't yet have
tickets for everything,

02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:26.810
they're still available.

02:20:26.810 --> 02:20:29.250
I hope that you'll find
the Shift events located

02:20:29.250 --> 02:20:31.810
on the Kennedy Center
website, also at the bottom

02:20:31.810 --> 02:20:33.510
of the Washington
Performing Arts homepage.
