00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:06.766
[upbeat music]

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.433
female narrator: Getting players
to install your game

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:09.433
is one thing.

00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:10.766
To be a successful game,

00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.866
you want your players
to come back again and again.

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.833
We've selected ten
compelling ways to do this.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.900
By adding Google Sign In
to your games,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.866
you open up great new ways
to engage with your players,

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.733
you reduce the friction
to signing in

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.333
because users don't have to
go through

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.566
a new account setup flow.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.233
With Google Play Game Services
achievements,

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:37.866
you create a series of tasks

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.133
your players can perform
in your game

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.400
and let the users know
once they've accomplished them.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.200
Achievements can be
a single goal

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.333
or things players do
multiple times.

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.033
You can also hide achievements
to prevent spoilers.

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:51.600
The most engaged players
are often motivated

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.166
to complete all the achievements
a game offers,

00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.000
specifically if they're
challenging, secret,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.766
or humorous.

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.900
Players love to measure
their skills against others

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.666
and leaderboards do just that.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.766
You can create
up to 70 leaderboards

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.666
with Google Play Game Services.

00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.066
Getting daily, weekly,
all-time leaderboards

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.866
to track players' scores

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.833
so they can compare their
results with their friends

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:17.500
or the public.

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.733
By providing saved games with
Google Play Game Services,

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.200
you can bring players back
to where they left off

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.866
between sessions and
you can let them switch devices

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:32.600
and continue playing between
their smartphone or tablet

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.800
or Android TV.

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.033
Nothing engages players

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.266
like the challenge
of beating another player.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.333
With Google Play Game Services,

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.266
you can easily add multiplayer

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.866
to both your real-time
and turn-based games.

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:49.700
With the Nearby Connections API,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.200
players can take on
their friends in the same room,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.233
on different devices.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:01.366
Add quests to introduce
time bound in-game challenges

00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:04.033
that players can complete
to earn rewards.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.366
You can issue quests
without updating your app

00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:10.000
for specific dates and
reward players who complete them

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.433
with in-game items.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.533
Player analytics will give you
information

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:19.700
on the behavior of players
in your game.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.866
You'll get detailed
revenue statistics,

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:23.300
player retention data,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.766
player progression data,
and more.

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:28.166
You can also set and track
daily revenue targets

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:31.033
to assess the monetary success
of your game.

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:33.500
These insights will help you
improve your game

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.900
and make it even more attractive
to your users.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.133
Flows in Play Game's
player analytics

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:44.766
will show you how players
progress through your game

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:46.700
and spot where they disengage.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.900
Maybe a level is too hard
to complete.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.400
Perhaps a game feature
is too difficult to find.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.633
And which are the features
the players come back to

00:02:53.633 --> 00:02:55.166
time and time again?

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:58.700
Use this information to improve
and update your game.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.900
With AdMob and Google Analytics

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.600
you can target your ads
to different types of users

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.933
so that they're more relevant,

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:11.266
which will be an improved
user experience.

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:13.633
For example,
you could target users

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:15.533
who have already made a purchase
from your game

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:18.100
with an ad promoting
another in-game product,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.566
while targeting users
who have never bought anything

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:21.900
with regular ads.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.133
The look and function
of your game

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:29.166
is important to you
and your players,

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:31.100
so keep that feel
with your ads too.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.066
Using native ads,
you can customize ads

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:36.866
and make your AdMob campaigns
a more engaging part

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:38.566
of your game experience.
