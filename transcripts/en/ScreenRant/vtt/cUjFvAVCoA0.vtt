00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.889
A film-set may seem like a natural environment
for actors, but with a bad combination of

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.550
clashing actors and directors, heightened
emotions, and uncontrollable egos, a movie

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.590
shoot can easily become the place of a total
actor meltdown. Here are 10 Actors Who Suffered

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.400
Meltdowns on the set of their Movies. If you

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.390
Gene Hackman,
There are certain seasoned actors who have

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.970
reached such a height of fame that the mere
thought of a hot new director wanting them

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.230
in their movie, doesn’t flatter them, it
makes them angry. When Gene Hackman discovered

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.750
that Wes Anderson wrote the role of the patriarch
to the titular The Royal Tenenbaums, specifically

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.530
for him, he was livid. He was also furious
that he would be earning so little since it

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.030
was an independent film. Hackman’s agent
convinced him to take on the role, but the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:03.000
actor’s anger filtered through on set. His
behavior was so unnerving to the rest of the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.670
cast, they managed their best to keep far
away from Hackman and his daily vitriol.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.430
Marlon Brando
Marlon Brando was a legendary actor not only

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.960
for his performances on screen but for his
crazy antics when the cameras weren’t rolling.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.960
While there have been countless stories of
the actor behaving abnormally on the set of

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.299
films like The Last Tango in Paris and The
Freshman, his major meltdown came on the set

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.299
of 1996’s The Island of Dr. Moreau. Being
Marlon Brando and knowing it was a privilege

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:20.299
for the filmmaker, John Frankenheimer, to
have the Godfather himself in the film, Brando

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.790
used that power to request some bizarre character
choices. One of Brando’s decisions was to

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.090
wear an ice bucket as a hat. There didn’t
seem to be any relevance to the ice bucket,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.320
it was just something the actor found and
wanted to wear. It was also his decision to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.229
put a friend of his, who was also a little
person, in the film who became a mini-me to

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.840
Brando’s character. Finally, Brando was
so indifferent to his role, he wore an earpiece

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.900
with someone feeding him his lines.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.540
Wesley Snipes
For years, Wesley Snipe has only brought problems

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.440
to film sets. It appears 2004’s Blade Trinity
was no exception. The third film in the Blade

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.220
series was nothing short of a total disaster.
Snipes spent most of the time in his trailer

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.790
rather than interacting with his co-stars
or preparing for scenes. He also accused director

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.030
David Goyer of being racist after seeing another
black actor wearing a non-wardrobe shirt,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.780
with Garbage” emblazoned on the front. This
incident caused Snipes to threaten Goyer’s

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.420
life. There was no much tension on the set,
Snipes was regularly replaced with a stand-in

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.700
and only showed up for close-ups. Most of
the comical scenes with Ryan Reynolds were

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.810
done without Snipes there with post production
placing him the scene later. All the strife

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.989
on set may have led to the final product being
uneven at best.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.069
Lindsay Lohan
Poor Lindsay Lohan has had what seems like

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.260
endless meltdowns in the public eye. Ever
since evolving from child to adult actor,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.480
Lohan has struggled to maintain a semblance
of normalcy in her life. 2013’s cinematic

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.530
nightmare, The Canyons, may have been a failure
on its own but Lohan’s on-set bizarre behavior

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.501
was no help. After not showing up on the first
day, the director abruptly fired her. After

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.310
she sat outside of the director’s hotel
room crying for hours, he gave her another

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.310
chance. Lohan also went out of her way to
escape the set as well as the security team

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.310
director Paul Schrader, hired to keep tabs
on the unpredictable actress. Lohan also had

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.281
an emotional breakdown and refused to film
an orgy scene. Since the scenes were in the

00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:04.040
script and the film also starred an adult
film star, the scene was not a curveball for

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.069
Lindsay. After the director exposed himself
to Lindsay, he demanded she disrobe and get

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.569
in the scene, which she did.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.379
Julia Roberts
There is rarely controversy surrounding Julia

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.569
Roberts. Once dubbed “America’s Sweetheart”
a title which she poked fun at by starring

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.930
in a film by the same name, Roberts has had
a long-lasting career with seldom a negative

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.110
word spoken of her. However, in 1991, while
filming Steven Spielberg’s Hook, she was

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.561
nicknamed “Tinkerhell”,&nbsp;Roberts was uncharacteristically
bratty on set which did not sit right with

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:36.920
the director. Much of her poor behavior stemmed
from the tremulous relationship with her fiancé’

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.099
at the time, Kiefer Sutherland. The relationship
drama became even more complex when actor

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.440
Jason Patric began visiting Roberts on set.
Fortunately, Roberts seems to have gotten

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.909
her on-set meltdowns out of her system early
in her career.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.720
Jared Leto
There are some actors who are so dedicated

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.010
to their roles, they remain in character for
the entirety of the film shoot. Jared Leto,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.409
always the committed thespian, did just that
for 2016’s Suicide Squad. Playing someone

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.879
as crazy as The Joker can’t be easy, as
it affected Heath Ledger greatly before his

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.799
death in 2008. When Leto took on the role,
he became abusive toward his co-stars with

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:18.010
his Joker-like antics. Leto sent them a variety
of disgusting items including dead pigs, rats,

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.224
and even used condoms. His extreme behavior
was intended to intimidate the other actors

00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:22.109
in a way only the Joker could. Unfortunately,
his devotion to the character only led to

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.960
disappointment for Leto once he discovered
many of his scenes were cut from the final

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.520
film.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.630
Christian Bale
Christian Bale is known for his bad temper.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.259
On more than one occasion, the Dark Knight
actor has displayed his tempestuous side on

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.990
film sets. For 2009’s Terminator Salvation,
Bale just couldn’t hide his annoyance with

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.160
crew members who were stepping in frame. When
director of photography, Shane Huribut, accidentally

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:52.320
stepped in on a scene, Bale went berserk.
The actor went on a long-winded tirade insulting

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.110
Huribut and demanding he be removed from the
set. The incident was recorded and went viral.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.100
Bale later explained that he had apologized
to Huribut and they continued working. It’s

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.199
not clear if this was the only instance of
a Bale meltdown on the set of Terminator Salvation

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.060
but it was the only one that was recorded
for the world to hear.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.550
George Clooney
According to many actors, David O’ Russell

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.539
is not an easy director to work with. While
he may create tension on set, he remains a

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.780
director actors want to work with despite
his demeanor. It was George Clooney who suffered

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.300
a slight meltdown caused by O’ Russell for
1999’s Three Kings. After a horrendous shoot,

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.540
which included the director verbally attacking
nearly every crew member and personal assistant,

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.800
the typically collected Clooney couldn’t
take it any longer. He demanded O’Russell

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.789
do something about his behavior. Rather than
directing his anger toward others, Clooney

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:47.130
insisted the director get physical with the
Clooney. After the director literally butted

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.500
heads with Clooney and then held his hand
around his throat, Clooney reacted by grabbing

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.410
the director’s throat, wanting to kill him.
Those around Clooney pulled him off the director

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:02.210
and the filming continued.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.569
Joaquin Phoenix
For Joaquin Phoenix, it was less of a case

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.740
of a public meltdown and more of a performance
art piece which convinced the public he was

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.150
having some sort of breakdown. After receiving
critical acclaim for his performances, the

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.850
actor decided to retire from acting. In 2009,
he made it clear to the public that he was

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.600
out of the acting game for good and he was
now going to focus on a career as a hip-hop

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:32.300
artist. Every talk show appearance he made
after the announcement not only reiterated

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.800
his new passion but was met with confused
reactions by the host. One of his strangest

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.800
interviews was with David Letterman who tried
to playfully address the new career change

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.180
which only made the interview more awkward
as Phoenix stoically responded with his complete

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.620
dedication to his new hip hop persona. In
2011, I’m Still Here, a supposed documentary

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.810
directed by friend and brother in law, Casey
Affleck, was released. It was intended to

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.270
highlight Phoenix’s new career and journey
as a rapper. Once critics and audiences saw

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.510
the film, it was apparent that I’m Still
Here was a mockumentary, just as Phoenix had

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.160
been trolling the public for over a year.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.180
Chris Evans,
Chris Evans may be a household name now, but

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.880
reaching that level of fame was far too daunting
for him to accept it easily. After signing

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.240
a 6-picture deal with Marvel films to be Captain
America, Evans became increasingly anxious

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.440
and was unsure if he could handle the pressure.
Prior to signing on to play such a major character,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.960
Evans feared he could not handle the commitment.
He contemplated quitting acting altogether

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.960
and the notion he would be unable to quit
if he signed a contract, gave him serious

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.400
panic. While promoting his previous superhero
role, Johnny Storm in The Fantastic Four,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.330
he felt overwhelmed and suffered his first
meltdown. Luckily, Evans sought out a therapist

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.580
to discuss his anxiety and will continue playing
the iconic superhero.
