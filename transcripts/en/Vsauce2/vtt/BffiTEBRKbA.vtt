Vsauce! Kevin here. Tellspec is a new scanner
that will tell you exactly what's in your

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.200
food. The company claims their spectrometer
technology will give you a breakdown of the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.530
chemical makeup of food including allergens
or pesticides and will also give you calorie

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.020
and fat information. All by shooting a laser
and sending the data of the refracted light

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.830
to servers that analyze it and produce the
results on a smart device.&nbsp;

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.010
Cornell Creative Machines Lab is developing
a 3D food printer that uses edible inks and

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.989
electronic blueprints. They've printed a space
shuttle scallop nugget and cakes with hidden

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.879
messages inside - and have created new printing
techniques to add texture called squiggle

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.249
printing. Meanwhile, these designs for digital
gastronomy including a chocolatier to make

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.050
your own custom chocolate candies.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.879
To help perfect growing your own herbs or
vegetables there's Parrot Flower Power - a

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.010
sensor that monitors sunlight, air temperature,
and soil moisture. It connects to a smart

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.070
device and its database of over 7,000 plants
helps you maintain the perfect conditions

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.750
for healthy growth.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.650
HAPIfork is designed to slow down eating to
help users lose weight. The electronic fork

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.790
vibrates when you're eating too fast and monitors
your eating habits including how long your

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.480
meals last, how many bites you take and allows
you to set goals to follow your progress after

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.510
each meal.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.711
The Kitchen Safe is a time lock container
to help people curb their cravings. Place

00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:37.170
junk food or other items you want to avoid
inside, set the timer and be locked out without

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.980
any way of getting inside until the timer
goes off.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.550
As part of their 2020 innovations initiative,
Whirlpool unveiled this interactive cooktop

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.490
concept. It uses an induction surface and
augmented reality to combine social media

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.520
with a dynamic stove top. And the time and
temperature of the virtual burners automatically

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.680
adjust when you place a pot or pan depending
upon the recipe you've selected.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.390
The iGrill is a wireless smart thermometer
that tells you when your meat is perfectly

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.650
cooked. It connects to a smart device and
allows you to select presets depending on

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.379
the type of meat and how you like it cooked
- and then it simply alerts you when it's

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.379
ready.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.049
Refrigerated watermelon stroller!

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.079
The Electroxlux Design Lab has introduced
some incredible new kitchen concepts including&nbsp;Kitchen

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:30.459
Hub to manage your food, help you eat healthier
and avoid food waste. The augmented reality

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.959
smart ring can store and monitor individual
diets, offer recipes with the food you have

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.900
and allowing you to shop online to instantly
order things you don't.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.569
Global Chef is a social kitchen appliance
concept that uses laser holograms to bring

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.859
people together. The idea is not only to be
able to cook with distant friends and family

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.249
but also take cooking lessons from top chefs.

00:02:54.249 --> 00:03:02.010
Home 2025 is GE's realistic vision of future
home appliances and includes a compact, window-mounted

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.760
urban grill, a smart faucet that tells you
how hydrated you are, and a food disposal

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.209
that compresses food scraps into compost pellets.

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.439
So 3D print some food with your hologram chef
and lock your homegrown vegetables in a kitchen

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:23.400
safe to eat later with your smart fork. And
as always - thanks for watching.
