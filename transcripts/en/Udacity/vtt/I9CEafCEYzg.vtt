00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.450
So chemically speaking, DNA and RNA are incredibly

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.350
similar. They're not exactly the same. While DNA

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.970
is made of deoxynucleotides because it's ribosugar is

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.750
missing an oxygen. And here, the ribosugar is

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.360
this black pentagon here. RNA's made of nucleotides.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.870
Which I'm showing in this, sort of, light

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.310
blue pentagon, meaning that it has an extra

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.340
oxygen. So this is how I'm going to distinguish them,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.650
from here on out whenever we have this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.020
kind of structure here. Now, nucleotides have nitrogenous

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.040
bases, just like deoxynucleotides do. You can see

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.690
the colorful structures in the DNA and in

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.200
the RNA. And long sequences of these nucleotides

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.980
can be strung together, one right after another,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.260
in DNA as well as RNA. But there's

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.620
one big difference. In the four letter alphabet

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.100
of nitrogenous bases between DNA and RNA. Just making a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.390
few comparisons here, I want you to see if you

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.793
can answer three questions for me. I want you to

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:03.260
look at the strands and tell me what DNA letter

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.310
is missing in RNA and I want you to tell

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.700
me what new RNA letter appears. And I want you

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.530
to tell me what letter that new RNA letter might

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.638
base pair with. Go ahead and see if you can

00:01:16.638 --> 00:01:19.180
answer those three questions in the text boxes here.
