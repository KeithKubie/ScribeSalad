00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.070
Why do we need to trust
the operating system?

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.250
And I'm going to talk about exactly
what does it mean to trust a system, but

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.480
that sort of differentiates
an operating system from

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.730
other applications that
may not be trusted.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.130
So, why do we need to trust it?

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.520
In fact,
not only we need to trust it but

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.150
we actually also call it
a trusted computing base.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.720
So let's see why do we call it a TCB or
a trusted computing base.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.880
It is the base in some sense.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.044
If you don't directly want to
deal with the hardware,

00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:37.580
we set applications on top
of the operating system.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.800
So the operating system really is
the computing base that is seen

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.070
by the applications or
the user processes.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.610
The need to trust to the operating
system comes from the fact

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.900
that we giving it
the keys to the kingdom.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.040
Keys to the kingdom here are direct
control of all the physical resources.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.110
So the operating system in some sense is
able to access anything that we have and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.340
then it's the job of the operating
system to make sure that

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.600
these resources, or whatever,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.850
high level resources we implement
using the low level physical resources

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.240
get accessed by the correct users in
the system or the correct applications.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.059
And if you're going to make someone
sort of the in charge or the controller,

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:26.520
you better be able to trusted that it's
going to do what it's supposed to do.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.625
Otherwise, the results that you
going to have, you will not like them.

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:34.313
So that's why there's need to
trust an operating system.

00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:36.385
So what the exactly does it mean for

00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:38.905
us to be able to trust
the operating system.

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:45.335
So what are the requirements that should
be met by this trusted computing base

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:51.110
that we say sets an important
role in protecting our resources?

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.980
First of all, the operating system
absolutely has to be between

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.360
the untrusted applications and

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.150
the physical hardware
resources that we have.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.550
This is called complete mediation.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.830
Think about the request coming
from an untrusted application and

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.680
this request is for a resource that is
being requested by the application.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.780
It has to go through
the operating system.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.940
The operating system has
to mediate this request and

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.760
you can think about
why that's necessary.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.200
It's necessary because we had
the operating system has to check

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.500
that the resource of
the request actually has access

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.270
is allowed to gain
access to this resource.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.930
And for that check to happen,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.550
the operating system has to become
between the request and the resource.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.540
So that's called complete mediation.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.830
Okay, you can't get to any resource that

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.700
need to be protected without actually
going through the operating system.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.270
So trusted system is always
going to take a look

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.200
at any request before it actually
reaches the resource, and

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.390
the source of that request is
able to access that resource.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.060
So the complete mediation
requirement is the first one.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.330
The second requirement a trusted
computing base has to meet is,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.542
what we call, it has to be tamper-proof.

00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:14.700
In fact, we going to spend bunch
of time how to achieve that,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.770
or how to meet that requirement.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.280
The reason it has to be tamper proof is
that we're talking about untrusted code

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.210
and in the trusted computing base
of the trusted operating system.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.710
Well, if the untrusted code can tamper
with the trusted operating system,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.490
you can't trust anymore.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.990
The untrusted code tampers with it,
changes it to do whatever it wants done.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.070
In particular again, access to resources
that perhaps were not meant for

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.180
this untrusted application, which may
be compromised, could be malicious.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.820
Third requirement is the so
called correctness requirement.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.530
If you going to call a system trusted,
you going to completely rely

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.570
on it to make sure that you're protected
resources get used in a proper way.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.390
Then however it does that,
whatever functionalities implemented by

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.100
the trusted computing base,
it should be done correctly.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.020
Because if there is a vulnerability or
a bug or

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.459
some error in the trusted computing
base or the operating system.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.990
I said it has the keys to the kingdom.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.420
So, we said operating
system has to be trusted.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.690
Now we know what it means for
it to be trusted.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.420
You shouldn't be able to bypass it.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.850
Okay?
That's complete mediation.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.300
You have to go through it.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.700
You can't alter or change it,
if you are an untrusted application.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.660
And whatever functionality it
implements, that's done correctly.
