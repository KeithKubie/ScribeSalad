00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.620
- [Instructor] In this video, we are going

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.350
to talk about proportional relationships,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.840
and these are relationships

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.010
between two variables where the ratio

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.840
between the variables is equivalent.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.510
Now that sounds complex
or a little bit fancy.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.630
It'll hopefully seem a little bit

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.660
more straightforward once
we look at some examples.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.190
So let's say I'm looking at a recipe

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.610
for some type of baked goods,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.250
maybe it's some type of pancakes,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.030
I've been making a lot of those lately,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.330
and we know that for a
certain number of eggs

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.090
how many cups of milk we need.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.490
So we have number of eggs,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.490
and then we're also going
to have cups of milk.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.230
And in this recipe, we know

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.140
that if we're going to use one egg,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.390
then we would use two cups of milk,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.870
and if we use three eggs,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.520
then we're gonna use six cups of milk,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.140
and if we use, let's say, 12 eggs,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.270
then we're going to use 24 cups of milk.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.500
So is this a proportional relationship

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.710
where the two variables
are the cups of milk

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.450
and the number of eggs?

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.060
Well, to test that we just have

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.240
to think about the ratio

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.460
between these two variables.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.380
And you can say that the ratio

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.730
of the number of eggs to the cups of milk,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.010
or the ratio of the cups of milk

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.070
to the number of eggs.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.510
But you just need to ensure that they

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.400
are always equivalent in these scenarios.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.230
So let me make another column here,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.330
and I'm gonna think about the ratio

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.330
of the eggs to the cups of milk.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.180
Well, in this first scenario

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.160
one egg for two cups of milk.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.380
This second scenario is three to six.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.450
This third scenario is 12 to 24.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.450
Are these equivalent ratios?

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.010
Well, to go from one to three

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.000
you multiply by three,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.970
and also, to go from two to six,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.100
you multiply by three.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.990
So you multiplied both
the variables by three.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.320
Similarly, if you multiply

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.310
the number of eggs by four,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.530
then you multiply the number

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.780
of cups of milk by four as well.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.540
So these indeed are all equivalent ratios,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.860
one to two, three to six, 12 to 24.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.940
In every scenario you have twice as much

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.310
cups of milk as you have number of eggs.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.350
So this would be proportional.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.140
So check.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.200
Now what would be an example

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.600
of a non-proportional relationship?

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.990
We'll stay in this baked
goods frame of mind.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.930
Let's say you're going to a cake store

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.270
and you're curious about how much

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.540
it would cost to buy a cake

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.460
for different numbers of people.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.420
So let's say number of servings,

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.130
number of servings in one column,

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.470
and then the cost of the cake.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.973
And let me set up two
columns right over here.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.500
And so let's say if you have 10 servings,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.990
the cake costs $20.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.120
If you have 20 servings,
the cake costs $30.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.010
And if you have 40 servings,
the cake costs $40.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.510
Pause this video and see
if you can figure out

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.970
whether this is a
proportional relationship.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.910
If it is, why?

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.523
If it isn't, why not?

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.360
Alright, well let's just think

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.285
about the ratios again.

00:03:07.285 --> 00:03:08.550
And here our two variables are

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.920
the number of servings
and the cost of cake.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.280
So if we look at the
ratio of the servings,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.283
servings, to cost,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.570
in this first situation it is 10 to 20,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.090
and then it is 20 to 30,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.680
and then it is 40 to 40.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.520
And so to see if these
are equivalent ratios,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.350
when we go from 10 to 20 on the number

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.790
of servings, we're multiplying by two.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.770
But when we go from 20 to 30

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.210
on the cost of the cake,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.740
we aren't multiplying by two,

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.310
we're multiplying by
1.5, or one and a half.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.940
And similarly, when we go from 20 to 40,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.120
we are multiplying by two again,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.600
but to go from 30 to 40

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.530
we aren't multiplying by two,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.580
we're multiplying by one and one third.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.070
By one and one third.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.100
When we multiply our
servings by a given amount,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.020
we're not multiplying our cost of cake

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.140
by the same amount.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.543
This tells us that this
is not proportional.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.860
One way to think about
proportional relationships,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.660
we already said, that the ratio

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.980
between the variables will be equivalent.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.570
Another way to think about it is

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.200
one variable will always be some constant

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.340
times the first variable.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.840
So in our first example right over here

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.330
we said the cups of milk is always

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.120
two times the number of eggs.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.510
We can write that down.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.620
So cups of milk

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.620
is always going to be equal

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.053
to two times the number of eggs.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.410
And this number right over here,

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.350
we call that the constant
of proportionality.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.680
And you wouldn't be able to set up

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.170
an equation like this in this scenario.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.070
It would have to be more complicated.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.020
And so a proportional relationship,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.930
the ratios are equivalent

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.140
between the two variables

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.340
and you can set it up

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.790
with an equation like this

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.570
where you have a constant

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.793
of proportionality.
