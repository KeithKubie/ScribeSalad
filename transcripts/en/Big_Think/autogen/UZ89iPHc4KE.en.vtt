there's a whole series of kind of
 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.450
there's a whole series of kind of
outrageous decisions so it's a

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460
outrageous decisions so it's a
 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.130

what I really actually argue in the book

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060
what I really actually argue in the book
 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.440
what I really actually argue in the book
is more that there is this historical

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450
is more that there is this historical
 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.220
is more that there is this historical
legacy of slavery and that we still live

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230
legacy of slavery and that we still live
 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.170

within slavery and segregation shadow
 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.840
within slavery and segregation shadow
and that really is what is governing and

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850
and that really is what is governing and
 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.490

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.190
 
DNA testing has has led to a kind of

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200
DNA testing has has led to a kind of
 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.810
DNA testing has has led to a kind of
crisis in the judiciary because it is if

I mean the crime labs in Dallas and

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180
I mean the crime labs in Dallas and
 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.140
I mean the crime labs in Dallas and
Houston have been plagued by error and

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150
Houston have been plagued by error and
 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.450
Houston have been plagued by error and
prosecutorial bias but if the labs are

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460
prosecutorial bias but if the labs are
 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.690
prosecutorial bias but if the labs are
independent and fair and the training is

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700
independent and fair and the training is
 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.380
independent and fair and the training is
solid and and they're independent then

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390
solid and and they're independent then
 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.730
solid and and they're independent then
the results are so good that it has made

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740
the results are so good that it has made

the results are so good that it has made
us realize that types of testimony types

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540
us realize that types of testimony types
 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.730
us realize that types of testimony types
of evidence that we thought were

there's a lot of kind of cognitive

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720
there's a lot of kind of cognitive
 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.210
there's a lot of kind of cognitive
research now to back this up that we can

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220
research now to back this up that we can
 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.270
research now to back this up that we can
kind of plant memories or change

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280
kind of plant memories or change
 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.980

that's better and that's a way to reduce
 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.980
that's better and that's a way to reduce
frankly the prison population and to
