Global Warning.
Global Warning.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.678
According to NASA, 2016 is
on track to be the hottest year

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.948
in history, beating the previous
record holder, 2015.

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:17.251
Climate change appears to be
turning into a global crisis,

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.119
kind of like dabbing
or putting kale in salads.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:21.221
Uh, you're not supposed
to eat kale, by the way--

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.123
it's like (bleep) parsley,
you guys. Stop eating it.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.592
It's not-it's not good. So
take your kids to see the snow

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:27.528
for the last time,
then get to higher ground,

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:28.829
where you'll be safe.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.931
Comedians, I would like you
to give me as many

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.300
global warming survival tips
as you can in 60 seconds,

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.335
and begin. Steve.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:38.305
Dry and jerk your turds
to eat later.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.081
The guy who made
the guitar gun--

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:49.983
-he probably knows
how to do that. -AGEE: Sure.

00:00:50.017 --> 00:00:51.618
Uh, points to Steve.
Dave.

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:54.621
-Pretend it's not happening.
-All right, points.

00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:57.991
-Yeah, I said it.
-Points. You're not afraid.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.526
Steve.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.728
-Suck up to Elon Musk.
-All right, points.

00:01:01.762 --> 00:01:03.130
J.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.666
Get used to the taste
of your own urine.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:08.802
Yes, points. Steve.

00:01:08.836 --> 00:01:10.604
Get all Purgey.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.207
All right, points. Dave.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.542
Load up on SPF 4,000.

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:18.212
All right, points. J.

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:20.347
Learn to breathe carbon dioxide.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.950
Yes, points. Steve.

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:27.154
Surround yourself
with fat, slow people, Chris.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.356
-(bleep).
-Poi...

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:31.625
Points. J.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.628
Fatten up your kids
to use as a raft.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.964
Yeah, points.

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:38.932
Points.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:43.237
Dave.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.771
Weld spikes to your Prius

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:44.872
for when the world
goes full-on <i>Mad Max.</i>
