00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.870
&gt;&gt;I think I'm recording now. This is Mike
Arrington from Techcrunch. Actually sitting

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:16.500
next to Robert Scoble who's taken one of the
YouTube computers here at Davos to blog. Yeah.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.340
So I'm supposed to answer the question. What's
the question? What one thing do you think

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.170
that country's companies or individual must
do to make the world a better place in 2008?

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.570
Interesting there are thousands of responses
I think now, and the YouTube team that's here

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.000
is actually seem to be getting a little bit
depressed listening to them. They're excited

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.090
about the responses but some of the stuff
is depressing them. What's interesting about

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.120
Davos is that there's you know three thousand
people here and they're all talking about

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.160
the same thing. They're talking about poverty,
they're talking about global climate change,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.540
um those are the big issues. They talk about
other things as well, economic growth in less

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.870
developed countries. It's clear though that
there needs to be a way to make the conversation

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.670
extend to a much broader audience. You know
millions instead of thousands. There is no

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.920
grassroots campaign today around global warming.
There are lots of people care about it but

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.890
people are not marching in on Washington about
it. So to make that happen you have to engage

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.220
a broader audience. I actually think that
what Davos is doing here with YouTube is a

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.930
good start. Just to get lots of people to
say what they care about and what they think

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.800
should be done to make the world a better
place. This is the first year they did it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.299
so next year actually I think you really see
this probably explode. So it'll be interesting

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.180
a year from now in 2009 to look back and see
how much this has evolved and if YouTube itself

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.540
can become a platform for grassroots efforts.
Sort of a virtual equivalent of marching on

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.710
Washington. So that's all I have to say for
now. I am, just want to add that I am honored

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.110
to be at Davos. It's great they're letting
bloggers in. I hope that they let more in

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.030
in the future. We've been trying to behave
ourselves, and play by the rules, and hopefully

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.119
that means more bloggers will be let in the
future.
