00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So what happens as we go down here, at least one vertex added and so on.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So what does this have to do with measuring the hardness of vertex cover?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, we'll get there in a minute.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
What I would like you to think about now is the following:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's say we were looking at the decision variant of vertex cover

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
where as input we were given a graph and an integer K,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and our output was an answer to the question,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
does the graph have a vertex cover of size at most K?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So now here comes my next question to you,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
what is the maximum height of the search tree

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
if we are not using it to solve the optimization version of vertex cover

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but the decision version of vertex cover?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Would that height be in half, would that height be K,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
would that height be N, or something we can't say?

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And please choose the best possible one here.
