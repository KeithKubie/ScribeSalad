00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.660
Bacteria is everywhere. Literally. In 
the ground, on the subway, in and on your
body. I mean we are mostly made up of bacteria.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.350
There’s more of them then there are of us.
For every one of our cells, there’s ten

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.660
bacterial cells.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.539
The most bacteria in the body can be found
in the gut. Which isn’t all the surprising,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.550
there’s been a lot of research lately about
the microbiome, the ecosystem of bacteria

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.210
that lives in and on us. One small study published
in the journal Science found that other bacteria-laden

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.430
areas of the body include your palms, behind
your knees, and your feet. But the most diversity

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.670
on your body? That can be found on your found
on your forearms. Weird right?

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.940
But it’s not just in and on our bodies.
It’s AROUND our bodies. We literally walk

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.260
with a cloud of bacteria everywhere we go.
Kind of like pigpen from Peanuts. In a study

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.579
published in the journal Peer J researchers
captured air surrounding participants. They

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.469
had people sit in boxes for four hours and
measured the air around them. They found they

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.380
could identify thousands of types of bacterial
DNA and could tell whether the person was

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.170
male or female!

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.380
So basically you can get someone else’s
microbes even when you’re just standing

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.709
next to them. Great. That’s gonna make commutes
awkward.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:20.909
So once that bacteria leave us, where does
it go? Well the most bacteria laden places

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.179
tend to be places like public transit.

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.049
One really cool study of recent years was
a massive undertaking by researchers at Weill

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.340
Cornell Medical College. They swabbed thousands
and thousands of surfaces of the New York

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.009
City subway system. A system that sees nearly
5.5 million people per day passing through

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.270
its stations and trains.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.060
Their findings were published in the journal
Cell systems. In total they found DNA from

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.099
more than 15-thousand different life-forms.
Almost half of the DNA belonged to bacteria.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.049
But I should say most of the bacteria they
found is harmless. Only 12% were linked to

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:50.479
disease.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.840
But it’s not just in public, it’s at home
too. There’s millions and millions of microbes

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.739
in nearly every nook and cranny of our homes.
And one study published in the journal Science

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.109
analyzed the homes of seven families over
the course of a few weeks. And they found

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.179
something surprising. The people seemed to
make the bacteria. Like when three of the

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.679
families moved, it only took one day for their
new house to look like their old house, microbially

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.620
at least.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.959
And bathrooms. Man, bathrooms. Bathrooms are
pretty gross. But not as gross as you’d

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.000
think. Turns out your bathroom is dominated
by bacteria from… your skin. Yeah, not what

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.950
you’d expect. Yeah bacteria from your bum
like Roseburia and Blautia and bacteria from

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.099
other nether regions like Lactobacillus and
Anaerococcus are present in restrooms. But

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.930
only briefly. Bathrooms are too cold, too
dry, and oxygen rich to support growth of

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.689
these kinds of bacteria. Instead 68-98 percent
of the bacteria the researchers found came

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.769
from skin and from outdoors!

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.519
So the germiest place in your home isn’t
the toilet. One study published in the Journal

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.689
of Applied Microbiology found that it’s
the kitchen. Especially the areas that remain

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.030
moist like the kitchen sink which gets touched
a lot. The study found that the sink can have

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.900
nearly 100,000 bacteria per square centimeter.
Where the toilet only has about 100. and let’s

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.319
not even mention the dish sponge. ugh. They
have the highest concentration of bacteria

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.560
of any place in the home. GROSS.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.659
But bacteria gets a bad rap. It’s not all
bad! In fact some of it’s pretty good for

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.040
us. Research shows that being exposed to more
bacteria actually bolsters our immune systems.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.749
Seriously, there’s theories out there that
say we’re actually too clean in our environments

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:20.859
leading to modern diseases like asthma. And
it’s just as much a part of us as anything

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.439
else. So while if I were I’d toss out the
dish sponge right now, a fine balance of bacteria

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.280
seems to be just what the doctor ordered.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.079
But the dish shop isn’t the only thing that’s
covered in bacteria, you cell phone is pretty

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.159
freaking gross. Check out how gross in this
episode right here
