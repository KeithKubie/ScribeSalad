00:00:00.608 --> 00:00:02.326
- [Voiceover] "Which x-values
make the ordered pair

00:00:02.326 --> 00:00:04.520
"X, comma negative
seven, a solution of the

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.262
"following inequality?"

00:00:06.262 --> 00:00:07.864
The inequality is two X minus seven Y is

00:00:07.864 --> 00:00:09.802
less than 25.

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:11.660
And so they give us some
choices, and I encourage you

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.320
to pause the video and see
if you can figure it out

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.748
on your own.

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:16.025
All right, now let's
work through it together.

00:00:16.025 --> 00:00:18.440
They're constraining that
Y is going to be equal to

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.763
negative seven.

00:00:19.763 --> 00:00:21.203
And so if we make that
constraint, we can replace

00:00:21.203 --> 00:00:23.199
this Y with a negative seven.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.866
So we can rewrite the
inequality as two X minus seven

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:31.604
times negative seven, since
we're constraining Y to be

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:35.122
negative seven, is less than 25.

00:00:35.122 --> 00:00:38.802
And so this is going to be
two X minus negative 49,

00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:43.616
or two X plus 49, is less than 25.

00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:46.464
Now if I just wanna
isolate the X on one side,

00:00:46.464 --> 00:00:49.157
which we see for these
inequalities up here,

00:00:49.157 --> 00:00:52.756
so we could subtract 49 from both sides.

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:56.018
So subtracting 49 from both sides, we get

00:00:56.018 --> 00:01:00.963
two X is less than, let's see, 49 minus 25

00:01:00.963 --> 00:01:03.506
would be positive 24, so this would be

00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:05.502
negative 24.

00:01:05.502 --> 00:01:08.498
Now to isolate the X, we
just divide both sides by two

00:01:08.498 --> 00:01:09.879
and we're not gonna change
the inequality, since we

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:12.224
are multiplying or dividing
by a positive value.

00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:13.501
Positive two.

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:17.274
So this is going to be X
is less than negative 12.

00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:19.956
And lucky for us, this is a choice.

00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:23.496
So as long as, if Y is
equal to negative seven,

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:26.840
as long as X is less
than negative 12, we will

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.603
satisfy this inequality.

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:31.077
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:34.316
And this one is a little bit more visual.

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:37.253
So "Which Y-values make the ordered pair,"

00:01:37.253 --> 00:01:40.898
so in the last one we
constrained what Y was,

00:01:40.898 --> 00:01:43.475
and we figured out what X values would

00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:45.252
satisfy this inequality.

00:01:45.252 --> 00:01:46.761
Now we're going the other way around.

00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.036
We're constraining X and we're saying,

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:51.474
what Y values would make
the ordered pair true?

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:53.157
Or make it a solution?

00:01:53.157 --> 00:01:55.560
"Which Y values make the
ordered pair 5 comma Y

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.917
"a solution of the
inequality represented by the

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:58.834
graph below?"

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:00.599
So they didn't give it to us
algebraically, they gave it

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:01.992
to us visually.

00:02:01.992 --> 00:02:03.455
And so to be a solution,
that means we have to be

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:05.009
in this blue area.

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.176
So this pair, so negative five,

00:02:10.176 --> 00:02:12.119
comma six.

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.579
That would be a solution to
the inequality being depicted.

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.144
Something that sits exactly
on the line, this would

00:02:18.144 --> 00:02:21.720
not be a solution, because
notice the line, as you can see

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.239
this lower boundary
line, is a dashed line.

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.294
If it was filled in, than
anything on the line would be

00:02:26.294 --> 00:02:26.921
a solution.

00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:28.720
But since it's dashed, things on the line

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.637
aren't solutions.

00:02:29.637 --> 00:02:32.655
It's only things that are
above the line are going to

00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:34.420
be solutions.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.438
So let's see what they're
asking us to think about.

00:02:37.438 --> 00:02:40.236
So they're saying, they're
constraining X to be

00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:41.641
equal to five.

00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:44.694
So X equals five is everything,

00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:46.180
let me see if I can draw this.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.056
X equals five is everything on

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:53.482
that line right over there.

00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:55.583
Now, if we assume that X equals five,

00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:57.650
we're gonna be someplace on this line,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.612
how do we have to constrain Y to make sure

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.945
that we are in the solution?

00:03:01.945 --> 00:03:05.010
Well, we have to constrain Y so

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.947
that we are above the line, for

00:03:07.947 --> 00:03:12.347
X equaling five, just to be clear.

00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:15.201
So we have to be above,

00:03:19.471 --> 00:03:22.068
our possible points are gonna be the ones

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:24.598
once again, we're
constraining X equals five,

00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:28.349
the possible points are the ones,

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.428
that I'm showing in magenta.

00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:34.551
And actually I could
keep going if I want to.

00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:37.871
So Y is going to have to be greater than,

00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:39.636
it can't be greater
than or equal to seven,

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.331
it has to be greater than seven.

00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:43.212
If it was greater than or equal to seven,

00:03:43.212 --> 00:03:45.092
we'd be including the point on the line,

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:46.776
but I already talked about
this being a dashed line

00:03:46.776 --> 00:03:48.749
so we don't want to include
the points on the line.

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.746
We only want to include
the points above the line.

00:03:54.046 --> 00:03:57.434
So Y is going to be greater than seven

00:03:57.434 --> 00:04:01.775
which is this choice right over there.

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:05.072
If X is equal to five, as long as Y is

00:04:05.072 --> 00:04:08.114
greater than seven, we are going to be

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.413
in the solution set.
