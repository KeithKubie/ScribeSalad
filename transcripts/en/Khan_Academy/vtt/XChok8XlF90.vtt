00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Given a rectangle with length a-squared plus 6a minus 27 and a width a-squared minus 9,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.340
Write the ratio of the width of the rectangle to its length as a simplified rational expression.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.360
So we want the ratio of the width to the length

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.540
to the length of the rectangle, and they give us the expressions for each of these.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.660
The width—the expression for the width of the rectangle—is a-squared minus 9. So, the width

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.700
—let me do it in this pink—is a-squared minus 9, and we want the ratio of that to the length; the ratio of the width of the rectangle to its length.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:54.300
The length is given right over there; it is a-squared plus 6a minus 27, they want us to simplify this.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.180
And so the best way to simplify this, whether we're dealing with expressions in the numerator or denominator, or just numbers,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.120
is we want to factor them and see if they have common factors

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.020
and if they do we might be able to cancel them out. So if we

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.580
factor this top expression

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:15.420
over here—which was the expression for the width—this is of the form a-squared minus b-squared, where b-squared is 9.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.340
So this is going to be the same thing as

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.360
a plus the square root of 9 times

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.380
a minus the square root of 9.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.620
So this is a plus 3

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.020
times a minus 3

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.460
and I just recognized that

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:37.560
from just the pattern; if you ever see something a-squared minus b-squared, it's a plus b times a minus b

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.840
and you can verify that for yourself;

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.580
multiply this out, you'll get a-squared minus b-squared.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.060
So, the width can be factored into a plus 3 times a minus 3.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.020
Let's see if we can do something for the denominator.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.400
So here, if we want to factor this out, we have to think of two numbers

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.460
that when we add them, I get positive 6, and when I take their product, I get negative 27.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.780
Let's see, if I have positive 9 and negative 3, that would work.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.840
So, this could be factored as a plus 9 and a minus 3.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:19.000
9 times a is 9a, a times negative 3 is negative 3a, when you add those two middle terms together, you'll get 6a, just like that

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.000
and then, 9 times negative 3 is negative 27—of course the a times a is a squared.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.300
So I've factored the two expressions

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.540
and let's see if we can simplify it.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.060
And before we simplify it, because when we simplify it we lose information, let's just remember what are allowable a's here,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.980
so we don't lose that information.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.960
Are there any a values here that will make this expression undefined?

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.100
Well, any a value that makes the denominator zero will make this undefined.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.680
So a cannot be equal to negative 9 or 3,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.080
'cause if a was negative 9 or 3, then the denominator would be zero; this expression would be undefined.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.960
So we have to remember this, this is part of the expression;

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.780
we don't want to change this domain;

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.360
we don't want to allow things that weren't allowable to begin with,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.660
so let's just remember this right over here.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.860
Now with that said, now that we've made this constraint,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.300
we can simplify it more;

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.760
we can say, look we have an a minus 3 in the numerator

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.960
and we have an a minus 3 in the denominator

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.520
and we're assuming that a is not going to be equal to 3, so it's not like we're dividing zero over zero.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.880
So a will not be equal to 3, any other number;

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.140
this will be an actual number, you divide the numerator and denominator by

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:41.840
that same value, and we are left with a plus 3 over a plus 9

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.920
and the constraint here—we don't want to forget the constraints on our domain—

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.300
a cannot equal negative 9 or 3.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.460
And it's important that we write this here, because over here we lost the information

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.120
that a could not be equal to 3,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.940
but in order for this to really be the same thing as this thing over here, when a was equal to 3 it wasn't defined

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.880
so in order for this to be the same thing, we have to constrain the domain

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.780
right over there; a cannot be equal to 3.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.200
Hopefully you found that useful.
