1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,330
We're going to continue with the lecture
on the gospel of John that I talked

2
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,940
about. Uh, last time I started last time.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,500
I want to finish up with some of the
material on John that I didn't get to as

4
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:16,820
much as I'd like to, and then we're going
to switch to the letters of John First,

5
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:19,980
second, and third, John, so we're going
to do both of those things. Now remember,

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,340
the rubric under which today's lecture
happens is not just the gospel of John

7
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:30,330
and not just the letters of John
as I've brought up several times.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,830
The method that I'm teaching you right
now in this class is the historical

9
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:39,300
critical method as it was developed
in the 20th century in Europe,

10
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:40,140
in North America.

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,630
This means that we're not reading these
texts for just what the texts say about

12
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:50,310
theology or even the early Church or
doctrine or ethics or something like that.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,540
We're trying to read the text in a way
against the very intention of the text.

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,370
We're taking the text as being something
like a window that we can look through

15
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:03,960
to try to construct as best as we can
guess at it. What kind of social context,

16
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:06,790
what kind of political context,
what kind of church, uh,

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,250
what kind of social groups these,
uh,

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,810
produced these texts and
found them to be compelling,

19
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:16,710
found them to be believable. So, um,
there are lots of other ways to read this.

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,530
Obviously the gospel of John is very
important for Christian doctrine.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,370
It's the most,
a Christological of the gospels.

22
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:25,240
It has the highest form of
Christology that is the Christologies,

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,120
that's the most divine, uh, rather
than simply being human, human. And uh,

24
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:32,880
so it's very important for doctrine in,
for theology and for faith.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,810
But what I'm doing right now is
just one particular way of reading,

26
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:39,810
which is reading this text as a clue,

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,080
as a series of clues and traces that we
might use to reconstruct what we think

28
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:48,540
was going on in the first century
with the growth of Christianity.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,130
And I'm trying to show you by this,

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,000
that there are different
kinds of Christianity that
grew up in different places,

31
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:56,040
different geographical
settings in different times.

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,510
So what we call Johanan Christianity is
what we're going to talk about today.

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,350
And we're also,

34
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,870
one of the wonderful things about the
John Literature is that by having the

35
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:08,130
Gospel, which is written, uh, at one
time, and then having first John,

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,470
which is a letter written after that time,

37
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:15,060
we can tell that shows us a development
of this form of Christianity.

38
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,220
And then by having second and third,
John,

39
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,130
which we believe were written
still later than first John,

40
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,980
that gives us a third stage.
So in fact,

41
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:27,390
what I'm gonna be talking about is three
or four stages in the development of

42
00:02:27,391 --> 00:02:31,230
Johanan Christianity as one branch
of early Christian literature.

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,780
So in order to do this,
uh,

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,690
I talked last time about how one of the
things going on in the gospel of John is

45
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,530
Jesus.

46
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,490
And the gospel of John Seems to start off
lots of conversations and they lead to

47
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:42,324
division.

48
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,860
So the causation of division is one
of the themes of the gospel of John.

49
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:50,190
And to show that we're going to go
walk through a couple of chapters.

50
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:54,360
First look at chapter three.
This is the story of Nicodemus.

51
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,110
So get your bibles out and follow along
with me because we're going to look at

52
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:58,741
this in depth.

53
00:02:58,741 --> 00:03:01,750
They were going look at chapter eight
a bit and then we're going to move off.

54
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,760
I said division is the issue.

55
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,470
So what we're going to talk
about is what the division is.

56
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,570
But one of the ways that this author
does this is he sets up Jesus in these

57
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:14,440
dialogues that don't
actually work very well.

58
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,950
Jesus is not good on interpersonal
communication in the gospel of John.

59
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,640
I'm sorry to have to tell you that and
we'll talk about why that's the case.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,770
So Jesus talks in riddles.

61
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,700
So the question we're gonna have is
why does Jesus talk in riddles and the

62
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,220
gospel of John?
What did he get out of that?

63
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,400
Chapter three
there was a pharisee named Nicodemus,

64
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:43,120
a leader of the Jews.
He came to Jesus by night and said to him,

65
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,070
now by night, dark, this is
kind of an thematic issue in
the gospel of John, right?

66
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,200
Notice I'm not going to bring
up all these themes this time,

67
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,830
but keep noticing these themes that I
talked about last time as they occur.

68
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,020
Even in this little passage,
rabbi,

69
00:03:56,021 --> 00:04:00,070
we know that you are a teacher who has
come from God and no one else can do

70
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:04,970
these signs that you do apart from the
presence of God. Jesus answered them.

71
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:06,310
Very truly,
I tell you,

72
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,640
no one can see the kingdom of God
without being born from above.

73
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,690
How the hell does that follow
from what Nicodemus just said?

74
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,980
He's a key. Gives Jesus a compliment.
You're a teacher from God.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,270
No one else can do these signs that
you do about the presence of God.

76
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:26,350
Jesus has no one can see the
Kingdom of God. What is there?
Is there? Uh, thank you.

77
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,280
Um,
can Jesus say you're smart?

78
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,350
You just got something there. No,
Jesus starts off changing the subject.

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,250
Jesus changes the subject and the
gospel of John Quite a lot. You.

80
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,590
No one can see the Kingdom of God
without being born from above.

81
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:49,330
Now you're reading it in
English translation might
text just said from above.

82
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:53,350
Does anybody's translation have something
different there besides from above

83
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,690
without being born a new again,

84
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,170
the problem is the Greek actually can
be translated either being born again or

85
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:07,810
being born all over again
or being born from above.

86
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,090
The same Greek word means both things.

87
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,540
Now this is the one place
basically in the Bible,

88
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,060
which born again kind
of language comes out.

89
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,240
So it's kind of ironic that there's a
whole branches of American Christianity

90
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,540
which based their entire theology
and ideology on the idea.

91
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,900
Have you been born again? Because
really it's just from this passage.

92
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,330
The other gospels don't
talk about being born again.

93
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,660
It's a rather rare metaphor
in early Christianity.

94
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,980
It comes from this chapter right here
and it comes from a Greek word that could

95
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:40,540
be just as easily translated,
be born from above as be born again.

96
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,530
So my English translators translated
to decided to translate from above.

97
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,590
But notice it's confusing for the here
because Nicodemus then answers as if he

98
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:52,630
heard it to be being born again.

99
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,330
So Nicodemus said to him,

100
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,690
how can anyone be born after having grown
old Ken went into a second time into

101
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:05,090
the mother's womb and be born?
And Jesus said,

102
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,900
Nicodemus, I'm speaking
metaphorically and spiritually here.

103
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,820
You need to understand that I don't
mean particularly that someone has to be

104
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,670
actually born physically
from their mother again.

105
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,850
No, Jesus doesn't say any of that, right?
That's what Jesus should have said.

106
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,380
Probably if Jesus really wanted
to communicate with nicotine buzz,

107
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,280
but apparently,

108
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,890
and John Jesus is not that interested
in communicating very directly with

109
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:37,730
Nicodemus the cause. Jesus
says, truly, I tell you,

110
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,480
no one can enter the Kingdom of God
without being born of water and spirit.

111
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,810
What the hell does that mean?

112
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,290
Okay,

113
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,680
what is born of the flesh is flesh and
what is born of the spirit is spirit.

114
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,460
Do not be astonished that I said to you,
you must be born from above.

115
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,030
The wind blows where it chooses
and you hear the sound of it,

116
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:00,580
but you did not know where it
comes from or where it goes.

117
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,640
All right.
What does that mean?

118
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,260
Does it help you to know that
the Greek word translated here?

119
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:13,261
Spirit is also the Greek word
which can be translated is wind.

120
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,650
So notice the gospel of John
is playing with you with puns.

121
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,970
There's already two puns in this passage.
One does the Greek word,

122
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,520
is it Greek word f being born again
or is it born from above? Well,

123
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,230
you're not told in the text.
In fact,

124
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,910
it sounds like it may
mean a little bit of both.

125
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,460
And is this Greek Word Punch Numa?

126
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,350
Is it supposed to represent the spirit
as a theological term or is this supposed

127
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:40,180
to represent breath or wind?

128
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,540
It seems to be doing double duty anyway
with all that stuff about wind blowing

129
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:48,460
where it wills, so it is with
everyone who's born of the spirit.

130
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,270
Nicodemus tries one more time,
said to him,

131
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,900
how can these things be?
In other words, Jesus,

132
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:58,450
can you give me an explanation
of what you're talking about?

133
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,160
It's not an unreasonable request. Jesus
answered, are you a teacher of Israel?

134
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:04,510
And yet you don't understand these things.

135
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,173
Well that's helpful.

136
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,690
Truly, I tell you, we speak of what we
know and testified to what we'd seen yet.

137
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:16,260
You do not receive our testimony if I
had told you about earthly things and you

138
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,420
do not believe how you believe,
I tell you about heavenly things.

139
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,120
No one has ascended into heaven except
the one who descended from heaven,

140
00:08:21,121 --> 00:08:23,700
the son of Man, and just as Moses
lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,

141
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,520
so the son of man must be lifted up
that whoever believes in him may have

142
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,800
eternal life. Well, at this
point, nicotine was just gives up.

143
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,200
We don't hear about nicotine
anymore in the story,

144
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:36,440
so apparently he's decided I can't
get a straight answer out of this guy.

145
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:37,880
Yeah,

146
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,830
and notice also how that Jesus starts
off in a dialogical stance with nicotine

147
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:43,280
buzz,
but never answers his questions.

148
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,450
And then Jesus almost gets kind
of well nasty toward the end.

149
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,440
He kind of just almost insults Nica
demas rather than just explaining what he

150
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:56,370
means. This is kind of the
way Jesus sometimes talks
in the gospel of John and my

151
00:08:56,371 --> 00:09:01,371
question is going to be why is
Jesus just lacking in social skills?

152
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,660
Look in chapter eight

153
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,350
let's see.

154
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,580
Look at chapter eight verse 31
another little interesting dialogue.

155
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,990
Jesus has been teaching and now Jesus
said to the Jews who had believed in him.

156
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,500
Now notice this scene starts
out often in the gospel of John.

157
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:36,330
The Jews are talked about as if there's
something other than Jesus is of course,

158
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:39,630
Jesus is a Jew, his disciples, the
Jews, they're all Jews in this story,

159
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,870
but the term the Jews gets packed in the
gospel of John with this otherness and

160
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:48,450
this is a reflection of that
sectarianism I talked about last time,

161
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,470
but now notice Jesus is now starting
to talk to the Jews who believe in him.

162
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,030
These are not the Jews who rejected him.

163
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,220
That's very important to see
at this point in the chapter.

164
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,110
These are the Jews who now believe in him.
If you continue in my word,

165
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:04,050
you are truly my disciples and you will
know the truth and the truth will make

166
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,750
you free.
They answered him.

167
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,470
We are the descendants of Abraham
and have never been slaves to anyone.

168
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,620
Why do you, what do you mean by
saying you will be made free?

169
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,640
And Jesus answered them? Well,
I was speaking metaphorically.

170
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,880
I meant that let's say your slaves
to sin and if you follow me,

171
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:27,480
then I will make you truly free
in a spiritual sense. I mean,

172
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,540
that's not what Jesus does, right? All
right, 34 Jesus answered them very truly,

173
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,150
I tell you, everyone who
commits San as a slave to sin,

174
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,000
the slave does not have a
permanent place in their household.

175
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:42,840
The Sun has a place there forever. So if
the son makes you free, you will be free.

176
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:45,630
Indeed. I know that you
are descendants of Abraham,

177
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,820
yet you look for an opportunity
to kill me. Wait a minute, Jesus.

178
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,290
These are the people who believe in you.

179
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,430
Oh,

180
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,250
because there is no place
for free in you for my word.

181
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,560
I declare what I have seen in the
father's presence. As for you,

182
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,360
you should do what you
have heard from the father.

183
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:06,770
They had to hand will Abraham is our
father, where Jews, Jesus said to them,

184
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,410
if you were Abraham's children,
you would be doing what Abraham did,

185
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:12,650
but now you are trying to kill me and
a man who has told you the truth that I

186
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:14,360
heard from God.
That's not what Abraham did.

187
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,560
You are indeed doing what your father
said. They said him, we are not bastards.

188
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,300
We are not illegitimate children.

189
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,600
We have one father got himself so they
try another tactic. While he won't,

190
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,550
if you won't be satisfied with Abraham,
is the bank with okay,

191
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,640
we'll have God as our father. Jesus
said, if God were your father,

192
00:11:28,641 --> 00:11:31,880
you would love me for I came from God
and now I'm here. I did not come my own,

193
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:33,620
but he sent me.
Why do you not understand?

194
00:11:33,621 --> 00:11:36,200
What I say is because you cannot accept
my word. You are from your father,

195
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:37,034
the devil,

196
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,373
the devil.

197
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,610
These are the people who believe in him.
It,

198
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,690
and Jesus ends up the whole
thing is I told, you know, they,

199
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,550
they finally ended up saying, yeah, the
Jews and in verse four days, did you him,

200
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,350
are we not right in saying that
you're a Samaritan and have a demon.

201
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,960
So now they're both being antagonistic.
And finally the, the chapter ends, uh,

202
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,010
way down there as I talked
about last time, uh,

203
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,690
verse 56, your ancestor Abraham
rejoiced that he would see my day.

204
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:10,960
He saw it was glad. Then the Jews said
to him, you are not yet 50 years old.

205
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,960
Have you seen Abraham? Jesus
said to him, very truly,

206
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:16,870
I tell you before Abraham was I am.

207
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,220
And there's that strong christological
claim of God be of Jesus being God

208
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:24,850
himself. And of course, so they
picked up stones to throw at him,

209
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,800
but Jesus hit himself and
went out of the temple.

210
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,940
Notice there these things going on.
Jesus speaks in riddles.

211
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,150
And the gospel of John Jesus does not do
what a good Yale instructor as opposed

212
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:39,820
to do,
which is explained things to you.

213
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,330
Jesus talks in riddles when
they ask questions, he responds.

214
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,400
And with nonsequitors and then when they
act like they want to believe in him,

215
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:51,310
he pushes them and then start,
you know,

216
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,560
picking at him and accusing them of stuff.

217
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,460
And eventually the scene ends up
with everybody's all frustrated.

218
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,210
Jesus is accusing them of trying to kill
him and sure enough then they do start

219
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:02,044
to try to kill him.

220
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,150
And notice how in the gospel of John
repeatedly these issues come down to

221
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,600
Christology.
Who is the person of Jesus?

222
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,160
And the point at which they pick up the
stones to throw at him is when he makes

223
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,680
this claim by quoting exodus,

224
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,690
the very name of God that
Jesus himself is God.

225
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,780
Now with all that going on,

226
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:29,290
let's look at how this then plays
itself out in the first letter of John

227
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,110
and just to back up,

228
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,100
remember how diverse were
finding Christianity,

229
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,620
and we're going to start seeing that
diversity now represented stuff in

230
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:47,240
Christology, but we have seen it
already in in geography, right?

231
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,000
We've seen that in the
corn to the book of acts.

232
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,390
The Gospel spread out in
concentrate circles from
Jerusalem to Judea to Samarria

233
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,980
to the ends of the earth.
But we also saw how an acts,

234
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:00,680
if you read it critically between
the lines, you can see him.

235
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,030
It didn't really spread that way.

236
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,750
They were anonymous Christians who went
off out of Jerusalem after a certain

237
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:10,370
period of persecution and they took the
message to say weenie and to different

238
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:13,880
parts of the east of the,
of the Mediterranean. And
these were anonymous people.

239
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:15,050
We don't know them,
they weren't Peter.

240
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,330
And then later Paul and Barnabas take
things around and Phillip goes off to some

241
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:22,940
area and maybe there's this Ethiopian
Eunuch in the book of acts who's converted

242
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:25,040
and he may take the
gospel back to Ethiopia.

243
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,810
So the spread of Christianity historically
was much messier than it really is

244
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:32,240
portrayed in any straight
forward way in the new testament.

245
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,110
It seemed to have been spread by just
people going to their home villages and

246
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,500
hometowns and taking back this message
that they had heard it different places.

247
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,550
So the, the way the Gospel spreads, the
way Christianity spreads is differently.

248
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,190
We saw for example,
then in Thomas Christianity,

249
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,850
which seems to have been very popular in
Syria and then all the way into India.

250
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,840
That's a form of,

251
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,480
that's a slightly different from the
form of Christianity that's rising up in

252
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,900
Rome in Rome at the time,

253
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,460
and although church tradition says that
Peter was the one who took the Gospel to

254
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:04,100
Rome and founded the church
there. Well, you have good re.

255
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,250
We have good reasons as you can tell why
we, historians tend to doubt that. Why?

256
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,490
Because we attend, we believe
basically that, again,

257
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,690
anonymous Christians who are lost to
history probably were the first ones to

258
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:15,890
took the gospel to Rome,

259
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,610
and then Peter became connected
up that to do with tradition.

260
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:23,060
So there's a certain kind of
Christianity that's growing up in Rome.

261
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,900
There's another kind of, Christianity
is growing up in Syria and India.

262
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,680
There's another kind of Christianity
this growing up in Antioch and and that

263
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,360
part of a western Syria,

264
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,060
and there's another chronic Christianity
we don't know anything about at this

265
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,830
point.
That's probably growing up in Egypt.

266
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,790
We just don't have enough sources to
know what kind of Christianity may have

267
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,990
been growing up in Egypt,

268
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,220
so there's different geographical regions
are experiencing different kinds of

269
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:50,220
Christianity and those different kinds
of Christianity are diverse with reflect

270
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:53,180
to the Torah, the Jewish law,
right? If there's another,

271
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:54,740
if there's still a form of Christianity,

272
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,800
this predominantly Jewish that's located
in Jerusalem and it's led by James,

273
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:02,210
the brother of Jesus,

274
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:06,560
who seems to have been famous
for advocating a certain
kind of law, observant,

275
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,170
tore obedient form of
discipleship to Jesus,

276
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,040
then you've got a form of
Jewish Christianity that
still seems to be keeping the

277
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:17,390
law and we've seen that reflected possibly
in the gospel of Matthew with it's

278
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:21,080
teaching that the law is still
something that people ought to obey.

279
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,400
We've seen though that the gospel of
mark teaches a Christianity that maybe it

280
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,290
exists.
Some people say markers written in Rome,

281
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,470
other people say maybe with mark
was written in Syria or in Galilee,

282
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,800
but with some kind of Christianity
that is now predominantly gentile,

283
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,420
although it still has Jewish elements,

284
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,730
but these are people who
are not keeping the law.

285
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,190
They seem to believe that they
don't have to keep the Jewish law.

286
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,720
And then we've got the form
of Christianity and Luke
that we saw where the Torah,

287
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,810
the law is not represents a
certain kind of ethnic, um,

288
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,550
an ethnic tradition of the Jews. So if
you're Jewish, you should keep the law.

289
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:54,860
But if you're a gentile,
you don't need to keep the law.

290
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,790
And then we saw from the Gospel
of Thomas and the gospel of John,

291
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,690
where is the concern about the law at all?
It's not really there.

292
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,630
You can not read all the way
through the gospel of John. Sure.

293
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:07,220
There's some controversies
about the sabbath,

294
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:08,510
about what you can do on the sabbath.

295
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:13,810
But disputes about observation of Jewish
law are not really an issue in the

296
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:19,370
gospel of Thomas and they're not
really an issue in the gospel of John.

297
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,900
What is at issue in the
gospel of John is Christology.

298
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,430
What do you believe about Jesus?

299
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,060
So let's look at the different kinds
of Christologies you get in early

300
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:33,830
Christianity too. Before we move on to
the letters first mark the gospel of John.

301
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,750
What is Mark's Christology? What
is his doctrine of Christ? Well,

302
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:43,130
for one thing, according to
mark, Jesus is the son of God.

303
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,391
Now,

304
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:49,391
that doesn't necessarily mean yet that
Jesus is completely divine or equal God.

305
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,480
You can be called a son of God without
necessarily being God himself and this

306
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:55,470
period of Christianity,

307
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,260
but at least mark certainly
considers Jesus the son of God.

308
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,200
He also though considers
Jesus to be the Messiah.

309
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,650
The Christ who has to suffer and use
his suffering is for the purpose of

310
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,230
ransoming us sinners.

311
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,730
So now the Christology that Mark's
working with is Jesus is the Messiah,

312
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:18,090
the son of God.
He's it's mandated that he suffered.

313
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:20,070
So it's God's will that
the Messiah suffer.

314
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,770
And that's one of the reasons he writes
his gospel is to convince his readers

315
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,520
that Jesus is suffering and execution
wasn't an accident and it wasn't a

316
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:30,840
catastrophe and it was a calamity. It
was God's will. It needed to happen.

317
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,280
So the suffering son of God is
part of Cri and Mark's Christology.

318
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,090
If you get to Luke,
as I've said before,

319
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,980
this whole idea that Jesus,
his death was a ransom is not in Luke.

320
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,570
In fact, Luke excises, that part of mark
when he's copying that part of mark,

321
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:53,220
and he leaves out that ransom passage
from mark because that doesn't fit his

322
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:57,540
Christology for the, for the Christology
of Luke. Do you remember Luke and acts?

323
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,800
What does the Christology of Luke?
Anybody want to venture of remembrance?

324
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,970
The martyr profit.
Exactly.

325
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,210
Jesus is the martyr prophet who's an
example for Steven or Paul are all of us

326
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:16,110
who are followers of Jesus
were all martyr profits.

327
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:19,230
We're called to be martyred profits.
That's not a ransom for many.

328
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,520
So Luke doesn't have a
doctrine of the atonement,

329
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,410
the Christian doctrine that says the
death of Jesus was to pay for the sins of

330
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:33,411
humanity or to redeem human
beings from the debt of sin.

331
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,690
So that's Luke's the gospel of Thomas.
There's no death at all.

332
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:43,620
And the gospel of Thomas, the Christology
of the gospel of Thomas Though,

333
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,240
is that Jesus comes across as practically
an already resurrected figure.

334
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,100
He's a knower.
He's a,

335
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,940
he's a figure of wisdom who's come from
the father who had come from above and

336
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:57,450
he comes to give his
disciples a true knowledge.

337
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:02,510
So Gilo Jesus as the revealer of hidden
knowledge is the main Christology of the

338
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:08,520
gospel of John. I mean the gospel
of Thomas. Now the gospel of John,

339
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,520
this is when you get closest to what
will be seen as Orthodox Christianity.

340
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,070
A lot of Orthodox Christology was set,

341
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:23,820
at least at one of the main
periods at the council of Nicea.

342
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,560
So we call this
the council of Nicea.

343
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:36,561
In three 25 of our RSCE was a council
called together by the Emperor

344
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:41,220
Constantine, who was tired of
all these Christian squabbling,

345
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,230
especially about Christology.

346
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,530
And he got bishops and people
from around the empire,

347
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,520
and he tried to get them
to come to an agreement.

348
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,530
They wrote what has come down to
be called the the nice seen creed.

349
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,660
And a lot of Christians, Roman
Catholics, Episcopalians,

350
00:20:58,661 --> 00:20:59,470
Anglicans,

351
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,470
some other churches will actually say
the Nicene creed in church as part of the

352
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:08,530
liturgy. Right? Can anybody
say it? We believe in,

353
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,563
yeah.

354
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,550
Yeah. Some of you know it. Yes.
You know, the Nice increase,

355
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:18,500
so that nice and creative
about Jesus being very god
from very God, God from God,

356
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:21,020
light from light. True. Uh, big, gotten,

357
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:25,280
not made because that was
one of the Christological
Dee Dee was so was Jesus son

358
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:30,281
of God because he was born from eternity
is as divine or did God say at one

359
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:34,880
point, okay, he's a really good guy.
I'm going to graduate him to divinity.

360
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:39,590
Status was that was one Christology.
So the Nicene creed said,

361
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:43,130
note Jesus did not become divine.
He always was divine.

362
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,140
So the Orthodox Christology was set to
a great extent by the Nicene creed in

363
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,890
three 25 but how we're,

364
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,440
how do we get from the year
30 when Jesus is crucified,

365
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,970
the or 70 when the Jerusalem temple is
destroyed in the gospel of Mark May have

366
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:02,450
been published,
the 50s when Paul was writing his letters,

367
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,750
maybe the year in the nineties when
the gospel of John is writing from the,

368
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:09,440
from those times all the way to the year
three 25 whether it's a whole lot of

369
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:14,360
fighting going on between Christians
trying to solidify what the Orthodox

370
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:17,510
Christology should be and all of these
different sources we've talked about.

371
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,920
The one that comes the closest to the
Nicene creed is this Christology of the

372
00:22:21,921 --> 00:22:24,800
gospel of John Because according to John,

373
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,300
Jesus is fully God co
equal with the father.

374
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,520
He's I am.

375
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,820
That is identifying himself
with the figure who appeared
to Moses in the burning

376
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:38,780
Bush. He's the descending
and ask, sending redeemer.

377
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,710
He's also the lamb of God sacrificed
for the people and in his sacrifice he

378
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:47,750
takes away the sins of the world.

379
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,200
All of those elements that would end
up becoming Orthodox Christianity,

380
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,850
Orthodox Christology,
those can be found in the gospel of John,

381
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,700
but now how do we get from there to
first? John, any questions about that?

382
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,940
What I want you to really see is I
want you to be able to anchor down,

383
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:06,230
not just take my word for it,

384
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:11,090
that will professor Martin knows all
things about all things and he tells me

385
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,580
that there are these different
Christologies and these
different early Christian

386
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:16,550
documents and so that's what I'm
going to write back on a paper.

387
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,451
I don't want that.

388
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:21,200
What I want you to do is
be able to actually anchor
down these ideas into these

389
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:24,830
particular texts that come from
particular different places in early

390
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:27,440
Christianity.
So any questions about that?

391
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,493
Yes sir.

392
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,950
The Christology of Matthew
is quite a bit like mark.

393
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,240
Matthew also believes that the
death of Jesus, for example, was a,

394
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:44,200
as a ransom for people
and for sends, uh, uh,

395
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,790
Matthew also that Jesus is the son of
God and that he is the Messiah. Uh,

396
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,860
exactly how divine Jesus is in the
gospel of Matthew is up for grabs.

397
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:57,350
It's, it's not clear, but he is.

398
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,260
He definitely seemed to believe
that Jesus is divine in some sense.

399
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,710
So Matthew is, Christology is not
too much different from Mark's.

400
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:07,880
The one thing that makes
him a bit different is that
he seems to also take Jesus

401
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:11,510
to be something like a new Moses who
either who not is giving a new law,

402
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:14,240
but it's interpreting the
mosaic law in the proper way.

403
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,260
So Jesus has a law giver and Jesus as a
teacher is also important for Matthew's

404
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:21,150
Christology.
Any other questions?

405
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,040
Okay. Look at first John,
the first letter of John,

406
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,980
right toward the end of the New Testament.

407
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,030
Yeah.

408
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,863
Now first,

409
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,440
there are several different connections
with First John Two the gospel that you

410
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,274
can see immediately.

411
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,060
So let's hop through the Gospel and see
these first look at the very beginning.

412
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,020
We declare to you what was from
the beginning, what we have heard,

413
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,550
what we have seen with our eyes,

414
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,700
what we have looked at and touched with
our hands concerning the word of life.

415
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,290
That all should sound familiar. There's
the seeing whoa teeth, the hearing motif,

416
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,690
and even the touching thing.
Cause if you remember,

417
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:04,160
it's in the gospel of John that you have
that famous scene where doubting Thomas

418
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:08,390
wants to touch Jesus's body to make
sure about that. This is the real Jesus.

419
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,280
This life was revealed and we
have seen it and testify to it.

420
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,400
Testimony and testifying and witnessing
as part of the gospel of John also and

421
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:18,020
declare to you the eternal life.

422
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,980
Eternal life is one of the themes from
the gospel of John that was with the

423
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:25,010
father and was revealed to us.
There's Jesus has the revealer.

424
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,970
We declared what we have seen and heard
so that you may also have fellowship

425
00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:32,510
with us and truly our fellowship is with
the father and his son, Jesus Christ.

426
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,180
We are writing these things so
that our joy may be complete,

427
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,860
so we're in the same world,
the same linguistic,

428
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:44,210
that'll the same discursive, the same
theological world as the gospel of John.

429
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,080
Look at one five this is the message we
have heard from him and proclaim to you

430
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:50,600
that God is light and in
him there's no darkness. Ah,

431
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:52,760
that wonderful light darkness motif.

432
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,930
Look at verse seven if we walk in
the light as he himself in the light,

433
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,180
we have fellowship with one
another and the blood of Jesus,

434
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:01,010
his son cleanses us from all sin.

435
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,520
The blood of Jesus being a
significant there two two 29

436
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,260
if we know that he is righteous,
if you know that he is righteous,

437
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,250
you may be sure that everyone who
does right has been born of him.

438
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,640
So born of him recalls this birth stuff
we've just seen in John Three in other

439
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,350
words,
and there are lots of others,

440
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:28,180
if you just read through the first letter
of John and you keep your ear attuned

441
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,500
to those themes that you've
already seen in the gospel of John,

442
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,970
you can just underline them and highlight
them all the way through the letter of

443
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,370
John. So they're there. But there are some
interesting problems with this letter.

444
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:39,950
Also,
look at chapter one verse eight

445
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,220
if we say we have no sin,

446
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,860
we deceive ourselves and the truth
is not in us. If we confess our sins,

447
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,190
he who is faithful and just will forgive
us our sins and cleanse us from all

448
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,520
unrighteousness.
If we say that we have not sinned,

449
00:26:56,521 --> 00:27:01,170
we make him a liar and his word is
not in us. So all of us are sinners.

450
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,750
Yay. You just have to confess your sin
and Jesus lifts in kill. Your is saying,

451
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,920
okay, we're all sinners.
Anybody who says there's not,

452
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,830
you're not centers to the problem.
Look at chapter three verse five

453
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,460
you know that he was revealed to take
away sins and in him there is no sin,

454
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,220
no one who abides in him sins.

455
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,133
Hmm.

456
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,730
I thought we just said,
we're our centers.

457
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,460
No one who sins has either seen
him or know him or known him.

458
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,650
Hmm.
That sounds a little problematic.

459
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,070
Everyone who commits sin
is a child of the devil.

460
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,890
For the devil has been
sitting from the beginning.

461
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,400
The son of God was revealed for this
person to destroy the works of the devil.

462
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,570
Those who have been born of God do not
sin because God's seed abides in them.

463
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,910
They cannot send because
they'd been born of God.

464
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,940
The children of God and the children
of the devil are revealed in this way.

465
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,310
All who do not do what
is right or not from God,

466
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,030
nor those who do not love their brothers
and sisters. Okay? Now wait a minute.

467
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,890
The first part, he says, we all sat
and we have to confess our sins.

468
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,730
This part it says, if you're in
him, you don't sin. And if you do,

469
00:28:16,731 --> 00:28:19,670
send your on the devil.
Look at five 18

470
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,980
we know that those who are
born of God do not sin,

471
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,480
but the one who is born of God protects
them and the evil one does not touch

472
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:32,630
them. Well, which is it?

473
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,920
Do Christians in John's church
sin or do they not send?

474
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,683
Yeah.

475
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,560
Is there a contradiction here in the text?

476
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,220
Yeah.

477
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,090
That's not the only weird place in this
letter, look at what he says about love.

478
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,880
Chapter two verse five

479
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,180
Chapter Two verse five whoever obeys
his word, truly in this person,

480
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:02,950
the love of God has reached perfection.

481
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,590
By this we may be sure that we are in him.
Okay,

482
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:12,720
so love is supposed to be there.
Two 10 [inaudible].

483
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,490
Whoever loves a brother. Now your
English translation may say or sister,

484
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:23,630
but the Greeks just says brother, and
maybe it's post to include sisters also,

485
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:27,650
but the gender of the Greek word is
just brother at this point in the Greek,

486
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:32,210
whoever loves his brother lives in the
light and in such a person there is no

487
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:35,860
cause for stumbling.
Okay,

488
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,820
so that talks about loving one's
brother. Well, who is the brother?

489
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,070
It seems like the brother for this
writer are other members of the same

490
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:48,490
community. He's not necessarily
saying what your physical brother,

491
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,940
your blood brother, but he's also not
talking about just any human being.

492
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,680
Notice how this work several times.

493
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:58,420
So look at two 15 so we're supposed
to love and we're supposed to love our

494
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,020
brothers,

495
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,490
but two 15 do not love the world
or the things in the world.

496
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,640
The love of the father is not in
those who love the world. Okay,

497
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,710
so we're not supposed to love the world.

498
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,650
Love not the world.
Do not love the world.

499
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,100
Remember the world for the word for world.
I'd said last time was cosmos,

500
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,430
the entire universe.
Does this sound a little odd?

501
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:29,490
If you think back on what may be the
most famous verse in the entire New

502
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,610
Testament,
if you go to football games,

503
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,050
anybody know what the most
famous football verse is?

504
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,600
John Three 16 see it. You know
I'm posters. Did they still?

505
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,870
Maybe they did that years ago. They don't
still do the posters. I guessed right?

506
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,920
Just one guy does it all
over the whole NFL. Okay,

507
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,710
so John Three 16 so yes sir.

508
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,120
Well, I was going to say during
the bcs national championship game,

509
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,680
the Florida quarterback war, John Three
16 on his eye, black. Did they win?

510
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,950
They didn't win any. Made it the number
one Google search during the game.

511
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:09,650
Great. So the Florida quarterback
war John Three 16 on his cheeks,

512
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:15,200
these cheeks I suppose. And
um, and that's why they won.

513
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,250
Okay, good. So what is John
Three 16 say? Let's quote it.

514
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,030
For God world.

515
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,880
Y'All are wimpy. For God so loved the
world that he gave his only begotten son.

516
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,770
For God so loved the world.
First John Two 15 do not love the world.

517
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,620
Hmm?
Yes sir.

518
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,210
I believe so. I actually haven't
checked. Does anybody have a Greek?

519
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,750
Michael has a Greek. Michael is
going to look it up while I continue,

520
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:54,751
but this is a two 15 and see if a cosmos
or some other word is the word for

521
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,780
world though. We'll get back
to you on that question. Okay,

522
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,440
look at three one see what love the father
has given us that we should be called

523
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:06,850
children of God and that is what we are.

524
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,240
The reason the world does not know
us is that it did not know him.

525
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,600
Okay,
so love is part of that.

526
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:18,310
Look at three 11 four this is the message
you have heard from the beginning that

527
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,780
we should love one another.
Okay,

528
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:25,480
so this is loving one another.
It's not talking.

529
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:27,910
Hear so much about loving the world.

530
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:31,600
Look at three 14 we know that we have
passed from death to life because we love

531
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:34,690
one another.
Whoever does not love abides in deaths.

532
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,110
Three 23 and this is his commandment
that we should believe in the name of his

533
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:38,261
son,

534
00:32:38,261 --> 00:32:43,261
Jesus Christ and love one another just
as he has commanded us for seven beloved,

535
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:45,770
let us love one another
because love is from God.

536
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,480
Everyone who loves is born of God
and knows God for 11 a beloved.

537
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:55,460
Since God loved us so much, we ought
to love not the world, but one another.

538
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,520
Verse 12 no one has ever seen God.
If we love one another,

539
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:01,130
God lives in us and his
love is perfected in us.

540
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,530
What about the translation?
Yep.

541
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:09,410
Okay. Same verb, same noun.
And John Three 16 and uh,

542
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,880
John First, John Two 15 so is there a
contradiction? That's just all I'm asking.

543
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:17,300
Where is the gospel of John Talks
about God loving the world, the cosmos.

544
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:22,190
And First John says you're not. Christians
are not supposed to love the cosmos.

545
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,420
Contradiction. Mom, we don't
know. Maybe not. Look at four 16

546
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,140
so we have known and believed the
love that God has for us. God is love.

547
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,330
And those who abide in love abide in God
and God abides in them. Keep reading.

548
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:45,190
Love has indeed been perfected among us
in this that we may have boldness in the

549
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,780
day of judgment because as he is so
are we in this world, in this world,

550
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,520
there is no fear in love,

551
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:55,060
but perfect love casts out fear for fear
has to do with punishment and whoever

552
00:33:55,061 --> 00:33:59,020
fears has not reached perfection in love.
We love because he first loved us.

553
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,430
Those who say I love God and hate their
brothers and sisters are liars and for

554
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:04,580
those who do not love a brother,

555
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:08,080
a sister whom they have not whom they
have seen cannot love God whom they have

556
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:10,840
not seen the command where
we have from him is this.

557
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,380
Those who love God must
love all of humanity.

558
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,580
What?
No,

559
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,420
I'm lying to you again. Follow
along in your Bible. See,

560
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:31,070
some of you went to sleep 21 the command,
what we have from him is this.

561
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,320
Those who love God must
love their brothers.

562
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,030
There's nothing in first
John about loving the world,

563
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,510
about loving humanity.

564
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,490
Okay?

565
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:44,220
About loving Amen.
All humankind or mankind.

566
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:48,210
There's nothing like that in the
first letter of John. You have,

567
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,030
what you do have in the first
letter of John is that God is love,

568
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:55,830
but that Christians, the followers
of John must not love the world.

569
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,700
The world doesn't love them. They
don't love the world, does it? Again,

570
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:02,760
I'm radically sectarian kind of stance.
And in fact,

571
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:04,740
there's nothing here
about loving outsiders.

572
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,050
According to the first letter of John.

573
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,320
All this love that's talked
about is basically centered
only on the community of

574
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:17,580
believers. It's an internal
love. It's brotherly love,

575
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,370
but that means that the term
brothers is taken to mean me.

576
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,320
Members of John's own community,

577
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:28,220
there's nowhere that Christians in first
John are told to love people outside

578
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:33,240
the community. They're told repeatedly
to love people inside the community. Yes,

579
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:34,074
sir.

580
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:37,990
How

581
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,560
to brother? Just to the
community of believers. Well,

582
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:42,570
you just have to analyze the
letter and see, you know,

583
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:47,100
how does it occur here and just go through
it. It's occurs all the way through.

584
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:52,000
Uh, for example, I think you
could definitely proved with
the letters of Paul, uh,

585
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,250
who specifically uses it
for both gentiles and Jews,

586
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,510
but only within the body of Christ.
Whether that's the case here,

587
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,500
you just have to read the letter.

588
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,210
I would argue that it is and as
precisely because I've read the letter as

589
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:11,211
setting up this dichotomy between the
outside cosmos and the inside brotherhood,

590
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,000
but it's just a matter
of reading the letter.

591
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,250
The word in itself wouldn't necessarily
supply that. Any other questions? Yes sir.

592
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,130
Yes, I believe. Well, sometimes it
fill out. Oh, and sometimes I got paid.

593
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,550
Okay. And the epistles,
it's almost always a guppy.

594
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,860
Any other questions? Okay. The radical,

595
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,920
in other words, what I'm reading in
first, John is it's representing again,

596
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:43,420
a radical sectarian group.

597
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:47,380
These are people who see themselves as
a community set apart from the cosmos.

598
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,393
The Cosmos is a,

599
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,300
is a place of darkness and a place of the
devil and that sort of thing. In fact.

600
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:56,350
And so now it's like what is the
cause of this radical sectarianism?

601
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,430
This is the most interesting problem
of the letter. Look at two 18

602
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,090
children. It is the last hour as you
have heard that antichrist is coming.

603
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,820
So now many antichrist have come.

604
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,520
So there's these antichrist and knows
this is they went out from among us,

605
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,100
but they did not belong to us
for if they had belonged to us,

606
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:20,200
they would have remained in us.
But by going out,

607
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:22,630
they made it plain that
none of them belongs to us.

608
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,310
So these are the people he's calling
antichrist or people that used to be

609
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:32,311
members of his own community and they
left the community for some reason to,

610
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,110
yeah,
so they left that.

611
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,730
Now Look at two 22 who is the liar,

612
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,230
but the one who denies that Jesus
is the Christ. So he's saying,

613
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,070
you must believe that Jesus the Messiah.
That's one thing. Is that the only thing?

614
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,140
Not necessarily.
This is the antichrist,

615
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,810
the one who denies the father and the son.

616
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:58,150
So some people he's saying have left the
community because they're Christology

617
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:02,770
is not high enough. They're not
allowing the true son ship of Jesus.

618
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,990
They're not allowing the
messiahship of Jesus. They may be,

619
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,060
you're saying he's just a prophet,
or he's just a human being.

620
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:12,810
So that's one of the things that's
going on. But look at five one

621
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,370
everyone who believes that Jesus
is the Christ has been born of God.

622
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,890
Everyone who loves the
parent loves the child.

623
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:22,650
So that's the main part
about Jesus being the Christ.

624
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:24,810
But now look at for chapter four verse two

625
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,770
I'll start the beginning of chapter four.
Beloved, do not believe every spirit,

626
00:38:30,771 --> 00:38:33,230
but test the spirits to see
whether they are from God.

627
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,700
For many false prophets have
out into the world. By this,

628
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:37,780
you know the spirit of God.

629
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:43,050
Every spirit that confesses that Jesus
Christ has come in the flesh is from God.

630
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:47,770
And every spirit that does not
confess Jesus is not from God.

631
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,080
And this is the spirit of the antichrist.

632
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,490
So one of the things that's going on here,
now look at also five,

633
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:57,310
eight just briefly, and
we'll move on. Five, eight.

634
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,150
These are three that testify the
spirit and the water and the blood.

635
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,340
And these three agree.
In other words,

636
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,200
this author is objecting to some people
who don't admit the messiahship of

637
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:13,930
Jesus, and that may have been
reflected also in the gospel. Remember,

638
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:17,020
some of the reasons that
some of the people there's
this division is because the

639
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,810
writer of the gospel of John believes
that some people aren't willing to confess

640
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,990
that Jesus is divine, that Jesus is
the messiah that he's going to got.

641
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,120
But now we get to a different situation.

642
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,780
Apparently there are other people who
have not come up in the community who may

643
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:30,880
be accepting that Jesus was the Christ,

644
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,060
but they're denying
that he was fully human.

645
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,710
They're denying that
he was flesh and blood.

646
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,150
And actually we do see different
beginnings of different Christologies.

647
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,730
The people we have a term for this,
uh, these early Christians who said,

648
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,400
they said that Jesus,
maybe there was a human Jesus,

649
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:49,480
but that's not really the Christ.

650
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:54,630
The Christ was this spirit that
maybe looked like he was human.

651
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:57,820
In fact, some said, well, if
he walked along a wet beach,

652
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:01,660
he wouldn't leave footprints because
he didn't have a physical body.

653
00:40:01,661 --> 00:40:05,530
He just was spirit.
He just seemed to be a body.

654
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:10,740
He seemed to be flesh and blood
and that the Greek word for seem,

655
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:15,700
he just looked like we'd get
this term to call dust. SEDEX.

656
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,630
[inaudible] is the Greek word
for to seem or to look like.

657
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:31,290
So other Christians use this term as a
label for those Christians who said Jesus

658
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:35,230
wasn't truly flesh and blood, because how
can a divine being be flesh and blood?

659
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:36,730
That's a contradiction in terms.

660
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,030
You can't have a being that's both God
and flesh and blood because flesh and

661
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:43,780
blood rots and dies and goes away.
God is eternal.

662
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,620
So God by definition can't be
flesh and blood. And so they said,

663
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:50,710
if Jesus is divine,
he must not have been flesh and blood.

664
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,390
He must've just seemed like he was flesh
and blood. So other Christians said, oh,

665
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:58,180
that's wrong. And they call
these people, the seemsters

666
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,850
does sedex.

667
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:06,400
So docetism refers to a Christology
that says Jesus has spirit,

668
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,400
the Christ, his spirit, but not
really flesh and blood. Human.

669
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:15,090
And so notice how this author is arguing
against different kinds of ideas and it

670
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,500
shows a further split
in early Christianity.

671
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:21,310
You have some people believing that
Jesus was human but not fully divine.

672
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,940
Other people believing that he was
so divine that he wasn't even human.

673
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:28,540
And this author is trying to
hold together these two things,

674
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,330
but now how this happened. So that's
one of, that's what's going on.

675
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:35,480
The Gospel of the first letter of John
shows a community that's again divided,

676
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,490
but now it's divided by some of the
people within its midst going off because

677
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:43,520
they thought you can't
have a flesh and blood God.

678
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,060
And therefore if you're going to have
Jesus as God, he can't be flesh and blood.

679
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,620
So they've left the community.
Let's look at second. John,

680
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:53,960
this is a little time and I'm going to
read all the way through this one cause

681
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:57,880
this is going to,
we need to sort of figure what's going,

682
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,720
it's a very short letter, the elder.
So he calls himself the elder.

683
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,070
So he doesn't even give us his name,

684
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,670
the elder to the elect lady and her
children whom I love and the truth,

685
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:08,631
and not only I,

686
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:11,990
but also all who know the truth
because of the truth that abides in us.

687
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,210
And we'll be with us forever.
Grace, blah, blah, blah.

688
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:17,630
I was overjoyed to find some of
your children walking in the truth,

689
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:19,490
just as we have been
commanded by the father.

690
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,010
He's talking to an elect
lady and her children,

691
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,070
most of us think this is a metaphor
that he's actually addressing this to a

692
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:28,100
church. They elect lady probably
means the church itself,

693
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:33,140
not a particular human person, but
that's just a judgment. Call my but now,

694
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:36,410
Dear Lady, I asked you not as though I
were writing to you a new commandment,

695
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:39,380
but on one we had from the beginning.
Let us love one another.

696
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,450
So there's that love thing. So
we're nowhere. We're nowhere.

697
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:43,880
It's still in the same kind of
Christianity that we work with the others.

698
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,650
This is love that we walk according to
his commandments. This is the commandment.

699
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:49,900
As you've heard from the
beginning of this walking,

700
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,760
many deceivers have
gone out into the world.

701
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:56,540
Those who do not confess that
Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.

702
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:00,470
There is those people again and he's
such person is the deceiver and the

703
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:04,370
antichrist be on your guard so that you
do not lose what we have worked for,

704
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:05,780
but may receive a full reward.

705
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,500
Everyone who does not abide in the
teaching of Christ but goes beyond it does

706
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:10,334
not have God.

707
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,900
Whoever abides in the teaching has both
the father's son do not receive into the

708
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:19,490
house or welcome anyone who comes to
you and does not bring this teaching for

709
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:22,340
two welcome is to participate in
the evil deeds of such a person.

710
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,920
So the main purpose of this very short
letter is to say to another church that's

711
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:29,330
in the same kind of
community with this one.

712
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,320
There are people who've left our community
and the reason is they don't believe

713
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:37,430
Jesus was fully flesh and blood.
Don't even let them come to visit you.

714
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:40,160
These are traveling preachers who
said, he says, don't receive them.

715
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,640
Don't give them money. Don't
give them food. Don't put
them up in your guest room,

716
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,520
just completely shunned them. So he's
riding to another church because of this.

717
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:53,960
Now look at Third John,
the elder to the beloved Gaius.

718
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,610
Now it's the same person writing,
he says,

719
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:58,190
but now it's to amending
Gaius not to the elect lady.

720
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:03,740
I pray that all may go well with you mean
good health, blah, blah, blah, beloved,

721
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,810
you do faithfully whatever
you do for the friends,

722
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,100
even though they are strangers to you,

723
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:08,960
they have testified to your
life before the church.

724
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,380
You will do well to send them
on in a manner worthy of God,

725
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:14,300
for they began their journey
for the sake of Christ.

726
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,580
Accepting no support from nonbelievers.

727
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,630
So this is a letter that's been sent
around probably with other traveling

728
00:44:20,631 --> 00:44:21,464
preachers,

729
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:26,090
but these traveling preachers seem to
be representatives of the elder himself,

730
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,230
the author. So he's writing to a man named
Gaius and says, you, you're a good guy.

731
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,590
You receive our messengers.

732
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:34,020
You receive the people that
were sending around to preach.

733
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:38,790
I have written something to the church.
Oh, he did write a letter to the church.

734
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,550
So now let's see what you see.
He wrote another letter to the church.

735
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,500
He's writing this letter to an individual,

736
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:49,250
but Diotrephes who likes to put
himself first does not acknowledge our

737
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:52,110
authority. So if I come, in other words,

738
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:57,090
die entre fees seems to be the leader of
a church and has not allowed the elder

739
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,850
to send his letter to that church.

740
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,440
He's intercepting letters and not allowing
these things to be read aloud in the

741
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:07,140
church. All these letters were supposed
to be read aloud in churches. You see,

742
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,611
if I come,

743
00:45:08,611 --> 00:45:11,970
I will call attention to what he is doing
and spreading false charges against me

744
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,620
and not content with these charges.

745
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,550
He refuses to welcome the friends and
even prevents those who want to do so and

746
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,720
expelled them from the church.

747
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,710
Diopter fees is refusing to welcome the
messengers from the elder that the elder

748
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:31,710
sent ahead of himself with the
letter. That makes up second. John,

749
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:34,170
is he what's going on here?

750
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,670
There's a leader of this Joe hunting
church probably after the writing of the

751
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:42,420
Gospel, probably after the writing
of first John and he rides second.

752
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:45,510
John as a sort of introductory
letter to a church and he says,

753
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,860
I'm sending you some of my, My
messengers, you know, received them.

754
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,890
Listen to the letter, give them what
they need, help them out financially,

755
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,650
put them up in your guest room and
then send them on their way so they can

756
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:59,280
travel around to other Christian churches.
Something's gone wrong though.

757
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:04,110
Maybe this is a different, maybe third
John, we don't know. This is speculation.

758
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,820
Maybe third John is another letter that
he had to write to an individual in that

759
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:12,390
town because his second John didn't work.

760
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,830
Why it may be that those people disagreed
with him about his Christology also,

761
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:22,050
so they may have received the very people
that he thought they shouldn't receive

762
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,251
and so he rides.

763
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:28,251
Third John Two an individual
saying diopter fees is
causing a bunch of problems,

764
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:32,880
not receiving my messengers and not
allowing my letters to be read in church.

765
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,870
Do you see how this represents,
this is all guesswork.

766
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,460
We don't know what's going on, but we
see several things about the letter.

767
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,070
There's a greeting,
their well wishes.

768
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,330
There's praise of the reputation
and behavior. The recipients. He is,

769
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,510
he attempts to establish a relationship.
He talks to this person of this.

770
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:52,141
He's a father,

771
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:55,890
son or a patron client relationship
and there's a letter of recommendation,

772
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,380
send them on.
This is what you do in the ancient world.

773
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,780
You give a messenger and there's
no post office. You know,

774
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,610
you give a letter to someone
who's traveling and that
person gets to a friend of

775
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:07,680
yours to where it doesn't
and they show the letter.

776
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:12,300
That letter is read outside of read
aloud to the group and then you put that

777
00:47:12,301 --> 00:47:15,480
person up or those people up,
you host them for a while,

778
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:18,030
they talk and you share your
messages and then you send them on.

779
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,210
We give them a little bit of financial
support to send them on their way to the

780
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:23,490
rest of the travel.
So that's clearly what's going on.

781
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:25,890
And both of these letters are
letters of recommendation,

782
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,080
typical letters of recommendation.

783
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:33,370
But what makes it interesting is that
second John seems to have been a letter of

784
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:37,720
recommendation that didn't work,
maybe.

785
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,041
And then third,

786
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:43,330
John had to be written to an individual
because his letter couldn't get through

787
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,820
to the whole church.

788
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,420
So what's the cause of this division?

789
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,880
Clearly the cause of division and the
gospel of John is that some people are not

790
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:57,310
accepting a high enough christology.

791
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:59,680
They're not accepting that
Jesus is truly divine.

792
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,280
They might be accepting that Jesus
is human, but not that he's divine.

793
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,830
The situation has shifted slightly by
the time we get to the first John the

794
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:11,620
letter because there it seems like,
yes,

795
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:14,560
he's talked about some
people are antichrist because
they've denied that Jesus

796
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:15,340
the Messiah,

797
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,930
but other people are antichrist because
they've denied that Jesus' flesh and he

798
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:22,150
says they've gone out from among us.

799
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,710
So the church has been split
again on the issue of Christology,

800
00:48:26,711 --> 00:48:31,180
but now the Christology is one.
Do you accept the full flushness of Jesus?

801
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,310
But then when you get
to second John in third,

802
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:37,690
John the split is the split now doctrinal,

803
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:42,670
is it Christological or is this just a
split over who gets to be the leader?

804
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,900
Who gets to be the recognized leader
of these church, these churches?

805
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:51,901
Is it the elder to his letters have
to be accepted in his emissaries,

806
00:48:52,061 --> 00:48:55,720
get accepted in different churches,
or is it this Guy Die Otra fees?

807
00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:00,460
Is he sort of trying to buck the elder
for the leadership and is there dispute

808
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,480
over Christology?

809
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:06,430
Do they disagree about Christology or is
it now a purely a personnel leadership

810
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:09,010
issue?
It's very difficult to see,

811
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:14,230
but you can very quickly see how though
in these by looking at these four

812
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:19,180
different documents, the gospel of
John First, John Second, John Third,

813
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:23,350
John Four different documents which
may have been written in this,

814
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,690
not by the same person, we don't think
they're all written by the same person,

815
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,480
but they're clearly written by the
same school of early Christianity.

816
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,610
They share enough of the vocabulary,
enough theology,

817
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:35,800
and you can almost see four different
stages of development and you see what we

818
00:49:35,801 --> 00:49:39,550
might expect. I remember I said that
and grown up in Texas where I was said,

819
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:41,260
let's make like a Baptist church and split

820
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:46,840
early churches also seemed to split a lot.
Is that what we see here,

821
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,370
four different stages of a church with
different kinds of divisions happening

822
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,790
and therefore different kinds of
Christianity developing to do to these

823
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:59,110
divisions. Very possibly.
Any questions about that?

824
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,610
Questions, comments, outbursts? Now,

825
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:08,650
what I've just given you is one reading
of these texts and I've done a lot of

826
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:10,990
speculating. For example, you
could just say, well, second,

827
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:14,230
John May have been written to one church
and third, John's written to a totally,

828
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:16,480
completely geographical region.
That's entirely possible.

829
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,960
I think it's interesting to put them
in this way and read them this way,

830
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,740
but that's just one historical
reconstruction because a
lot of what I'm teaching

831
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:24,730
you is let's,

832
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:29,060
how do you imagine history developing
if all you have are these texts by which

833
00:50:29,061 --> 00:50:30,710
you construct the history
of the early church.

834
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,480
Next time we're going to
shift gears dramatically
because now we're not going to

835
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:38,450
be talking about the historical
situation of the text.

836
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,230
We're going to be talking about how do
you get through all these texts to try to

837
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:44,660
figure out the historical Jesus himself?

838
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:49,640
Did Jesus of Nazareth Really Exist?
What did he do?

839
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,700
What did he say?
What did he think of himself?

840
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,620
That's what we'll talk about next time.
