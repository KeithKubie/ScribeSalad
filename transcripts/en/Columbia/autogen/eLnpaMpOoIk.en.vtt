says that the three critical issues try
to interpret some of the results that I

to interpret some of the results that I
 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.430
to interpret some of the results that I
will present and then you know go back

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440
will present and then you know go back
 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.710
will present and then you know go back
to the institutional arrangements and

the developing countries and the global
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.080
the developing countries and the global
order so I will start by by presenting

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
order so I will start by by presenting
 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.300
order so I will start by by presenting
you know you know some facts that relate

you know you know some facts that relate
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.759
you know you know some facts that relate
to you know to the three when I call the

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769
to you know to the three when I call the
 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.339
to you know to the three when I call the
three critical issues in the

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349
three critical issues in the
 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.550
three critical issues in the
international economic order the first

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560
international economic order the first
 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.030
international economic order the first
one is that markets are very unevenly

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040
one is that markets are very unevenly
 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.150
one is that markets are very unevenly
liberalized we'll see through the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160
liberalized we'll see through the
 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.849
liberalized we'll see through the
comparison of different previous in

the second is the and the one which I
will dwell in for a bit longer in this

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549
will dwell in for a bit longer in this
 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.509
will dwell in for a bit longer in this
initial part of the presentation is that

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519
initial part of the presentation is that
 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.099
initial part of the presentation is that
the benefits of the of the globalization

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109
the benefits of the of the globalization
 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.690
the benefits of the of the globalization
process are very unevenly distributed

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700
process are very unevenly distributed
 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.229
process are very unevenly distributed
both among nations and among citizens

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239
both among nations and among citizens
 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.039
both among nations and among citizens
and I would say that you know to a large

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049
and I would say that you know to a large
 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.659
and I would say that you know to a large
extent this you know these outcomes

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669
extent this you know these outcomes
 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.990
extent this you know these outcomes
relate to to a third critical issue

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000
relate to to a third critical issue
 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.759
relate to to a third critical issue
which is the fact that there is a

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769
which is the fact that there is a
 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.270
which is the fact that there is a
significant lag in the development of

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280
significant lag in the development of
 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.569
significant lag in the development of

that regard we we are leaving some of
 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.850
that regard we we are leaving some of
the issues that were faced by many

and the nation-state in a sense we are
 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.640
and the nation-state in a sense we are
building we have been building an

system of institutions I mean there are

transnational institutions have been
 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.930
transnational institutions have been
created for instance in Europe you know

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940
created for instance in Europe you know
 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.990
created for instance in Europe you know
with the European Union and the European

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000
with the European Union and the European
 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.510
with the European Union and the European
Commission which has a specific set of

Commission which has a specific set of

Commission which has a specific set of
powers which I you know overall member

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:33.750
powers which I you know overall member
 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.510
powers which I you know overall member
or member states of the European Union

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520
or member states of the European Union

but aside from those limited examples
 

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.100
but aside from those limited examples
and I probably outside for that a

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.110
and I probably outside for that a
 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.980
and I probably outside for that a
specific example we are building a

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:45.990
specific example we are building a
 

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.870
specific example we are building a
system an international system which

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880
system an international system which
 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.480
system an international system which
there is a system based on nations or

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.490
there is a system based on nations or
 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.460
there is a system based on nations or
nation-states

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:51.470
nation-states
 

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.170
nation-states
now one of the very peculiar

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180
now one of the very peculiar
 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.750
now one of the very peculiar
characteristics of that system is that

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:56.760
characteristics of that system is that
 

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.780
characteristics of that system is that
nation states have been weakening at the

00:07:59.780 --> 00:07:59.790
nation states have been weakening at the
 

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.600
nation states have been weakening at the
same time so we're building a system in

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:02.610
same time so we're building a system in
 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.600
same time so we're building a system in
which we still have a very unsettled

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:05.610
which we still have a very unsettled
 

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.270
which we still have a very unsettled
relation between the international the

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280
relation between the international the
 

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.690
relation between the international the
global order and the nation-state and

global order and the nation-state and
 

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.110
global order and the nation-state and
finally I'm very importantly also we

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120
finally I'm very importantly also we
 

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.659
finally I'm very importantly also we
still have a system in who is developing

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:17.669
still have a system in who is developing
 

00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:20.000
still have a system in who is developing

intermediate stage between the first and

the second which was really the collapse
 

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.360
the second which was really the collapse
or the first global world so we have a

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:15.370
or the first global world so we have a
 

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.640
or the first global world so we have a
first globalization you know drawing

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:17.650
first globalization you know drawing

first globalization you know drawing
let's say from 1870 to 1913 they

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.130
let's say from 1870 to 1913 they
 

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.880
let's say from 1870 to 1913 they

giving rise to a second phase of
 

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.410
giving rise to a second phase of

globalization from they say they at the
 

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.930

end of the Second World War to 1973 and
then you know they say the the sort of

then you know they say the the sort of
 

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.340
then you know they say the the sort of

process that we have been living through
 

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.080

since the mid 1970s now if we look at
 

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.690
since the mid 1970s now if we look at
the at the last column here and compare

the at the last column here and compare
 

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.150
the at the last column here and compare
with the previous ones let's say that

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160
with the previous ones let's say that
 

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.640
with the previous ones let's say that
you know the very specific

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:50.650
you know the very specific
 

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.850
you know the very specific
characteristics or the current system is

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:53.860
characteristics or the current system is
 

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:59.610
characteristics or the current system is
the high capital mobility so capital is

00:09:59.610 --> 00:09:59.620
the high capital mobility so capital is
 

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.470
the high capital mobility so capital is
very free to move among nations and the

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480
very free to move among nations and the
 

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.320
very free to move among nations and the
third line what I call extensive free

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:07.330
third line what I call extensive free
 

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.400
third line what I call extensive free
trade now in the first area that is in

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:11.410
trade now in the first area that is in
 

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.260
trade now in the first area that is in
in relation to the to the capital

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:13.270
in relation to the to the capital
 

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.690
in relation to the to the capital
mobility we have a system which is very

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:15.700
mobility we have a system which is very
 

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.810
mobility we have a system which is very
similar to the first globalization in

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:18.820
similar to the first globalization in
 

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.450
similar to the first globalization in
the third in the area of trade we have

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:21.460
the third in the area of trade we have
 

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.120
the third in the area of trade we have
actually much more liberalized trade

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.130
actually much more liberalized trade
 

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.990
actually much more liberalized trade
today than we ever had in history it is

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000
today than we ever had in history it is
 

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
today than we ever had in history it is
not true that the first mobilization was

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.010
not true that the first mobilization was
 

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.310
not true that the first mobilization was
a world of free trade there were agents

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320
a world of free trade there were agents
 

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.700
a world of free trade there were agents
of free trade such as Great Britain but

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:35.710
of free trade such as Great Britain but
 

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.440
of free trade such as Great Britain but
there were also major protectionist

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:37.450
there were also major protectionist
 

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.750
there were also major protectionist
nations starting with the United States

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760
nations starting with the United States
 

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.150

Europe and Latin America being you know

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800
Europe and Latin America being you know
 

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.380
Europe and Latin America being you know
during that phase you know very

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:46.390
during that phase you know very
 

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.460
during that phase you know very
protectionist nations so actually the

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:50.470
protectionist nations so actually the
 

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.980
protectionist nations so actually the
all of the first globalization was

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:52.990
all of the first globalization was
 

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.010
all of the first globalization was
actually one of limited free trade you

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:56.020
actually one of limited free trade you
 

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.410
actually one of limited free trade you
know from that perspective we certainly

00:10:58.410 --> 00:10:58.420
know from that perspective we certainly
 

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.690
know from that perspective we certainly
have today the most liberalized trade

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:00.700
have today the most liberalized trade
 

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.680
have today the most liberalized trade
regime ever in history now at the same

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:04.690

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.940
regime ever in history now at the same
time you see that we have you know what

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:08.950
time you see that we have you know what
 

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.160
time you see that we have you know what
I call growing and segmented labor

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.170
I call growing and segmented labor
 

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.360
I call growing and segmented labor
mobility by growing we will see that in

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:15.370
mobility by growing we will see that in
 

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.750
mobility by growing we will see that in
fact you know a labor has been has

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760
fact you know a labor has been has
 

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.550

become increasingly mobile after

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560
become increasingly mobile after
 

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.030
become increasingly mobile after
collapsing both in the interworld period

and in the first globally in the second

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:26.350
and in the first globally in the second
 

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.920
and in the first globally in the second
globalization you know there has been an

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:28.930
globalization you know there has been an
 

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.960
globalization you know there has been an
extensive movement towards labor

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:30.970
extensive movement towards labor
 

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.810
extensive movement towards labor
mobility but it is still you know

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:33.820
mobility but it is still you know
 

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.900

limited and very importantly segmented

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:36.910
limited and very importantly segmented
 

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.180
limited and very importantly segmented
in a different way to the way it was

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:39.190
in a different way to the way it was
 

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.130
in a different way to the way it was
segmented during the first globalization

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:41.140
segmented during the first globalization
 

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.230

where labor was probably more mobile

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240
where labor was probably more mobile
 

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.220
where labor was probably more mobile
than today the the segmentations that we

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:47.230
than today the the segmentations that we
 

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.230
than today the the segmentations that we
have today are basically segmentations

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240
have today are basically segmentations
 

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.590
have today are basically segmentations
according to the skills of workers so

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600
according to the skills of workers so
 

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.930
according to the skills of workers so
steam workers are much more mobile than

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:54.940
steam workers are much more mobile than
 

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.240
steam workers are much more mobile than
unskilled workers or to be precise on

illegal manner I prefer the term

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720
illegal manner I prefer the term
 

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.260
illegal manner I prefer the term
irregular to illegal because you know

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:10.270
irregular to illegal because you know
 

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.260
irregular to illegal because you know
people are not never illegal okay so

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:13.270
people are not never illegal okay so
 

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.750
people are not never illegal okay so
that so the irregular form in critical

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760
that so the irregular form in critical
 

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.630
that so the irregular form in critical
you know labor mobility takes place in

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:18.640
you know labor mobility takes place in
 

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.300
you know labor mobility takes place in
the first globalization is interesting

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:21.310
the first globalization is interesting
 

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.610
the first globalization is interesting
that the major forms of segmentation

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:23.620
that the major forms of segmentation
 

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.520
that the major forms of segmentation
were were according to the origin of

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:26.530
were were according to the origin of
 

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.610
were were according to the origin of
migrants so essentially ancient migrants

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:29.620
migrants so essentially ancient migrants
 

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.010

move in a different way from European
 

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.500
move in a different way from European
migrants you know while European

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:34.510
migrants you know while European
 

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.540

migrants migrated to the United States

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:36.550

at some point from migrating into those
places so that asians really migrated to

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:50.530
places so that asians really migrated to
 

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.930

they are lagging behind that's a
 

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:16.489
they are lagging behind that's a
different characteristic I think from

00:13:16.489 --> 00:13:16.499
different characteristic I think from
 

00:13:16.499 --> 00:13:19.040
different characteristic I think from

third globalization and finally in terms

00:14:10.939 --> 00:14:10.949
third globalization and finally in terms
 

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:13.309
third globalization and finally in terms
of the national institutions I will say

00:14:13.309 --> 00:14:13.319
of the national institutions I will say
 

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:15.410
of the national institutions I will say
that the main characteristics or the or

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420
that the main characteristics or the or
 

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.290
that the main characteristics or the or
the or this third globalization is what

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:18.300
the or this third globalization is what
 

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.600
the or this third globalization is what
I call the globe the growing

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:19.610
I call the globe the growing
 

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.970
I call the globe the growing
standardization of institutions that's a

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980
standardization of institutions that's a
 

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.220
standardization of institutions that's a
big the big difference to the previous

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:25.230
big the big difference to the previous
 

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.679
big the big difference to the previous
two phases in which it was openly

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:27.689
two phases in which it was openly
 

00:14:27.689 --> 00:14:29.869
two phases in which it was openly
recognized that international

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:29.879
recognized that international
 

00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:31.519
recognized that international
institutions could be very different

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:31.529
institutions could be very different
 

00:14:31.529 --> 00:14:32.299
institutions could be very different
from each other

00:14:32.299 --> 00:14:32.309
from each other
 

00:14:32.309 --> 00:14:35.329
from each other
so there was no attempt or and no forces

00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:35.339
so there was no attempt or and no forces
 

00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:36.970
so there was no attempt or and no forces
that generated a harmonious

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:36.980
that generated a harmonious
 

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:43.309
that generated a harmonious
modernization of institutions now built

00:14:43.309 --> 00:14:43.319
modernization of institutions now built
 

00:14:43.319 --> 00:14:45.949
modernization of institutions now built
from the point of view of the unequal

00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959
from the point of view of the unequal
 

00:14:45.959 --> 00:14:49.189
from the point of view of the unequal
distribution of benefits well we have

00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199
distribution of benefits well we have
 

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:51.350

let me go through the through the graphs

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360
let me go through the through the graphs
 

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.189
let me go through the through the graphs
is first of all what I call the what is

00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199
is first of all what I call the what is
 

00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:58.030
is first of all what I call the what is
has been called the divergence big time

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040
has been called the divergence big time
 

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.009
has been called the divergence big time
so a long term divergence between

00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019
so a long term divergence between
 

00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:04.160
so a long term divergence between
industrial and developing countries that

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:04.170
industrial and developing countries that
 

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.259
industrial and developing countries that
starts during the first globalization

00:15:06.259 --> 00:15:06.269

two periods the first period they say
 

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.259
two periods the first period they say
basically covers the first globalization

00:15:29.259 --> 00:15:29.269
basically covers the first globalization
 

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:31.199
basically covers the first globalization
and the second cover the interwar period

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:31.209

developing countries lack significantly
 

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:39.429
developing countries lack significantly
behind now that was so what a contracted

00:15:39.429 --> 00:15:39.439
behind now that was so what a contracted
 

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.309
behind now that was so what a contracted
during the second globalization so

00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:42.319
during the second globalization so
 

00:15:42.319 --> 00:15:45.489
during the second globalization so
generally there was a big boom also

00:15:45.489 --> 00:15:45.499
generally there was a big boom also
 

00:15:45.499 --> 00:15:47.850
generally there was a big boom also
called by many people the Golden Age of

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:47.860
called by many people the Golden Age of
 

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.919

you know post-war development in which

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:50.929
you know post-war development in which
 

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:53.319
you know post-war development in which
you know industrial countries grew very

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:53.329
you know industrial countries grew very
 

00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:56.139
you know industrial countries grew very
fast and developing countries had the

00:15:56.139 --> 00:15:56.149
fast and developing countries had the
 

00:15:56.149 --> 00:16:00.369
fast and developing countries had the
first boom ever in history now in the

00:16:00.369 --> 00:16:00.379
first boom ever in history now in the
 

00:16:00.379 --> 00:16:03.460

countries started to lag also behind

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:07.809
countries started to lag also behind
 

00:16:07.809 --> 00:16:11.109
countries started to lag also behind
again behind a particularly those

00:16:11.109 --> 00:16:11.119
again behind a particularly those
 

00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:13.960
again behind a particularly those
outside Asia so you particularly see the

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:13.970
outside Asia so you particularly see the
 

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.079

the black columns at the end basically

00:16:17.079 --> 00:16:17.089
the black columns at the end basically
 

00:16:17.089 --> 00:16:21.129
the black columns at the end basically
delayed to the growth or the you know or

00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:21.139
delayed to the growth or the you know or
 

00:16:21.139 --> 00:16:23.350
delayed to the growth or the you know or
the in the average developing country

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360
the in the average developing country
 

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.889
the in the average developing country
it varies very much less than the

00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:26.899
it varies very much less than the
 

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:28.960
it varies very much less than the
industrial countries which are again in

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:28.970
industrial countries which are again in
 

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.249
industrial countries which are again in
in blue so the result of that is that we

00:16:33.249 --> 00:16:33.259
in blue so the result of that is that we
 

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:35.319
in blue so the result of that is that we
have a long-term increase in

00:16:35.319 --> 00:16:35.329
have a long-term increase in
 

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:38.049
have a long-term increase in
international inequalities this growth

00:16:38.049 --> 00:16:38.059
international inequalities this growth
 

00:16:38.059 --> 00:16:40.239
international inequalities this growth
this shows two measures of international

00:16:40.239 --> 00:16:40.249
this shows two measures of international
 

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:42.220
this shows two measures of international
inequalities in the post-war period

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:42.230
inequalities in the post-war period
 

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.239
inequalities in the post-war period
until 2001 as we will see the the recent

00:16:46.239 --> 00:16:46.249
until 2001 as we will see the the recent
 

00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:48.489
until 2001 as we will see the the recent
period is some part are typical in

00:16:48.489 --> 00:16:48.499
period is some part are typical in
 

00:16:48.499 --> 00:16:53.650
period is some part are typical in
history the the red line shows the ratio

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:53.660
history the the red line shows the ratio
 

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.879
history the the red line shows the ratio
between the per capita income of the

00:16:57.879 --> 00:16:57.889
between the per capita income of the
 

00:16:57.889 --> 00:17:00.069
between the per capita income of the
OECD that is the industrial economies

00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079
OECD that is the industrial economies
 

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:01.629
OECD that is the industrial economies
and sub-saharan Africa

00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639
and sub-saharan Africa
 

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:03.659
and sub-saharan Africa
so there's true the two extremes of the

00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:03.669
so there's true the two extremes of the
 

00:17:03.669 --> 00:17:06.189
so there's true the two extremes of the
international distribution of income as

00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:06.199
international distribution of income as
 

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:08.019
international distribution of income as
you can see there has been as a

00:17:08.019 --> 00:17:08.029
you can see there has been as a
 

00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:10.929
you can see there has been as a
persistent increase in the gap between

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:10.939
persistent increase in the gap between
 

00:17:10.939 --> 00:17:12.939
persistent increase in the gap between
industrial economies and sub-saharan

00:17:12.939 --> 00:17:12.949
industrial economies and sub-saharan
 

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:18.610
industrial economies and sub-saharan
Africa now the blue shows the let's say

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:18.620
Africa now the blue shows the let's say
 

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.699
Africa now the blue shows the let's say
the average developing country so the

00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:21.709
the average developing country so the
 

00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:24.699
the average developing country so the
story there is it's a bit different as

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:24.709
story there is it's a bit different as
 

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:25.689
story there is it's a bit different as
you

00:17:25.689 --> 00:17:25.699
you
 

00:17:25.699 --> 00:17:28.529
you
see there has been also almost

00:17:28.529 --> 00:17:28.539
see there has been also almost
 

00:17:28.539 --> 00:17:32.440
see there has been also almost
persistent increase in inequality with

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:32.450
persistent increase in inequality with
 

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.590
persistent increase in inequality with
you know one exception which is the

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600
you know one exception which is the
 

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.370
you know one exception which is the
period between 1973 and 1980 but aside

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:39.380
period between 1973 and 1980 but aside
 

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.009
period between 1973 and 1980 but aside
from that also the average developing

00:17:42.009 --> 00:17:42.019
from that also the average developing
 

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:44.860
from that also the average developing
country has lagged behind the industrial

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:44.870
country has lagged behind the industrial
 

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.909
country has lagged behind the industrial
world so the you know build you know on

00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919
world so the you know build you know on
 

00:17:48.919 --> 00:17:51.639
world so the you know build you know on
over long periods of time as we saw in

00:17:51.639 --> 00:17:51.649
over long periods of time as we saw in
 

00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:53.980
over long periods of time as we saw in
the previous graph prior to 1950 there

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:53.990
the previous graph prior to 1950 there
 

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.629
the previous graph prior to 1950 there
have been a significant divergence of

00:17:55.629 --> 00:17:55.639
have been a significant divergence of
 

00:17:55.639 --> 00:17:58.210
have been a significant divergence of
income and generally speaking on average

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:58.220
income and generally speaking on average
 

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.700
income and generally speaking on average
there has also been an increase in

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:00.710
there has also been an increase in
 

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.669
there has also been an increase in
increasing divergence of incomes since

00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679
increasing divergence of incomes since
 

00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:08.799
increasing divergence of incomes since
since the 1950s so the recent period the

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:08.809
since the 1950s so the recent period the
 

00:18:08.809 --> 00:18:10.830
since the 1950s so the recent period the
period going particularly from nineteen

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840

the first period in which we see a very
 

00:18:18.679 --> 00:18:21.340
the first period in which we see a very
high diverging advantage of developing

high diverging advantage of developing
 

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.740
high diverging advantage of developing
countries this is the first period in

countries with income inequality has
 

00:19:43.419 --> 00:19:47.970
countries with income inequality has
risen or has fallen basically over the

risen or has fallen basically over the
 

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.940
risen or has fallen basically over the
last three decades and the conclusion is

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:50.950
last three decades and the conclusion is
 

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.890
last three decades and the conclusion is
that eighty eight percent of the

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:52.900
that eighty eight percent of the
 

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.770
that eighty eight percent of the
population of the world lives in

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:55.780
population of the world lives in
 

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.700

countries where inequality is increasing

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:58.710
countries where inequality is increasing
 

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.240
countries where inequality is increasing
so increasing inequality within nations

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:02.250
so increasing inequality within nations
 

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.640
so increasing inequality within nations
is even a more pervasive phenomenon in a

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:05.650
is even a more pervasive phenomenon in a
 

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.280
is even a more pervasive phenomenon in a
sense than in increasing inequality

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:08.290
sense than in increasing inequality
 

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.730
sense than in increasing inequality
among nations particularly because among

now over 25 years and India in a shorter
 

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:29.030
now over 25 years and India in a shorter
period of time now on the contrary

according to this estimates less than 3%
 

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.210
according to this estimates less than 3%
or the population of the world live in

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220
or the population of the world live in
 

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.980

countries where income distribution

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:37.990
countries where income distribution
 

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.080
countries where income distribution
improved in the last three decades of

improved in the last three decades of
 

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.049
improved in the last three decades of
the 20th century so this is a very

00:20:43.049 --> 00:20:43.059
the 20th century so this is a very
 

00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:45.330
the 20th century so this is a very
pervasive phenomena that you know we see

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:45.340
pervasive phenomena that you know we see
 

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.720
pervasive phenomena that you know we see
here in turns in this next graph in

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:48.730
here in turns in this next graph in
 

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:50.580
here in turns in this next graph in
terms of the you know the effects that

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:50.590
terms of the you know the effects that
 

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.299
terms of the you know the effects that
that has had on income inequality in the

00:20:54.299 --> 00:20:54.309
that has had on income inequality in the
 

00:20:54.309 --> 00:20:57.210
that has had on income inequality in the
world so while you know the income

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:57.220
world so while you know the income
 

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.549
world so while you know the income
inequality of the world may have

00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559
inequality of the world may have
 

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:02.520
inequality of the world may have
improved particularly due to the rise of

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:02.530
improved particularly due to the rise of
 

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.919
improved particularly due to the rise of
China in part in the in the world

00:21:04.919 --> 00:21:04.929

you know income inequality within
 

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.990
you know income inequality within
countries has been an increasing source

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.000
countries has been an increasing source
 

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.680
countries has been an increasing source
of world inequality since then you know

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:16.690
of world inequality since then you know
 

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:21.539
of world inequality since then you know
since 1980 at least now a third

developing countries you know relate to
 

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.780
developing countries you know relate to
some social issues and I just you know

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:30.790
some social issues and I just you know
 

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.080
some social issues and I just you know
mentioned two here the first one is that

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.090
mentioned two here the first one is that

the development of a let's say of a
 

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.980
the development of a let's say of a
social welfare state is a you know is

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:40.990
social welfare state is a you know is
 

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.070
social welfare state is a you know is
highly associated with the income level

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080
highly associated with the income level
 

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.789
highly associated with the income level
of countries so if we see here the you

00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799
of countries so if we see here the you
 

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:48.810
of countries so if we see here the you
know the

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:48.820
know the
 

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.399
know the
spending the socialist spending as a

00:21:50.399 --> 00:21:50.409

of the economies we see that you know we
 

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.810
of the economies we see that you know we
have the three corners for low-income

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:57.820
have the three corners for low-income
 

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.639
have the three corners for low-income
middle-income and high-income countries

00:21:59.639 --> 00:21:59.649
middle-income and high-income countries
 

00:21:59.649 --> 00:22:02.850
middle-income and high-income countries
so the high-income countries generally

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:02.860
so the high-income countries generally
 

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.370
so the high-income countries generally
have the the instantly a very

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:05.380
have the the instantly a very
 

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.289
have the the instantly a very
sophisticated set of institution to

00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:07.299
sophisticated set of institution to
 

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:10.259
sophisticated set of institution to
manage the the affects of markets and to

00:22:10.259 --> 00:22:10.269
manage the the affects of markets and to
 

00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:13.259
manage the the affects of markets and to
promote a social development while you

00:22:13.259 --> 00:22:13.269
promote a social development while you
 

00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:15.779
promote a social development while you
know this is not true particularly of

00:22:15.779 --> 00:22:15.789
know this is not true particularly of
 

00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:17.279
know this is not true particularly of
low-income countries and many

00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:17.289
low-income countries and many
 

00:22:17.289 --> 00:22:19.139
low-income countries and many
middle-income countries are really

00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:19.149
middle-income countries are really
 

00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:21.299
middle-income countries are really
struggling to develop those institutions

00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:21.309
struggling to develop those institutions
 

00:22:21.309 --> 00:22:24.779
struggling to develop those institutions
so the the capacity of nation-states to

so the the capacity of nation-states to
 

00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:27.299
so the the capacity of nation-states to
contract markets by themselves you know

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:27.309
contract markets by themselves you know
 

00:22:27.309 --> 00:22:30.539
contract markets by themselves you know
really depends on the level of income of

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.740
not work is smoothly among other reasons
because industrial countries protect

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:27.750
because industrial countries protect
 

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.590
because industrial countries protect
those sectors which they should you know

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600
those sectors which they should you know
 

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.870
those sectors which they should you know
are Dakini in the industrial economies

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880
are Dakini in the industrial economies
 

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.970
are Dakini in the industrial economies
and should be transferred but they try

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:34.980
and should be transferred but they try

to avoid in order process due to many

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:37.530
to avoid in order process due to many
 

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.520
to avoid in order process due to many
you know internal pressures that they

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:40.530
you know internal pressures that they
 

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.260
you know internal pressures that they
face including the internal political

face including the internal political
 

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:47.840
face including the internal political
pressures and the third problem is the

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:47.850
pressures and the third problem is the
 

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:50.480
pressures and the third problem is the
asymmetry in the degree of mobility of

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:50.490
asymmetry in the degree of mobility of
 

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.630
asymmetry in the degree of mobility of
factors of production and this issue

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640
factors of production and this issue
 

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.750
factors of production and this issue
remains in particular to the fact that

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760
remains in particular to the fact that
 

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.250
remains in particular to the fact that
capital it's much more mobile than labor

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:00.260
capital it's much more mobile than labor
 

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.430
capital it's much more mobile than labor
and particularly than unskilled labor

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440
and particularly than unskilled labor
 

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.380
and particularly than unskilled labor
now the major implication of that fact

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:06.390
now the major implication of that fact
 

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.380
now the major implication of that fact
as you know I think that they someone

particularly in some of the work by
Danny Broderick has shown is that there

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:14.250
Danny Broderick has shown is that there
 

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:17.780
Danny Broderick has shown is that there
is a bias in income distribution against

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:17.790
is a bias in income distribution against
 

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.940
is a bias in income distribution against
the less mobile factors and in favor the

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:19.950
the less mobile factors and in favor the
 

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.820
the less mobile factors and in favor the
more mobile factors so the tendency of

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:22.830
more mobile factors so the tendency of
 

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.070

the fact that the international economy
discriminates against labor mobility and

course they you know we are experiencing
 

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.139
course they you know we are experiencing
in the developing world a true flood of

00:29:17.139 --> 00:29:17.149
in the developing world a true flood of
 

00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:19.570
in the developing world a true flood of
capital but we have experienced in the

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:19.580
capital but we have experienced in the
 

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.610

past order floats of capital the problem
 

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.159
past order floats of capital the problem
is that the floats of capital are you

00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:24.169
is that the floats of capital are you
 

00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:27.970
is that the floats of capital are you
know followed by by very dry weather so

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:27.980
know followed by by very dry weather so
 

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.980
know followed by by very dry weather so
is the instability of finance the fact

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:29.990
is the instability of finance the fact
 

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.200
is the instability of finance the fact
that we alternate between extremely good

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:32.210
that we alternate between extremely good
 

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.930
that we alternate between extremely good
finances and extremely under lack of

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:34.940
finances and extremely under lack of
 

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.360
finances and extremely under lack of
financing that generates very strong

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:37.370
financing that generates very strong
 

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:41.590
financing that generates very strong
swings in the developing world and this

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600
swings in the developing world and this
 

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.480
swings in the developing world and this
is seen from the point of view of the

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:43.490
is seen from the point of view of the
 

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:46.899
is seen from the point of view of the
cost of capital so the the periods of

00:29:46.899 --> 00:29:46.909
cost of capital so the the periods of
 

00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:50.049
cost of capital so the the periods of
crisis are reflected here in peaks in

00:29:50.049 --> 00:29:50.059
crisis are reflected here in peaks in
 

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:53.200
crisis are reflected here in peaks in
the cost of financing so you know you

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:53.210
the cost of financing so you know you
 

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.200
the cost of financing so you know you
know if we combine the two graphs we

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.210
know if we combine the two graphs we
 

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.610
know if we combine the two graphs we
will see that the previous equation

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:57.620
will see that the previous equation
 

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.250
will see that the previous equation
financing is available the cost of

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:00.260
financing is available the cost of
 

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.950
financing is available the cost of
financing for the periods in which

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:01.960
financing for the periods in which
 

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.360
financing for the periods in which
financing is not available are periods

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:04.370
financing is not available are periods
 

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.950
financing is not available are periods
in which financing becomes very

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:05.960
in which financing becomes very
 

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.200
in which financing becomes very
expensive so we alternate between

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:08.210
expensive so we alternate between
 

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.539
expensive so we alternate between
periods in which financing is good

00:30:10.539 --> 00:30:10.549
periods in which financing is good
 

00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:15.129
periods in which financing is good
unless an available at very low cost

00:30:15.129 --> 00:30:15.139
unless an available at very low cost
 

00:30:15.139 --> 00:30:16.930
unless an available at very low cost
with producing which is not available

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:16.940
with producing which is not available
 

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.090
with producing which is not available
and whatever is available is available

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:19.100
and whatever is available is available
 

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.090
and whatever is available is available
at very high cost so in this particular

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:22.100
at very high cost so in this particular
 

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.360
at very high cost so in this particular
swings in financing that you know are

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:25.370
swings in financing that you know are
 

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.509
swings in financing that you know are
you know the manifestation of that first

00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519
you know the manifestation of that first
 

00:30:28.519 --> 00:30:32.799
you know the manifestation of that first
asymmetry that I was mentioning now this

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:32.809
asymmetry that I was mentioning now this
 

00:30:32.809 --> 00:30:35.080
asymmetry that I was mentioning now this
is one so you say well why don't

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:35.090
is one so you say well why don't
 

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.799
is one so you say well why don't
developing countries you know

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:37.809
developing countries you know
 

00:30:37.809 --> 00:30:39.659

room of manoeuvre to do that and one way

00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559
room of manoeuvre to do that and one way
 

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:55.229
room of manoeuvre to do that and one way
to see that is this particular in a

00:30:55.229 --> 00:30:55.239
to see that is this particular in a

00:30:59.019 --> 00:31:03.180
table in which is teammate how cyclical
is fiscal policy and we see you know in

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:03.190
is fiscal policy and we see you know in
 

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.609
is fiscal policy and we see you know in
the table you see the countries have

00:31:05.609 --> 00:31:05.619
the table you see the countries have
 

00:31:05.619 --> 00:31:08.639
the table you see the countries have
counter-cyclical fiscal policies so they

00:31:08.639 --> 00:31:08.649
counter-cyclical fiscal policies so they
 

00:31:08.649 --> 00:31:10.649
counter-cyclical fiscal policies so they
tend to that means that they tend to

00:31:10.649 --> 00:31:10.659
tend to that means that they tend to
 

00:31:10.659 --> 00:31:13.680
tend to that means that they tend to
increase public sector spending during

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:13.690
increase public sector spending during
 

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.589
increase public sector spending during
crisis and trend to moderate public

00:31:16.589 --> 00:31:16.599
crisis and trend to moderate public
 

00:31:16.599 --> 00:31:18.810
crisis and trend to moderate public
sector spending to their boobs so fiscal

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:18.820
sector spending to their boobs so fiscal
 

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.299

policy tends to smooth business cycles

00:31:21.299 --> 00:31:21.309
policy tends to smooth business cycles
 

00:31:21.309 --> 00:31:24.299
policy tends to smooth business cycles
in the developing world the opposite is

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:24.309
in the developing world the opposite is
 

00:31:24.309 --> 00:31:27.419
in the developing world the opposite is
true in regions or the developing world

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:27.429

cyclical policies so you know actually

00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:33.249
cyclical policies so you know actually
 

00:31:33.249 --> 00:31:36.539
cyclical policies so you know actually
fiscal policy moves or reinforces the

developing world has a counter-cyclical
fiscal policy as industrial firms so

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:45.820
fiscal policy as industrial firms so
 

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.909
fiscal policy as industrial firms so
this these are manifestations of that so

00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919
this these are manifestations of that so
 

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:49.560
this these are manifestations of that so
that developing countries are subject to

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:49.570
that developing countries are subject to
 

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:50.039
that developing countries are subject to
stalls

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:50.049
stalls
 

00:31:50.049 --> 00:31:53.190

to strong very strong cyclical swings in

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200
to strong very strong cyclical swings in
 

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.209
to strong very strong cyclical swings in
the international economy and I think

00:31:57.209 --> 00:31:57.219
the international economy and I think
 

00:31:57.219 --> 00:31:59.159
the international economy and I think
there is a lot of evidence in you know

00:31:59.159 --> 00:31:59.169
there is a lot of evidence in you know
 

00:31:59.169 --> 00:32:01.469
there is a lot of evidence in you know
it's a massive literature that actually

00:32:01.469 --> 00:32:01.479
it's a massive literature that actually
 

00:32:01.479 --> 00:32:03.269
it's a massive literature that actually
has shown that business cycle has have

00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279
has shown that business cycle has have
 

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:05.940
has shown that business cycle has have
tended to become smoother in industrial

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:05.950
tended to become smoother in industrial
 

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.489

countries in developing in the

00:32:08.489 --> 00:32:08.499
countries in developing in the
 

00:32:08.499 --> 00:32:09.899

developing world actually the evidence

00:32:09.899 --> 00:32:09.909
developing world actually the evidence
 

00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:12.629
developing world actually the evidence
is the opposite that business cycle had

00:32:12.629 --> 00:32:12.639
is the opposite that business cycle had
 

00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:17.209
is the opposite that business cycle had
become sharper you know more stronger

00:32:17.209 --> 00:32:17.219

last year 800 billion dollars now the
 

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.250
last year 800 billion dollars now the
reason for that I would say the basic

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:08.260
reason for that I would say the basic
 

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.950
reason for that I would say the basic
reason for that is that since developing

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960
reason for that is that since developing
 

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.360
reason for that is that since developing
countries have learned that they are

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:12.370
countries have learned that they are
 

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:15.780
countries have learned that they are
subject to strong cycles of finance they

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:15.790
subject to strong cycles of finance they
 

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.060
subject to strong cycles of finance they
have decided to use the current good

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:18.070
have decided to use the current good
 

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:21.240

financial conditions to accumulate what

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:21.250
financial conditions to accumulate what
 

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:24.510
financial conditions to accumulate what
has come to be called self insurance so

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:24.520
has come to be called self insurance so
 

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.830
has come to be called self insurance so
they basically they have been

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840
they basically they have been
 

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.360
they basically they have been
accumulating massive amount of

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:27.370

next crisis and the manifestation one of

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:33.940
next crisis and the manifestation one of
 

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.640
next crisis and the manifestation one of
the major manifestations of that you

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:35.650
the major manifestations of that you
 

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.230
the major manifestations of that you
know together I guess with other

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:37.240
know together I guess with other
 

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.270

fairly basically with high commodity
 

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.440
fairly basically with high commodity
prices but the result of that is that

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:43.450
prices but the result of that is that
 

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:45.990

you know developing countries actually

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000
you know developing countries actually
 

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.480
you know developing countries actually
instead of receiving net financing from

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:48.490
instead of receiving net financing from
 

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:49.710
instead of receiving net financing from
the industrial countries are actually

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720
the industrial countries are actually
 

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.750
the industrial countries are actually
financing the industrial countries and

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760
financing the industrial countries and
 

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:56.910
financing the industrial countries and
particularly the United States now in

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:56.920
particularly the United States now in
 

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.180
particularly the United States now in
the trade area I would say the major

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:00.190
the trade area I would say the major
 

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.150
the trade area I would say the major
problem the major problem that we have

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:03.160
problem the major problem that we have
 

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.570
problem the major problem that we have
is that they the opportunities tend to

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:06.580
is that they the opportunities tend to
 

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.419
is that they the opportunities tend to
be very only unevenly distributed among

00:34:09.419 --> 00:34:09.429
be very only unevenly distributed among
 

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:12.090
be very only unevenly distributed among
the developing countries and this first

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:12.100
the developing countries and this first
 

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.629
the developing countries and this first
of all the the only way in which they

00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639
of all the the only way in which they
 

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:18.540
of all the the only way in which they
say the technological transfer can be

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:18.550
say the technological transfer can be
 

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:21.389
say the technological transfer can be
done smoothly from the let's say from

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399
done smoothly from the let's say from
 

00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:22.800
done smoothly from the let's say from
the industrial country throughout the

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:22.810
the industrial country throughout the
 

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:26.270
the industrial country throughout the
developing world it's actually to have a

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280
developing world it's actually to have a
 

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.859
developing world it's actually to have a
parallel process by which economic

00:34:28.859 --> 00:34:28.869
parallel process by which economic
 

00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:32.250
parallel process by which economic
activities are transferred now that

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:32.260
activities are transferred now that
 

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.460
activities are transferred now that
process has two problems first of all

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:35.470
process has two problems first of all
 

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:38.580
process has two problems first of all
that industrial countries tend to block

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:38.590
that industrial countries tend to block
 

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:41.369
that industrial countries tend to block
you know that transfer by protecting

00:34:41.369 --> 00:34:41.379
you know that transfer by protecting
 

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:43.889
you know that transfer by protecting
basically agriculture and protecting you

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:43.899
basically agriculture and protecting you
 

00:34:43.899 --> 00:34:46.590
basically agriculture and protecting you
know some light manufacturers which are

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:46.600
know some light manufacturers which are
 

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.500
know some light manufacturers which are
labor intensive okay so that's one

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:49.510
labor intensive okay so that's one
 

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.930
labor intensive okay so that's one
phenomenon and the second phenomena is

00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:51.940
phenomenon and the second phenomena is
 

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.619
phenomenon and the second phenomena is
that the opportunities to adopt

00:34:54.619 --> 00:34:54.629
that the opportunities to adopt
 

00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:56.909
that the opportunities to adopt
particularly manufacturing activities

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919
particularly manufacturing activities
 

00:34:56.919 --> 00:35:00.510
particularly manufacturing activities
are not even are not distributed evenly

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520
are not even are not distributed evenly
 

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.200
are not even are not distributed evenly
among

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:01.210
among
 

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:04.170
among
developing countries so some developing

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:04.180
developing countries so some developing
 

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.810
developing countries so some developing
countries which have already some level

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:06.820
countries which have already some level
 

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:10.230
countries which have already some level
of development are much better at trying

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240
of development are much better at trying
 

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:12.540
of development are much better at trying
to attract those activities than the

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:12.550
to attract those activities than the
 

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.480
to attract those activities than the
average developing helps so for all the

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:15.490
average developing helps so for all the
 

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.099
average developing helps so for all the
velop in countries there are always some

00:35:17.099 --> 00:35:17.109
velop in countries there are always some
 

00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:19.200
velop in countries there are always some
opportunities particularly opportunities

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:19.210
opportunities particularly opportunities
 

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:21.720
opportunities particularly opportunities
to produce primary goods but the

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:21.730
to produce primary goods but the
 

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.720
to produce primary goods but the
opportunities produce manufacturers are

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:23.730
opportunities produce manufacturers are
 

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:26.460
opportunities produce manufacturers are
not evenly distributed among the

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:26.470
not evenly distributed among the
 

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.310
not evenly distributed among the
developing countries now the result is

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320
developing countries now the result is
 

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:33.300
developing countries now the result is
important because as you can see here

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:33.310
important because as you can see here
 

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.370
important because as you can see here
there is strong evidence that the

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:35.380
there is strong evidence that the
 

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.460
there is strong evidence that the
developing countries that are able to

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:38.470
developing countries that are able to
 

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.280
developing countries that are able to
industrialize and particularly in recent

industrialize and particularly in recent
 

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:42.690
industrialize and particularly in recent
periods to industrialized towards

periods to industrialized towards
 

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.030
periods to industrialized towards
highness you know high-tech

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040
highness you know high-tech

manufacturers do much better in terms of
 

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.370
manufacturers do much better in terms of
economic growth than those developing

00:35:56.099 --> 00:35:56.109
the you know the columns on the Left I
 

00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:58.170
the you know the columns on the Left I
mean do you have called two columns here

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:58.180
mean do you have called two columns here
 

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.530
mean do you have called two columns here
it what happened between 1962 and 1980

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:01.540
it what happened between 1962 and 1980
 

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:03.960
it what happened between 1962 and 1980
and then from what happened between 1980

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:03.970
and then from what happened between 1980
 

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:06.839
and then from what happened between 1980
and 2000 and what you see here is that

00:36:06.839 --> 00:36:06.849
and 2000 and what you see here is that
 

00:36:06.849 --> 00:36:10.470
and 2000 and what you see here is that
in the earlier periods of time well you

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480
in the earlier periods of time well you
 

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.170
in the earlier periods of time well you
know in all periods of time the the

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:13.180
know in all periods of time the the
 

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.060
know in all periods of time the the
countries that are basically specialized

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:15.070
countries that are basically specialized
 

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.609
countries that are basically specialized
in primary commodity or in natural

00:36:17.609 --> 00:36:17.619
in primary commodity or in natural
 

00:36:17.619 --> 00:36:19.589
in primary commodity or in natural
resource base manufacturers that base

00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599
resource base manufacturers that base
 

00:36:19.599 --> 00:36:21.810
resource base manufacturers that base
manufactures based on the processing of

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:21.820
manufactures based on the processing of
 

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.030
manufactures based on the processing of
natural resources those countries tend

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:24.040
natural resources those countries tend
 

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.700
natural resources those countries tend
to grow much less much less than

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:26.710
to grow much less much less than
 

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:29.460
to grow much less much less than
countries that industrialize in and in

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:29.470
countries that industrialize in and in
 

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:31.470
countries that industrialize in and in
the recent period is basically countries

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480
the recent period is basically countries
 

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.690
the recent period is basically countries
that move into high-tech manufacturers

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:33.700
that move into high-tech manufacturers
 

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.859
that move into high-tech manufacturers
that can grow relatively fast now again

00:36:37.859 --> 00:36:37.869
that can grow relatively fast now again
 

00:36:37.869 --> 00:36:39.980
that can grow relatively fast now again
this has changed during the recent

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:39.990
this has changed during the recent
 

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.990
this has changed during the recent
period of time basically because natural

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000
period of time basically because natural
 

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.120
period of time basically because natural
resources have become an opportunity

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:45.130
resources have become an opportunity
 

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.040
resources have become an opportunity
again you know for many developing

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:47.050
again you know for many developing
 

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:49.440
again you know for many developing
countries so the in in the recent period

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:49.450
countries so the in in the recent period
 

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:51.480
countries so the in in the recent period
the story you know is slightly different

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:51.490
the story you know is slightly different
 

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.540
the story you know is slightly different
to this but over you know long period of

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:54.550
to this but over you know long period of
 

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.670
to this but over you know long period of
time it is basically the opportunity

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680
time it is basically the opportunity
 

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.800
time it is basically the opportunity
industrialized that has become an

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:58.810
industrialized that has become an
 

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:01.440
industrialized that has become an
opportunity now that opportunity has not

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:01.450
opportunity now that opportunity has not
 

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.030
opportunity now that opportunity has not
been available to all developing

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040
been available to all developing
 

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.260
been available to all developing
countries and particularly low-income

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:04.270
countries and particularly low-income
 

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.690
countries and particularly low-income
countries have fallen behind in that

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:06.700
countries have fallen behind in that
 

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:11.040
countries have fallen behind in that
process and finally looking at my third

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:11.050
process and finally looking at my third
 

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.960
process and finally looking at my third
asymmetry

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:13.970
 

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:16.810
I you know this graph shows that in many

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:16.820
I you know this graph shows that in many
 

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.359
I you know this graph shows that in many
ways migration remains remains more

00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:19.369
ways migration remains remains more
 

00:37:19.369 --> 00:37:20.950
ways migration remains remains more
limited than during the first

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960
limited than during the first
 

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.160
limited than during the first
globalization so I have here the number

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:24.170
globalization so I have here the number
 

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:25.900
globalization so I have here the number
of migrants as a proportion of total

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:25.910
of migrants as a proportion of total
 

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:29.430
of migrants as a proportion of total
population a different points in history

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440
population a different points in history
 

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.740
population a different points in history
you know nineteen ten thirty sixty and

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:32.750
you know nineteen ten thirty sixty and
 

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.950
you know nineteen ten thirty sixty and
two thousand huh when you see here you

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960
two thousand huh when you see here you
 

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.170
two thousand huh when you see here you
know are in a basically two phenomenon

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:38.180
know are in a basically two phenomenon
 

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.780
know are in a basically two phenomenon
aside from Western Europe you know

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:40.790
aside from Western Europe you know
 

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.000
aside from Western Europe you know
Western Europe was a source of migration

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:43.010
Western Europe was a source of migration
 

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:45.670
Western Europe was a source of migration
and they let's say in the late 19th

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680
and they let's say in the late 19th
 

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.640
and they let's say in the late 19th
century and early 20th century and has

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:48.650
century and early 20th century and has
 

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.140
century and early 20th century and has
only become a source of you know

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:50.150
only become a source of you know
 

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:53.500
only become a source of you know
emigration in recent days so you know

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:53.510
emigration in recent days so you know
 

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.550
emigration in recent days so you know
aside from from Western Europe actually

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560
aside from from Western Europe actually
 

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.680
aside from from Western Europe actually
you know the number of migrants as a

00:37:59.680 --> 00:37:59.690
you know the number of migrants as a
 

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.200
you know the number of migrants as a
proportion of the total population

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:01.210
proportion of the total population
 

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.870
proportion of the total population
remains today below the levels reached

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880
remains today below the levels reached
 

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:08.770
remains today below the levels reached
in 1910 and that is a first

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:08.780
in 1910 and that is a first
 

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.920
in 1910 and that is a first
characteristic or differ in all the the

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:11.930
characteristic or differ in all the the
 

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:13.780
characteristic or differ in all the the
traditional context of immigration I

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:13.790
traditional context of immigration I
 

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.910
traditional context of immigration I
mean this means the the US Canada

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920
mean this means the the US Canada
 

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.640
mean this means the the US Canada
Australia New Zealand you know where you

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:18.650
Australia New Zealand you know where you
 

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.410
Australia New Zealand you know where you
know this basically the pattern of the

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:20.420
know this basically the pattern of the
 

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.450
know this basically the pattern of the
u.s. so a significant fall in the

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:22.460
u.s. so a significant fall in the
 

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.120
u.s. so a significant fall in the
proportion of migrants from 1910 to 1960

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:25.130
proportion of migrants from 1910 to 1960
 

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:27.220
proportion of migrants from 1910 to 1960
and then a recovery to levels which

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:27.230
and then a recovery to levels which
 

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:29.800
and then a recovery to levels which
remains significantly below you know

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:29.810
remains significantly below you know
 

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.950
remains significantly below you know
1910 but it's also a very much of the

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960
1910 but it's also a very much of the
 

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.349
1910 but it's also a very much of the
caricature of the other destination of

00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359
caricature of the other destination of
 

00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:38.260
caricature of the other destination of
European migrants in the late 19th early

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:38.270
European migrants in the late 19th early
 

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.079
European migrants in the late 19th early
20th century which was South America so

00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:41.089
20th century which was South America so
 

00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:43.450
20th century which was South America so
Argentina and Uruguay so then we see a

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:43.460
Argentina and Uruguay so then we see a
 

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.579
Argentina and Uruguay so then we see a
josa collapse and you can see the

00:38:45.579 --> 00:38:45.589
josa collapse and you can see the
 

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:47.650
josa collapse and you can see the
proportion of migrants in Argentina and

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:47.660
proportion of migrants in Argentina and
 

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.900
proportion of migrants in Argentina and
worldwide was much higher than the u.s.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:49.910
worldwide was much higher than the u.s.
 

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:52.359
worldwide was much higher than the u.s.
let's say in the in the first

00:38:52.359 --> 00:38:52.369
let's say in the in the first
 

00:38:52.369 --> 00:38:57.250
let's say in the in the first
globalization so overall yes there is

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:57.260
globalization so overall yes there is
 

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.710
globalization so overall yes there is
this increasing mobility of Labor but

00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720
this increasing mobility of Labor but
 

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.690
this increasing mobility of Labor but
mobility but the proportion of migrants

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:01.700
mobility but the proportion of migrants
 

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.290
mobility but the proportion of migrants
remained below well so they actually in

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:05.300
remained below well so they actually in
 

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.870
remained below well so they actually in
you estimated not in this way by by by

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880
you estimated not in this way by by by
 

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.849
you estimated not in this way by by by
looking at you know Pacific moment of

00:39:09.849 --> 00:39:09.859
looking at you know Pacific moment of
 

00:39:09.859 --> 00:39:11.950
looking at you know Pacific moment of
time but actually by looking at previous

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960
time but actually by looking at previous
 

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.800
time but actually by looking at previous
and the contribution of migration to

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:14.810
and the contribution of migration to
 

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:16.960
and the contribution of migration to
population growth you will find out

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:16.970
population growth you will find out
 

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:18.940
population growth you will find out
actually that migration was much more

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:18.950
actually that migration was much more
 

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:20.829
actually that migration was much more
important in the first globalization

00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839
important in the first globalization
 

00:39:20.839 --> 00:39:25.330
important in the first globalization
than it is it is today

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:25.340
 

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.840
now you know with this background in

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:28.850
now you know with this background in
 

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:33.310
now you know with this background in
mind let me try to reflect on on what

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:33.320
mind let me try to reflect on on what
 

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.570
mind let me try to reflect on on what
should be the you know the sort of you

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:37.580
should be the you know the sort of you
 

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.330
should be the you know the sort of you
know objectives of International

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:40.340
know objectives of International
 

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.010
know objectives of International
Cooperation some of the issues of

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:42.020
Cooperation some of the issues of
 

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:46.720
Cooperation some of the issues of
international cooperation so I define in

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:46.730
international cooperation so I define in
 

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:51.670
international cooperation so I define in
a you know in my work what I call the

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680
a you know in my work what I call the
 

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.590
a you know in my work what I call the
three basic objectives of international

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:53.600
three basic objectives of international
 

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.560
three basic objectives of international
cooperation which relate to different

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:56.570
cooperation which relate to different
 

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:00.040
cooperation which relate to different
aspects of the open Internet penance but

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:00.050
aspects of the open Internet penance but
 

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.040
aspects of the open Internet penance but
you know which is characteristic of the

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:03.050
you know which is characteristic of the
 

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:07.300
you know which is characteristic of the
global order but the first the first

they say environmental issues have
 

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.010
they say environmental issues have
become increasingly important as global

be one of the you know a issues of
global public goods now aside from the

global public goods now aside from the
 

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.580
global public goods now aside from the
issue of interdependence there are

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:12.590
issue of interdependence there are
 

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.040
issue of interdependence there are
however two other issues which I call

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:15.050
however two other issues which I call
 

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:17.770
however two other issues which I call
the issue of the quality of nations and

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:17.780
the issue of the quality of nations and
 

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.880
the issue of the quality of nations and
the issue of equality of citizens now

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:21.890
the issue of equality of citizens now
 

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:25.240
the issue of equality of citizens now
the issue of equality of nations you

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:25.250
the issue of equality of nations you
 

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:26.920
the issue of equality of nations you
know respond to them you know to what I

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:26.930
know respond to them you know to what I
 

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:31.240
know respond to them you know to what I
have presented today the fact that you

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:31.250
have presented today the fact that you
 

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:36.070
have presented today the fact that you
know nations are very you know our you

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:36.080
know nations are very you know our you
 

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.150
know nations are very you know our you
know star

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.160
know star
 

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.519
know star
that's our part of a hierarchical system

00:41:39.519 --> 00:41:39.529
that's our part of a hierarchical system
 

00:41:39.529 --> 00:41:41.380
that's our part of a hierarchical system
so they are really unequal the

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:41.390
so they are really unequal the
 

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.480
so they are really unequal the
opportunities that they face are very

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:43.490
opportunities that they face are very
 

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:46.480
opportunities that they face are very
unequal and and they are particularly

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:46.490
unequal and and they are particularly
 

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.099
unequal and and they are particularly
unequal according to the level of

00:41:48.099 --> 00:41:48.109
unequal according to the level of
 

00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:50.620
unequal according to the level of
development so low-income countries

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:50.630
development so low-income countries
 

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.049
development so low-income countries
generally have much more difficulties

00:41:53.049 --> 00:41:53.059
generally have much more difficulties
 

00:41:53.059 --> 00:41:55.749
generally have much more difficulties
than middle-income countries in relating

00:41:55.749 --> 00:41:55.759
than middle-income countries in relating
 

00:41:55.759 --> 00:41:57.640
than middle-income countries in relating
to the global economy and say

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:57.650
to the global economy and say
 

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.200
to the global economy and say
middle-income countries in turn have

00:41:59.200 --> 00:41:59.210
middle-income countries in turn have
 

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:01.299
middle-income countries in turn have
much more difficulties than the

00:42:01.299 --> 00:42:01.309
much more difficulties than the
 

00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:03.160
much more difficulties than the
high-income countries in related to the

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:03.170
high-income countries in related to the
 

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:07.420
high-income countries in related to the
global economy so this issues basically

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:07.430
global economy so this issues basically
 

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:11.440
global economy so this issues basically
relate to you know how to overcome the

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:11.450
relate to you know how to overcome the
 

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:13.509
relate to you know how to overcome the
asymmetry of the global order that I

00:42:13.509 --> 00:42:13.519
asymmetry of the global order that I
 

00:42:13.519 --> 00:42:16.630
asymmetry of the global order that I
mentioned before that is the macro the

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640
mentioned before that is the macro the
 

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.170
mentioned before that is the macro the
the technological and the inequalities

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:20.180
the technological and the inequalities
 

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.410
the technological and the inequalities
in the mobility of factors of production

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:22.420
in the mobility of factors of production
 

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:26.890
in the mobility of factors of production
and the third issue relates at the end

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:26.900
and the third issue relates at the end
 

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:30.789
and the third issue relates at the end
to how we transplant to the global order

00:42:30.789 --> 00:42:30.799
to how we transplant to the global order
 

00:42:30.799 --> 00:42:33.700
to how we transplant to the global order
what was the origin of the nation-state

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:33.710
what was the origin of the nation-state
 

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.579
what was the origin of the nation-state
or the modern nation-state which is the

00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:36.589
or the modern nation-state which is the

quality of citizens that is how we build
 

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:43.720
quality of citizens that is how we build
an international system of the set of

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:43.730
an international system of the set of
 

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:47.680
an international system of the set of
Rights which is they say the the best

the Equality of citizens is transplanted

00:43:02.559 --> 00:43:02.569
the Equality of citizens is transplanted
 

00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:05.470
the Equality of citizens is transplanted
to the world economy so in this regard

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480
to the world economy so in this regard
 

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.950
to the world economy so in this regard
we are concerned not only with citizens

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960
we are concerned not only with citizens
 

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.559
we are concerned not only with citizens
of developing countries but also even

00:43:11.559 --> 00:43:11.569
of developing countries but also even
 

00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:13.450
of developing countries but also even
with citizens of industrial countries

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:13.460
with citizens of industrial countries
 

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.910
with citizens of industrial countries
which may be unfairly treated by the

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920
which may be unfairly treated by the
 

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.150
which may be unfairly treated by the
global economic holder so how to manage

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.160
global economic holder so how to manage
 

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.759
global economic holder so how to manage
that you know they say the losers of

00:43:21.759 --> 00:43:21.769
that you know they say the losers of
 

00:43:21.769 --> 00:43:24.880
that you know they say the losers of
globalization as individuals or as

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:24.890

families which may be located any part

00:43:27.609 --> 00:43:27.619
families which may be located any part
 

00:43:27.619 --> 00:43:29.650
families which may be located any part
of the global economy I will probably

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:29.660
of the global economy I will probably
 

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:31.990
of the global economy I will probably
argue more frequently in developing

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000
argue more frequently in developing
 

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.049
argue more frequently in developing
countries but also in you know in

00:43:35.049 --> 00:43:35.059
countries but also in you know in
 

00:43:35.059 --> 00:43:39.069
countries but also in you know in
industrial towns now so we will see

00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.079
industrial towns now so we will see
 

00:43:39.079 --> 00:43:42.160
industrial towns now so we will see
several issues of the International

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:42.170
several issues of the International
 

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.799
several issues of the International
agenda that reflect to some extent

00:43:44.799 --> 00:43:44.809
agenda that reflect to some extent
 

00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:47.049
agenda that reflect to some extent
different parts of this of these

00:43:47.049 --> 00:43:47.059
different parts of this of these
 

00:43:47.059 --> 00:43:49.940
different parts of this of these
objectives so may combine you know

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:49.950
objectives so may combine you know
 

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.579
objectives so may combine you know
the first to order may relate to the

00:43:52.579 --> 00:43:52.589
the first to order may relate to the
 

00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:58.099
the first to order may relate to the
third as we will see now before I do

00:43:58.099 --> 00:43:58.109
third as we will see now before I do
 

00:43:58.109 --> 00:44:00.920
third as we will see now before I do
that however it is actually interesting

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:00.930
that however it is actually interesting
 

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:03.800
that however it is actually interesting
and going back to my my first you know

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:03.810
and going back to my my first you know
 

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:05.839
and going back to my my first you know
presentation about the the problems with

00:44:05.839 --> 00:44:05.849
presentation about the the problems with
 

00:44:05.849 --> 00:44:09.050
presentation about the the problems with
institutions that you know what is the

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.060
institutions that you know what is the
 

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:13.220
institutions that you know what is the
sort of governance structures that that

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:13.230
sort of governance structures that that
 

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:16.339
sort of governance structures that that
we should build and I would say you know

00:44:16.339 --> 00:44:16.349
we should build and I would say you know
 

00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:19.040
we should build and I would say you know
those governance structures have to

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:19.050
those governance structures have to
 

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:26.750
those governance structures have to
respond a to to this to the

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760
respond a to to this to the
 

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.569
respond a to to this to the
heterogeneity of the system and other

00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579
heterogeneity of the system and other
 

00:44:29.579 --> 00:44:31.940
heterogeneity of the system and other
there is a first a question of the

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:31.950
there is a first a question of the
 

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:33.680
there is a first a question of the
relation between the global and the

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:33.690
relation between the global and the
 

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:35.980
relation between the global and the
regional and sub-regional institutions

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:35.990
regional and sub-regional institutions
 

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:41.540
regional and sub-regional institutions
so my first point is that a system built

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:41.550
so my first point is that a system built
 

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:46.069
so my first point is that a system built
on a denser network of institutions is

00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079
on a denser network of institutions is
 

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:48.950
on a denser network of institutions is
peripheral to a system based on few

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960
peripheral to a system based on few
 

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.050
peripheral to a system based on few
institutions because of the

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.060
institutions because of the
 

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.720
institutions because of the
heterogeneity of the system so that's

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:53.730
heterogeneity of the system so that's
 

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.000
heterogeneity of the system so that's
why there is a row here and a

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:56.010
why there is a row here and a
 

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.500
why there is a row here and a
significant role for regional and

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:57.510
significant role for regional and
 

00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:01.430
significant role for regional and
sub-regional institutions and also for

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440
sub-regional institutions and also for
 

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:02.750
sub-regional institutions and also for
national you know for national

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760
national you know for national
 

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.870
national you know for national
institutions so it has to be a system

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880
institutions so it has to be a system
 

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.230
institutions so it has to be a system
that takes into account the different

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240
that takes into account the different
 

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.260
that takes into account the different
orders or and the heterogeneity of that

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:12.270
orders or and the heterogeneity of that
 

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:14.990
orders or and the heterogeneity of that
order and you know that denser system is

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000
order and you know that denser system is
 

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.200
order and you know that denser system is
likely to be better to manage the global

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:18.210
likely to be better to manage the global
 

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:19.819
likely to be better to manage the global
order that just having a few

00:45:19.819 --> 00:45:19.829
order that just having a few
 

00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:21.829
order that just having a few
international institutions so this is

00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839
international institutions so this is
 

00:45:21.839 --> 00:45:24.140
international institutions so this is
not a question in that regard or

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:24.150
not a question in that regard or
 

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:27.109
not a question in that regard or
building one big nation the same global

I mean based on nation-states there are

00:45:46.579 --> 00:45:46.589
I mean based on nation-states there are
 

00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:49.760
I mean based on nation-states there are
some very specific characteristics or

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:49.770
some very specific characteristics or
 

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:51.710

nation-states and in that regard there
 

00:45:54.599 --> 00:45:57.920
nation-states and in that regard there
are two particular questions or two

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:57.930
are two particular questions or two
 

00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:00.260

okay and I'll actually finish with that

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:44.470
okay and I'll actually finish with that
 

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:48.930
okay and I'll actually finish with that

these are you know different issues that

these are you know different issues that
 

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:56.000
these are you know different issues that
we see in the global world today

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.010
we see in the global world today
 

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:59.549
we see in the global world today
now we done in mind particularly you

00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559
now we done in mind particularly you
 

00:47:59.559 --> 00:48:01.980
now we done in mind particularly you

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:06.180
objectives of international cooperation
let me reflect on some of the areas of

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:06.190
let me reflect on some of the areas of
 

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:10.829
let me reflect on some of the areas of
international cooperation so let me

00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839
international cooperation so let me
 

00:48:10.839 --> 00:48:12.900
international cooperation so let me
start with you know macroeconomic and

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:12.910
start with you know macroeconomic and
 

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:15.569
start with you know macroeconomic and
finance I mean what what are we talking

00:48:15.569 --> 00:48:15.579
finance I mean what what are we talking
 

00:48:15.579 --> 00:48:17.490
finance I mean what what are we talking
about

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:17.500
about
 

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.080
about
well there are some issues that relate

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:19.090
well there are some issues that relate
 

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:20.700
well there are some issues that relate
to the global public with the provision

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:20.710
to the global public with the provision
 

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:23.040
to the global public with the provision
of global public goods and the second

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:23.050
of global public goods and the second
 

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:24.450
of global public goods and the second
set of issues that relate to their

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:24.460
set of issues that relate to their
 

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:27.540
set of issues that relate to their
symmetries - that you know macroeconomic

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:27.550
symmetries - that you know macroeconomic
 

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:29.130
symmetries - that you know macroeconomic
and financial asymmetry that we saw

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:29.140
and financial asymmetry that we saw
 

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.280
and financial asymmetry that we saw
before so in relation to the first

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:32.290
before so in relation to the first
 

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:36.990
before so in relation to the first
problem we need a you know a system that

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.000
problem we need a you know a system that
 

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.290
problem we need a you know a system that
you know provide some macroeconomic

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:40.300
you know provide some macroeconomic
 

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.770
you know provide some macroeconomic
coherence in the world economy we don't

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:43.780
coherence in the world economy we don't
 

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.800
coherence in the world economy we don't
have one and we're seeing that issue

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:46.810
have one and we're seeing that issue
 

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:50.010
have one and we're seeing that issue
today in the past this was always solved

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:50.020
today in the past this was always solved
 

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.870
today in the past this was always solved
through ad hoc arrangements among major

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:51.880
through ad hoc arrangements among major
 

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.420
through ad hoc arrangements among major
powers so there was a big crisis in the

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:54.430
powers so there was a big crisis in the
 

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:57.150
powers so there was a big crisis in the
1980s you know there was a what was the

00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.160
1980s you know there was a what was the
 

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.339
1980s you know there was a what was the
PASOK or you know among the major

00:48:59.339 --> 00:48:59.349
PASOK or you know among the major
 

00:48:59.349 --> 00:49:02.010

particular the issue of u.s. deficits
 

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.200
particular the issue of u.s. deficits
now we have seen today and there is the

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:07.210
now we have seen today and there is the
 

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:09.690
