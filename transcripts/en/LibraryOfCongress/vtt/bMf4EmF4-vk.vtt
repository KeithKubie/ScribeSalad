00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.190
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.130
&gt;&gt; Saundra Smith McBee:
It is my honor today

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.820
to introduce Mr. Paul Rudnick.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.700
Mr. Rudnick is an American
playwright, novelist,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.450
screenwriter and essayist.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.500 position:56%
His plays have been produced both on

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.020
and off Broadway and
around the world.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.230
Rudnick was born and
raised in Piscataway,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.510
New Jersey where his
mother Selma was a publicist

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.350
and his father Norman
was a physicist.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.440
Rudnick attended Yale College
before moving to New York City

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.080
where he wrote his book jacket
copy and worked as an assistant

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.560
to his friend, the costume
designer, William Ivey Long.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.720
Rudnick began writing for
magazines including Esquire,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.620
Vogue, Vanity Fair, and Spy.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.380
Rudnick's first play
was Poor Little Lambs,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.840
a comedy about a female
Yale student's attempt

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.100
to join the Whiffenpoufs, an
All-American male singing group.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.480
The play's cast included
the young then Kevin Bacon,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.400
Bronson Pinchot and Blanche Baker.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.780
Rudnick then wrote two novels,
Social Disease, A Satiric Tale

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.090
of New York's Nightlife in the
vein of Evelyn Waugh's Vile Bodies

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.900 position:56%
and I'll Take It which was a tribute
to Rudnick's mother and aunts

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.970
and their passionate
love of shopping.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.790
In the late 1980's Rudnick
moved into the top floor

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.500
of a Greenwich Village brownstone
which had once been the 1920's home

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.930
of the actor, John Barrymore.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.560
That inspired Rudnick's play I Hate
Hamlet about a young TV star who

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.050
and he's about to play Hamlet is
visited by the ghost of Barrymore.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.460
In 1993, Rudnick had a breakthrough
with his off-Broadway hit Jeffrey.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.260
Rudnick has won an Obie award,
an Outer Critics Circle award

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.700
and the John Gassner
Playwright award.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.050
Rudnick's later plays
included the Naked Eye,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.100
which depicted an extreme
photographer along the lines

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.590
of Robert Mapplethorpe.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.920
Rudnick has worked as an
accredited script doctor

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.000
on movies including the Addams
Family and The First Wives Club.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.250
In 2011, HarperCollins
published I Shudder,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.950
a collection of Rudnick's
autobiographical essays,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.130
some covering his work
on stage and screen.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.540
Since 1998, Rudnick has
been a frequent contributor

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.790
to the New Yorker, mostly of
over 50 short humor pieces.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.910
His work appears in the collections

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.380
of Fierce Pajamas and
Disquiet, Please.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.210
In May 2013, scholastic
published Gorgeous,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.710
Rudnick's first adult novel.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.000
Publishers Weekly in
a starred review said

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.980
that the book was hilarious,
profane, and profiled.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:40.100
And in January 2016, his
latest book scholastic publish,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.770 position:56%
It's all Your Fault, New York Times
says, caution do not read in public,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.260
will cause you to laugh
and maybe cry out loud.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.510
Everyone please help me welcome
to the stage Mr. Paul Rudnick.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:07.440
[ Applause ]

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.520
&gt;&gt; Paul Rudnick: Oh thank you
for that wonderful introduction,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.500
oops that wonderful introduction
and thank all of you so much

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.070
for being here and thank you.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.960
I was told that at these talks
the absolute worst sin was

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.970
to read anything from cards or
notes, so I'm not going to do that.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.720
So here goes.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.490
What I wanted to talk about today
was probably the most common

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.950
question that writers always get,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.990
which is where do you
get your ideas from.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.170
And I had immediately thought
of so many awful answers to that

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.550
like Walmart or you steal them.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.210
But what I found and I think this
happens to a lot of other writers

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.630
as well is if you're
yearning to write something

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.840
and the rent is due you'll often
try to do something like sit

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.710
down with your notebook open
and make lists and try to figure

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.900
out okay, what's a great
idea, what should I do next.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.130 position:56%
Usually those ideas vanish instantly
even if they feel sort of wonderful

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.270
and inspired at the moment, they
somehow just don't take hold.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.910
What I find is there has
to be something in my life

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.180
and in the larger world
that becomes so overwhelming

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.450
that it insists on
being written about.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.440 position:56%
It can be personal or it can be
larger than that, but it's something

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.960
where you find yourself helplessly
drawn to it and you just have

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.590
to start writing whether
you like it or not.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.890
So I wanted to share kind
of three brief moments

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.310
of that sort of inspiration.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.610
The first actually
which was mentioned

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.290
in the introduction was years ago
when I first moved to New York

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.560
and this will show you
how long ago this was

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.860
because it involves real estate.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.710
This was when if you wanted an
apartment you could actually look

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.260 position:56%
at the real estate listings in the
New York Times or the Village Voice,

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.880
wander over to a building,
take a look, wait a day

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.040
or so before deciding
to pay the very low rent

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.620
and there you have an apartment.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.700
This has been unheard of for
about the past 30 years now.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.670
But when I first arrived, I saw a
listing I think it was in the Times

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.870
that intrigued me because
it said medieval duplex.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.250
And I thought okay, what's
medieval about it, you know,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.580
is it the plumbing,
is it the landlord.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.920
So immediately I went
and it was the top floor

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.460
of a brownstone right
off Washington Square.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.720
So it was the romantic ideal

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.090
of every young artist
moving to New York.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.990
It was a garret basically,
but a very nice one

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:39.460
with the full top floor and it had
been the nest of John Barrymore,

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.320
the famous actor who lived there
actually beginning at around 1901,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.910
when he was playing
Hamlet on Broadway.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.500
And he remodeled the
whole place as something

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.410
which he called the
alchemist's corner.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.340
So it really had the most
marvelous enchanted feeling.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.940
There were stained-glass windows
and an enormous skylight and up

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.530
on the roof there was
a tiny cottage.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.020
Which from my research I found

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.380 position:56%
out Barrymore had planted the entire
roof and added a reflecting pool,

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.270
all of which was not up to
code, so it eventually collapsed

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.570
into the apartment below.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.610
But that had been repaired
by the time I got there.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.770
So I looked around with
a real estate agent

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:23.740
and I was immediately drawn to
it, but I wasn't quite sure.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.960
So that I went home and I
called my very first agent,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.300
this wonderful woman named Helen
Merrill, who even then was already

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.400
in her 70's and very German.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.110
She moved to Germany
before the war as a refugee,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.320
but still had the thickest accent.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.830
And I said Helen, I'm
looking at this apartment

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.250
with this Barrymore
pedigree and she said,

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:50.370
oh Rudnick perhaps you
have found my hairpins.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.630
Because it turned out that
Helen had had an affair

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.700
with Barrymore's son-in-law
on the premises.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.420
So at that point it sort of
became impossible not to write

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.340
about the apartment
once I had moved in.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.020
And I began writing a novel
that was called I Hate Hamlet

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.770
because somehow it felt

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.450
like a literary Greenwich
Village thing to do.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.430
But eventually because it was
about actors and it was all set

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:21.770
in a single room it became a
play, I just let it happen.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.490
And it eventually ended
up on Broadway in a sort

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.320
of wildly adventurous
and traumatic run

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.830
because what happened
was we cast this insane,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:38.840 position:56%
oops oh this insane wildly alcoholic
English actor named Nicol Williamson

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.320
was playing the ghost
of John Barrymore.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.570
And he was the kind of guy who
the first time I met him was

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.960
at a restaurant where the table was
filled with two empty wine bottles,

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.140
a can of beer, a few cocktails
and because he was so known

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.080
as a drunkard when someone asked,

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.210
are you still drinking he
said no, not in months.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.450
And there was that moment
where you thought do we point

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.520
to the glassware, you know, and I
just thought I hope for the best.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.170
And Nicol on his good
nights could be inspired

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.680
and the play just soared.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.260 position:56%
And on his lesser nights the first
act ended with a big climactic dual,

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.180
a sword fight that took
place all over the stage.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.540
And Nicol's costar was the very
young actor named Evan Handler,

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.780
who you may know from Sex
in the City and all sorts

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.370
of television things and Evan was
wonderful, wonderful, very talented

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.460
and wonderfully patient as well.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.720
But Nicol did not want any costar,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.140
let alone one who was
much younger than he was.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.450
Nicol had called me one
morning at 3 a.m. to tell me

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.860
that he felt he could
play both leading roles.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.770
It's one of those questions

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.230
where you don't know do I
ask how you would do that,

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.660
how you would have a
sword fight with yourself.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.550
But Nicol took it into his head
and then one night during the run,

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.780
during the sword fight he
took after Evan for real

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.150
and stabbed him and drew blood.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.670
And I was not there that evening,
but the next day I came downstairs

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:12.530
and the full front page of the
New York Post said, I hit Hamlet,

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.150
star stabs actor in the butt,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:20.550
which if you know the paper it's
sort of New York Post poetry.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.660
So with that kind of experience
from that moment of walking

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.150
into an apartment I never
knew where this was headed,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.820
but I knew I had to write about it.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.100
So that was my first moment of okay
inspiration appears from anywhere.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.130
The next thing I'd like to
get into was more serious

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.760
and affected far more people,
which was by that point we were

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.910
into late 80's, early 90's and I
was a gay man living in New York.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.440
And so many people, an overwhelming
amount of people I knew were sick

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.400
or dying of AIDS and it
was a terrifying time.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.040
This was before there
were any treatments.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.620
This was while the government was
completely ignoring the illness.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.210
This was where even medical
personnel were unwilling sometimes

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.270
to treat or touch people
who were infected.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:12.760
And because I'm a comic writer
at that time I couldn't imagine

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.190
that I had any place in
writing about the plague years

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.600
and about the people I knew,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.370
it just felt like the
most awful contradiction.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.590
But then one day, actually it was
also mentioned in my introduction,

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.350
a dear friend of mine,
William Ivey Long,

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.970
who is a true Southern gentleman

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.310
and a brilliant Tony
award-winning costume designer.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.290
He and I were going to the hospital
to visit another good friend

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.770
of ours named Eric who was
very, very ill and would die.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:43.360
And Eric was emaciated,
was hallucinating,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.250
and also his room was quarantined.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:51.100
It was still the most --
everything about it only got worse.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.380
But Eric what was so strange
is Eric had many friends,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.550
so he must have been
visited quite a bit.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.990
But he was refusing to
kind of live up to his role

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:04.810
as a noble sick person
and why should he.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.930
But Eric was doing things like
demanding exactly the right shade

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.820
of towels in the right
amount of Egyptian cotton.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.120
And if you brought him a
beverage it had to be, you know,

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.740
grape-ade not lime-ade,
not lemonade.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.850
If you brought him the fashion
magazines that he loved they had

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.950 position:56%
to be French Vogue and Italian Vogue
because American Vogue was trashy.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.720
So he became so insistent
on everything

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.090
and nothing was ever good enough
and of course, because he was

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.770
in such a terrible state we wanted
to please him and do anything

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.210
to ease what he was going through.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:40.570 position:56%
But that morning, that visit William
and I went out to a park bench

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.820
in front of the hospital
afterwards after a couple

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.750
of hours of being be harangued.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.780
And William turned
to me and he said,

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.800
you know I love Eric very dearly
and I will do anything for him,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.440
but my God I want to slap him.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.820
And we both looked at each other
and the whole situation was

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.760
so unbearably awful and tragic

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.030
that all we could do
was burst out laughing.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.600
And I realized that so many of
the people I knew were getting

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.290
through all of this with the
only weapon in their possession,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.750
which was a sense of humor.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.830
That people were marching
and people were helping

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.230
and people were joining Act Up
and every possible organization,

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.370
but these were some of
the most stylish and funny

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.090
and extraordinary people
I've ever met.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.890
Men and women, gay and straight,
it just was something to behold.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.500
And I thought oh okay that's
what I want to write about.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.890
And that moment and all of the
stuff that seems impossible and all

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:38.970
of the stuff that somehow becomes
hilarious in the face of death.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.520
So I wrote this play
called Jeffrey and it was

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.820
about a guy -- it was funny again.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.890
Again, it was a character that
began in another play I was working

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.260
on about another sort
of story entirely.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.380
But there was this one guy who
was giving up sex who said well

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:56.160
that was the only possible way to
deal with the AIDS crisis was kind

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.820
of to run from it and to
run from romance and to run

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.870
from any kind of personal contact.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.720
And that seemed like
a strong storyline,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.780
so that became the center.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.160
And once I'd written the play
Helen my agent again submitted

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.340
to every theater in New York,
all of whom turned it down.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.820
Even the people who liked it
would write me letters saying,

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.260
oh well I enjoyed this, our
audience would never stand for it.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:23.310 position:56%
It just became known - they said how
can you have a comedy about AIDS.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.450
And Helen finally went
to a tiny theater

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.200
on 23rd Street called the WPA

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.760
and she sat outside the
artistic director's office

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.030
and would not leave
till he read the play.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.620
And then wouldn't leave
until he agreed to do it.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.590
So the man named Kyle
Renick who was wonderful

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.070
and I was just so grateful.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.670
So it was set for like
a three-week run.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.430
Every actor New York was
warned away from this play.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.310
They were told it would
ruin their careers.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.260
They were told it was far too gay.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:53.080
And it was -- the worst thing
you can do to actors is try

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.300
to scare them about
completely ridiculous concerns.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.620
So the people we ended up with I
just was so deeply grateful for.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.960
They were so talented and that
they were willing to show up.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.950 position:56%
So we did the play and I remember,
you know, a terrible dress rehearsal

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.900
and then the first preview was on
New Year's Eve for some odd reason.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.810 position:56%
And it went really well and my mom
was there, I was sitting behind her.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:22.870
And when my mom would watch things
her shoulders would be kind of up

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.150
around her ears until the audience
started laughing and responding

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.080
and then they gradually settled,
which meant things were okay.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.400
But I was flooded with of what I
always think of as the highest form

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.710
of happiness which is relief.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.290
And the play opened it was very
well received and became --

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.440
people just flocked to it
because there was a sense of,

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.310
it was almost like a town meeting
where these were matters that were

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.670
on everyone's mind and no
one was sure how to respond

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.150
and no one was sure if
it was okay to laugh.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:56.180
And the play kind of made that
understandable at the very least.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.650
And it moved on, it ran off
Broadway for about a year.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:04.730
And I was just so -- it the first
thing I'd ever written where I felt

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:07.480
that my voice was completely
heard and that I was proud

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.910
of the work that I'd done.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.700
And I was then told by many
people oh this play will be done

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.980
in New York, maybe LA or San
Francisco, but nowhere else.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.040
And then it was produced
all around the world.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.200
And so again, it just felt
like this, you know, gift.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.570 position:56%
Although what was odd was I remember

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.200
in some other countries they would
change the title and I remember

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.620
for some reason in Paris
they changed the title

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.390
to Sex, Drugs and Sequins.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:40.960
Actually I like productions of my
play in languages I don't speak

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.850
because I don't have
to worry about them.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.890
I just assume they're going well.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:49.960
But so it was -- again, it was
such a lesson in okay write

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.840
about something that scares
you, write about the thing

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:57.350
that is most critical to
your life aside from writing.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.030
Write about something that
might actually matter to people.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.940 position:56%
And the fact that that the audiences
were responding just meant the world

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:10.120
to me and it just opened
everything up for me.

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.960
Then the third thing I'd like to
talk about is my first venture

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.260
into YA, which was with the help

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.050
of my Scholastic, my
wonderful publisher.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:26.440 position:56%
Because what I wanted to write about
was beauty in every possible sense.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.460
Why it doesn't matter
in the slightest,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.450
why it can affect everyone's
lives helplessly.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.650
And I'd been offered a
number of projects set

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.770
in fashion worlds and
that kind of thing.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.410
I was also one of the writers on
the movie of the Devil Wears Prada.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.810
There are often on films there
are a batch of writers and woman,

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.430
Aline Brosh McKinna, who was
credited did a magnificent job.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.660
And she I think borrowed certain
elements from everybody's draft,

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.070
but it ended up being
very much her work.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.950
But it was a wonderful
introduction to that world.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.460
And I had also written at
Vogue and had met Anna Wintour

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.330
who is an extraordinary person.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:05.260
And I thought okay, what's the
way into this world, you know,

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.960
what is it just froth, how do
you make it somehow larger.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.100 position:56%
And then my mom became very ill, she
was diagnosed with ovarian cancer

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.470
and went through the whole
process of chemotherapy,

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:18.910
doctor visits, you name it.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.100
Although I think something that
pleased my mother enormously,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.910
my partner, John, is
here who's a physician

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:27.450 position:56%
and my cousin Carl is also a doctor.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.490
So my mom would go to
the doctor accompanied

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.990
by two handsome young doctors.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.530
So this was kind of
Jewish mom nirvana for her.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.720
And it was sort of
wonderful to watch.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.060
But I was going through
this with her

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.430
and there were two things
that really struck me.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:50.080 position:56%
One, she was going through a lot of
clippings and mementos from her past

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.830
and she found I think
during the war,

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.150
during the second world war she
actually had written an advice

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:59.300
column and there was a photo of
a very young version of my mom

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.130
at the top of each column.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:06.150
And she looked at it and she said,
you know back then I thought I was

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:12.250
so ugly and she said and I looked
great and then she laughed.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.130
And it was both horribly
sad and joyous

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.410
because my mom had an
incredible sense of humor.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.560
And what happened after that was
during the chemo she lost all

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.860
her hair.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.730
And probably right before she was
about to lose it all when she knew

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.370
that was upon her I found

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:33.190
through William Ivey Long a
theatrical hairstylist who worked

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.160
on Phantom of the Opera,
Hairspray, a lot of shows.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.120
He came to her apartment
and shaved her head,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.110
which gave it a certain flair.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:45.870
And she said that somehow
allowed her

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.360
to accept what was
going on a bit more.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.340
And then after the chemo
her hair grew back.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.630
And she prefaced this by saying all
the women in my mother's family,

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.760
a lot of them were
librarians and teachers

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.770
and they were extraordinary women
and sort of very strict minded

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.660
and they all had hair all the way
down their backs which they kept

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.040
in buns, tightly tied at
the nape of their necks.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.620
That was the proper
way to do things.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.540
They thought anything fussy or
any visits to the beauty parlor,

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.660
let alone any highlighting
was considered vain

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:21.380 position:56%
and prideful and ultimately gentile.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.200
So they stayed far away.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.810
So my mom throughout her entire
life had had only one very severe

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.640
hairstyle, which she
looked beautiful

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.130
but it was still that was the rule.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.550
So after her hair grew back
it was still very short,

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.760
but it was also wonderfully
curly and brilliantly silver.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.890
And when she looked at it she
became so joyful, she just laughed

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:47.570 position:56%
and she had just never allowed
herself that sort of personal moment

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.770
to enjoy how she looked and it came

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.850
out of the worst possible
circumstances.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:57.450
So that sense of the power
of beauty and the burden

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.330
of beauty was what
inspired my book Gorgeous.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.630
And it was the first --

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.880
well actually it wasn't the first
time I had ever sort of wandered

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.280
into fantasy because certainly
I Hate Hamlet had a ghost.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.350 position:56%
But what I thought of was and it
was something that also took a while

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.800
to land in terms of was it a
play, was it a film about a girl

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.680
from a very small town
in Appalachia,

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.520
grew up in a trailer park whose mom
was morbidly obese and who dies.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.670
And sort of tells her
daughter right before she dies

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:29.190 position:56%
that something wonderful is going
to happen and when it does she needs

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:34.020
to say yes and she needs to accept
the magic that's going to appear.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.580
And the girl then receives all
sorts of mysterious messages.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:42.280
She's flown to New York where she
meets a very powerful and not all

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.700
that pleasant, but clearly very
gifted Manhattan designer named Tom

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.890
Kelly who makes her an offer.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:54.860
He says, I will make you three
dresses, one red, one white

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.040
and one black and if you agree

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.460
to wear them you will become
the most beautiful woman

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.960
who has ever lived.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.850
And at first she thinks
this is of course nonsense.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:07.090
Then she decides no, her mother's
deathbed wish was say yes,

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.400
so she does and he does
and that's what happens

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.180
in the rest of the book.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.430
So it's this very wild
and comic adventure,

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:18.870
but it's with very
serious underpinnings

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:23.480 position:56%
about what does it mean for this
girl who's very smart and very savvy

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.040 position:56%
and she sees how beauty works in the
world and she sees how money works

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.360
and celebrity and everything
that's very alluring

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.160
and can seem very important
and can be quite destructive.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.610
But because I thought no,
I want this girl to win.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:44.200
She figures out how to kind of
lasso the power of all that.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.890
And she -- well if you read the
book you'll -- I'll just one thing,

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.580
she does end up as
the Queen of England.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:56.140
So again, it was an idea that sort
of had circled for a long time

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.740
and then finally landed
with the help of all

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.580
of these very powerful
events in my life.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.090
So I think if I was ever
going to give advice

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:07.910 position:56%
to writers, which I should never do.

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.730
But I think sometimes people you
could tie yourself up in knots

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.470
and think oh my God I'm not a
writer, I don't know what to do

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.310
with myself, everything I do sours.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:22.450 position:56%
And I think no, it will find you, at
least that's been the case with me.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:27.630
That that's been the joy of my
life and it can drive you mad

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.260
because you sometimes think oh my
God I'll never have another idea

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:35.490
again, nothing will ever
descend and then suddenly.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:40.520
It's interesting my most current
projects after the recent massacre

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.910
in Orlando a new play just
sort of poured out of me

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.740
and completely unexpected.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.130
Again, it was one of those things

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:53.620
where I thought oh my God this
is the worst kind of tragedy and

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.190
yet I want to find something
celebratory in the world's response

00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:02.720 position:56%
to that and something both tormented
and ultimately healing in some way.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.230
So that is now underway.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:09.260
And beyond that I of course,
got a call a few days ago

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.370
from the New Yorker saying, Paul
we need something about Brad

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.270
and Angelina by Thursday.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:19.150
And that's the kind
of challenge I like.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.320
Also, the trouble is
when you get a request

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.080
like that you think this is
what we call a developing story.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.530 position:56%
So I thought, you know, okay and
also it's so odd when I write things

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:31.830
like that for the New Yorker

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.540
that are often very contemporary
and you're dealing with.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.650
And you suddenly start to
think wait, I don't want to,

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.600
you know want to attack
Brad and Angelina.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.400
I thought the world is
doing plenty of that.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.190
On the other hand, it's
playing out on this, you know,

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:48.030
on every possible form of
social media and it's delicious.

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:53.800
And you also think just why do
movie stars ever marry each other,

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.470
you know, just haven't
they read the tabloids

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.840
about the person they're marrying.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.220
You know, can they
ever be surprised.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.650
And you sort of admire the
noble belief in oh yeah,

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.610
this time it's going to work out.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.420
And on the other hand you think
okay, you're ignoring everything.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.720
But so it was juicy stuff.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.910
So if you read the New Yorker
next week you'll see what emerged

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.070
because I tried to find an angle
on it because you think okay,

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:22.940
you don't want to sort of
straight-ahead almost never works

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:29.210
because then it's not funny, it's
not personal, it's not fresh.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.550
So I finally kind of
with that time pressure.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:36.190 position:56%
It's also why I love writing for
the New Yorker is because with plays

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:42.800
and books and films you could take
years towards the final product

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.750
and sometimes it can
still evaporate.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.970
But with the New Yorker you write
it and there you get to see it

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.040
and the world gets to comment
on it for better or for worse.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.560
And that's a real excitement and
I grew up reading the New Yorker,

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:58.520
so I feel, you know, wonderfully
grateful to be included there.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.210
So anyway, that's how for me

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.660
at least that's how
ideas sort of approach.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:09.830
So now if anyone has any questions
I'd be happy to answer them.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.460
Anybody? Go ahead, come
on pretend I'm Lois Lowry.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.090
Pretend I'm that rich.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.690
And that one from -- yes.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:26.700
&gt;&gt; How would you like create your
humor because like I try to write

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.370
like humorous stuff and it comes
out like of the ha-ha-ha moments.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:34.210
&gt;&gt; Paul Rudnick: Yeah the question,
that's a very good question

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.510
about how do you write humor.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.980
I find I come from a family
that really valued humor,

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.030
so you know at the dinner
table, all that stuff.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:44.980
It was just an, unending
sense of comedy.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.630
And that there was
always also a sense

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.440
that humor was a great
balance wheel if you started

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.190
to take yourself too seriously
or feel a little too smug

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:58.070
that somebody could sort
of land a choice punchline

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.810
and that would take care of you.

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:03.730
But I think the best
way is maybe don't try

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:07.020
to deliberately write
comedy, write about the story

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.490
and the characters you're
interested in and if they're going

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:10.910
to be funny that will happen.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.070
That in a way the comedy
sometimes will take care

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.860
of itself so that you can.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.210
It's especially hard I think when
you're writing books and things

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.120
to wonder, will people
laugh at this.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.860
You can lose yourself
is any of this funny,

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.260
is this awful or is this hilarious.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.240
So I think it's one
of the few things

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.390
where you don't have
to worry it to death.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.260
You know, think sometimes
something I'll write

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.790
that I would imagine was very
serious, then when it's read aloud

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.590
or somebody or it becomes
a play it's hilarious

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:42.760
and sometimes I'm not even
sure why they're laughing,

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.590
but I'm very happy that they do.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:49.110
So yeah, I would say don't
beat yourself up about comedy,

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:52.310
you know, let it find you.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:53.610
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.910
&gt;&gt; Paul Rudnick: You're
welcome, thank you.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.940
&gt;&gt; Mr. Rudnick I only know
your work from the New Yorker,

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.810
although I'm eager to
read it in other forms.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.640
And I just wanted to say

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.460
that I loved the piece you did
recently called My Demands.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:16.250
And hope that Leah Ellen
Altschuler and the whole --

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.700
everybody, the whole
campus at the Shower

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:23.330
of Blessings Junior Bible
College will come to life

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.140
in some form whether it's in
more pieces in the New Yorker,

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.130
a book or a movie or a play.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.870
But I wanted to say that
what I loved about it was

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.590
that you took a character
who I at least

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:40.740
and probably many other New Yorker
readers might have dismissed as,

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.740
you know, according to
our preconceived notions

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.040
of what she would be like

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.930
and you showed real
compassion and love for her.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.040
And so that's why I want
to know more about her.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.180
&gt;&gt; Paul Rudnick: Oh well
thank you, I'm so glad.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.760
This was a piece, it's funny
actually my most recent YA book

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.780
from Scholastic It's All Your Fault
deals with a similar character,

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.900
a girl who was homeschooled
and brought up in sort

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.150
of a deeply religious and
deeply devout atmosphere.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:07.370
And I thought, you know, it's easy
to use those people as targets,

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.470
especially if you're
from the East Coast.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:11.190
And I thought no that wears itself

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.140
out in about, you know,
two sentences.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.500
So I thought -- because
actually the people I know

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:20.450
who have been homeschooled are
some of the most sweet natured,

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:24.200
genuinely innocent people because
they haven't been socialized

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.870 position:56%
in the American public school system
where you get bullied and beaten

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.120
up all the time and you
kind of learn to, you know,

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.750
develop a very sometimes
too thick skin.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.150
So that these -- even
as adults a lot

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.980
of homeschooled people have
a genuine sort of optimism

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.800
about them that I really admire.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.980
And in that case with that piece
it was also about what's going

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.890 position:56%
on all the time on today's campuses,
trigger warnings and safe spaces

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.860
and that whole sense of students.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:55.030
Because my heart go -- I think the
students are often absolutely right

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.750 position:56%
or crazily wrong, but I think no,
no, no that's what that college life

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.060
and that age is all about.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.640
I think you are allowed to
say absurd and strident things

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.960
and find your way in the world.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.340
At the same time your heart goes

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.200
out to the professors
who have to deal with.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.090
There was that one student at Yale
who kept howling at a professor

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:15.840
that she didn't want
to hear him talk,

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.790
she just wanted to
talk about her pain.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.360
And then someone of
course, mentioned you come

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.470
from a very nice neighborhood, you
know, I don't know where quite --

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.110 position:56%
was the pain involving dry-cleaning.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:32.080
But it was -- so I thought again,
that's such rich comic turf

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.120
because it's, you know, it's
like the current election.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.020
You know, when you've got so
many opinionated people howling

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.760
at each other they're
usually very funny.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.060
Yes.

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.000
&gt;&gt; My question is out of everything
you've ever written what is the

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.540
finished product that was the
most different from the idea

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.890
that initially inspired it
or your first conception

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.530
of what it would look like?

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.480
&gt;&gt; Paul Rudnick: That --
it's an interesting question.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.570
Everything I tried -- one
thing I've learned sort

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.260
of in a hard way manner
is to let it surprise me.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:07.960
So things often start
quite differently.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.170
It's funny there was -- well
one thing that happened once

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.690
when I was called in to overhaul
the First Wives Club the movie.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.010 position:56%
And when I was -- the script I was
given there had been many drafts was

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:21.140
very serious believe it or
not given the final movie.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.900
And I remember one of the features
of it if you've seen the film,

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.050
Diane Keaton has a daughter
in it who is a lesbian.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:31.860
And in the original draft that
character was mentally disabled

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:36.870
and she was the word back then used
was retarded and they said Paul,

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:39.750
could you please make this
character into a lesbian.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.550
And I kind of by of course
being an idiot I first said,

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:43.860
well why not both.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:48.220
But it was just the
most absurd leap,

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.460 position:56%
but on the other hand they had these
wonderful stars and I went to work

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.720
and the movie was about
to start shooting.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.190
And I thought okay, how do
you turn this tragic story

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.360
of these women who'd been
treated badly by their husbands

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.050
and abandoned into this
sort of powerful statement

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:08.910
about these women's friendship
and revenge and Manhattan lives.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.080
So it -- and when, it's a
tribute to the film's producer,

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.500
a guy named Scott Rudin who's
a genius because it was --

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.700
the whole shoot was insane,
nobody was getting along,

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.880
the director was having
all sorts of problems.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.560
And I thought this thing is doomed.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.360 position:56%
And I told Scott, I said I can't see
this once it opens it's just going

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.970
to be too god-awful.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.680
And he said he'd been working on
it personally then for a long,

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.390
long time and he said okay, you
have to come see it at least once,

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:36.900
you have to come to the opening.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.430
And I said oh all right
and it's delightful.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.880 position:56%
I mean thanks to the director and to
Scott and to editing and everything

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.400
that can be done in movies and it's
kind of only in movies it worked.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.560
It's still an unholy mess, but
it's a delightful unholy mess.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.350
So it was -- again, it's the kind
of thing where it's very hard

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:59.000
to duplicate that process to say
okay, how do I take something

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.870
in big trouble and save it,
but it sure worked that time.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:07.620
So it was -- so since then I go
into things thinking you just hope

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.450
for the best, see what will work.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:14.920
But again, nothing -- if
you try too hard to stick

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.910
to your original outline or
that image you have in your head

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:21.490
of the finished work you're
doomed, you'll kill yourself.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:25.910
And because often what you discover
along the way is so much better.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:30.250
So yeah, so it probably answers --
everything ends up very different.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:34.310
I remember Jeffrey was originally
called Keep it in Your Pants

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:38.150
and then when I called it
Jeffrey one of the producers,

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.690
this wonderful man who's a
heterosexual he told me he said

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:43.180
Paul, I like that title,
I like calling it Jeffrey

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.840
because I know it's a gay
play, but I have no idea why.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.020
I thought you are absolutely right.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.060
So again, it's kind
of thing where --

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.640
well actually I'll
tell you very quick

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.690
that I also wrote Sister Act
originally for Bette Midler

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:00.780
who took many years
and finally said no

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.320
because she kept saying
I can't play a nun.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.120 position:56%
And even though everyone around her
kept saying you're not playing a nun

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.030
you're playing a showgirl
disguised as one.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.240 position:56%
She kept saying no and then it ended
up being made with Whoopi Goldberg

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.520
and it became a huge
success, so go figure.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.430
And Bette years later God bless her
came to me and said, why did I turn

00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:19.240
that down that was terrible.

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.970
And I thought thank you Bette.

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:23.500 position:56%
But so yeah, so it's just a question

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.080
of just staying open
to everything I think.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.380
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.680
&gt;&gt; Paul Rudnick: You're welcome.

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.450
Okay, I've been told
that our time is up.

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:32.690
But again, thank you all
so much for being here.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:34.990
This has been a delight.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:39.080
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.520
of Congress, visit us at LOC.gov.
