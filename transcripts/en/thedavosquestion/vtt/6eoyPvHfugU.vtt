&gt;&gt;Hi YouTube my name is Dan Shapiro. I direct
the Harvard International Negotiation Initiative.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.800
And it's a wonderful experience being here
at Davos, and it's a wonderful experience

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.440
to have the opportunity to talk with you today,
and hear your feedback as well. The work I

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.460
do is as a negotiation of conflict resolution
and what is the one issue that I see as most

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.471
important in 2008. Well there's plenty of
them. The one I'm particularly focused on

00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:28.960
is how to deal the emotional and identity
based dimension of conflict. Looking around

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.380
the world right now as our world is shrinking.
It's getting flatter, and more globalized.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.750
People are interacting more and more and that
makes it more and more challenging to get

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.289
work effectively done. And ultimately what
that means is that emotions are become a potential

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.320
trouble point, but at the same time it can
be one of your greatest assets. In 2008 what

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.749
can we be most focused on? I would suggest
we focus on the human dimension of conflict

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:58.140
and of human interaction. So for example,
as you are interacting with other people in

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.920
this upcoming year. In what ways do you try
to appreciate their perspective even if you

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.640
strongly disagree with their perspectives.
Simply by appreciating, the research is quite

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.659
clear on this. You are able to enlist helpful
emotions, and you and the other party will

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.820
are going to be able get along much more effectively,
whether you are a head of state trying to

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.210
negotiate a big peace treaty, or whether you
are like myself trying to negotiate with my

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.270
wife where to go on Friday night for dinner.
So good luck with all of your negotiations,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.100
and pay particular attention to the emotional
dimension. And if you're interested in more

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.680
information my colleague Roger Fisher and
I recently wrote a new book on that subject

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.280
called Beyond Reason, using emotions as you
negotiate. And I also direct an initiative.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.299
You can check out our initiative at our website
just Google: Havard International Negotiation

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.180
Initiative. You'll find us. I look forward
to your feedback and to thinking through your

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.159
ideas and talking to you over YouTube. Thank
so much.
