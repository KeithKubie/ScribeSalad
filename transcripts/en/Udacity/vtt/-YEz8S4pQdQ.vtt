00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.600
In this lesson, we define
the dual of a linear program and

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.460
showed how this dual program
can be seen as the problem

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.090
of making a certain kind of bound on
the primal program as tight as possible.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.240
Then we saw how maximum flow and

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.270
maximum bipartite matching can be
expressed as linear programs, and

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.779
how the minimum ST cut and
vertex cover problems were their duals.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.230
If this idea of duality appeals to you,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.960
I suggest looking at the primal dual
algorithm for solving the near programs.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.070
Although this is not
a practical strategy for

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.540
solving general linear programs,
it has served as the inspiration for

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.860
many algorithms for
specific types of problems.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.740
In fact, the Ford-Fulkerson
algorithm which we studied and

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.350
the famous Hungarian algorithm for

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.650
finding minimum cost matchings,
can be seen as primal dual algorithms.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.730
Those are good places to start.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.080
More broadly, the type of duality that
we've studied has profound implications

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.360
for game theory, convex geometry,
and convex optimization.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.560
Keep this lesson in mind when
you encounter those topics.
