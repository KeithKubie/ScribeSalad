00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.330
- I've got a motorcycle sign
over here.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.790
Clint leads me over to an
original Indian Motocycle sign.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.420
- Is it in pieces?
- Yeah.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.540
But it's all cut into pieces.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.830
So why would
someone cut this up?

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.250
A guy used it for--

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.250
I bought a roll top
desk, and he used it

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.580
for the bottoms of
the drawers so mice

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.880
wouldn't get into the drawers.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.170
[sighs]

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.290
This is absolutely mint.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.380
Who would cut it up?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.420
So he cut this the
size of the drawer?

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.290
Yeah.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.670
No way.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.210
And someone lined the drawers
of the desk with this sign.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.540
Because then it
was worth nothing.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.880
It was metal.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.540
It was something to line a
drawer with or patch a roof

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.040
with or fill a hole in a wall.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.170
When would this
sign have been?

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.960
This would be late
teens, early '20s.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.040
OK.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.830
They were still calling
them "motocycles."

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.170
There's no motorcycle.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.290
So this is the Hendee days,
Hedstrom and Hendee, Indian

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.250
in its heyday as far
as I'm concerned.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.330
It's hard enough to find
anything antique motorcycle.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.830
So when you add in
how old this sign

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.670
is, how far back this
goes, it's unbelievable

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.880
that it still exists.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.710
And it's all pretty much
there except one corner.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.830
So let's see.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.080
And then here's
the little town

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.330
that his dealership was in.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.210
All right.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.420
So it is missing
a piece, though.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.540
Well, yeah.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.380
But you've got this
you can use, and you've

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.960
got this you can use.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.830
This sign is pristine.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.170
The colors, everything
is brilliant about it--

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.210
other than the fact
that someone has chopped

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.580
it into a bunch of pieces.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.210
God.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.500
So when you bought
this desk, was it--

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.580
I didn't know it was in there.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.580
Oh, I was going to ask you.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.500
Nobody knew it was in there?
- No.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.540
And everybody who
sees it wants it.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.460
I know.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.040
I'm one of those guys, I guess.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.120
Have you ever priced it?

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.290
No.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.120
My biggest fear now is
that he's not going to put

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.960
a number on this sign at all.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.790
He's not even going to
give me the crazy number.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.620
He's just going to say,
I don't want to sell it.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.000
I really don't
want to sell it,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.540
but I can tell you're
passionate about the sign.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.750
Love the motorcycles.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.960
Love the motorcycles.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.080
And I-- I'd want the
selling price to be $1,000.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.460
This sign has so
much going for it

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.170
as far as subject matter.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.500
I'm looking beyond the chop job,
and I'm looking at the history

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.830
of American motorcycles and
how that makes me feel inside

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.710
and how connected I am to it.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.210
Just the fact that the
colors are so vibrant--

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.750
it might not have
ever been hung.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.120
The person that cut this
sign up, in a weird way,

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.880
saved the sign.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.580
And that is why the
colors are so incredible.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.170
The sign never hung outside
because it was cut up

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.040
and lined a drawer.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.420
So you didn't know you were
finding it for me back then.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.460
No, I didn't.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.500
Because I'm going
to do $1,000 on it.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.250
- OK, thanks.
- All right, man.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.830
Thank you very much.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.880
It means a lot to me.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.290
Finally, Clint
comes up with an "I

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.710
don't want to sell it"
price that I will pay--

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.210
$1,000 for the sign.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.960
That's paying up, but the
fact is that it exists.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.710
Once it comes together
on a piece of wood,

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.960
it's going to look brilliant.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.290
Hey, look at that.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.750
Clint is in the position
where a lot of people in this

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.880
business want to be-- relaxed,
retired, surrounded by all

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.170
of the things that they love.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.120
A guy like me, I dream about
being a guy like Clint.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.580
This is going up front.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.880
He's not a seller.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.210
He's a collector.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.830
So for Clint to be able to
let go of some of these items

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.880
today, I think that
was really big.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.040
- Appreciate you, man.
- It's going to be too tough.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.170
Really do.
Love the building.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.170
Fun day.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.380
- You got a great eye.
- Thanks, Clint.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.670
Appreciate it ever so much.
Thank you.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.000
Appreciate it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.540
I sold some things today
that I thought I'd never sell,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.830
but I did.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.500
So I might have seller's
remorse, but I'll get over it.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.830
So I'd have them
back sometimes, yeah.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.710
I might slap their hand a
little more than I did, but--

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.290
- Sweet picking, Clint.
- All right.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.080
Thanks.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.420
[howls]

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.580
Here's the deal.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.460
We all have our ways
of decompressing.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.830
I know bubble
bath sounds funny.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.790
I've never taken a bath.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.920
What kind of smells
are you talking?

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.380
I mean, anything.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.880
It could be lavender,
it could be wildflowers,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.420
it could be the Little Pony.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.750
They don't have any man ones?

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.710
They don't have no motor
oil or gasoline-smelling ones.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.040
I can tell you
right now I'm not

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.420
buying anything
called a Little Pony

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.290
and sticking it in
a bathtub with me.
