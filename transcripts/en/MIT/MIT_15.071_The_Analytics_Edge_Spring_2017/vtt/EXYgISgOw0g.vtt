00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.110
In this video, we'll discuss
how radiation therapy can

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.309
be framed as an
optimization problem.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.610
The data's collected in the
treatment planning process,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.980
which starts from a CT scan,
like the one you see here,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.690
on the right.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.190
Using a CT scan, a
radiation oncologist

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.790
contours, or draws
outlines around the tumor

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.260
and various critical structures.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.310
In this image, the
oncologist would

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.780
contour structures like
the parotid glands,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.430
the largest of the saliva
glands, and the brain.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.360
Then, each structure
is discretized

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.910
into voxels, or volume
elements, which are typically

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.770
four millimeters in dimension.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.630
The second image here shows
a closer view of the brain.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.900
You can see the small
squares, or voxels.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.710
Here, they're two-dimensional,
but in reality they

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.110
would be three-dimensional.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.310
Now, we can compute how
much dose each beamlet,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.600
or piece of the beam,
delivers to each voxel.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.200
We'll start with
a small example.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.700
Suppose we have nine
voxels and six beamlets.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.110
Our voxels can be
categorized into three types:

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.210
the tumor voxels, which
are colored pink here;

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.289
the spinal cord voxel,
colored dark green;

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.890
and other healthy tissue
voxels, colored light green.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.600
So we have four tumor voxels,
one spinal cord voxel,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.009
and four other
healthy tissue voxels.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.630
We have two beams that are
each split into three beamlets.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.610
Beam 1 is composed of
beamlets 1, 2, and 3,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.800
and comes in from the right.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.090
Beam 2 is composed of
beamlets 4, 5, and 6,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.400
and comes in from the top.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.169
Our objective is to minimize the
total dose to healthy tissue,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:14.060
both to the spinal cord and
to the other healthy tissue.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.410
We have two types
of constraints.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.810
The first is that the
dose to the tumor voxels

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.660
must be at least
7 Gray, which is

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.390
the unit of measure
for radiation.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.030
Our second constraint is that
the dose to the spinal cord

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.420
voxel can't be more
than 5 Gray, since we

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.079
want to be careful to
protect the spinal cord.

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.520
We know the dose
that each beamlet

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.180
gives to each voxel
at unit intensity.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.260
This table shows the dose
that each beamlet in Beam 1

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.870
gives to the voxels.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.350
Remember that this
is at unit intensity.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.850
If we double the
intensity of the beamlet,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.340
we double the doses.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.480
The dose to each
voxel can depend

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.290
on how far the beamlet has to
travel, or the type of tissue

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.660
that the beamlet has
to travel through.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.440
Similarly, we know the dose
that each beamlet in Beam 2

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.460
gives to each voxel,
again at unit intensity.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.890
The dose depends on the
direction of the beam

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.090
and what it travels through.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.050
Putting these
tables together, we

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.210
can write out our
optimization problem.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.210
Our decision variables are the
intensities of each beamlet.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.760
We'll call them x_1, the
intensity for beamlet 1, x_2,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.829
the intensity for
beamlet 2, x_3,

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.880
the intensity for
beamlet 3, etc.,

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.290
all the way up through x_6.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.550
As we mentioned
before, our objective

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.860
is to minimize the total dose
to the healthy tissue, including

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.600
the spinal cord.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.660
So we want to minimize the total
dose beamlet 1 gives to healthy

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:07.840
tissue, which is (1 + 2)*x_1,
plus the total dose beamlet 2

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.880
gives to healthy tissue,
which is (2 + 2.5)*x_2,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.529
plus the total dose beamlet
3 gives to healthy tissue,

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.420
which is 2.5*x_3.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.360
Now for beamlets 4, 5, and 6,
beamlet 4 just gives one dose

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.330
to healthy tissue, beamlet
5, 2*x_5, and then beamlet 6,

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.330
we have (1 + 2 + 1)*x_6.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.650
Now for our constraints.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.159
First, we need to make sure
that each voxel of the tumor

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.960
gets a dose of at least 7.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.560
Let's start with the first
tumor voxel in the top row.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:57.750
So 2*x_1 + x_5 needs to be
greater than or equal to 7.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.330
Now the tumor voxel
in the second row,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.480
we have x_2 + 2*x_4, also
greater than or equal to 7.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.570
Now for the two tumor
voxels in the bottom row,

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.610
we have 1.5*x_3 + x_4,
greater than or equal to 7.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.680
And 1.5*x_3 + x_5, greater
than or equal to 7.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.900
Then for the spinal cord, we
need to make sure that 2*x_2 +

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.460
2*x_5 is less than
or equal to 5.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.260
And lastly, we just
need to make sure

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.300
that all of our decision
variables are non-negative.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.150
So they should all be
greater than or equal to 0.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.040
Now that we've set up
our optimization problem,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.960
we'll solve it in LibreOffice
in the next video.
