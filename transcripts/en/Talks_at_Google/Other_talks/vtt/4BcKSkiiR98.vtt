00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
today, Earth Day,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.270
2016, we're very lucky
to have Louie Psihoyos,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.170
the director of the Academy
Award winning film "The Cove"

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.930
to talk about his latest
film "Racing Extinction."

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.730
It's an honor to
have you here, Louie.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.390
How are you?

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.830
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: Glad to be here.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.160
FEMALE SPEAKER: How
are you doing today?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.100
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: Good.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.900
Good.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.730
I just from Tribeca
Film Festival

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.160
just a few minutes ago.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.870
I got something called
a Disruptor Award, which

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.049
back when I was a kid,
you'd call it an award

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.810
for being a troublemaker.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.480
But it was as exciting.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.680
There was a few
thousand people there.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.960
And the people there were
there to celebrate people

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.540
that are trying to change
the world with film,

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.196
and you know, the guy
from the Charity Water--

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:46.570
a lot of different
organizations.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.872
I just built like-- all we did
was a little bit of building.

00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:52.330
FEMALE SPEAKER:
That's pretty good.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.530
You're actually from New
York originally, right?

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.340
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: I lived here.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.548
I am from Chelsea originally.

00:00:56.548 --> 00:00:59.540
I used to live up at 23rd
between 10th and 11th Avenue

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.870
back when this was a
really bad neighborhood.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.330
The selling point when I got
my place was from the landlord.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.079
He said, from this window,
you can see a crime an hour.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:11.370
I thought that was really cool.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.203
That was back when I
was your age in my 20s.

00:01:13.203 --> 00:01:16.670
And I thought that was
pretty exciting then.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.850
I was working at "National
Geographic" at that point.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.640
And then I started an
organization called the Oceanic

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.720
Preservation Society.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.135
And I moved recently a little
bit closer to the ocean.

00:01:28.135 --> 00:01:30.135
FEMALE SPEAKER: So you're
not in Denver anymore?

00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:31.801
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: I
used to be in Boulder.

00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.230
I was in Boulder
for about 25 years.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.900
I was running the
Oceanic Preservation

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.920
Society from Boulder.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.890
And we used to say we're
a conveniently located

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.660
between two oceans.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.860
But now within the
last six months,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.790
I moved out to Northern
California based out of there.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
what brought you

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.780
from doing photography
for "National

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.164
Geographic" to filmmaking?

00:01:52.164 --> 00:01:53.580
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: A
friend of mine--

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.430
this will be probably be
interesting to the tech people

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.929
here.

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.100
But a good friend of mine
that was my dive buddy

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.520
was Jim Clark, the guy
that started Netscape,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.410
Silicon Graphics, WebMD.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.080
Netscape was the first
commercial internet browser.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.070
I photographed him for
"Fortune Magazine."

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.140
I used to be a photographer
in a former life.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.350
And I photographed
him when he built

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.190
this big boat called Hyperion
that had the world's tallest

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.690
mast.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.664
And we were hanging
out in Amsterdam.

00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:19.830
His boat was being launched.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.767
And we found out we
both liked to dive.

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:23.350
And he said, Louie,
would you teach me

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.400
how to be a good photographer?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.140
And I said, Jim, I'll teach
you how to be a great one

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.080
if you teach me how
to be a billionaire.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.750
And so he would pick
me up on his plane.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.250
And we would go around
the world and go

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.740
to some of the
most amazing places

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.890
in the world-- places I could
never have done on my own.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.290
And I taught him photography.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.320
We just explored.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.410
And this was the third time
we were in the Galapagos.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.080
And there was fisherman
illegally long

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.931
lining in a marine
sanctuary all around us and.

00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:52.180
And Jim said, somebody should
do something about this.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.465
And I said, how about you and I?

00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:55.940
And he said, what do you mean?

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.275
I said, we'll use your
money, and my eye,

00:02:58.275 --> 00:02:59.750
and we'll make films.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.800
And I thought that
was-- to me, I always

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.850
wanted to be a filmmaker.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.940
I'd worked for
"National Geographic"

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:04.940
as a still photographer.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.540
But it wasn't my
area of expertise.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.542
And so he was going to fund
me for about a million dollars

00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:12.250
a year, which is a
hefty amount of money.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.600
It was a good amount of money
for a documentary filmmaker.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.930
But I've never made a
film before in my life.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.220
And so now, we were on vacation
together down in the Caribbean.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.770
And my kid is
playing on the beach

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.300
with another kid whose father
is a pretty well-known film

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.580
director.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.620
And Steven Spielberg
comes over to the boat

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.650
and says, I said to
him, Mr. Spielberg,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.250
do you have any advice for
a first-time filmmaker?

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.592
He said, yeah never make a movie
involving any boats or animals.

00:03:40.592 --> 00:03:42.300
Now, the first film
I did was "The Cove,"

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.690
which became the most winning
documentary in history.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.785
It won over 70 top film
awards from Sundance

00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:50.040
to the Academy Award.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.770
But that was our first film.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.965
But the idea was-- did
people here see "The Cove"?

00:03:55.965 --> 00:03:56.909
A couple?

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.200
Yeah, so about half the people.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.616
Another half
probably heard of it,

00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:01.940
or they're scared to
see it, because it

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.620
has the stigma of being
a really violent film.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.610
And it has one
section in it that is

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.440
pretty-- it is hard to watch.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.250
It was hard for me to make.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.230
We had planted hidden
cameras in this place

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.730
where they killed more dolphins
than any place in the world.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.029
This is where they supply--
this place in Taiji, Japan--

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.480
they kill several
thousand dolphins a year.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.300
And the ones that are
looking for young females

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.070
that they put into service in
the captive dolphin industry.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.900
Most of them swim with dolphin
parks in Asia and Europe

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.450
and come out of this
one little cove.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.810
And we saw how do they
kill these animals?

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.910
What do they do with them?

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.250
We planted these hidden cameras.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.230
And it' sort of became
like a James Bond movie.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.360
The whole film
took a turn when we

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.880
decide to sneak into this cove.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.150
And it became really exciting.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.691
It wasn't just a
documentary anymore.

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:55.982
It was like-- I think
"Rolling Stone" called

00:04:55.982 --> 00:04:57.940
the movie a cross between
the "Bourne Identity"

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.400
and "Flipper."

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.236
And it was exciting.

00:05:01.236 --> 00:05:03.360
We had some amazing footage
that came out of there.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.330
But here's the really
cool thing about the film

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.940
aside from all
the awards that we

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.980
got from doing that one film is
that they were killing 23,000

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.590
dolphins and porpoises
a year in Japan

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.714
when we started that movie.

00:05:13.714 --> 00:05:15.820
Now, they are killing
less than 6,000

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.830
mostly because of that
movie, because in the movie,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.810
we explain that
how they're killed.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.090
And we also explain that
these animals are toxic.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.090
A dolphin today,
because of the ocean

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.929
is so polluted by what we
put into it-- for those

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:33.470
who haven't seen the movie or
don't remember the movie if you

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.690
saw it-- there are
six levels of the food

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.240
chain in the ocean from
plankton up to dolphins.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.650
And at every tropic level,
each of those trophic levels

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.810
is an order of magnitude
more pollution.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.590
So a pound of swordfish or
a pound of dolphin flesh

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.940
has a million times
more pollutants in it

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.700
than a pound of
plankton, because it all

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.240
gets magnified up
the food chain,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.080
to the point where
a dolphin washing up

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.170
on the coast of New
York state right now

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:07.680
has about 6,000 parts
of PCBs in them.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.300
That would be eligible
for a Superfund site--

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.510
just that one dolphin.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.590
And now people in
Japan are eating this.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.327
So just by giving them the
information that the government

00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:20.910
wasn't giving them, because you
go to the Minister of Health's

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.960
website in Japan, they
had advisories for women

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.840
to be eating dolphin meat,
even thought it's toxic.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.940
One piece of toxic
dolphin meat could

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.630
be enough to maybe
make your fetus abort.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.540
And so now those numbers
dropped precipitously.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.090
And I'll just steamroll
right into the next idea.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.490
So I'm at Sundance with
"The Cove" as our premier.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.044
And my own background
is that when

00:06:47.044 --> 00:06:48.460
I worked at National
Geographic, I

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.930
did stories on the Mesozoic--
the mid-life of the planet--

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.320
this is the age of dinosaurs--
and dug up dinosaurs

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.320
all around the world.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.970
I did a book on dinosaurs
called "Hunting Dinosaurs."

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.969
And I used basically 50
of the top paleontologist

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:03.010
in the world as tour guides
through the Mesozoic.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.790
So I know a bit
about this subject.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.480
I spent 10 years
working in that world.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.974
But at Sundance, I
brought a book with me--

00:07:10.974 --> 00:07:13.390
it was called "Terra" by Michael
Novacek, the head provost

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.750
American Museum of Natural
History at 81st and Columbus.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.250
And in the book, he's talking
about how we're losing species

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.920
now faster than
mankind's ability

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.700
to record these animals are
even on the planet with us.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.627
And I thought, this is horrific.

00:07:25.627 --> 00:07:27.460
And I didn't want--
that's not the headspace

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:27.990
I wanted to be in.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.330
I wanted to show them
the premier of my film.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.413
So I picked the only other
book I brought with me.

00:07:31.413 --> 00:07:34.910
But this was by Charles Veron,
former chief marine scientist

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:35.950
for Australia.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.560
In the book he is talking about
we're losing the Great Barrier

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.420
Reef now and all other
reefs on the planet because

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.200
of acidification.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.980
That's exactly what goes on
before a mass extinction event.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.110
That's what we're going
through right now.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.270
And I thought here I am running
this organization called

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.780
the Oceanic
Preservation Society.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.380
I consider myself a lay
expert in this field.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.290
And I had no idea that we were
losing the oceans that quick.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.970
I had no idea we were in the
middle of what scientists

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.400
are calling the
Anthropocene-- the age of man.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.360
This is an epoch
where we are leaving

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.930
a mark on the fossil record
of the future to the point

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.654
that future generations can see
that there's a line we arrived.

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:10.070
They're probably
not going to be--

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.670
they'll be looking at the
computers in the garbage dump.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.320
And they're going to see--
it will be like an iridium

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.740
layer-- you know,
when the comet hit

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.329
the dinosaurs 65
million years ago,

00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:21.870
it wiped out all
the large dinosaurs.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.340
It was left with
an iridium layer.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.536
There's not dinosaurs
above that iridium layer.

00:08:28.536 --> 00:08:29.910
But there's a
dinosaurs below it.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.549
So we know that there
was a catastrophic event.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.570
When future
generations look back

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.960
at our plume of
the iridium layer,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.210
they're going to
see our garbage.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.380
And I think that if we don't
do a great job at trying

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.494
to mitigate this
problem, we're not

00:08:45.494 --> 00:08:47.660
going to looking to say how
great our computers are,

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.790
how great our technology
is, how wonderful it

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.390
is that we can communicate
at the speed of light

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.139
across the planet.

00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:57.210
They're going to say that
this generation presided

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.600
over the biggest
apocalypse on the planet

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.050
since the dinosaurs were
wiped out by a comet

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.840
65 million years ago.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.570
So it just shocked
me at Sundance

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.690
to realize that we were in
the middle of this epoch

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.020
that I was oblivious
to, because when

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.914
you're digging dinosaurs
around the planet,

00:09:13.914 --> 00:09:16.330
you're looking around at these
graveyards like in the Gobi

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.130
Desert with Michael Novacek.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.200
And you almost trip
over dinosaurs.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.700
You think, what happened here?

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.990
What went on?

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.560
And it's sandstorms and
all this cataclysmic stuff.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.000
In the iridium layer, it's
pretty easy to spot it.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.910
But to think that
we're going to an event

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.770
like that right now, because
this is comfortable-- we're all

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:35.869
having lunch.

00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:36.910
It's air conditioned air.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.080
We can communicate
on our phones,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.420
and at the speed of light,
thoughts that we might have.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.990
But it to the natural world,
to the rest of the planet,

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.559
we're just one species.

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:50.350
We don't even know by
an order of magnitude

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.976
how many animals
we're sharing it with.

00:09:51.976 --> 00:09:53.600
But we know we're
losing faster than we

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.890
can record that they're here.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.610
Some people say 8.5
million, 10 million.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.110
We've only identified about a
million and a half species out

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.550
of the whole catalog of
maybe 8 million, 30 million,

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.390
100 million species.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.220
We don't even know.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.390
So I look at things
because of hanging around

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.000
with paleontologist, I look at
things a little bit different.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.510
They have an appreciation
of what's called deep time

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.510
where the guys go
and dig up dinosaurs.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.020
But they're not looking
at-- they're not

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.349
thinking about-- they might
be thinking about lunch.

00:10:19.349 --> 00:10:21.140
But they're also thinking
about the animals

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.056
that they are digging.

00:10:22.056 --> 00:10:24.986
How do they fit into this
whole history of life?

00:10:24.986 --> 00:10:26.860
And now, as a photographer
and as a filmmaker

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.234
I'm trying to
think of how do you

00:10:28.234 --> 00:10:33.000
make a film about perhaps
the most cataclysmic event

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.800
in the world that
nobody knows about,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.400
but give them a sense of
hope after they see the film.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.970
There's something
that we can do.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:44.700
I don't want to just make a
film like a NOVA film, which

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.752
are really well produced,
but don't give you

00:10:47.752 --> 00:10:49.710
tangible ideas of what
you can do to change it,

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.240
because this is a planetary
disaster on the scale that

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.610
is unprecedented.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.120
You can't be saying that
the house is burning down.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.120
You have to say, what can you do
to get buckets of water on it?

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.660
So that was "Racing Extinction."

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:10.150
But the film-- when you do
it normal Hollywood film,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:14.310
they look at you, the audiences,
$10 and a box of popcorn.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.220
You're just butts in seats.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:20.410
And I don't look at documentary
filmmaking like that.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.860
I look at you as minds in
seats and more importantly,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.640
minds and hearts in
seats, because the science

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.130
shows that people don't
change behavior on what

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.530
they learn-- what they think.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.420
You have to change
their heart first.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:38.140
You can talk about 30,000
species dying every day.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.670
And it's just a calculation.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.360
That's a number.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.109
It's a statistic.

00:11:42.109 --> 00:11:43.900
But early in the film,
"Racing Extinction,"

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:48.227
we show the scene--
and actually, you

00:11:48.227 --> 00:11:50.060
might want to direct
this a little bit more.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.850
You can stop me
anytime you want.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.910
But at the beginning of this
film, I find a buoy on a beach.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.540
It was down in the
Dominican Republic.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:03.640
And this fisherman had brought--
said you guys are from America.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.840
Can you give me $500 as
a reward for this buoy?

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.280
And I said, let me see
what this buoy looks like.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.316
And it was a big
thing and not too

00:12:14.316 --> 00:12:15.690
easy to carry back
up to America.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.010
But it was actually owned by
a friend of mine, Chris Clark

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.759
from the Cornell
bioacoustical laboratory.

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:24.250
He runs the biggest repository
of animal sounds on the planet

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.370
And after I returned
this buoy, he

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.389
tells me, Louie, just about
everything on the planet's

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.930
been singing.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:30.860
We just haven't been listening.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.170
We're losing these voices.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.260
He plays for me the
voice of an o'o.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.960
This is a bird from Kauai--
the small island of Kauai

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.380
in the Hawaiian Islands.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.040
And he tells me that
these birds mate for life.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.020
And a dueting pair
where he'll sing.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.510
Then she answers with a song.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.750
And it's a beautiful duet.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.830
But he's only playing me
the male side of the duet.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.077
And there's a gap where
the female should be.

00:13:01.077 --> 00:13:02.160
And he says, you know why?

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.200
He says, that's the
last male of the species

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.420
singing for a female
that will never come.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.347
That breaks my heart.

00:13:08.347 --> 00:13:09.930
And it should break
everybody's heart,

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.390
because you can identify.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.080
It's no longer just one of the
30,000 species, some number.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.580
It's like you can identify
with that one animal.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.380
It's like the martian in
the film that came out.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.670
There's a whole film based on
one guy's trying to survive.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.040
But you can imagine where
there's no hope for this bird.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.020
Michael Novacek was
saying to me that after I

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.950
came back and
interviewed him, he said,

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.230
he was doing a dissertation.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.580
There was five grad students
doing their dissertations.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.120
And three of them were
doing dissertations

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.690
on the birds of Hawaii.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.880
I think five of the
birds went extinct

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.380
in the three-year
period that they

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.940
were working on the papers.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.400
That's how fast things
are disappearing.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:56.450
So to me, it's really crucial
to make a movie, to get it out

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.600
there at light speed
so people can start

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.810
getting their heart changed,
because the solutions,

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.430
which we can talk about later,
are really fairly simple.

00:14:07.934 --> 00:14:10.470
There's five major
drivers of extinction

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.440
is habitat destruction,
pollution, invasive species,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.060
over-consumption-- just
that four-- I can't

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.260
remember the fifth one.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.420
We try to address
them all in the movie.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:26.420
But the idea is that the
biggest problem with extinction

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.080
is habitat destruction.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.240
And that's because we're
tearing down rain forests.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.240
We're tearing down
natural habitat

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.390
to grow food for animals
that we're going to eat.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.230
And you guys are engineers.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.284
You are thought leaders.

00:14:40.284 --> 00:14:41.200
Now, think about this.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.820
If you had a pile of
grain on the table,

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.905
and you could either
eat that yourself

00:14:46.905 --> 00:14:48.530
to get your protein
and your nutrition,

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.090
or you can give six times
that amount to an animal

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.020
that you're trying to eat
so you can get it's flesh,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.780
it's a really bad
exchange of energy.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.130
But that's what we're
doing all over the planet.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:06.100
There's a really dangerous
myth that we need

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.640
meat for human consumption.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.690
We think, oh, to be
a man to be strong

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.907
you have to eat that way.

00:15:11.907 --> 00:15:12.990
You have to eat an animal.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.030
Well, in fact, the next
movie I'm working on

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.630
is called "Game Change."

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.770
It's being executive produced
by James and Suzy Cameron

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.260
from "Avatar."

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.500
And one of the
heroes in our movie

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.370
is a guy that won the-- this
is a documentary by the way.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.279
So he was an ultimate
fighting champion.

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:32.070
And he got injured.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.517
And he thought, well, what
can I do for nutrition?

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:35.350
What's the best way?

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.680
What can I eat to heal myself.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.740
And he found very little
information out there

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.850
and that most
doctors do 14 years

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.570
of learning to be a
doctor, but not have

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.270
a single hour in your
curriculum of nutrition.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.530
But he found out that
the gladiators, which

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.490
were the first ultimate
fighting champions,

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.880
were actually vegans.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.550
They didn't eat meat.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.620
These two professors
from Austria,

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.635
who we just interviewed
last month, went in.

00:16:02.635 --> 00:16:04.260
And they looked at
the strontium levels

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.400
in the teeth and the bones.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.450
And they could determine
that, in fact, they

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.454
were not meat eaters.

00:16:09.454 --> 00:16:10.370
They were vegetarians.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.100
They were vegans.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.932
In fact, they were
called the barleymen.

00:16:12.932 --> 00:16:14.640
When they go back into
the documentation,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.710
they found that was
one of the concoctions

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.200
that they ate for protein.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.360
It's a very recent
myth that you have

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.220
to eat animals for
human consumption.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.740
We've just been sold a bill
of goods about all this.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.950
If you look at your teeth,
if you have cats or dogs,

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.010
go back and look
at their dentition.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.240
They're carnivores.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.770
But the back molars--
there's no back molars--

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.630
but they have very pointy,
sharp teeth with serrations

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.490
that are used for gulping meat.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.170
And it goes into a very
short digestive track.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:45.280
But we have incisors
here that are

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.490
used to crunch through an
avocado or a piece of fruit.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:50.780
And these molars
are used to crush

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.040
beans, legumes, vegetables.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.030
We are omnivores.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.860
But our gut tract
and our teeth is

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.264
all about being a vegetarian.

00:17:00.264 --> 00:17:01.680
Sort of fast
forwarding into that,

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.846
but we want to talk obviously
about extinction more.

00:17:03.846 --> 00:17:09.359
So the idea is how do you
scale up these issues?

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:12.609
Look what we did with "The
Cove" with 23,000 dolphins down

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:13.670
to 6,000.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.859
And I think, OK, mass
extinction event.

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:19.160
How do you get that film out
there and get people to see it.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.400
So I knew it was about scale.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.579
So we had the film at
Sundance this last year.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.849
And we licensed it to
the Discovery Channel.

00:17:28.849 --> 00:17:31.140
There's a reason we did it,
because they were paying us

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.970
a lot of money
for a documentary.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.150
I was only-- still only
$0.30 on the dollar,

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.191
because you don't make a
lot of money when you do

00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:38.230
documentaries.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.230
But they promised us
a global audience.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.620
And they put it out in 220
countries and territories

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.070
on a single day.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.820
And 36 million people
saw it the first weekend.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.040
It's showing, again, I think
either tonight or tomorrow,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.560
"Racing Extinction"
But 36 million

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.510
is a really good launch
for f documentary.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:18:00.410
But what you need to do
though is get it up to scale.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.510
It doesn't matter if 36
million people see it.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:08.530
What you need is
10% or up to 16.5%

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.830
of the population to
see it before-- that's

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.510
the tipping point-- what Malcolm
Gladwell talks in his book

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.010
about.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.814
But the science shows you
might need is a little as 10%

00:18:16.814 --> 00:18:19.230
of the people that have an
unwavering belief in the truth.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.990
And then the rest of the
population falls like dominoes.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:29.520
And in "Racing Extinction," we
had premiered at the Tribeca

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.450
Film Festival-- I think it
was like the year before last

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:34.080
with this film.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.095
And it was a rough cut-- the
Tribeca Film Festival where

00:18:37.095 --> 00:18:41.686
I just got back from 20 minutes
ago, is going on right now.

00:18:41.686 --> 00:18:43.060
But we did a rough
cut screening.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.875
And in that screening,
what we do is

00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:46.750
we are trying to alert
the world that there's

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.400
a mass extinction going on.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.380
And Ban Ki-moon, who's the
Secretary General of the United

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.540
Nations, allowed us the day
before the big climate march

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.080
in New York, allowed us to
use the building as these

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.770
for these projections to give
endangered species a voice.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.530
We took the 39-story
Secretariat Building--

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.900
used that for a big canvas and
then used the General Assembly

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.750
Building.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.790
It was five IMAX
screens together.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.600
We tiled about 16, 30,000-lumen
projectors together to do this

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.300
huge projection event.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.380
But I'd always wanted-- That
was the same right before we

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.830
got here that I usually stay
at the Maritime Hotel right

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:23.580
across the street.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.520
And Eric Goode,
who runs the hotel,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.490
saves endangered species,
loves the work we do,

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:28.970
and he always gives me
the penthouse suite,

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.020
which overlooks the
Empire State Building.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.620
And I thought I want to light
up the Empire State Building

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.830
with endangered species.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.630
And we had a scene in there that
was Tony Malcolm, who owns it,

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.890
is a good friend of mine.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.520
And he said, well, Louie, if
you can get permission to do it,

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.920
I'll let you use the building.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.400
And I've been trying
for four years

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.390
to light up the building
since the last two years

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.380
of the Bloomberg administration.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:59.470
And I was at an event
right before the COP21.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.410
And there was 50
heads of organizations

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.710
like the Sierra Club,
Greenpeace, myself,

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.190
in the room over at Norman
and Lyn Lear's house.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.660
Norman Lear is the most
successful producer

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.350
ever for television.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:15.430
And the first film I did, "The
Cove," was sold at their house.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.640
We couldn't sell it at Sundance
six years ago when we came out.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.900
But in that room were two
people-- the head of Lionsgate

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:27.270
and Jeff Skoll from--
what's the company?

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.990
What does he do?

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.490
PayPal?

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.340
Jeff Skoll.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:30.930
Help me out.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.240
You guys have to know who he is.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.120
Anyway, he was
Participant Media.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.710
Anyway, Lionsgate
bought the film.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.370
Jeff Skoll that runs
Participant Media

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.040
does outreach campaigns
for films like ours.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.540
He said, if you buy the film,
I'll do the outreach campaign.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.234
And so in that room, it was
a very powerful room to be.

00:20:47.234 --> 00:20:48.400
That made my life go around.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.920
So five years later,
now I'm sitting

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.330
in this room with 50 of the
heads of these organizations

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.870
and five the people down
below Ban Ki-moon working

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.100
on the environment before COP21.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.329
And Lyn says to
me, Louie, can you

00:21:00.329 --> 00:21:02.370
talk about your movie,
"Racing Extinction," which

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.430
was over at that point.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.321
We had the ending
with the UN in it.

00:21:07.321 --> 00:21:09.570
And I said, well, I don't
want to talk about the movie

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.986
so much, but what
I've been trying

00:21:10.986 --> 00:21:15.440
to do to really end the movie
is to light up the Empire State

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:15.940
Building.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.024
Does anybody in this room
know Bill de Blasio--

00:21:19.024 --> 00:21:19.940
the mayor of New York?

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.880
And Norman Lear, who is
leaning up against the wall,

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.870
says, I know Bill.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.670
And he flies to New
York the next day.

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.290
It was on a Saturday
at this house.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.250
And the next Wednesday,
I get an e-mail

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.510
from Bill de Blasio
saying, cool,

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.020
how do we make this happen?

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.740
And so right there, we
got the wheels in place

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.560
to light up the
Empire State Building.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.014
Now, the problem
was our distributor

00:21:41.014 --> 00:21:42.305
was like, you know what, Louie?

00:21:42.305 --> 00:21:43.800
The movie is good
enough the way it is.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.030
You don't need to touch it.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:45.890
It's great.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.430
It was a wonderful,
global ending to the film.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.660
And he said, it's August.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.886
You want to do this?

00:21:50.886 --> 00:21:52.510
Everybody that's
important in New York,

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.910
in August, they're
going to be gone.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:54.860
They are going to
be at the Hamptons.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.790
They are going to
be over in Europe.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.700
And on a Saturday night, none
of the media's going to show up.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:04.287
Nobody can afford to have
crews working overtime

00:22:04.287 --> 00:22:05.120
on a Saturday night.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.660
It will be a nonevent.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.460
We did it anyway.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.910
And we closed down
traffic on 5th Avenue.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.532
Taxis were stopping
in the middle

00:22:14.532 --> 00:22:16.990
of the street with their fares,
and getting out, and taking

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.670
their cellphone pictures.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.450
There was tens of thousands,
if not hundreds of thousands

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.030
of people on the street and
on the rooftops shooting this.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.570
And what we didn't count on,
we didn't even think about,

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.860
is the viral nature of everybody
with a cell phone putting it

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.050
on with their 1,000
friends on Instagram,

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.170
or Twitter, or Facebook.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:36.080
We became the top trending
story on Facebook and Twitter

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.510
for four days running.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:41.910
We had 939 million media
impressions by Thursday.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:47.890
And it blew up in this viral
way that nobody ever expected.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.970
And then I thought, well, it
can't get any bigger than that.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.220
We really hit out of the park.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.130
And then the Pope calls.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.070
And the Pope wanted
us to-- right before.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.380
He said, all of this attention
is going to be on Paris.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.130
But we need to
keep the attention

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.300
on what's going on
for the environment

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.550
to get the leaders that
are there to pay attention.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.880
And so he let us
use the Vatican.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:15.140
This is St. Peter's Cathedral
as the backdrop for this--

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.000
do we have clips we can show?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.630
Do we have anything cued up?

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
we do have the UN.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.150
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: The UN.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.200
OK, well, do you
want to look at that?

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.380
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.350

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.490
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:11.690
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: But go
see "Racing Extinction."

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.220
You can get it on
iTunes, Amazon,

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.241
or you can order
it from Discovery.

00:24:15.241 --> 00:24:17.740
I wish I had known it was going
to be this small of a group.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.656
I could have just brought
them in my backpack.

00:24:19.656 --> 00:24:23.400
You probably don't even know
what a DVD is anymore, do you?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.920
But anyway, I'll get $1
from you if you actually

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.240
go buy the film.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.300
But we're doing a
new indie right now

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.870
that will include the Vatican.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:40.800
But anyway, did you want
to-- just wind up, I'm sorry.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.055
You have a list of questions.

00:24:43.055 --> 00:24:45.430
FEMALE SPEAKER: I've seen the
film several times already.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.990
And it's incredibly
powerful and moving.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:54.227
And the imagery is incredibly
evocative, as we've seen here.

00:24:54.227 --> 00:24:56.560
I was really surprised by
some of the stats in the film.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.230
Like you said, I didn't know
that much about a current mass

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.002
extinction event.

00:25:01.002 --> 00:25:02.460
I was really
surprised particularly

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.220
by the 6 billion oysters
that died overnight

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.360
on the oyster farm, 70
million sharks that are killed

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.284
every year for shark fin soup.

00:25:10.284 --> 00:25:11.950
Did you know about
these things as well?

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.491
Or were they
discoveries for you too?

00:25:13.657 --> 00:25:15.740
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: I didn't
know about acidification.

00:25:18.765 --> 00:25:20.390
We're acidifying the
ocean to the point

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.520
where we're increasing it about
30% since the industrial era.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.270
At the current rate
of acidification--

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:34.754
this is the burning of fossil
fuels-- about a third to half

00:25:34.754 --> 00:25:36.170
of all the carbon
dioxide released

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.590
gets absorbed by the ocean.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.110
That creates carbonic acid.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.640
So anything with the carbon
structure-- plankton,

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.825
coral reefs, start to dissolve.

00:25:44.825 --> 00:25:46.200
And that's what's
going on right.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.320
At the current rates,
by 2050, all coral reefs

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.120
will be in a state of dissolved.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.279
By 2100, they'll be gone.

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:54.070
I didn't know that.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:59.220
That was horrific, because
trying to reverse acidification

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:02.570
is really tough, because
we're changing the chemistry

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.080
of the ocean at that level.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.571
And you lose 25% of the
species in the ocean.

00:26:07.571 --> 00:26:08.945
But there's a
billion people that

00:26:08.945 --> 00:26:11.400
rely on coral reefs for
food, sustenance, recreation.

00:26:14.704 --> 00:26:20.990
I was sitting in a room at
the Aspen Ideas Festival

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.374
with-- I was speaking there.

00:26:23.374 --> 00:26:25.290
But I just took off
everything I could attend.

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.930
I found myself in a
room with Marvin Odum,

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.720
who is the head of Shell Oil and
half of his board of directors

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.210
and the heads of Duke Energy
and Southern Electric.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:37.940
This is like, I don't know, in
my world, this is the devils.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:41.345
And they were just like
this with a circular table.

00:26:41.345 --> 00:26:42.470
We're all out having lunch.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.850
And Marvin says, we have
scientists looking out

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:46.559
50 years.

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:48.600
And we're going to have
to double our oil and gas

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.090
production by then
to meet the demand.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.970
I said, Marvin we have
scientists looking out

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.520
50 years, 500 years,
5 million years.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.310
If you burn all
the gas you want,

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:59.890
we're not going to have
coral reefs for your children

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:00.552
to enjoy.

00:27:00.552 --> 00:27:02.760
I said, how do you reconcile
your short-term business

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.930
interests for the long-term
economic, environmental damage

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.596
for a billion people
that rely on a food

00:27:06.596 --> 00:27:08.350
source every generation?

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.995
He says, well, what
do you do for energy?

00:27:10.995 --> 00:27:12.120
I said, I'm glad you asked.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.260
I drive electric cars.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.130
They're powered by solar panels.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.800
My SUV-- is actually,
the license plate

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.720
on my electric car says, V, it
stands for vehicle, using sun.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.910
It's the opposite of an SUV.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:26.349
I power up my work and
my home by solar energy.

00:27:26.349 --> 00:27:28.390
And he says, well, not
everybody can afford that.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.750
These people started talking
among themselves again sort

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.960
of harrumphing.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.036
But there was only
one woman in the room.

00:27:35.036 --> 00:27:37.410
And afterwards, she had a copy
of "The Cove," because she

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:38.760
knows I'd be at this lunch.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.930
And she said, would
you sign it for me?

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.179
I said, what's with your name?

00:27:41.179 --> 00:27:43.280
And she goes-- it was Mrs. Odom.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.040
It was Marvin's wife.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.540
And I thought, OK,
this is how we're

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.970
going to get to the men
is through the women, who

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.960
have a lot more
innate compassion,

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.520
I think, for their kids.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.020
And I knew I had to
make a movie that

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.490
was going to maybe
do an end around,

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:01.960
because you can sit there and
talk among your shareholders.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:06.890
But one thing you can't ignore
is your kids and your wife.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.495
It's just the way it is.

00:28:08.495 --> 00:28:10.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I read an article

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.840
last year-- many
articles last year

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.050
actually saying that the melting
of the at the Antarctic ice cap

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.070
is now irreversible.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:23.720
When you hear things like that,
it's kind of hard to keep hope.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.870
So in the film,
"Racing Extinction,"

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:29.820
it does have a message of
hope with the Start One Thing

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.440
Campaign.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.620
Would you like to talk
about that a little bit

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.330
before we take some questions?

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.460
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: Yeah
First of all, the movie

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.920
is constructed so that if
you're in the audience,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.870
you're thinking,
I'm just one person.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.780
Everybody that we picked in
this film is a game changer.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.120
They're doing stuff that's
absolutely remarkable.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.056
We take an electric car.

00:28:47.056 --> 00:28:48.180
We were going to build one.

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.020
We thought, well, why build
one when Elon Musk just

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:50.640
built the best one?

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.570
We go to visit him.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:52.850
This is a time when
everybody thought

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:53.870
he was going go bankrupt.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.200
He thought he was
going to go bankrupt.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.140
We were going to
interview him in October.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.135
And he wrote back
and said, Louie,

00:28:58.135 --> 00:28:59.410
can we wait till the
end of this quarter?

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.520
If I don't hit my numbers,
I could go bankrupt.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.464
Sure, Elon, do
whatever you want.

00:29:03.464 --> 00:29:05.880
We photographed him three
months later, four months later,

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.254
the numbers were
slightly better.

00:29:07.254 --> 00:29:08.930
The stock was at $34.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:11.550
And now, it's at $250.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:16.200
The new model that
he's came out with

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.030
had more orders, more preorders
than-- its the biggest product

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.260
sale in history in a single
day-- bigger than the iPhone.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.874
So change happens
very, very quickly.

00:29:25.874 --> 00:29:26.790
That's the cool thing.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:28.520
It's what should
give us all hope.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.180
When I was walking up to
the Tribeca Film Festival

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.150
to get this award, I
saw it was a picture

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:37.000
of 1905 of Broadway-- all
these horse drawn carriages

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.204
on Broadway.

00:29:38.204 --> 00:29:40.120
If that same photographer
shot that same angle

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.114
seven years later, you
wouldn't have seen any horses.

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:44.280
It would have all been cars.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:49.060
That's how fast life transforms.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.220
Seven years is that
magic number that where

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.340
things start to ramp up.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.529
Seven years ago,
we were punching--

00:29:55.529 --> 00:29:56.570
there wasn't smartphones.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.945
That's when the first smartphone
came out 7, 8 years ago.

00:29:58.945 --> 00:30:01.660
We were punching the number
1 key to text six times

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.580
to get a capital C.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.470
And now, I don't
have to tell you

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.570
what you can do with a
cell phone these days.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.880
But it's like the Swiss
Army knife for our lives.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.360
We do everything with it.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.120
But that's seven years.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.050
But if you're 25 years old,
that may seem like an eternity.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:21.010
But for me, who turned nearly
60, that's not that long.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:23.070
And so my hope is that
you can get this film out

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.400
there-- get some of
these disruptive ideas

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.052
like you don't need meat
for nutrition and protein.

00:30:29.052 --> 00:30:31.510
In fact, in our film, we look
at the world's strongest guys

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.760
are vegan.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.010
Nine time world champion arm
wrestler, Alexey Voevoda,

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.685
is a vegan.

00:30:34.685 --> 00:30:36.850
The most accomplished ultra
runner male and female

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.308
in the world, Scott Jurek, just
ran the Appalachian Trail--

00:30:39.308 --> 00:30:42.990
22 days-- double marathons a
day running the Appalachian

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.500
Trail-- 46 days.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.852
And he does it on a vegan diet.

00:30:46.852 --> 00:30:47.560
There's a reason.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.360
Because it's cleaner.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.526
It's better for your system.

00:30:49.526 --> 00:30:50.440
It's healthier.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.310
We interviewed doctors.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.770
The head of the US
Heart Association.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:31:01.540
And he is saying, no doctor
studies nutrition at all.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:06.150
He said, we're inept to
deal with the diseases.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:09.830
80% of the diseases that we
have are caused by what we eat.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:15.514
And you could talk about
strokes-- heart conditions.

00:31:15.514 --> 00:31:17.180
You can talk about
erectile dysfunction.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:21.770
It's all related to basically
filling your body with animal

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.480
fats that clog up your system.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.130
It's a plumbing
problem that we have.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:28.630
And it has to do with
what we put in our mouth.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.400
One of the doctors
told me he said,

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.400
I could fix all the
problems in America

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.687
right now, most of them, by
just wiring people's mouth shut.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:40.600
There is a dissociative
relationship

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.512
between what we're
eating and what we

00:31:42.512 --> 00:31:43.720
think it's doing to our body.

00:31:46.743 --> 00:31:49.710
A vegan-- Sam Simon, the
co-founder of "The Simpsons"

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.710
told me that-- I don't
know if it's true or not.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.170
But he said, a vegan driving
a Hummer uses less energy

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.900
than a meat eater on a bicycle.

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:01.220
So if you want to save the
world, change your diet.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.220
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
on racingextinction.com

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.669
I saw that there is an
Earth Day challenge.

00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:08.460
Or you're calling on
people to participate.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.580
And I've decided to
do something I've been

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.830
meaning to do for a long time.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:12.440
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: Which is?

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.880
FEMALE SPEAKER: Which is to
look into and start buying

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.340
carbon offsets for my travel.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:18.580
What about you?

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.450
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: We did the
same thing for the film.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:28.850
The average person in
America burns about six,

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:31.122
6 to 7 tons of carbon.

00:32:31.122 --> 00:32:32.080
That's a lot of carbon.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.600
But you can offset it
with as little as $20

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.280
by setting aside acreage.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.690
We do it in Ecuador.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:43.370
We set aside acreage enough to
offset the whole entire travel

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.800
and production for the movie.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.550
And it's not that it's
not that expensive.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.842
You do some basic math.

00:32:51.842 --> 00:32:53.540
When we did "The
Cove," the first film,

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.289
we didn't know about
carbon offsets.

00:32:55.289 --> 00:32:56.830
Somebody spent three
months doing it,

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:58.990
because we didn't have
the tools back then.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.680
And remember, it was
646 tons of carbon

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.870
we figured we used
to make that film.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.070
So we offset it by
as much as we could

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:09.060
by putting the solar panels,
and getting electric cars,

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.900
and then setting
aside rain forests.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.600
That's the easiest way to
do it, because rain forests

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.262
get knocked down
primarily for cows.

00:33:15.262 --> 00:33:17.220
And what they're finding
if you leave it alone,

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.330
you can stitch back
these environments.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:22.980
One of the big problems
with extinction

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.645
is you fracture the environment.

00:33:26.645 --> 00:33:29.961
And populations can't
breed across that.

00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:32.210
And you start to lose-- they
can't sustain themselves.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:36.020
So what we're doing is helping
stitch back the rain forest.

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:40.035
FEMALE SPEAKER: So does anyone
have any questions or an Earth

00:33:40.035 --> 00:33:42.897
Day challenge that they would
like to take up themselves?

00:33:42.897 --> 00:33:43.730
We have a mic again.

00:33:51.639 --> 00:33:52.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:53.971
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: Is it on?

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: Is it on?

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.380
OK.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.859
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming here.

00:34:01.859 --> 00:34:03.650
We hear a lot about
these things every day.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:08.590
Like you mentioned, when it
comes to your kids and wife,

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:11.960
then we are more considerate
than-- it just occurred

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.000
to me that, oh, yeah, when
I go back to my house,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.739
I think we are growing
things in the backyard.

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:20.280
And we think about, all
right, let's eat vegetarian.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.230
Mostly, it's vegetarian cooking.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.050
And let's bake organic stuff.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.460
But when I am here,
just today in the lunch,

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.040
I picked whatever came first.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.960
Like I didn't realize--
whatever chicken and fish

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.870
whether that came in
[INAUDIBLE] didn't quite.

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.250
I'm more in my commercial
mindset when I'm here.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.100
And when I go back, I'm
more like long-term,

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.040
and what will happen
to my kids and family,

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.081
and that kind of mindset.

00:34:45.081 --> 00:34:48.280
So I myself, I said, oh,
two personalities now.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:52.330
So how can you now
coming to the-- I

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:55.348
like the hashtag
for the one thing.

00:34:55.348 --> 00:34:56.889
LOUIE PSIHOYOS:
Start With One Thing.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:58.310
AUDIENCE: Start With One Thing.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:02.300
So I changed the laundry
to be crystal balls, which

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.380
are a kind of bioceramic.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:07.180
They don't use detergents.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.230
I was looking to a
bike in the summer.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:14.190
Things one by one-- remove the
chemicals for the cleaning lady

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:19.185
to instead use Method or simple
stuff like vinegar and baking

00:35:19.185 --> 00:35:19.685
soda.

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:27.840
But I don't see a
good way to convince.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.670
I had a lot of trouble
convincing people hey,

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:32.580
it's OK if it
leaves a little bit

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.600
of dirty thing on the floor.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.070
My cleaning lady
is not quite happy

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.153
because she thinks that
she's not doing a good job

00:35:38.153 --> 00:35:40.000
with vinegar and baking soda.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.360
Others are not happy
with washing the clothes.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.480
So where is that I
can show them like,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.460
hey, the incremental rewards.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.300
When you set up a design doc
through a manager in our job,

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.830
for example, a software
engineer-- management

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:55.090
want to incremental returns.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:57.298
They don't want to see, hey,
one year from now you'll

00:35:57.298 --> 00:35:58.350
give something like that.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.000
Can you make it more quarterly?

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.930
At least something keeps coming.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.540
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: Well,
at the end of our film,

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:11.940
it shows the result
of one action you do.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.130
In New York, you're probably
not living in private homes.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.890
But other parts of the
country where you're are

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:20.200
living in homes, you can
install solar panels.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.500
It's the equivalent of taking
a gasoline car off of the road

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.309
and driving it halfway
around the Earth every year.

00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:29.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, here, we
can actually choose our energy

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.440
source through Con Ed.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.770
You can choose solar or wind.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.430
It actually takes 30
seconds to sign up.

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:39.150
LOUIE PSIHOYOS:
Well, there you go.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.870
And there's meatless
Monday campaigns.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.720
Every American eats about
an average of 10,000 animals

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.520
in their lifetime.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.170
So you think about--
you can look at it

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:51.420
from an ethical point of view.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.880
You can look at it from
a health point of view,

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.296
or an environmental
point of view.

00:36:54.296 --> 00:36:56.750
You can look at any
of those critically.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:58.960
You can solve the
day whether you

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.610
decide to eat more
of plant-based diet

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:05.280
for any of those reasons, it can
be-- you can win that argument.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.100
So I keep on coming back.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.630
The simplest thing you
can do is change your diet

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.030
to more of a plant-based diet.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.580
But, yeah, hopefully there's
a 1,000 different ways

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.900
that you guys will think of
besides the obvious ones of how

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:18.400
to say.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.830
But support to look
at each action.

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:25.390
I look at every person in
this room as a super hero.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:26.494
You have that potential.

00:37:26.494 --> 00:37:27.910
You were probably
already doing it

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:29.740
at other points of your life.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.740
When people say, what can I do?

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.147
I say, well, the
first thing I can say

00:37:34.147 --> 00:37:35.230
is not you should do this.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:36.290
It's who are you?

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:37.590
What do you do?

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.650
And try to use that
talent to amplify

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.260
the message to other people.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.750
You look at freaking Google.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.240
You can reach more people
with that little laptop

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.650
than a "New York Times"
writer can 10 years ago.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:55.010
You could write a blog
to tell the cleaning

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:59.930
ladies of the world the
difference-- you could figure

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.790
out chemically how much better
it is for the environment

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.650
much better than
I probably could.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.240
But I don't know who you are.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.090
Everybody can do that and think,
OK, at am I really good at?

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.990
In my world, if you're a
filmmaker, make films about it.

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:14.200
If you're a writer,
write with your songs.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:19.490
Michael Franti, the
singer for to Spearhead,

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:21.250
has been writing the
last couple days.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:24.680
He's doing a song about
it for Earth Day today.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.100
It depends on who you are
and what you're doing.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:33.060
Everybody has massive amounts
of underused talent, I think.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.060
AUDIENCE: Question here.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.940
So one of the things you
said we can do individually

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.390
is to become vegetarians.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:45.120
And one parallel I saw was we've
known for about 40 plus years

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.950
that cigarettes can kill us.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.510
And we still have plenty of
people smoking cigarettes.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:53.800
And that's such an individual--
if I keep doing this action.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.852
I'm going to die.

00:38:54.852 --> 00:38:56.310
And there is still
people doing it.

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:59.880
And I was wondering, do we
really have to rely on people

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:05.380
to break meat eating, which
has become so culturally

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.060
intertwined?

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.140
Do we need to rely on
people to individually make

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:08.780
that decision?

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.740
Or are there other
things we can do

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:14.580
to help affect that change
as opposed to waiting

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.640
50 years for people to
really stop eating meat?

00:39:18.699 --> 00:39:20.240
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: I'm
old enough that I

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.270
can remember that if
you came to an office

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.310
like this 30 years ago,
you could see people

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:29.940
smoking at their desk and
polluting the air-- 1997,

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:34.500
I think, or '98 were the
last commercial smoking

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.947
planes in America.

00:39:35.947 --> 00:39:37.780
If you want to smoke
at Google, you probably

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.489
have to go outside
and around the corner.

00:39:39.489 --> 00:39:41.946
I think there is going to be
a time in the very near future

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:43.377
where if you eat
meat, it's going

00:39:43.377 --> 00:39:45.460
to be like you can do it
outside around the corner

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.720
with the smokers.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.220
Because environmentally,
if you look

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.650
at the impact in
California where they-- I

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:56.260
forget what it was something
like 5,000 gallons of water

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.470
for a kilo of meat.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.900
It's in the thousands
of gallons per pound

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:05.230
to raise meat when there's a
water such shortage going on.

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:08.610
It would be standing in
a shower for three days

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:10.640
so you can have your hamburger.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.835
You know what I mean?

00:40:11.835 --> 00:40:14.300
It's really out of
balance what we think of.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.310
And a lot of the
crops are-- almonds,

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:18.290
1.1 gallons for to
raise an almond,

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:19.540
because they flood the fields.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.612
It's very inefficient.

00:40:20.612 --> 00:40:22.570
Somebody in this room
could probably figure out

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:23.650
now to do it more efficiently.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:24.860
A lot of the
alfalfa that's grown

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.990
in California-- the alfalfa
is exported to China

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:28.129
where they feed cows.

00:40:28.129 --> 00:40:29.420
Think of the energy loss there.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:32.720
We're exporting our water
and our energy-- things

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.977
that we could-- plants
we could be eating,

00:40:35.977 --> 00:40:38.560
not alfalfa, but other things
we could be using for ourselves.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.490
It's just this is horrible
exchange of energy

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.175
that everybody should see it.

00:40:43.175 --> 00:40:45.800
The environmentalists-- they see
it, and they're harping on it.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.350
But, yeah, the Surgeon
General's smoking

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.840
was hazardous to your
health was 40 years ago.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.040
But now, you need two things.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.730
You need to change
public perception.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:58.850
And you need to do
government legislation.

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:01.030
And I can't talk
about it right now.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.670
But there's a really
big country, a huge one.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.270
And it's not the
United States that's

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.740
going to announce next month
to reduce half the meat

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.690
consumption of a
very big country.

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:13.637
And that's going to be a mandate
that people have to follow.

00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:14.220
They'll do it.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.386
They will cut out subsidies.

00:41:15.386 --> 00:41:16.950
So it's happening.

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:18.870
The leadership is coming
from other countries

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:20.244
other than America.

00:41:20.244 --> 00:41:22.160
I have travelled around
the world quite a bit.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.710
You guys probably do too.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:27.200
We are looked at
as like-- you're

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.250
innovators-- you're
different than the rest

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:31.240
of the population of America.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.780
But the rest of
America, we are not.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:38.770
And we are looked at as
the fools of the world.

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:41.460
We are, because
we are the slowest

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.600
to get the carbon problem.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:48.060
If you go to Europe and
Germany, 30% of their energy

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.310
is done with
alternative energy now.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:51.100
Their exporting.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.130
And people said, they have more
installed solar than we do.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:57.310
And we have the same
solar for footprint here.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:00.514
Seattle has the same solar
footprint as Germany.

00:42:00.514 --> 00:42:02.680
And they're producing energy
so cheaply that they're

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.010
exporting it to Poland.

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.340
They're giving it away
at $0.01 a kilowatt.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.462
So here we still hear
this diatribe-- solar

00:42:09.462 --> 00:42:10.170
is too expensive.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:10.870
No, it isn't.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:14.750
That's a vestige of a campaign
by the fossil fuel companies

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.150
to say it's not practical.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.910
The fossil fuel
companies also told us

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.180
that the divestment
campaigns weren't

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.700
going to work-- a couple
college kids getting Harvard

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:29.600
and Stanford to reduce
their fossil fuel

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.974
footprint in their
endowments wasn't going

00:42:31.974 --> 00:42:33.140
to affect their bottom line.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.620
Peabody Coal went bankrupt
last month-- the biggest coal

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.190
company in the world.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.062
So it's happening.

00:42:38.062 --> 00:42:39.020
We're bonding together.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.930
But you need both.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:40.805
You need legislation.

00:42:43.395 --> 00:42:45.020
Warren Buffet, I used
to like that guy,

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.820
but I hate him now, because he
runs a company in Nevada that

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.900
just made it almost
impossible to get solar,

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.240
because he has a
fossil fuel company.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.230
He made it almost impossible
for somebody in Nevada, which

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.150
is all sun and desert,
to put up solar panels

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:05.520
and get paid for it from the
state to sell back to energy.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.580
And they're doing this.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.580
This is their business model.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.330
They know they can't do
it on a national level.

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:11.121
So they are going state
by state and trying

00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:15.280
to make the right thing to do
very difficult for well-meaning

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:15.780
people.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.760
So we need to
fight them and also

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.610
get legislation to
make it easy for people

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.000
to do the right thing.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.520
And also, the impact of a
film is really powerful.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.780
We just have anecdotal stuff.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.190
But I was a judge at
Sundance this last year.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.312
And a guy was coming
to the bathroom

00:43:32.312 --> 00:43:33.270
rushing to get my seat.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:36.800
And some guy says, I just saw
"Racing Extinction" last year.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.600
It changed my life.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.230
I said, how so?

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:41.620
He said, well, I had two
big cattle operations.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.910
I just got rid of both of them.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:46.870
And so films are a
really powerful tool.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:48.470
Tell your friends
to see the film.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:51.410
It's really important, because
you can sit there and talk

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:54.150
about to your cleaning
lady about the importance

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:56.810
of the environment that
it's really important what

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:57.810
you do around the house.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:59.601
But you see a film like
"Racing Extinction"

00:43:59.601 --> 00:44:03.000
or I don't know, "Chasing Ice,"
or any other environmental

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.146
films that are out
there, you don't

00:44:05.146 --> 00:44:06.270
have to explain it anymore.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:07.130
Buy them a copy.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:11.790
Give it to them with their
bi-weekly check or whatever.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:15.600
And one thing
about-- Ric O'Barry,

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.410
who was the hero
of the first movie.

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:18.160
He did "The Cove."

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.180
He was the guy that
captured and trained

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.186
the five female dolphins
that collectively

00:44:22.186 --> 00:44:23.310
played the part of Flipper.

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:25.240
He told me that,
Louie, "The Cove"

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.480
was the best thing that
ever happened to him.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.020
I said, why?

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:28.728
He said, because he
never asked explained

00:44:28.728 --> 00:44:31.330
anybody what the problem is,
because you go to a dolphin

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:31.830
show.

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:33.600
And you see the dolphins
are smiling and laughing.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.930
And the kids are having fun.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:36.640
What's the problem?

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.250
The film shows you that the
dolphin has an eternal smile,

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:42.640
even when its head is
chopped off and sitting

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.460
on the slaughterhouse
floor and still smiling.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.000
There have bigger brains.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.670
And they are more sentient.

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:51.250
The neurons that are associated
with sentient neurons

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.520
are more familial.

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.930
They hang out in family pods
like orcas their entire life

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:57.540
with their mother.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.100
When you start to see a film
like that, that explains what

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.490
the problem is,
it's like instead

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.470
of trying to explain it
and spend an hour or two

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:07.970
at a lecture, now he's got
tens of millions of people

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:09.720
around the country,
around the world, that

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.310
understand the problem.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:12.476
And it's just a matter going
from country to country

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.090
to try to close these
businesses down.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:15.131
Same thing with the film.

00:45:15.131 --> 00:45:17.432
If you could get
the film out there--

00:45:17.432 --> 00:45:19.890
Discovery did a great job of
it getting the film out there.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:21.660
But we're still not
at that 10% level.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.080
36 million people
worldwide is not that big.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.240
We need to do that in America.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.850
So tell your friends
about the film.

00:45:32.485 --> 00:45:34.110
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for being here.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.740
And thanks for all
your great work.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.480
I think it's very
sobering statistics

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.750
that you're sharing
in that I think

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.740
something like 50%
of greenhouse gases

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.750
are produced by
animal agriculture.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:45.732
It's really terrible.

00:45:45.732 --> 00:45:47.940
So I really appreciate your
call to action for people

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.860
to take up vegan
diets as one way

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.170
to combat this thing
that's going on.

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:54.700
My question is,
why do you think--

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.960
and I watch very closely
the COP21 and now

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.470
the US dietary guidelines, which
came out in 2015, both of which

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:03.240
seem to completely ignore the
issue of animal agriculture.

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.320
It wasn't even brought
up or mentioned.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.170
Sustainability wasn't
even an afterthought

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:08.700
for the dietary guidelines.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.480
So I'm wondering what
you think is the impetus

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.910
to have our politicians
and leaders talking

00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:15.174
about these things openly?

00:46:15.174 --> 00:46:16.590
LOUIE PSIHOYOS:
Yeah, whenever you

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.310
talk about dietary concerns,
you have the lobbyist

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:23.240
go in really hard-- the
lobbyist go to the politicians

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.830
to try to get the
language dumbed down.

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:30.170
I remember when the guidelines
came out five or six years ago

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:32.650
about, OK, eggs, dairy.

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:33.800
It's a real problem.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.270
Milk should not be on
the food pyramid at all.

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:40.610
This got crucified.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:45.290
It was too big of a
problem politically.

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:46.950
The information is still there.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:52.070
The UN came out with the
guidelines for agriculture.

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.770
And it's called the long
shadow of agriculture.

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:58.230
And it said, we have to
reduce our consumption.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:03.510
The 50%, if you
look at-- I think

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:07.860
it's 14.5% equivalent
of tailpipe emissions.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:11.020
So the consuming of meat
in America for consumption

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.860
is more than that of all
the tailpipe emissions

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.530
of all the industries that burn
fossil fuels-- planes, trains,

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.180
automobiles.

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.460
That's for certain--
at least 14.5%.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:23.490
50% is probably aggressive.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.610
But the thing is
we know that this

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:29.080
is the one thing we can do right
away to turn the dials down.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:34.160
But this is an area where
we have to do it internally.

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:39.560
We showed the film in Bogota,
Colombia several months ago.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.480
And the day after--
this is a pretty heavy

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:47.800
meat-eating country-- the day
after the students got together

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.560
and met with the chancellor.

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:53.560
And he agreed to put
more of a vegan menu

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.970
with the several
thousand students there.

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:57.850
And this is the kind
of change we need.

00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.730
We know that in
America, we don't work

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:02.040
on a national level as much.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.740
I've testified against Sea
World for another film.

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.830
But what we're
doing statewide is

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:11.020
you could have a container
load of shark fins

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:14.760
that are legal to possess,
sell, or distribute

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.710
any way in Washington State.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:19.600
But that container
is not open if you

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.960
go on to Oregon, or
Idaho, or somewhere else,

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.540
transport by truck
and get disseminated.

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.800
And US customs
officials say, there's

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.970
nothing we can do about it.

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:33.030
We just made it illegal to
import it into the docks.

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:37.316
And we're doing that in
California and in Oregon.

00:48:37.316 --> 00:48:38.690
Texas is the first
southern state

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:40.270
that we have to
implement the law.

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.320
So we're working
with legislations,

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.550
but on a state-wide
basis like the same way

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:50.207
that Warren Buffet does it with
his minions-- those bastards.

00:48:50.207 --> 00:48:51.790
And we're trying to
close them down so

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:55.750
we can take-- Seattle was the
third largest port in America.

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:58.880
And this is making it very,
very difficult to-- in fact,

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.170
it wasn't just shark fins.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:08.600
There was ivory, rhino
horns, penguin-- 10 species.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.060
So we can do it.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.814
It doesn't take much to get
a referendum these days.

00:49:13.814 --> 00:49:15.230
People talk about
these petitions.

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:16.313
And they get all the time.

00:49:16.313 --> 00:49:17.620
People say, they don't work.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.140
We killed SeaWorld
with petitions.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.500
We got Willie Nelson,
Bare Naked Ladies--

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:28.130
these 10 musical acts out of 12,
to stop performing at SeaWorld.

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:30.530
Richard Bloom, who is a
representative from the state I

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.700
live in now, California,
came out with a law

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.597
that it was just a first salvo.

00:49:34.597 --> 00:49:35.430
It was just an idea.

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:39.520
The law was that he was going
to stop the breeding of dolphins

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.000
in California.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.864
That law, coupled
with my organization--

00:49:42.864 --> 00:49:44.780
I run the Oceanic
Preservation Society-- there

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.880
were six people.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.670
We bought copies
of "Blackfish"--

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:50.400
another film about
dolphins and orcas.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.170
We bought copies of
"Blackfish" and "The Cove."

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:56.350
And we gave them to all
the shareholders of the 10

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:57.850
major investment of SeaWorld.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:00.510
That coupled with Richard
Bloom's proposed law

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:02.614
caused the stock to
crash a billion dollars

00:50:02.614 --> 00:50:03.280
in a single day.

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.717
And they haven't
recovered since.

00:50:05.717 --> 00:50:07.050
It wasn't just our organization.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:08.300
We worked with
other organizations.

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.800
That was a great
movie, "Blackfish."

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:14.140
But together, we can
do incredible things.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.740
We're trying to get
it illegal to bring

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.410
animal parts, body
parts, for trophies

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:22.480
from Africa to America.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:27.030
And UPS buckled with 167,000
members on the petition.

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:30.520
We're working right now
this week today with FedEx

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.430
to do the same thing.

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:35.820
We showed that we could
legally transport shark fins

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:38.820
to states using their system.

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:40.420
And we did it.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.950
We photographed it.

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:45.440
There are people from
Federal Express complicit

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.710
with showing us how we could
avoid federal law by shipping

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:50.670
with them.

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:54.330
And so that is with their
head of marketing right now.

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:57.220
We will release it
probably today or tomorrow.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:02.100
And if they don't buckle,
we'll go public with it

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:04.370
and start a petition.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:07.960
So a 160,000
petitions is nothing

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.390
to get these companies
to change law.

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:17.090
All it takes is getting people
together-- getting people

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:21.610
to understand that taking the
15 seconds to 5 seconds it

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:26.382
takes to sign a petition
really helps-- sign and share.

00:51:26.382 --> 00:51:28.590
AUDIENCE: So going back to
my question, who would you

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:32.470
petition and how to create 100
million vegans in the United

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:34.580
States tomorrow?

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.390
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: I'm
working on a film--

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:39.040
the one I'm working with
James and Suzy Cameron.

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:39.990
We're working on that.

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:41.698
We're trying to get
Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:46.470
as an executive
producer as well.

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.380
Li Ka-shing, the
richest guy in Asia--

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:50.020
he's also an executive producer.

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:51.550
We'll get the film out there.

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:55.050
I work on that issue
every day with the idea

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.800
that it doesn't
happen overnight.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.530
It's going to happen
with this film.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:01.270
We want to get the
film distributed.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:05.020
And then, at some point,
maybe release it for free.

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.515
The problem with people like
in the environmental movement.

00:52:07.515 --> 00:52:09.390
They say, well, all your
care about is money.

00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:10.514
You got to release it free.

00:52:10.514 --> 00:52:13.520
It's really expensive to release
movies. "Racing Extinction" was

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.150
an $8 million, $9 million movie.

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:17.060
We sold it for $3 million.

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.560
I probably can't
tell those figures.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.810
Just cut that from the record.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:25.810
But it's an expensive
movie to give away.

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:26.950
I sold my house.

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:29.330
And I got $700,000
of my own money.

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.200
I'm not a rich guy.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.939
Everything I own
is in that film.

00:52:31.939 --> 00:52:33.730
And people say, why
don't you give it away?

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:34.810
It's like, you know what?

00:52:34.810 --> 00:52:35.590
I've got to eat.

00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:38.120
I've got insurance to pay.

00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.446
If I run a Google
on the laptop, I've

00:52:40.446 --> 00:52:41.570
got to pay for that laptop.

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:43.730
They're not giving
it away to me.

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:44.710
Life is expensive.

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:47.030
And I got crews that
need to get paid.

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:49.690
It's like you can't
give away art just

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:53.640
because it's well-intentioned.

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:57.940
And sometimes we have investors
that need to get paid.

00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:59.820
But there is a scale.

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:03.772
We are very conscious that we
want to hit that 10% to 16.5%

00:53:03.772 --> 00:53:05.105
number no matter how it happens.

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:12.474
We had a deal to sell
"The Cove" in China.

00:53:12.474 --> 00:53:13.973
And somebody said,
oh, they are only

00:53:13.973 --> 00:53:15.580
going to offer you $30,000.

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:16.440
Fine.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:20.150
They are going to reach a half
a billion people in China.

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:21.320
We didn't do it.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.860
And I can remember we went
to China about a year later.

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:27.590
And people that
were with my team

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:29.340
were signing autographs
on the street.

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.570
They recognize them
from the movie.

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:34.360
Somebody had pirated the movie
in Cantonese and Mandarin.

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:37.840
And it was like every school
kid of 15 to 25 years old

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:38.930
had seen "The Cove."

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:40.910
And now they are
celebrities on the streets.

00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:43.650
But it's because it went viral,
because we didn't sell it.

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:48.230
Somebody has took it under the--
let's just-- I like this movie.

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:49.250
Let's just rip it.

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:52.560
And it went viral.

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:56.390
But for me, at some point,
I don't care about the money

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.960
so much.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.710
I just want to get it out
there and solve the issue so we

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:01.910
can go on to something else.

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:04.170
There always has to be
another problem to solve.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:05.034
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:05.034 --> 00:54:06.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: Are there
any other questions?

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:12.810
All right, got one over there?

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:15.310
I think this will be
probably the last one.

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:16.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.970
Thanks for being here.

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:25.420
You were on to covering China
for "Racing Extinction."

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:29.170
Could you tell us about maybe
the most horrifying moment

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:30.939
that you experienced there?

00:54:30.939 --> 00:54:31.980
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: In China?

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.100
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:33.810
Or Hong Kong.

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:35.100
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: Or Hong Kong.

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.720
Actually, we were in Guangzhou.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.710
And they had the illegal
wildlife markets there.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.390
And they had been
shutdown twice that year.

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:44.350
And it keeps on moving.

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:46.391
There's so much demand,
it keeps on springing up,

00:54:46.391 --> 00:54:47.977
even though people face jail.

00:54:47.977 --> 00:54:49.810
So you go there at like
3:00 in the morning,

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:52.110
and people are selling
just about everything

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:54.180
you can imagine-- a
lot of illegal wildlife

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:56.720
or a lot of wildlife that
we wouldn't eat in America.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.670
But just the same--
just the screams

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:02.360
and the horrors of these
animals being put into cages

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:06.260
or being killed, because this--
blocks and blocks and blocks.

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:08.320
It would be like the
Meat District here--

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.860
like imagine every shop.

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:11.650
Like you go to the
Chelsea Market.

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:14.540
And there is 15
of them that size.

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:17.910
And they are all selling
endangered snakes,

00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:21.250
endangered birds, all
kinds of farm animals,

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:24.080
but things that I
don't know dogs,

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:26.092
cats, rats-- they're
all being eaten.

00:55:26.092 --> 00:55:27.550
And it was like
everything that had

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:30.270
a heartbeat, including
insects and larvae,

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:31.260
was being sold there.

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:36.420
And there was something
really disturbing about that.

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.320
It was done so openly.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.380
And you know what?

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.924
In 1986, I was doing a
story for "Fortune Magazine"

00:55:43.924 --> 00:55:45.340
on the biggest
independently owned

00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:46.560
cattle ranches in America.

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.440
And I went to one that
was so big in Oklahoma

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.260
that they had their
own slaughter house.

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:53.897
And that convinced me to
become-- I wasn't a vegetarian.

00:55:53.897 --> 00:55:54.730
I was a pescatarian.

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:57.280
But I stopped eating things
that walked right then

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.934
and haven't since.

00:55:59.934 --> 00:56:01.350
When they kill
these animals, they

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:02.840
put a cap bolt to the skull.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.465
It was supposed to
kill them instantly.

00:56:04.465 --> 00:56:05.640
But it's an assembly line.

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:10.627
They did 500 a day-- 500 cows
a day in this small facility.

00:56:10.627 --> 00:56:11.710
And they rip the skin off.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:13.070
And they hang it upside down.

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:16.050
And it's supposed to be dead, as
people are shaving parts of it

00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:18.370
off and putting it into
different bins and stuff.

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:21.566
And I remember this cow
was hanging upside down.

00:56:21.566 --> 00:56:22.690
it was supposed to be dead.

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:25.160
And it was looking at
me and following me

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.150
as it went around in
this conveyor belt.

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:28.229
And it was still alive.

00:56:28.229 --> 00:56:29.520
Part of it was still conscious.

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:32.170
And I thought at that point,
I don't want to be part of it.

00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:33.600
Now, I made a conscious effort.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:38.510
But when you see the scale that
was being done, it was amazing.

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:41.560
There was a rooftop in
Hong Kong that we went to.

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:46.230
And it was seven pallets
deep of shark fins.

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:49.000
And it was spread out all over
this roof overlooking Hong Kong

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.050
Harbor.

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:53.210
And you each shark
has seven fins to it.

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:56.315
And you see these
little baby ones.

00:56:56.315 --> 00:56:58.480
I've dove all over the world.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.872
And every time you
go back to a place,

00:57:00.872 --> 00:57:02.080
you see less and less sharks.

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.080
And it was because of the
demand for shark fins.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.409
Now, if you haven't seen
"The Cove," or sorry,

00:57:06.409 --> 00:57:07.950
"Racing Extinction,"
what you realize

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:10.850
is that one of the
guys in our film

00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:15.080
had photographed
a live shark fin.

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.930
What they do is a
lot of the sharks,

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:19.090
they just cut off the fins
and throw the shark back

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:24.180
to die, basically with all
its appendages cut off.

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:26.690
And the shark needs-- it
doesn't grow them back.

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:32.570
It needs to swim to breathe--
water rushing by its gills.

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:34.880
So these animals are left
to die on the bottom.

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:37.510
And one of the guys in
our movie had filmed this.

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:42.200
That film went viral
in China with a PSA

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.260
that Yao Ming, the
basketball player, did.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.650
And the airing of
that film was seen

00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:48.500
by more than a billion
people in Asia.

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:52.100
And that, along with
the legislation,

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:57.230
it's now illegal to serve shark
fin at banquets at government

00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:59.290
banquets in China.

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:03.410
That one PSA helped reduce
the demand for shark fin soup

00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:04.950
by 70%.

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:06.130
That's the power of imagery.

00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:08.754
That's one of the themes running
through "Racing Extinction" is

00:58:08.754 --> 00:58:10.436
that imagery is very powerful.

00:58:10.436 --> 00:58:11.560
And that's why we do films.

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.893
That's why I was a photographer.

00:58:12.893 --> 00:58:17.160
I was like, I did it to
try to change the world.

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.270
That's why I was
working-- the first story

00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:22.910
I did for "National Geographic"
was a story on garbage

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:24.170
and recycling.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.600
I started in 1981.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.970
And people weren't talking
about recycling back then.

00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:31.010
Now, there's recycling
in my hotel room.

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:32.570
But I was on the
vanguard of people.

00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:36.960
But at "Geographic," when
we came out with that story,

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.422
we had 15 million people saw
the magazine at that point.

00:58:40.422 --> 00:58:42.380
It was the second biggest
subscription magazine

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.390
in the world.

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:47.290
And it had a pass around rate
of about three to four people

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:48.290
would see each magazine.

00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:51.060
So you could hit that
Malcolm Gladwell number--

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:55.910
that magic 15%-- just by virtue
of getting one article out

00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:57.350
there that people see.

00:58:57.350 --> 00:58:59.100
I am not saying that
50% of the population

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.970
became recyclers overnight.

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:04.120
But it became that first salvo.

00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.680
The research shows
that if you want

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:08.880
to get a movie scene
in America, people

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.400
need to hear it six or seven
times before they'll actually

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:11.900
go see it.

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:16.160
So that means it has to
have a strong word of mouth.

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.880
The celebrity that's associated
with the movie on the cover

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.350
of a magazine that you adore.

00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:22.460
You see bus stop
ads, and billboards,

00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:26.940
and they blow it out
there-- $250 million movie--

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.544
will have $100 million
, $150 million.

00:59:29.544 --> 00:59:31.960
If it's really a bomb, they
will throw another $50 million

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:33.590
to $100 million at
it, because they

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:35.140
know if they don't hit those
numbers the first weekend

00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:37.556
or two before people figure
out that it's a piece of crap,

00:59:37.556 --> 00:59:40.590
they won't see it.

00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:43.370
As documentary filmmakers,
we don't have that.

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:45.280
But what we do is
we have good ideas.

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:50.900
We could light up the UN,
the Empire State Building,

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:51.880
or the Vatican.

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.280
I wish that was my idea.

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.160
But what we're
doing now is saying,

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.030
OK, the film is out there.

00:59:57.030 --> 01:00:01.560
But we still work on cove
issues six years later.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.044
Recently, SeaWorld just
because of all the pressure

01:00:04.044 --> 01:00:06.210
we put on it, they announced
that they weren't going

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:07.890
to do captive breeding anymore.

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:11.180
They're stopping all
their orca programs.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.530
And that's because of
"Blackfish," "The Cove."

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:18.090
The executive producer
of "Blackfish"

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:21.280
was inspired to become a
vegan by seeing "The Cove."

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.510
And she's never done a movie
before because of "The Cove,"

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:29.090
because she put the money
into "Blackfish." so there's

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:32.480
like a reciprocal effect of
doing one good thing that

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.020
can really go viral.

01:00:36.865 --> 01:00:38.450
And I worked for
"National Geographic"

01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:39.866
over the course
of about 18 years.

01:00:39.866 --> 01:00:42.330
I did, I don't know,
13, 14 stories for them.

01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:47.510
I can remember one time
watching somebody actually

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:51.570
see my movie-- my
story on a plane.

01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:52.966
And he flipped through that.

01:00:52.966 --> 01:00:54.840
It took me a year and
a half to do the story.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.870
He flipped through
it as fast as you

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:58.175
could flip through a magazine.

01:00:58.175 --> 01:00:59.050
It was heartbreaking.

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:01.990
But with a film,
you got 90 minutes

01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:03.760
to change people's hearts.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.010
And that's an extraordinary
amount of time these days.

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:07.910
You guys probably
know more than I do.

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:11.780
People say that people
don't more than a couple--

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.080
you can't have a YouTube
that's going to last

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.559
more than a couple minutes.

01:01:15.559 --> 01:01:16.100
I don't know.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:21.550
I think people have a propensity
to-- I binge watch "House

01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:23.390
of Cards" when it comes out.

01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:24.780
I'll do it one weekend.

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.520
I think if you have
a good story to tell,

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.130
people will endure
just about anything.

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:31.210
The trick that you have
with environmentalists

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:32.960
is how do you make a good story?

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.200
What we try to do is we
try to make a story that

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.400
is really entertaining.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.944
"Rolling Stone" said
that, like I said,

01:01:39.944 --> 01:01:42.110
"The Cove" was a cross
between the "Bourne Identity"

01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:45.250
and "Flipper." "Racing
Extinction" is really

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:47.780
the result of me watching too
many Jacques Cousteau specials

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.730
and James Bond movies as a kid.

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:51.720
We have a Tesla
that we tricked out.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.480
We wanted to make this Bond car.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.200
So we have a
luminescent paint job.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.509
We use it for getaways.

01:01:58.509 --> 01:02:00.050
We have a disappearing
license plate.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.466
We have a
forward-looking infrared

01:02:01.466 --> 01:02:03.240
that comes out of
the front on a Gimbal

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.990
so we can see carbon
dioxide in real time.

01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:07.670
We have a 16,000-lumen projector
that comes out of the back with

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:10.300
a hatch on a robotic arm so we
can project it on skyscrapers

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.236
in real time.

01:02:12.236 --> 01:02:15.260
The car is freaking amazing.

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:20.300
But we knew that we had to
have some sort of hook in there

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:23.730
so that if a kid of a
certain age saw the film,

01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:25.930
they would say you got to
at least go see the car.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.710
They may not understand--
they will get the exposition.

01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:34.520
They will get the story on
the way to seeing the car.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.400
But there all sorts of
interesting characters

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.100
in this film that hopefully
hook people into the film.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.950
There's a lot going on in this
one little 90-minute sequence.

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:44.670
But 90 minutes is
that enough time

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:46.590
to actually change the DNA.

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:48.250
Somebody should do
some research on it.

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:55.110
But I think that we used to
read books and get changed.

01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:56.950
We're not reading
books en masse anymore.

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:58.410
But we're watching films.

01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:02.280
And we're watching episodic
television by the buckets full.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:04.912
But if you can make a film
that changes people's hearts,

01:03:04.912 --> 01:03:06.120
we can change their behavior.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.258
I know that.

01:03:08.258 --> 01:03:10.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right,
well, thank you very much.

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.450
LOUIE PSIHOYOS:
Thank you, everybody.

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:12.033
Appreciate it.

01:03:12.033 --> 01:03:13.450
Sure.

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:14.724
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: And yeah,
Be sure to check out

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.860
the hit "Racing Extinction."

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:18.776
It's available online.

01:03:18.776 --> 01:03:21.640
And check out the website
racingextinction.com

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.964
for local viewings.

01:03:23.964 --> 01:03:24.880
LOUIE PSIHOYOS: Great.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.463
Thank you all.

01:03:25.463 --> 01:03:26.730
Cheers.
