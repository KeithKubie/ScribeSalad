Hi, YouTube. I'm Jim Schiro, the CEO of Zurich
Financial Services. And as I look at the current

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.770
economic crisis that we're in, I think we
have to look at the recovery as a process,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.090
not an event. I think we'll start to see recovery
coming in 2010, probably mid-year.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.500
I think what we're finding still is the need
to identify the issues and I think one of

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.980
the good things about Davos this year is the
global debate around the issues. Now we have

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.579
to provide action plans to move ourselves
forward and I'm confident that we will.
