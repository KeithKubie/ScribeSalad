00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.764
One last thing Lauren said that we're going to discuss, is the idea of

00:00:03.764 --> 00:00:08.584
language, thought and culture together. So what happens when we learn our

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:11.062
native language and then we're exposed to people who speak a different

00:00:11.062 --> 00:00:15.136
language? Will we be able to understand concepts that they have in their

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:19.506
language, if we don't have those in ours? Well, the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis

00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:25.241
states that language creates thought as much as thought creates language. And

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.202
the idea here is that if we're speaking different languages, we don't have a

00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:32.530
common foundation. Therefore, it would be difficult to communicate and

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.242
translate ideas from one language to the other. Now the linguistic

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:40.882
determination hypothesis, suggest that our language actually determines our way

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:46.386
of thinking and our perceptions of the world. Basically, what they're saying is

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:49.680
that, we don't have a word for an idea or a concept in our language, it's not

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.288
possible to think about that idea or that concept. Now, one very interesting

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:59.182
example that seems to support this hypothesis comes from a small tribe of about

00:00:59.182 --> 00:01:04.670
200 people who live in the Amazon area of Brazil. Now these individuals have no

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.592
words for numbers that are higher than two. Therefore it's almost impossible

00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:13.597
for them to understand the concepts of nine and ten. And they even have

00:01:13.597 --> 00:01:18.543
difficulty with an operation 3 plus 1. Now this is not because these people are

00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:22.786
not intelligent. It is because they don't have words for numbers higher than

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:28.723
two. Now let's go back to Lauren for a recap of this section on language.
