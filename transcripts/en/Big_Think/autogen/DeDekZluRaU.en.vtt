intrigued me and I started to enquire

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
intrigued me and I started to enquire
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.930
intrigued me and I started to enquire
and look at my experience and the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940
and look at my experience and the
 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.970
and look at my experience and the
experiment with it there was no training

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980
experiment with it there was no training
 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.890
experiment with it there was no training
but it it's more you experiment with

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900
but it it's more you experiment with
 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.500
but it it's more you experiment with
different ways of doing things and you

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510
different ways of doing things and you
 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.840
different ways of doing things and you
just see if it works and most of the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
just see if it works and most of the
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.390
just see if it works and most of the
time it doesn't work but then you just

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400
time it doesn't work but then you just
 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.820
time it doesn't work but then you just
keep experimenting and when it works it

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830
keep experimenting and when it works it
 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.680
keep experimenting and when it works it

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.330
are rather than what you do and I was
more leaning towards doing incredible

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150
really onto something there
 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.509
really onto something there
well I think it brings the inner and the

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519
well I think it brings the inner and the
 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.150
well I think it brings the inner and the
outer together because I think when you

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160
outer together because I think when you
 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.320
outer together because I think when you
when when one starts in performance you

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330
when when one starts in performance you
 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.130
when when one starts in performance you
you tend to relate to that you're

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140
you tend to relate to that you're
 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.800
you tend to relate to that you're
putting something out you know that it's

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810
putting something out you know that it's
 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.570
putting something out you know that it's
either a skill that you're putting out

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580
either a skill that you're putting out
 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.020
either a skill that you're putting out
or a knowledge or an ability that you're

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030
or a knowledge or an ability that you're
 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.430
or a knowledge or an ability that you're
putting out but then you realize that

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440
putting out but then you realize that
 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.160
putting out but then you realize that
actually what you're really putting out

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170
actually what you're really putting out
 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.619
actually what you're really putting out
is yourself and you're also putting out

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629
is yourself and you're also putting out
 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.420
is yourself and you're also putting out
a skill in the performance but it's a

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430
a skill in the performance but it's a
 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.309
a skill in the performance but it's a
vehicle to put yourself out and so I

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319
vehicle to put yourself out and so I
 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.890
vehicle to put yourself out and so I
learned that early on because when I

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900
learned that early on because when I
 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.020
learned that early on because when I
started performing I was actually

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030
started performing I was actually
 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.490
started performing I was actually
performing on the streets in Tel Aviv

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500
performing on the streets in Tel Aviv
 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.930
performing on the streets in Tel Aviv
and so there I had to put myself into it

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940
and so there I had to put myself into it
 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.690
and so there I had to put myself into it
because otherwise I wouldn't get much

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700
because otherwise I wouldn't get much
 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.789
because otherwise I wouldn't get much
response you know if I was just putting

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799
response you know if I was just putting
 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.400
response you know if I was just putting
out something and and my tendency was

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410
out something and and my tendency was
 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.690
out something and and my tendency was
has been to to just play it safe and not

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700
has been to to just play it safe and not
 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.580
has been to to just play it safe and not
to put myself out but to put out

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590
to put myself out but to put out
 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.850
to put myself out but to put out
something cool or fancy or impressive

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860
something cool or fancy or impressive
 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.460
something cool or fancy or impressive
and then I think what I've learned is

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470
and then I think what I've learned is
 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.009
and then I think what I've learned is
that you know the it's you know you you

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019
that you know the it's you know you you
 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.569
that you know the it's you know you you
have an opportunity to put yourself out

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579
have an opportunity to put yourself out
 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.840
have an opportunity to put yourself out
and and since who we are has boundless

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850
and and since who we are has boundless
 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.599
and and since who we are has boundless
depth then you can always go deeper in

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609
depth then you can always go deeper in
 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.400
depth then you can always go deeper in
putting putting out who you are because

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410
putting putting out who you are because
 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.620
putting putting out who you are because
there's always more you know it's not

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630
there's always more you know it's not
 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.080
there's always more you know it's not
just you know it's not just

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090
just you know it's not just
 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.180
just you know it's not just
two-dimensional you're not just someone

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190
two-dimensional you're not just someone
 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.760
two-dimensional you're not just someone
who enjoys messing with people's minds

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770
who enjoys messing with people's minds
 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.740
who enjoys messing with people's minds
there's more depth to it than that and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750
there's more depth to it than that and
 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.170
there's more depth to it than that and
and part of it is sometimes you just

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180
and part of it is sometimes you just
 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.879
and part of it is sometimes you just
Intuit that and then you have to dig

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889
Intuit that and then you have to dig
 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.140
Intuit that and then you have to dig
deeper to find out what that actually

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150
deeper to find out what that actually
 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.539
deeper to find out what that actually
means
