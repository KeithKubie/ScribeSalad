well if you think about it for a minute

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080
well if you think about it for a minute
 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.469
well if you think about it for a minute
you'd really begin to realize that for

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:06.479
you'd really begin to realize that for
 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:09.830
you'd really begin to realize that for
thousands of years women were really

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
thousands of years women were really
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.220
thousands of years women were really
economically dependent on man and that's

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
economically dependent on man and that's
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.409
economically dependent on man and that's
just the way it was I mean in fact if my

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:15.419
just the way it was I mean in fact if my
 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.420
just the way it was I mean in fact if my
grandmother or great grandmother were

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
grandmother or great grandmother were
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.430
grandmother or great grandmother were
alive today she just wouldn't even

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440
alive today she just wouldn't even
 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.620
alive today she just wouldn't even
believe the way the world works and the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
believe the way the world works and the
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.930
believe the way the world works and the
way women have really gained economic

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940
way women have really gained economic
 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.850
way women have really gained economic
power I think if you go back to the

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860
power I think if you go back to the
 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.750
power I think if you go back to the
1960s you begin to see the early signs

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760
1960s you begin to see the early signs
 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.359
1960s you begin to see the early signs
of that because baby boomer women were

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369
of that because baby boomer women were
 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.000
of that because baby boomer women were
the first generation in mass to get that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010
the first generation in mass to get that
 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.400
the first generation in mass to get that
education and education was really the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
education and education was really the
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.930
education and education was really the
key for women succeeding in the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
key for women succeeding in the
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.520
key for women succeeding in the
workplace not just entering the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
workplace not just entering the
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.410
workplace not just entering the
workplace but staying in the workplace

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
workplace but staying in the workplace
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.720
workplace but staying in the workplace
and getting really some pretty good

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
and getting really some pretty good
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.260
and getting really some pretty good
earning power back then very few women

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270
earning power back then very few women
 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.330
earning power back then very few women
prior to the baby boom generation had

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
prior to the baby boom generation had
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.910
prior to the baby boom generation had
that opportunity but this generation

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
that opportunity but this generation
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.950
that opportunity but this generation
went in there made it happen and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
went in there made it happen and
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.979
went in there made it happen and
education really has been sort of at the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
education really has been sort of at the
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.380
education really has been sort of at the
heart of what's allowed women to really

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
heart of what's allowed women to really
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.290
heart of what's allowed women to really
gain that economic power that is

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300
gain that economic power that is
 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.789
gain that economic power that is
transformed their role in society for

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799
transformed their role in society for
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.110
transformed their role in society for
now and well into the future

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120
 
 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.660
 
what's so interesting to me is that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
what's so interesting to me is that
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.480
what's so interesting to me is that
while women were gaining their education

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
while women were gaining their education
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820
while women were gaining their education
for the very first time in history we

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
for the very first time in history we
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.950
for the very first time in history we
saw our economy transform itself pretty

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
saw our economy transform itself pretty
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.870
saw our economy transform itself pretty
dramatically we went from an economy

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
dramatically we went from an economy
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.810
dramatically we went from an economy
that was in industrial manufacturing

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
that was in industrial manufacturing
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.540
that was in industrial manufacturing
based where brawn really defines your

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550
based where brawn really defines your
 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.910
based where brawn really defines your
role and gave you the power to really

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
role and gave you the power to really
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.250
role and gave you the power to really
earn income to a more knowledge-based

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260
earn income to a more knowledge-based
 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.500
earn income to a more knowledge-based
economy where the skill set was more

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510
economy where the skill set was more
 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.960
economy where the skill set was more
education based so women got that

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
education based so women got that
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.300
education based so women got that
education at exactly the right moment in

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
education at exactly the right moment in
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.580
education at exactly the right moment in
history that allowed them to really

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
history that allowed them to really
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.890
history that allowed them to really
succeed in the workplace today for the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900
succeed in the workplace today for the
 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.890
succeed in the workplace today for the
very first time we see a critical mass

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900
very first time we see a critical mass
 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.700
very first time we see a critical mass
of women entering the workforce with

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
of women entering the workforce with
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.250
of women entering the workforce with
that education and gaining earning power

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260
that education and gaining earning power
 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.640
that education and gaining earning power
in fact what's so incredible is that if

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650
in fact what's so incredible is that if
 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.410
in fact what's so incredible is that if
you were to look over the last 30 years

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
you were to look over the last 30 years
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.020
you were to look over the last 30 years
what you would notice is that men's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
what you would notice is that men's
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.210
what you would notice is that men's
income has remained rather flat if you

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220
income has remained rather flat if you
 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.460
income has remained rather flat if you
adjust for inflation whereas women's

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470
adjust for inflation whereas women's
 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.580
adjust for inflation whereas women's
income has grown exponentially now of

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
income has grown exponentially now of
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.200
income has grown exponentially now of
course some of that is just trying to

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210
course some of that is just trying to
 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.090
course some of that is just trying to
catch up and we're still not all the way

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100
catch up and we're still not all the way
 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.130
catch up and we're still not all the way
there there is still a lot of work to be

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
there there is still a lot of work to be
 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.060
there there is still a lot of work to be
done but women have gained incredible

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070
done but women have gained incredible
 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.040
done but women have gained incredible
incredible power economically and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050
incredible power economically and
 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.720
incredible power economically and
they're beginning to take that power and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
they're beginning to take that power and
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.330
they're beginning to take that power and
translate it into all kinds of

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
translate it into all kinds of
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.520
translate it into all kinds of
interesting ways of doing things

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
interesting ways of doing things
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.900
interesting ways of doing things
different than the way men have

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910
 
 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.360
 
what we begin to understand as we see

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
what we begin to understand as we see
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.850
what we begin to understand as we see
large numbers of women with earning

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860
large numbers of women with earning
 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.950
large numbers of women with earning
power is that women in fact do use their

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960
power is that women in fact do use their
 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.890
power is that women in fact do use their
money differently than men in fact it's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900
money differently than men in fact it's
 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.810
money differently than men in fact it's
been noted even in developing countries

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820
been noted even in developing countries
 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.780
been noted even in developing countries
that ninety percent of women take their

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790
that ninety percent of women take their
 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.910
that ninety percent of women take their
income and they reinvest it in their

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920
income and they reinvest it in their
 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.950
income and they reinvest it in their
families and their communities while in

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960
families and their communities while in
 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960
families and their communities while in
those same developing nations only about

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970
those same developing nations only about
 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.960
those same developing nations only about
thirty to seventy percent of men take

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970
thirty to seventy percent of men take
 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.240
thirty to seventy percent of men take
that money and reinvest it in families

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
that money and reinvest it in families
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.570
that money and reinvest it in families
and communities they have a tendency to

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580
and communities they have a tendency to
 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.780
and communities they have a tendency to
spend it on alcohol and tobacco so you

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790
spend it on alcohol and tobacco so you
 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.460
spend it on alcohol and tobacco so you
know it doesn't sound really great on

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470
know it doesn't sound really great on
 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.170
know it doesn't sound really great on
the surface but that's just really the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
the surface but that's just really the
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.780
the surface but that's just really the
truth in developing countries but even

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790
truth in developing countries but even
 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.570
truth in developing countries but even
in the United States what we notice is

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580
in the United States what we notice is
 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.520
in the United States what we notice is
that women have a tendency to spend

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
that women have a tendency to spend
 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.430
that women have a tendency to spend
their money more on their family more on

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440
their money more on their family more on
 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.640
their money more on their family more on
education on health and on things that

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
education on health and on things that
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.320
education on health and on things that
really make life for families a little

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330
really make life for families a little
 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.430
really make life for families a little
bit better that's good news
