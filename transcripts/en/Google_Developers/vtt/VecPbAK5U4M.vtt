Hi everyone, I'm Chris
Broadfoot.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.910
Welcome to this week's Google
Maps Developer Shortcut.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.700
I'm going to show you how to
get started with the Google

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.160
Maps Android API in under
five minutes.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.270
I've just released a project
called How I Map Android.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.960
It's on github.com/googlemaps.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.700
Go ahead and check out
the repository.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.840
Now you could take a fork of it
if you wanted, or you can

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.870
download the zip file
if that's easier.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.950
All of them's good.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.130
If I scroll down here, you can
see there's instructions in

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.580
more detail.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.190
But follow along with
this video.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.300
So if I go into the directory,
you can see that all the files

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.500
are checked out.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
Now you can use Eclipse,
IntelliJ, or Ant, they're all

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.190
fine and will work.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.440
First I'll show you
how to import the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.970
project into Eclipse.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.670
I'm going to use a brand new
workspace just to make sure

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.380
that everything's clean, and
we're going to go and import

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:59.150
that project there, and
run the hellomap.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:08.230
So File, Import, you want to
import an existing Android, go

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.450
and choose the directory, press
Open, make sure that

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.425
both of those check boxes are
clicked, press finish.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.665
I'm not sure what that is, but
I think it'll still work.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.120
If I close the perspective and
reopen the Java perspective,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.370
we'll see all of our files.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.780
Close that one.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.770
So the most important file
here, immediately, is the

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.020
Androidmanifest.xml.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.370
Now you're going to have to go
and add you API key down here,

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.726
I'll show you how to do
that in just a moment.

00:01:56.726 --> 00:02:00.285
I'll show you quickly how
to import into IntelliJ.

00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:03.180
On the home screen, press Open
Project, or you can go File,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.100
Open Project.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.350
Once again, navigate
to the project.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.600
Press choose.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.920
It's going to open up.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.890
Now the first thing you'll
have to do is to add the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.340
Android SDK to the project
definition.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.880
So you can do that by going
File, Project Structure, and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.690
choose your Android SDK here.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.310
Now, if you don't have them
there already, you can go New,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.750
Android SDK.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.390
Set that all up.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.750
It's very easy.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.650
Press OK.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.770
If I go into project, you can
see all the files here again.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.750
Androidmanifest.xml, it's
very important.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.300
Now to run the project, we're
going to have to go into Edit

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.300
Configurations.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.710
Press the plus sign, Android
application, choose the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.830
hellomap module.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.840
We want a USB device.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.590
You can't use an emulator to run
Android maps applications.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.915
Go ahead and press OK.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:04.240
I've forgotten the module,
the hellomap module.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.095
Press OK, make sure your phone
is plugged in and unlocked.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.140
Now head over to the Google
API's console.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.630
You'll have to create a new
project, enable the Android

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.190
API in there, the Android
maps API.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.850
Head over to API access, and
create a new Android key.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.770
There's instructions on how to
get your debug key store

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.630
certificate in here, and you'll
want to make sure

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.210
you're using the
com.example.hellomap package.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:37.560
Now go ahead and take your key,
put it into your Android

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.570
manifest, hit Run in Eclipse
or IntelliJ, Ant works just

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.690
fine as well.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.030
And you'll see a map
on your phone.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.560
That's it, enjoy your Android
maps development experience,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.810
and I'll see you next time.
