00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
&gt;&gt; I think the point is about India being
a superpower.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.480
I think it's [INAUDIBLE] about an objective,
and with what power

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.880
actually means.
Let's look at power first.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.531
I think if we were look at either India in
either the dimension of

00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:25.030
talent, in the dimension of power, it could
be many things to many

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.980
people.
To me, I think fundamentally, we are a very

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.080
tolerant country.
So intrinsically, we have the ability to do

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.930
what people wanted to do,
so I think tolerance, the underlying essence

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.230
of what we do and our
focus has been built around that.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.269
To me I think power stems from how we leverage
our inherent

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.170
capabilities to develop what we can actually
deliver as a nation.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.511
So power could mean, you know, how do we utilize
our talent pool in the

00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:53.530
country?
How to be energized and leverage the natural

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.800
resources that's in the
country to actually be far more productive,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.539
self-sufficient.
And the other dimension is the word super.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.859
I think super is an objective, again, is a
superlative in terms of what

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.230
we could do as a nation.
If you were to intrinsically leverage some

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.990
of the underlying sense of
what power denotes I think we'd be a far better

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.680
nation that what we are
today.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.850
You want to me to go ahead?
To go ahead?

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.100
It's my favorite topic or you want?

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah yeah go on.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.810
&gt;&gt; Go ahead?
Okay.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.159
The aspect of -- the essence of India also
lies with how other

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.120
countries and nations actually look at India
from their perspective.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.650
I think what people are been typically have
been doing is an inward,

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.630
awkward look in terms of saying, hey, this
is the India is the outside

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.350
environment, and it's time for the others
to look at us in terms of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.870
what we are capable of.
So today when we hear of, you know, leveraging

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.880
India's capabilities,
it's saying, hey, what do you [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.860
is thinking about India, and
what do some of the other nations are thinking

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.380
about India.
I think, it's time for India to say hey, this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.909
is what we stand for and
start leveraging some of those.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.000
To me, let's look at some of the dimensions
of what the basic limits of

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
natures are.
Let's look at water, [INAUDIBLE] and on to

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.660
say that to fight for the
world in the next, say, 15, 20 years it's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.610
going to be on water space.
Let's look at energy.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.440
[INAUDIBLE] what power is all about.
So if when we look at some of these dimensions

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.660
I think India has got
extreme capability in terms of what we could

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.090
do in this space to be
able to achieve what we would typically call

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.360
a superpower.
So I think it's in us.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.640
It's each one of us in terms of our ability
to believe in oneself and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.810
say hey I think we are, you know, a nation
which -- that is very proud

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.520
of what we do and what we're capable of doing.
So I think self-belief and believing in all

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.140
the objectives that come
our way, leveraging our internal capability

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.090
is probably the best way to
look at what we could do as a nation.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.091
Yeah?
