00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.033
- [Instructor] Let's
talk a little bit about

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:02.910
money and elections in the United States,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.430
and the various actors
that might be involved.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.440
You of course at the center of the action,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.980
you have the various
campaigns for the candidates.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.810
Then you have the party committees

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.910
that will try to influence the election,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.730
and we'll talk about how in a little bit.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.530
You have individuals who
besides being voters,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.280
can also be donors.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.410
And then you have organizations.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.490
It could be corporations,
it could be interest groups,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.160
it could be labor unions.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.080
And then last but not least,
we have these two boxes

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.400
where you see PAC 1 and PAC 2.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.620
The obvious question is, what is a PAC?

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.490
Well it stands for
political action committee,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.870
and they've been around for decades.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.440
A simple way to think about is
it's a way to pool resources

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.300
which then can be donated to other parties

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.080
to influence an election.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.650
But how can the money actually flow?

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.560
Well as you can see, it can flow in many,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.180
many, many different ways.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.350
And to help us understand this,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.090
I'm gonna introduce some terminology

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.690
that you might've heard before.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.650
There is hard money.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.560
Hard money is money that
is actually regulated

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.970
by the Federal Election Committee,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.020
and there are caps in terms of how much

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.330
people can donate to various parties.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.290
In general, any donation
to a candidate's campaign

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.150
is considered hard money.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.840
That would be hard money there
coming from the individuals.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.210
This would be hard money right over here

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.020
coming from that PAC which
has pooled a bunch of money.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.180
This would be hard money right over here

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.150
coming from that PAC to
Donald Trump's campaign.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.430
This would be hard money coming
from the Democratic party

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.910
to Hillary Clinton's campaign,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.300
or from the Republican party
to Donald Trump's campaign.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.730
If there's something called hard money,

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.280
perhaps there's also
something called soft money,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.020
and you would be correct.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.140
There is something called soft money.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.470
A simple definition for soft money is

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.750
it doesn't have the regulations
that hard money does.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.040
An example of it would be let's say

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.370
the Democratic party
here, some of the money

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.580
that they spend, so I'll just draw

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.730
some of the money they spend,
this part right over here.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.740
Maybe some of the money
that the Republican party

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.100
spends during the election, it's used for

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.010
what's sometimes known as
party building activities

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.350
to get more people to join their party,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.340
or to advertise about certain issues.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.800
As long as it's done not in coordination

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.460
with the candidate's campaigns,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.320
this is not going to have any limit.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.620
Some of the money that goes
from an individual to a party,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.840
or some of the money that
goes from a PAC to a party,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.970
can also be considered
soft money if once again,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.537
if it keeps separate
from coordinating with

00:02:43.537 --> 00:02:45.480
the candidate's actual campaign,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.760
and used for those party
building activities.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.100
Now party building is a
pretty broad definition.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.110
Soft money has been demonized a lot

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.700
because people say well, it's
just a way of getting around

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.520
campaign finance regulations.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.190
Because even though it might
not be directly coordinated

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.430
with a candidate's campaign,
it can influence an election

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.930
in a pretty significant way.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.840
Now to further understand this diagram,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.870
you see these dotted lines
between the corporations

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.840
or the labor unions and these
political action committees.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.550
What does that mean?

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.770
Well a political action
committee can be connected

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.090
or sponsored by a
corporation or a labor union,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.560
but it cannot receive funds
directly from the treasury

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.870
of that corporation or labor union.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.320
The corporation can
sponsor it, can say hey,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.650
this is associated with us.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.500
If it's say, a labor union,
it can go to its membership

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.940
and say hey, I want you
to donate to this PAC.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.380
If it's a corporation it can
go to its management team

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.730
and say hey, let's all donate
to this PAC personally.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.430
Or it could go to its
shareholders and say hey,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.000
why don't we all donate to this PAC?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.380
Because this PAC can donate money

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.940
to the party or the
candidate that might help

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.770
influence the election in a
way that might benefit us,

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.100
or benefit the corporation.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.980
Now an attempt to limit
soft money came in 2002,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.400
when you have the Bipartisan
Campaign Reform Act of 2002,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.650
often known as McCain-Feingold,

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.630
who are the two sponsors in the Senate.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.520
Among other things, it tried
to limit this soft money.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.809
After this Act, even this party spending

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:16.780
would have to be hard money.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.940
It would have to be subjected to the caps

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.700
when they are raising that money.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.590
It also made clear that
corporations and labor unions

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.260
couldn't participate in what's called

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.670
election nearing activities,

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.750
where they're spending money on say,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.300
issue-based ads with oftentimes,

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.430
the intent of influencing the election,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.450
especially in the run up to the election.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.590
This was made explicitly illegal as well.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.590
This gets challenged in 2010
where you have this major case,

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.200
Citizens United versus the
Federal Election Committee.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.080
Citizens United was an organization

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.780
that was releasing a movie
called Hillary the Movie

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.780
during the 2008 election.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.340
This was a movie that was pretty negative

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.822
on Hillary Clinton.

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:03.560
The argument of the
government was that hey,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.460
even though this looks like a movie,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.710
it's really political advertising.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.930
It's electioneering as we go
into the run up to an election,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.580
and so Citizens United, which
is a nonprofit corporation

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.820
should not be able to do this.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.420
But the Supreme Court ruled
in Citizens United's favor.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.460
They said, as long as
they are not coordinating

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.800
with the actual candidate's campaigns,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.880
they are allowed based on
the notion of free speech

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.200
to directly participate in electioneering

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.160
in the run up to an election.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.140
And to a large degree, the
Citizens United ruling from 2010

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.040
really gutted the strength of

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.690
the Bipartisan Campaign
Reform Act of 2002.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.560
That Act was trying to curtail soft money,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.880
that for the most part,
was going through parties.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.880
But now post-Citizens United,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.830
on both sides, folks started to say gee,

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.450
I could start an organization
that pools money.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.870
Let's call that a PAC.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.390
But I'm gonna keep it independent.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.310
It's not gonna coordinate in any other way

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.490
with the elections of the
individual candidates,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.360
and so this is often
referred to technically

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.093
as an independent expenditure PAC.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.677
Here, post-Citizens United,
I can get unlimited funding

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.180
from corporations, or from individuals

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.850
that is not regulated in
terms of spending caps.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.910
And now I can spend an
unlimited amount of money

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.125
on electioneering to try
to influence the campaign.

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:37.800
Because of the power of these types of

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.320
independent expenditure PACs,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.010
they have been termed Super PACs.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.320
Now the key difference between a Super PAC

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.120
and a regular PAC is that the regular PACs

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.500
that we talked about have limitations

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.470
in terms of how much money
people can donate to them.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.660
They actually even can't take direct money

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.700
from the treasuries of a
corporation or a labor union.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.630
They also had limitations in terms of

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.130
how much they could donate
to an individual campaign.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.040
But they could donate to a campaign.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.050
A Super PAC, on the other hand,

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.140
can take unlimited amounts
of funds from individuals,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.730
from other PACs, and it
could actually take money

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.290
from corporate treasuries themselves.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.010
As long as they are independent of

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.550
the candidates' campaigns, they
don't coordinate with them,

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.770
they can spend as much
money as they would like.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.890
So as always, it's really
interesting to think about

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.410
what is going to be the
eventual repercussions

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.750
of Citizens United versus FEC?

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.030
We've already seen in the 2016 elections

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.420
money approaching a billion dollars

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.780
in terms of Super PAC money.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.410
What is the influence
it has on the democracy?

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.380
But a lot of folks might
immediately demonize the Super PAC

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.350
and said say, money
was already in politics

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.020
and this is just making it worse.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.210
Where now you have corporations
that are essentially

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.120
being able to directly contribute
large amounts of money.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.690
We've always had issues
with foreign nationals

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.060
contributing to our elections.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.880
We've always tried to prevent that.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.970
But a corporation can have
ownership from around the world

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.410
even if it's a United
States-based corporation.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.050
How do you prevent foreign
interest from showing up

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.500
through this money?

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.370
But on the other hand,
I encourage you to read

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.240
the Supreme Court's rulings

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.720
because they had some
very strong arguments

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.780
in terms of a slippery slope.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.600
If you don't allow Citizens
United to publish a movie,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.290
saying that it's electioneering,

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.250
at what point what is something
a political organization,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.690
or a media organization?

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.800
And the Supreme Court
found it very difficult

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.550
to regulate Citizens
United without going down

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.220
a slippery slope where
they would have to regulate

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.940
a whole set of corporations and media.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.410
I'll let you think about it,

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.763
