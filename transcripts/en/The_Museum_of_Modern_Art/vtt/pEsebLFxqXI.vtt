00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:02.127
(music)

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.247
- [Jodi Hauptman] Leopold
Survage created this series

00:00:05.247 --> 00:00:07.040
called Colored Rhythm.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.584
He had this idea about
making abstract film,

00:00:09.584 --> 00:00:12.254
this idea that Survage himself said

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:14.757
to throw off paintings last shackle,

00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:18.302
and that is immobility,
making painting move.

00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:20.470
And part of that was related to

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.764
other kinds of movement happening in the

00:00:22.764 --> 00:00:24.850
ever growing cities at that moment.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.227
The invention of the automobile,

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:30.480
the airplane, the incredible
spectacle of the city,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.483
the lights, and even the
beginnings of cinema,

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:37.112
which first began in 1893, so when Survage

00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:38.613
is thinking about making his film,

00:00:38.613 --> 00:00:40.532
it's only about 20 years in.

00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:42.117
He turned to the thing he knew best,

00:00:42.117 --> 00:00:43.493
and that was drawing.

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:46.497
He chose a very smooth paper.

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:49.082
there was no resistance
from bumps or bulges.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.959
He started with a black ink.

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:55.338
He created a shape around
the edges of the picture

00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:57.883
and then he filled it in with these

00:00:57.883 --> 00:01:00.010
very beautiful washes of watercolor.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.179
Ink is not water soluble.

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.181
And then when he went back
in with the water color,

00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:05.599
it would stay in place.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:06.725
And that allowed him to create

00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:09.603
these beautiful washes one after another.

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.522
He captured one of the
primary qualities of cinema,

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:13.732
and that is light.

00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:16.276
They have a kind of glow, a luminosity

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.779
that is not dissimilar from what you see

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.572
when you're sitting in a movie theater.

00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:23.950
When you lay out the series, you see how

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.662
one shape feeds into another
shape into another shape.

00:01:27.662 --> 00:01:29.080
Some of the critics at the time

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.209
who knew these drawings,
talked about the relationship

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:35.003
to something organic, to plants,

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.798
things that swell and grow and deflate

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:39.341
and grow again.

00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:42.511
He made over 100 drawings with the idea

00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:46.015
that eventually technicians
would actually animate them.

00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:47.974
He understood that he
himself couldn't do it,

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.601
but unfortunately, because of the

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:53.396
onset of World War 1, the
film was never actually made.

00:01:53.396 --> 00:01:54.898
He was trained as a painter,

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:57.359
a very traditional
painter, but his ability to

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.528
think outside of that training

00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:02.447
and to imagine something
that he didn't have any idea

00:02:02.447 --> 00:02:07.327
of how to make is just an
incredible act of risk,

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:10.038
that I think is crucial for this moment.

00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:12.040
The best artists are those that were

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.843
able to take risks.
