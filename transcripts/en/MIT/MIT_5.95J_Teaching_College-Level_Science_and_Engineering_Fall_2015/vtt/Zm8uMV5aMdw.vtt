I'm Janet Rankin.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.790
I'm the Interim Director of
the Teaching and Learning Lab

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.020
here at MIT.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.760
And for the past four years,
I've been teaching 595J.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.060
It has a lot of other numbers,
but it's Teaching College-Level

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.980
Science and Engineering.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.630
Well, before I
came to MIT, I was

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.490
on the faculty at
Brown University,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.040
and I taught in the
engineering department there.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.470
And it was very
interesting to me

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.700
how you could either do a really
good job teaching, or not so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.230
good a job teaching.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.550
So I started to get interested
in some of the theory

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.510
and some of the best
practices associated

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.000
with teaching specifically
to engineering,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.370
but teaching in general.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.640
And I worked in the
Teaching and Learning Center

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.170
at Brown for a while.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.850
And so when there
was the opportunity

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.210
to come here and work at MIT in
the Teaching and Learning Lab,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.940
I thought it would be great--
a great opportunity to come

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.850
and work with other scientists
and engineers who are also

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.360
interested in improving
teaching, or using

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.950
research-based best
practices in teaching.
