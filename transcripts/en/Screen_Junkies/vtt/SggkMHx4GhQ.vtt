Only one of these nine films will win the coveted title of best picture

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.480
unless the guy in charge of the result screws up because he was on his phone backstage

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.860
And they accidentally give it to someone else.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.040
There's a mistake. This is not a joke. Moonlight has won best picture.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.800
Best Oscars ever!

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.220

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.640
You've seen Dunkirk's breathless portrayal of heroism in the face of death;

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.620
Now prepare for a movie about all the talking that was going on at the same time

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.620
Would you stop interrupting me while I am interrupting you!

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.220

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.440
In a fat suit!

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.860
Hey, I'll take wearing a fat suit to win an Oscar over eating a bison liver

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.280
or something really bad like being Casey Affleck

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.880
Grumpy Old Man.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.200

comes a love story between a woman and the fish prisoner in her lab

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.120
... which sounds creepy when you strip the art away from it, but trust me: in the context of the story

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.480
you will totally be okay with this woman having sex with a fish man.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.520
It's actually a really beautiful story about finding your voice and-

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.849
oh man. This is gonna be known as the fish banging movie. Isn't it?

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:35.920
The FISH BANGING MOVIE

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.440

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.640
Comes a touching romance between this grown man, and this seventeen-year-old

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.800
Which also sounds creepy when you strip the art away from it.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.020
In this film full of lush

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.560
cinematography, moving performances and

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.000
groundbreaking visual effects that removed Armie Hammer's balls from his short shorts

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.240
critics are saying it's visually stunning

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.320
transcendent, and one of the most mesmerizing films of the year

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.000

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.100

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.899
ADVERTISING.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.720
In a film with such powerful performances

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.040
you'll stop referring to Sam Rockwell as "that guy"

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.440
and start referring to him as...

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.236
"That guy! You know, from Three Billboards?"

00:02:32.236 --> 00:02:34.236

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.300

The Last of The Mohicans guy.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.240

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.620
...so, Daniel Day-Lewis?

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.880

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.920
boyfriends and family you'll almost forgive her for defending Crash by the Dave Matthews Band.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.920
I fucking hate this song. I love it.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.260

In a film so calculated to win Oscars

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.149
