Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And that's the
view from outside my apartment,

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.570
which I won't be going out in because a
hurricane is coming.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.139
But don't worry, there are plenty of
things to do online now guys.

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.860
To learn about yourself, MisterStopert
suggests what happened

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.239
my birth year. It unravels slowly and
gives some fun

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.439
perspective.
But Sporcle is the Olympics of

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.470
geekiness. Some of its games are easy, like Guess the Font and some are amazingly difficult.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.610
For the past few weeks I've been memorizing

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.130
national flags and on Sporcle
you have to know the flag

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.040
and spell the country right. Even more
geographic is this US drag-and-drop.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.620
Grab a state and place it in its correct
location. The game averages how many

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.230
miles

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.790
you're off.
If you like being tested and you like Tetris,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.250
you can play Statetris. They've got all
kinds of maps, where the countries fall like

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.310
Tetris pieces

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.710
you have to manipulate and properly place.
If you're already a geo wizz, try

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.710
Which Is It's Dog Breed Trivia game.
But why look at shapes,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.970
when you could just type? Z-Type is an awesome
game where you have to type the enemy's

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.180
word. Each correct letter is a shot.
Of course,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.510
it's more fun to prove you're a human.
Captcha invaders sends ships to attack

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.270
your city

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.360
and your only defense is filling out the captions.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.400
If you'd rather avoid facts and have
pretty colors, Bioniccommando1000

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.040
sent me

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.690
RetroShoot. You steer with the mouse,
never stop firing

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.080
and it feels so good when you let off a bomb.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.240
He also recommended Monito. Your cursor
is attached to a ball with a springy

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.860
string,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.070
so watch that its momentum doesn't throw
it into danger.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.229
But if you'd rather cut stuff, play Splitter,
where clever slicing

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.549
gets you results.
Tomdemey sent me

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.560
Gravity Guy. Your character constantly
runs and it's up to you

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.200
to reverse and re-reverse gravity at just
the right time to keep his path smooth.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.860
For more constant change, MissBabygirl3601
sent over Four Second Frenzy,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.250
a barrage of games where you only have four
seconds to complete

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.860
each one using only the arrow keys and
the spacebar. When you're done playing

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.920
games, here are some things you can do on
YouTube now guys.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.209
Yesterday Jake showed me these awesome
videos of the world

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.900
where a guys integrates his hands like 
he's playing with people and cars

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.529
as if they're his toys. Also interesting
is this video about a structure

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.569
built by artist Wim Delvoye.
It's a machine containing

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.540
enzymes, bacteria, grinders, pumps.
You put real food

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.919
in one end and out the other -
I'm not kidding - comes actual,

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.760
synthetically made, poop.
Have a good weekend.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.640
And as always,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.980
thanks for watching.
