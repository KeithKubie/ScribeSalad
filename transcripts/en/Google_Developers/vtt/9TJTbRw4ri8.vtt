00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.430
SPEAKER: 86% of
app ideas are born

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.740
from a developer's
personal pain.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.650
These ideas are for
apps nobody needs.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.060
Developers believe research
with users is a waste of time.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.580
They perceive their app
as a coding exercise.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.780
To validate their idea, they ask
their sister if she likes it.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.807
She says yes.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.350
TOMER SHARON: Meet
Will and Dana.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.130
Will and Dana are the
co-founders of Noteo,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.730
a note-taking app nobody needs.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.830
Dana is 26 years old.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.270
She's an MIT Computer Science
graduate, she's a Trekkie,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.950
and she has been coding since
she was eight years old.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.380
Will is 25 years old.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.160
He's a Stanford Computer
Science graduate,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.220
and he loves Star
Wars and LEGOs.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.410
They met over a
weekend hack-a-thon

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.240
here in San Francisco
about a year ago,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.520
and they liked each
other's way of thinking.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.540
So about six months
ago, they started Noteo,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.775
and they've been
working on it since.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.715
Will and Dana are failing.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.880
They're crashing,
they're burning,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.510
and they're sinking
$200,000 of seed money

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.310
that they got, without even
knowing what went wrong.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.090
I'm here to help you
avoid their mistakes.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.430
I'm here to help you
execute the right plan.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.420
Hi, my name is Tomer Sharon.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.260
I'm a Google Search User
Experience Researcher,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.020
and I have been studying
dozens of thousands

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.470
of users, of people.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.750
Learning about what they
need, what they want,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.449
and how they use apps
and other products.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.590
I've been helping Google Search
and startup teams come up

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.955
with products that
meet human needs.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.850
Going back to Will and Dana.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.930
They have six big, big problems.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.670
Their number one is they did
not fall in love with a problem.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.920
They rushed into
launching a landing page

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.510
for a product they
weren't sure of.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.430
They had personal pains
related to note-taking,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.590
and they were sure that this
is something people needed.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.416
Just to be very sure, they
launched this landing page.

00:02:55.416 --> 00:03:04.010
And I did put an arrow here, but
I'm going to use my lightsaber.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.160
They launched this landing page.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.840
And they collected
people's email addresses,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.770
trying to figure out
if they're interested,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.070
therefore if the app is needed.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.140
But the only question that
they were able to answer

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.030
is the one that
you see down there.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.730
Are people interested
enough to give them

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.450
their email addresses?

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.730
They were never getting
or gathering information

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.990
about what users need.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.060
Their number two problem is
that they learned from friends.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.700
They interviewed seven
friends and family members.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.220
Now family members
and friends are always

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.070
happy to give you feedback.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.150
The problem is that
they're biased.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.970
How can they hurt your feelings?

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.040
They're your friends.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.440
They're your family.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.690
Of course they like your idea.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.910
Sure, they'll use it.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.560
No doubt they'll pay for it.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.150
A lot.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.450
Third problem.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.790
They listened to users.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.860
Now I know coming from a
User Experience Researcher,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.900
it sounds kind of weird,
but bear with me here.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.530
The first rule of research
is don't listen to users.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.000
Instead, observe their behavior.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.870
When Will and Dana asked
their friends and family,

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.870
would you use this app,
would you pay for it,

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.000
how much you pay for it,
they got really good answers.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.780
People liked it.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.700
But they forgot--
or didn't know,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.110
or ignored-- what
social psychologists

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.440
know for almost 100 years now.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.470
We humans are very, very bad
at predicting our own behavior.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.560
Here are two studies that
were done during that time.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.590
This is a study from 1937.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.860
The researchers
went into classrooms

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.320
and asked students-- they
passed along a questionnaire--

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.750
and they asked students,
would you cheat in an exam?

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.440
And the students answered.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.010
A few weeks after that, they
came back to these classes,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.710
to these students, and
together with the teachers,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.340
they were giving an
opportunity for the students

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.900
to cheat without them knowing.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.170
And surprise,
surprise, there was

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.590
close to zero correlation
between what people said

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.170
about their behavior and
what they actually did.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.600
1937.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.550
Now Will is kind of
sarcastic about studies

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.000
from 77 years ago, so
here's a study from 2012.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.880
This was done in the UK with
dozens of thousands of people.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.400
The researchers went into public
bathrooms in gas stations.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.990
And they asked people
coming out of the bathrooms,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.450
did you wash your hands after
you finished your business?

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.360
99% percent of people
said of course, yes.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.310
But the researchers, they
installed electronic recording

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.240
devices on the faucets
in the bathrooms.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.400
And they actually knew
exactly how many people

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.070
did wash their hands.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:44.710
So 32% of men and 64% of women
actually did wash their hands.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.420
There's a very, very big
difference-- very big

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.920
difference-- between what we say
we do and what we actually do.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.010
There are many reasons for that.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.840
Some people would say,
they're just liars.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.040
They're not.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.470
We are having trouble
predicting our behavior.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.840
There are many reasons for that.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.600
When Will and Dana ask
their friends and family,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.830
or anyone else, would
you use our app?

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.370
They're asking them
to predict the future.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.210
Again, we humans
are very bad at it.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.250
Their fourth
problem is that they

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.920
didn't test the
riskiest assumption.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.490
Every product or
idea comes with a set

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.860
of assumptions or beliefs.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.080
The riskiest assumption is the
one that is core to the idea.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.470
And it's also unknown.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.555
Or, the riskiest assumption,
if that's not true--

00:07:46.555 --> 00:07:49.080
if the riskiest
assumption is not true--

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.010
the whole idea falls apart.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.370
What they could have
done, Will and Dana, is--

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.300
and this is just
an example-- they

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.680
could have assumed
that this is risky.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.520
Smartphone owners are aware of
their ineffective note-taking

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.340
habits.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.940
If this is not true, they have
no reason to develop Noteo.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.760
They didn't do anything
to validate or invalidate

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.815
this riskiest assumption.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.970
Their fifth problem
is what I call,

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.740
that they're having a Bob
the Builder mentality.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.390
They rushed into
developing a product.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.270
This is what they know best.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.290
This is what they
know how to do.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.830
They rushed to
developing a product,

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.840
and they launched a
minimum viable product

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.740
without even knowing what for.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.030
They kept asking themselves, can
we build this note-taking app,

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.780
instead of asking
if they should.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.120
In their mind, this
was a coding exercise.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.430
And a coding exercise
doesn't require any insights

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.140
from users.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.730
And their last problem is
that they were perfectly

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.510
executing the wrong plan.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.640
They developed a beautiful
app nobody needs.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.546
They could have validated
or invalidated three things.

00:09:19.546 --> 00:09:20.045
The problem.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.670
Is there a problem,
a note-taking problem

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.250
in this world that
people care about?

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.710
They could have
validated the market.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.070
Are there enough people who
have this problem and care

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.860
about this problem?

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.060
And later on, they could
have validated their product.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:46.440
Is our product solving this
problem for this market?

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.945
And I give credit
to Laura Klein,

00:09:47.945 --> 00:09:48.986
who's sitting right here.

00:09:48.986 --> 00:09:49.810
Thanks for that.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.750
They are doing a few
things very well.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.980
I want to mention
two of these things.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:05.670
So in the past year, I
interviewed 150 app developers

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.260
and startup founders.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.140
And I wanted to know what are
the questions that they ask

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.840
themselves about their
users, or potential users.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.930
And the good thing
that I found was

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.660
that they ask the
right questions.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.020
These are some of the results.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.750
I'm just going to
go over a couple.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.990
97% of them ask, who
are my customers?

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.820
95% ask, do people
need my product?

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.240
Probably the most
important question to ask.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.840
89% ask if the
product is usable.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.320
These are very good and
important questions to ask.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.580
The second thing that
is going well for them

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.370
is that they
understand priorities.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.370
They understand what
are the questions, what

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.410
are the most important
questions they need to ask.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.150
And they know when to
ask these questions.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.240
I'm completely ignoring
the invalid, unreliable way

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.930
they answered those questions.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.190
But just having
the right questions

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.160
and knowing when to ask them
is a very, very positive thing.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.830
So up until now, I talked
about their six problems

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.590
and a couple of good
things for them.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:27.090
What I want to do next
is suggest a solution.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:32.240
Suggest a way to
execute the right plan.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.640
So say hello to
lean user research.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.950
Lean user research
is a discipline

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.340
that is providing
insights into product

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.180
users, their perspectives, and
abilities to the right people

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.220
at the right time.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:54.660
Excellent lean user
research is of high quality.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.400
It's not crappy research.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.170
It's impactful, meaning
it's not just interesting,

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.000
but you actually have
something to do with it.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.350
And it's fast, because nobody
wants to wait for research.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.920
Next, I'm going to introduce
you to three lean user research

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.140
techniques.

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.780
The first one is called
experience sampling,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:23.080
the second is observation,
and the third is fake doors.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.950
Let's start with
experience sampling.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.600
During an experience
sampling study,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.880
research participants are
interrupted several times a day

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.750
to note their
experience in real time.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:44.640
This is a very unique way
of mining their reality.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.690
Experience sampling is coming
from a research technique

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.870
that was called pager studies.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.370
This was developed in the 1950s.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.450
Back then, researchers
handed pagers

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:00.580
to their research subjects
and asked them a question

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.370
several times a day.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.050
For example, how do you feel?

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.890
Where are you?

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.610
And things like that.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.450
Or what do you do?

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:17.640
And they collected
these responses

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.410
and understood the lives
of their users, or research

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.660
subjects.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:30.400
The key in experience sampling
is asking the same question

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.930
over and over again.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:37.230
So for example, if you want
to know-- if you ask people,

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:42.510
what annoyed you in the
last couple of hours?

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.430
Imagine you asked that
question five times a day,

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:51.420
for five days, and you have
100 research participants.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:56.920
Quick math, you collect
2,500 data points.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.120
This is a huge, huge,
insightful, useful body

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.040
of knowledge.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.580
I want you to try it out.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.640
If you sit nearby the screen,
you can use the QR code.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.910
If not, access
this URL right now.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.830
Yes, do it right now.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:19.760
And even if you watch at
home, you can do that.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.110
And you have an experience
sampling question there.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.425
A sample question
related to Noteo.

00:14:26.425 --> 00:14:29.210
It works!

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.160
Answer the question, and
we'll go over your answers

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.800
in a minute.

00:14:37.228 --> 00:14:39.280
And I'm going to play
with my lightsaber.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.620
Don't futz with it too much.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.050
The URL is working too.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.690
All right, I'm moving on.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.630
So imagine you are asked that
question five times a day,

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.750
for five days.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.570
You're not always going
to have an answer,

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.580
but you will in many cases.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.340
Let's go over sample responses.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:24.540
So here we have 31
responses to this question.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:30.070
If you look at it-- just eyeball
what you see here-- very,

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.550
very quickly you can
understand that there

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:37.430
are several groups of
things you can learn here.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.920
Let me color them for you.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:45.970
Some people are
writing down lists.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:50.550
Others are writing down ideas.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.140
And others are just
sketching stuff.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.120
That's from a few
seconds of looking at it.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.830
Imagine 2,000 of these and
what you can learn from that.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.490
One of the most important
things in experience sampling

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.750
is the question that you
ask, phrasing it right.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:16.320
A great experience
sampling question

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.950
asks about repeated behavior.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.290
Something that happens
a lot during a day,

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.890
or during the study period.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.590
I'm going to give
examples in a minute.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.720
A bad experience
sampling question

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.420
is asking either
yes/no questions.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.440
Yes/no would give you
nothing about user needs.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.890
It would give you 2,500
responses of yes or no.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.690
You're not going to
learn much from that.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:55.460
A bad question also
can ask about numbers.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.739
Again, same thing.

00:16:56.739 --> 00:16:58.280
You're going to get
a lot of numbers,

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.590
you're going to
average them, it's not

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.109
going to tell you much
about what people need.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:08.960
And a bad question also
asks about opinion.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.819
If you ask me eight times
a day about my opinion

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:15.160
about something, it's
not going to change much.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:15.680
All right?

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.410
Ask about repeated behaviors.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.640
Two examples.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.250
A good example.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:25.859
What was the reason you
recently updated your website?

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:31.130
Repeated behavior, no data, no
numerical data, not yes or no,

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.420
and it's not about an opinion.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.510
It's about behavior.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:35.960
A bad example.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:41.270
How many emails did you
receive in the past hour?

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.630
Some people would say
0, 3, 17, 52, 200.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.990
Again, there's not
a lot you can learn

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.570
from that about user needs.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.290
So to sum it up,
experience sampling

00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:00.160
helps you identify needs.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.910
It identifies
features that might

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.160
be helpful for your audience.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.549
And it tells you a lot
about current pain points

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:11.090
and delights.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.180
So this was experience sampling.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.640
I'm moving on to observation.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.510
This is the second lean
user research technique

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.110
I want to introduce you to.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.720
In observation,
you are gathering

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:34.050
data at the user's or
the person's environment.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.900
They don't have to be users yet.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.230
This is the science
of contextualization.

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:45.250
There are four pillars
to observation.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.490
The first one, pretty
obvious, is observing.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:55.840
Watching people as they go
along with their daily lives,

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.240
at home, work, the
street, the bus station,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.870
the train, wherever
is relevant, based

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.770
on what you want to learn.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.830
The second pillar is listening.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.900
Listening to the jargon
people use, their language,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.260
and witnessing conversations
they have with one another.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.700
Third, noticing.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.740
There are several
behaviors, or things

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.960
that happen, that you
can observe and identify

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.340
that would tell you a lot
about what people need.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.870
And gathering.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.900
You collect artifacts.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.750
Artifacts are things
people either use

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.240
or create to
complete their tasks.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:47.720
So for example, if you're
observing a person at work,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.870
and a work related
task is coming in,

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.890
and the person is noting
that task in a spreadsheet

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:59.520
they created, that's a
spreadsheet you need to gather.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.680
I talked about
noticing behaviors.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.730
I want to go over
several such behaviors.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.520
Paying attention
to these behaviors

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.092
is really, really hard.

00:20:14.092 --> 00:20:15.550
I don't know if
you're aware of it,

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.020
but when you observe
people, there

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.970
are tons of things
you can learn.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.560
It's critical to know
what to look for.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.600
So here are just
five behaviors that

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.860
are important to
pay attention to.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:36.200
The first one is routines,
regular actions people

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.820
are doing.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.400
The task example I just
gave, with the spreadsheet,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.120
this is a routine.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.100
Interruptions.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.180
When something happens and it
stops a person-- the person

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:54.860
you're watching-- stops
them from completing a task.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.110
Breaking its
continuity in some way,

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:01.000
either because of the
person himself or herself,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.270
or because of someone
else, can teach you a lot.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.210
Life is never clean
of interruptions.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.420
If a phone call is
coming in, the person

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:15.610
is in a meeting, looks at
the phone, takes the call.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.190
As an observer,
your intuition would

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.670
be to ignore that
because you didn't

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.950
want to learn about meetings.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.110
But what happens during
that conversation

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.850
is extremely important
to learn from.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.630
It has a direct
relationship to what

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.280
you want to learn
about the meeting.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.370
Annoyances.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.820
Annoyances are just
obstacles to complete a task.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.750
They're not going to prevent
people from completing a task,

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.640
but they would make them angry.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.230
They would make them
overwhelmed, frustrated,

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.720
and things like that.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.220
Delights.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:57.830
A lot of people
think that research

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:03.310
is there to identify problems,
challenges, pain points.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.380
That's partially true.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.910
Learning about what
people love, learning

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.910
about what people
enjoy, is extremely

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.350
helpful in understanding
what they need.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:19.230
And the last behavior to pay
attention to is transitions.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:24.900
This is what happens when the
thing you're observing is done,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.380
or on the way to something else.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.830
I'll give an example, because
it better explains it.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.200
Let's say, again, you're
interested in meetings

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.950
and you're observing a
person during a work day.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.240
And they have a meeting.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.750
The meeting has
ended, and now they're

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.690
walking 200 feet to
the next meeting.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:48.540
Your intuition would be to
take a break, a mental break.

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:51.460
Drink water, check
your email, not

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.320
pay attention to
what's happening.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.790
But that person might
open their laptop

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:01.070
and walk to that
meeting doing something.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.240
This is a very, very
good signal for a need.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.100
So pay attention to
these transitions.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.220
Instead of just talking
about observation,

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.380
let's watch 90 seconds of
an observation session.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.650
What I want you to do is this.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:23.720
Imagine that Stop &amp; Shop, a
grocery shopping retailer,

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.190
came to you and asked you
to answer this question.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:33.469
How can we improve the in-store
grocery shopping experience

00:23:33.469 --> 00:23:34.135
with technology?

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:40.930
Try and list, or think
about, three things

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.970
that she really,
really cares about.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.210
Let's watch.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.106
WOMAN SPEAKER: And
another thing that I do

00:23:49.106 --> 00:23:52.900
is, if something is
really a good price--

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.690
if something's on sale and
it's for a really good deal--

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:58.840
and it's not perishable, or
that it has an expiration

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.220
date that's farther
along, I'll buy a bunch.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.470
Like, I literally--
if I know my kids love

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:07.060
it-- and I know that
it's an amazing price-- I

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.530
buy like 10 of something.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.284
For example, the other day I
bought Haagen-Dazs ice cream.

00:24:11.284 --> 00:24:12.450
I see that it's on sale now.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:12.776
I'm biased.

00:24:12.776 --> 00:24:14.900
Haagen-Dazs is just really
good quality ice cream,

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.310
and there's a lot of flavors,
and my kids love ice cream.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.760
So to me, sometimes
quality is important,

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.720
even though you're
paying a little bit more.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.690
So I bought the Haagen-Dazs
ice cream at a good price

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.600
because then you save-- two for
$7.00-- you save $0.99 each.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.450
So you're actually saving
$2.00 when you're paying $7.00

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.420
for two.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.220
So I loaded up my cart.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.310
You know, Haagen-Dazs
doesn't do a bigger size,

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.323
so of course you're paying more.

00:24:42.323 --> 00:24:43.739
MALE SPEAKER: How
do you know this

00:24:43.739 --> 00:24:46.442
is a good price compared
to other places?

00:24:46.442 --> 00:24:47.650
WOMAN SPEAKER: Good question.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.710
Just because, in my
experience, I've seen

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:54.010
Haagen-Dazs being sold, and
it's usually the full price

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.240
that it says that it is.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.208
It's at least $4.50.

00:24:57.208 --> 00:24:59.680
For example, King's, the high
end market down the street,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.170
everything's more expensive
in here, baseline.

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.530
So one time, my husband
liked the Greek yogurt,

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:08.160
and I wanted to buy him
the Greek yogurt when

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.345
I was at King's, and
they had a little sale.

00:25:10.345 --> 00:25:14.070
And I was so happy, and I
bought a bunch, and I came home.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.875
And when I came
here to Stop &amp; Shop

00:25:15.875 --> 00:25:17.290
and I looked at
the Greek yogurt,

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:22.680
it was cheaper baseline
than it was at--

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.040
TOMER SHARON: At King's.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.740
All right.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.230
So, in 90 seconds,
these are three insights

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:31.290
you could have learned.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:34.160
She cares about
saving money, she

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.840
cares about the quality
of the food she's buying,

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.610
and she cares about
her kids' health.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:45.520
Imagine what you could have
learned during a longer

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.250
session with several people.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.320
All right?

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.880
Observation is really good
for identifying features

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.100
your users or
potential users need,

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:03.530
for validating or invalidating
assumptions about your users,

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:09.950
and learning more about their
problems, workflows, and goals.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.490
So this was observation.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.770
The third, and last, lean
user research technique

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.000
I want to go over is called fake
doors, or as I like to call it,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.960
fake it till you make it.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.710
And fake doors-- and
I'm using, again,

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:28.810
Will and Dana's
landing page-- you

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.950
are pretending you
have something.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.720
They did that in their
other landing page,

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.680
where they tried to
collect email addresses.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:44.850
The difference here
is this button.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.290
Instead of collecting
email addresses,

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:51.781
they are trying to
understand the commitment.

00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:53.280
They're trying to
prove that there's

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.400
a commitment to
using the product.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.310
They're asking people to buy a
product that doesn't exist yet.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.430
If people do that,
that's a very good signal

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.730
that there's a need here.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:12.780
A version of that is called
the button to nowhere.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.665
The button to nowhere is
exactly what it sounds like.

00:27:16.665 --> 00:27:19.140
I'm going back to this page.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.420
Imagine that Will and Dana
thought about they had an idea.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:28.080
Let's develop a TV
app for note-taking.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.900
Now without writing-- well,
maybe not one line of code,

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:37.400
because adding this button
right there would take

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.630
a line of code-- but without
writing a lot of code,

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:45.130
without developing the app, they
can learn a lot about needs.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:51.350
What they need to do is
measure, or look at the ratio,

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:55.340
between how many people
clicked the button divided

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:59.110
by how many people are
exposed to this page.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.700
If they decide in
advance on a threshold,

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.820
that if crossed that would
make them develop the app,

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.400
they have a very powerful
decision making tool at hand.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:17.130
And they didn't need to develop
anything else, rather than

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.505
this.

00:28:19.505 --> 00:28:21.130
They don't need to
develop the product.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:28.330
This technique is also
called 404 testing,

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:29.355
for obvious reasons.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.470
And it's extremely helpful
in learning about needs

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:43.140
without risking time, money, and
effort you can never get back

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.750
if you develop
the wrong product.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:48.950
So lean user research technique.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:52.200
I talked about experience
sampling, observation,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.850
and fake doors.

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.140
And lean user research
is a discipline

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.010
that is providing
insights into products

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:02.910
users, their perspectives, and
abilities to the right people

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:03.840
at the right time.

00:29:09.329 --> 00:29:10.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:15.320
Funny, but when you talk about
apps, it's not funny anymore.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:20.070
Ignore lean user research,
and your app's destiny

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.010
will be very similar to
the destiny of helicopters

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.410
in movies.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:29.210
Many developers think
that they don't have time

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.380
to waste on learning from users.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.270
If there's one thing,
only one thing,

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.830
I want you to take
away from this talk,

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:43.040
is that you don't have time
to develop the wrong app.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:47.360
Don't perfectly
execute the wrong plan.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.670
Execute the right plan.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.650
Thank you.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:56.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:01.870
A couple of things.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:06.062
Feedback on this talk
would be extremely helpful.

00:30:06.062 --> 00:30:07.770
And I want to thank
all these good people

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:11.920
for serving as the photographer,
logo designer, models,

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.710
and so on and so forth.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.170
If you have any questions,
please come to the mics here,

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:18.680
and I'll be happy to answer.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.660
We have enough time.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.660
Or you can come to me.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.590
Yeah, go ahead.

00:30:33.737 --> 00:30:35.070
AUDIENCE MEMBER 1: I've got two.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.230
So, suppose our
team's getting bigger.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.340
Same customer base.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.340
Could be like we're working
on exposure touch point A,

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.420
and the other team's working
on touch point B. Is there

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.540
strategies or
approaching for sharing

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.620
findings and results of user
researches to other team

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.779
members?

00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:53.570
And then, probably the
second one, that is,

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:57.170
do findings and
research results expire?

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:00.500
TOMER SHARON: Sharing
is key to success.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.290
I mean, I don't
see why you don't

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.230
share your findings
with other teams.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.280
Are you competing?

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.320
Are the teams competing?

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:07.665
AUDIENCE MEMBER 1: No, no, no.

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:08.740
The question is how.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.267
TOMER SHARON: How to share?

00:31:10.267 --> 00:31:11.267
AUDIENCE MEMBER 1: Yeah.

00:31:11.267 --> 00:31:14.243
Well, I mean-- So I actually
have to hand someone raw data.

00:31:14.243 --> 00:31:15.902
That's part of the
[? parser, ?] where

00:31:15.902 --> 00:31:17.880
I can make [INAUDIBLE]
for them to gain

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.350
meaningful insights [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.725
TOMER SHARON: OK,
so the question

00:31:20.725 --> 00:31:23.166
is asking about what to share.

00:31:23.166 --> 00:31:25.300
All right.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.510
I'm against reports, so I'm
not for writing reports.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:33.530
But do do the analysis and
share what you learned from it.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:37.070
You don't need to
drop raw data on them.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.039
What was the other question?

00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:40.830
AUDIENCE MEMBER 1: Do
findings ever expire?

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.760
TOMER SHARON: Do
findings ever expire?

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.890
Sometimes if you
change the design,

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:51.060
if you change the product,
some findings might expire.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:56.820
Finding about human behavior
don't tend to expire.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:00.550
Findings about user needs
don't really expire.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.110
Because human behavior-- and
I know it's a funny thing--

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.590
doesn't change much.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:10.290
We are behaving very similarly
to how humans behaved

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:14.330
10,000 years ago
without technology.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:15.354
Yes.

00:32:15.354 --> 00:32:17.270
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: So
what is the right sample

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.110
size for any kind of
research like this?

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:24.690
So for a small application,
what would the sample size be?

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.930
For a bigger application
with more risk,

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.180
what would the sample size be?

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.180
TOMER SHARON: It depends
on your question.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.620
Remember, the
questions I introduced?

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.700
For observation, you don't
need a lot of people.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.150
And not a lot is, I don't
know, eight, or around that

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.860
are more than enough
to learn from.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.460
In experience sampling,
when I'm doing that,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.800
we use thousands now.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.900
We used to use hundreds,
now we're using thousands.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.520
It depends on what
you want to know

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.960
and what is the research
method that you're picking.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.710
But it's changing.

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.640
If you have a specific
question in mind

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.014
that you want to
learn about, I'm

00:33:04.014 --> 00:33:06.250
happy to talk to you later
about the sample size.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.070
Yes.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:11.190
AUDIENCE MEMBER 3: Hi, I
thought your observation

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.110
example was very interesting.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.810
It looked a lot like the
listening to your users thing

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:17.110
that you told us never to do.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.450
TOMER SHARON: When I say,
don't listen to users,

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:27.049
observe their behavior, there
are two ways to do that.

00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:29.090
I didn't go into that
because I didn't have time,

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.090
but I am happy to do that now.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:36.070
What you watched is what I
call an out loud session.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:40.580
What I asked her to do is
describe what she's doing.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:44.142
I didn't ask her for-- you
know, I didn't ask her,

00:33:44.142 --> 00:33:45.850
would you use the app
I'm thinking about?

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:48.790
I didn't ask her for
feature recommendations.

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:52.651
I asked her to describe
what she's doing and why.

00:33:52.651 --> 00:33:53.150
OK?

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.430
Another way of doing
that is what I call,

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.180
do it in silent mode.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.590
Ask them to shut up.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.610
People usually don't talk to
themselves when they shop,

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.080
so you can just watch.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.460
It's a trade off.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.560
There are pros and
cons to each one.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.290
Because when you watch someone--
I have a video of someone

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:15.969
I asked not to talk during
shopping, grocery shopping--

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:18.530
you don't really
understand what's going on.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.179
It seems very unhelpful.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.030
So sometimes, in
some situations,

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.920
I do ask them to describe
what they're doing.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.670
Sometimes I'll do some
kind of combination.

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:31.600
I ask them to be
silent, and only

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.620
if I don't understand
something, I'll

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.380
ask them a question about it.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.360
I'll ask them to explain.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:42.806
Don't listen to users when you
ask questions about the future.

00:34:42.806 --> 00:34:43.500
OK?

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:47.699
If you have no choice, ask
them about the recent past, not

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:49.459
about the future.

00:34:49.459 --> 00:34:52.000
AUDIENCE MEMBER 3: On a closely
related note, the first thing

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.710
I noticed in that example
was that the user couldn't

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.320
get through 90
seconds of shopping

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.320
without being interrupted
by somebody yelling

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.920
on a loudspeaker about something
she cared nothing about.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.670
TOMER SHARON: Yeah,
it's like flying.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.150
Yes.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.530
AUDIENCE MEMBER 4:
So with 404 testing,

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.910
what are some of the pitfalls?

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.350
It seems like if I
put a button in my app

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:15.280
and pushed that out to everyone,
that they're going to be upset.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.880
TOMER SHARON: There's one
very, very big pitfall.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.520
I attended one of Eric Ries's
talk, and he gives an example.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.810
Or, somebody asked
him, what do you

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:30.770
mean post an ad that
leads to nowhere?

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:32.320
To a 404 page?

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.440
People would chase me.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.000
People would call
me, and they would

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.180
want to do bad things to me.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.420
And he responded and said,
then you have a business.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.950
They really care.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:49.680
So the con is that the
people feel tricked.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:54.050
So, I'm not recommending that
you do that all the time.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:36:01.040
But sometimes this is extremely
helpful in understanding needs.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:06.760
You can be more gentle
than serving 404 pages

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.930
and come up with something
like I showed, coming soon,

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.220
or something like that.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.430
Thank you for your
feedback, you helped us.

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:14.792
If you have money, pay them.

00:36:14.792 --> 00:36:15.500
Things like that.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.180
Give them a gift or
something like that

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.530
to make it better for them.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:21.570
Yes.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:22.986
AUDIENCE MEMBER
5: I was wondering

00:36:22.986 --> 00:36:25.440
if you have any recommendations
for conducting the user

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.740
experience sampling?

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.970
Just in terms of
implementation-wise.

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:31.940
Do I just put
dialogues in my app

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.865
after the users execute
some repeated action, or?

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.950
TOMER SHARON: I do have
a lot to say about that.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:45.170
What I'm going to say is
that tomorrow at 9 o'clock,

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:48.140
I'm giving a talk just
about experience sampling.

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.129
So instead of three
minutes, I have 30 minutes,

00:36:50.129 --> 00:36:51.670
so I'm going to talk
more about that.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.300
And I'm going to talk about
an example from Google.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.760
AUDIENCE MEMBER
5: OK, thank you.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.551
TOMER SHARON: Sure.

00:36:56.551 --> 00:36:58.190
Yes.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:02.130
AUDIENCE MEMBER 6: How do you
pick your riskiest assumption?

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.840
TOMER SHARON: Again,
it's an assumption.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.480
It's not easy.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.740
First, you need a
list of assumptions.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.750
A lot of people
don't even do that.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.190
List of assumptions.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.594
And then, look at
each one and try

00:37:13.594 --> 00:37:15.010
and think-- if you
have a team, do

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:19.930
that as a team-- try to
identify the one assumption

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:22.590
that if it turns out
that it's not true,

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:23.780
everything falls apart.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.260
There's no reason
for this company,

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.840
there's no reason
for this product.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.216
Might be more than one, but
normally it's about one.

00:37:32.216 --> 00:37:34.208
All right?

00:37:34.208 --> 00:37:35.210
Yep.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.126
AUDIENCE MEMBER 7: Hi.

00:37:36.126 --> 00:37:39.400
I was wondering, what is
your advice for a redesign

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.870
or a product that
exists already,

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.190
but you want to improve?

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:46.220
And maybe you kind of executed
it in not the best way?

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.910
TOMER SHARON: That's
a pet peeve of mine.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:54.270
Usually, redesigns,
from my observations,

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:59.620
are done because
three years passed.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:03.770
And it's not necessarily
a good reason.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:07.610
There needs to be a good
reason for a redesign.

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:11.480
If it's from 15 years
ago and it looks old,

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.420
that's a good reason.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.895
Three years ago, I'm not
sure it's going to look old.

00:38:14.895 --> 00:38:20.440
A good reason is, we identified
different user needs.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.540
OK?

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:26.440
And identified user needs is not
we asked people what they need,

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.550
and they told us.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.520
Or feature requests.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.250
Or things like that.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:35.740
User needs bubble up from
these things I just described.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.654
AUDIENCE MEMBER
7: OK, thank you.

00:38:37.654 --> 00:38:39.458
AUDIENCE MEMBER 8:
You can let them go.

00:38:39.458 --> 00:38:41.360
They've been-- OK.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.300
TOMER SHARON: No, no, I
give priority to women

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.460
because we want
them to come back.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.830
AUDIENCE MEMBER 8: So, really,
we're talking apps here.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:51.170
But a product is a product.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.850
Hardware, software, it
doesn't matter what it is.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.060
One's a little more
permanent than another.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:00.320
But how do you end up
finding the right problem,

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:04.180
executing it correctly, but
not doing it the correct way?

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.230
So, this is something-- I do
a lot of stuff with startups

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:10.280
and I see this happen all
the time-- and I just go,

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.390
this product is useless to me
because it solves the problem,

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:15.390
but it doesn't solve
it in a way that's

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:16.990
going to be continuously useful.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.130
Or it's too expensive.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:23.540
How do you find that out early
on in the stages of development

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.440
and ideation in order to
prevent that kind of outcome?

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.490
TOMER SHARON: One thing that
I mentioned during the talk

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:34.760
is something that people
in many cases ignore.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.820
It's not only important
to identify a problem,

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.400
because there are many
problems in this world.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.900
It's important to
identify and invest time

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:47.960
in identifying a problem
people really care about.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.520
Because there are many
problems that nobody

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.420
would argue that
they're problems,

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:56.800
but people don't care enough
about them to solve them.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.460
We do a lot of
bypasses all day long.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.480
We don't really care.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.370
Yes, there's a problem.

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.950
No big deal.

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:08.420
There are hundreds of thousands
of apps that solve problems

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.140
that nobody cares about.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.775
I would say this is key.

00:40:12.775 --> 00:40:15.400
You can solve the right problem,
you can solve a problem people

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.110
care about, and you can
design a beautiful app,

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.570
but then the
workflow is terrible,

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:22.720
and people would never use it.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.090
There are problems, from
the company or the startup

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:29.380
perspectives, that can
arise in every stage.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.360
In my opinion,
the hardest to fix

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.410
is solving the wrong problem.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.190
Or not solving any problem.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:39.360
There are many solutions
without problems.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.390
OK?

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:42.070
It's hard.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:45.410
It's not something I
can answer in a minute.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:47.190
We can talk later.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.770
Yes.

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:48.530
AUDIENCE MEMBER 9:
Does this change

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.720
if you're building an enterprise
software instead of a consumer

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.590
application?

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:56.490
For example, there are two
big differences that I see.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:58.710
One is there are
multiple stakeholders.

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:02.020
And number two, the access
to top management is limited,

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:06.227
or perhaps the intentions of
managers are opaque sometimes.

00:41:06.227 --> 00:41:08.310
TOMER SHARON: I always
like to talk about research

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:11.190
in terms of questions.

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:13.380
If you care about
what people need,

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.480
what people want, and
can they use the thing,

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.240
it's not really different.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:23.580
What product, what app, or what
organization you're targeting.

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.820
Or what type of audience
you're targeting.

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:28.650
Of course, there are
differences in the details.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.840
Differences in
stakeholders, definitely.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:34.060
In organizations, there is
the person or department

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.450
that pays for the product,
and then there are users.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:38.250
That's different.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:41.640
They have very different
considerations.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.320
So yes, there are differences.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.000
And when you have
multiple stakeholders,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.720
you need to focus
on each one of them.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.470
Because user experience is not
just what happens to the user

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.320
during the usage of the product.

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.230
But very basically, there's
not a lot of difference.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.030
The basic things you
need to do, there's

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:06.690
not a lot of difference,
in my opinion, at least.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.174
Yep.

00:42:08.174 --> 00:42:09.590
AUDIENCE MEMBER
10: So what do you

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.210
do when your users have a
need that happens much less

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:14.755
frequently than taking
notes or going shopping,

00:42:14.755 --> 00:42:15.630
like buying a flight?

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.610
TOMER SHARON: Good question.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.990
So I mentioned, what was
the reason you recently

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.960
updated your website?

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.160
People don't necessarily
update their website

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.670
five or eight times a day.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.100
So the study would
just take longer.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:32.210
So let's say your audience is
updating their website twice

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:33.660
a week.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.190
All right?

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:36.720
So you're not going to
ask that five times a day.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.890
I would recommend that
you ask that once a week

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:44.170
and run this study for 10 weeks.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:47.740
All right, so, a participant
would answer the question

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:51.720
during a study 10
times over 10 weeks.

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.230
Do that with 50,
100 people, you have

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.250
a lot of data points still.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:59.950
It's just going to take longer.

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.230
Yep.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.188
AUDIENCE MEMBER 11: Hi.

00:43:02.188 --> 00:43:05.780
How do you deal with insincere
answers to your questions?

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:06.887
How do you--

00:43:06.887 --> 00:43:08.345
TOMER SHARON: I
ask more questions.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:15.010
In my interviews with
founders and app developers,

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:19.490
I wanted to know if
they read certain books.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.470
And I thought in
advance that they

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.270
would tend to not say
the truth because they

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:25.640
want to look smart.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.900
So I asked them, after
asking about the books,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.850
so say three questions
after that, I asked them

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:37.110
what does the term blah,
blah, blah say to you.

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:40.992
And that's a term taken from
an important book in that list.

00:43:40.992 --> 00:43:42.450
If they haven't
read the book, they

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.440
wouldn't know what
I was talking about.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.700
And some of them didn't.

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:51.440
So there are ways to understand
if people are not very sincere.

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.070
But there's an
even bigger problem

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:57.160
when you ask people and
not observe their behavior.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:01.150
When you ask people, they do
what's called rationalization.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:03.900
They tell you things
they think you

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.260
want to hear because
they want to look smart.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:09.930
They want to be
perceived as good people.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:12.880
So they would change
reality a little bit.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.750
And the bad news is
that we have no way

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:17.270
of knowing if
that's true or not.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.670
So it's hard.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:20.830
It's hard.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:23.760
That's why I heartily
recommend not

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.512
to ask questions
and just watch them.

00:44:26.512 --> 00:44:27.850
AUDIENCE MEMBER 11: Thank you.

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:29.799
TOMER SHARON: Last question.

00:44:29.799 --> 00:44:30.590
We don't have time.

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.715
AUDIENCE MEMBER 12: It's
regarding the 404 testing.

00:44:32.715 --> 00:44:35.620
Most of the time, you are
just pitching something new.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:38.220
It's hard to get data
from your competitions.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.110
How do you generalize the
data that you have collected,

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:43.550
since you don't
have anything that

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:45.992
is similar to what
you're trying to do?

00:44:45.992 --> 00:44:47.700
TOMER SHARON: Let me
see if I understand.

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:53.282
You are saying that you don't
have anything to compare to?

00:44:53.282 --> 00:44:54.490
AUDIENCE MEMBER 12: Probably.

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:59.250
TOMER SHARON: OK,
so you can decide

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.450
in advance, what
is a number that

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:03.900
would make us feel confident?

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.280
Or you can compare yourself
to yourself over time.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:11.130
So you can run the test
today, and then again a month

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:14.710
from now, and in two months,
and see what has changed,

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:16.240
if at all.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.740
OK?

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:18.660
All right, one more.

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:24.415
I have a timer here, and
something will explode if--

00:45:24.415 --> 00:45:26.790
AUDIENCE MEMBER 13: All right,
I'll try to keep it tight.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.175
The lady in the video
seemed like an extrovert.

00:45:29.175 --> 00:45:31.300
And it seems like these
would be the kind of people

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.050
who would be more
inclined to participate

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:35.830
in an observational study.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:38.220
Do you have any methods
for recruiting introverts,

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.580
or making sure that
there isn't a bias there?

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.250
TOMER SHARON: Yes.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:46.010
When you find these
people, don't just

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:48.190
communicate with
them over email.

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:49.640
Talk to them.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:50.180
All right?

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:55.624
And many people
would not volunteer

00:45:55.624 --> 00:45:56.540
even if you're paying.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:59.450
They would not volunteer
themselves to do that.

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:03.730
But if you talk to them, you
can create rapport and make

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:06.970
them feel comfortable,
and some would come.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:10.250
You don't have to
have-- that woman

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.250
is what we researchers
call a good participant.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:17.560
Because she's really, you
know, expressing everything

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.610
in a very clear way.

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:22.730
It's very easy for us to learn
from these kinds of people.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:24.620
But we also need the introverts.

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.790
So we talk to them in
advance, to make sure

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:29.270
that they're
comfortable with it.

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:31.560
And not all of them will.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.160
Sometimes we do
blind observations.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.890
We observe people
without them knowing.

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:40.510
We just walk-- let's say the
grocery shopping-- we just

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:42.770
walk into a store.

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:44.980
I was in a sports
bar a month ago

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:47.640
watching people watch games.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.512
And they didn't even know
I was doing research.

00:46:51.512 --> 00:46:52.720
AUDIENCE MEMBER 13: One more.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.550
Do you find that there's
kind of a certain period

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:58.470
through the session that after
which, then you kind of really

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.820
start in your mind
recording interactions,

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.990
because you've warmed up the
participant, so to speak?

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:05.740
TOMER SHARON: What do
you mean, recording?

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:09.150
AUDIENCE MEMBER 13: Or like,
you might need to warm them up

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:12.591
before you can kind of get the
behaviors you want, I guess.

00:47:12.591 --> 00:47:13.340
TOMER SHARON: Yes.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.070
They need to feel comfortable.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:19.770
So I pretty much in the first
five, ten, fifteen minutes,

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.270
sometimes, I don't
really collect any data.

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:25.390
I just want to make them feel
comfortable sharing stuff

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:28.640
with me, or just getting
used to the odd situation

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.580
that you do grocery
shopping with somebody

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.230
with a camera following you.

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:36.230
And there are ways to make
them feel comfortable.

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.940
All right.

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:38.640
So, for those of
you who are here,

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.170
you don't have time to
work on the wrong app.

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:46.030
Please, please, please perfectly
execute the right plan.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.850
Thanks guys.
