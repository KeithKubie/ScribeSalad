00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:02.770
The traffic lights are talking

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.650
and the street lights and cars
have joined the conversation.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.070
They are figuring out how to move billions
of people in the most efficient way.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.420
At Carnegie Mellon University

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.740
we create intersections
that actually learn

00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:22.600
so we all get home faster, safer and
with 20 percent fewer emissions.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.000
We’re not just blowing smoke.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.711
There’s work to be
done worldwide.

00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:28.740
We do the work that matters.
