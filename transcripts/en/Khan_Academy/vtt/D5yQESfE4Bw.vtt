00:00:01.073 --> 00:00:02.819
- [Instructor] So what we're
going to try to do in this

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:07.712
video is add 7/10 to 13/100,
pause this video and see

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:10.295
if you can figure what that is.

00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:14.993
Alright so despite being a
little bit intimidating at first

00:00:14.993 --> 00:00:18.964
because we're adding tenths
here, 7/10 and we're adding

00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:22.625
hundredths here 13/100, how
do I add a certain number

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:25.597
of tenths to a certain
number of hundredths?

00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:29.764
The key idea is to re-express
7/10 as a certain number of

00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:33.383
hundredths, so how do we do that?

00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:36.970
Well let's just first visualize
each of these fractions.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.137
So 7/10 if we imagine this
square is a whole and that we've

00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:44.661
divided it into ten equal
sections I tried to hand draw it

00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:48.051
as best as I can, notice I
have filled in seven of those

00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:51.557
ten equal sections that we
have split the whole into.

00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:55.724
So this represents 7/10 and
13/100 you could split the whole

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.376
into 100 equal sections and
I tried to hand draw it,

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:02.029
let's assume that these
are 100 equal sections.

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:06.196
And so notice this is a ten
by ten square, it's got 100

00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:11.910
of these squares and notice we
have ten plus three 13 filled

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.089
in so we want to add these
7/10 to these 13/100.

00:01:16.089 --> 00:01:18.700
Now how do we express 7/10
in terms of hundredths?

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.240
Well visually you could take
each of your tenths and split

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.875
them into ten equal sections,
now you have your whole split

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:31.042
into hundredths and each of
your tenths is now a hundredth

00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:37.684
so you have ten times as many
things in the denominator

00:01:37.684 --> 00:01:42.235
and you also have ten times as
many things in the numerator.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:47.052
Before you had seven of the
tenths filled in, now you have

00:01:47.052 --> 00:01:49.635
70 of the hundredths filled in.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.962
Or another way to think
about it, we multiplied

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:56.724
the numerator by ten and the
we multiplied the denominator

00:01:56.724 --> 00:01:57.767
by ten.

00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.994
And if you do the same
thing to the numerator

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:02.535
and the denominator, you
multiply or divide it by the same

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:05.304
number, you're not changing
the value, think about it,

00:02:05.304 --> 00:02:08.392
ten over ten is the same thing
as one, so we're just taking

00:02:08.392 --> 00:02:11.640
one and multiplying it by
7/10 isn't going to change

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.080
the value.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.167
But this is as we already
talked about this is equivalent

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:20.334
to 70/100, so this is equal
to 70/100 which is this

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:28.162
right over here plus 13/100, plus 13/100.

00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:32.576
Well now we're adding 100s
in both cases, if I have 70

00:02:32.576 --> 00:02:36.289
of something and I add to
that 13 of the same somethings

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.472
in this case the something
is hundredths, I'm going to

00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:42.660
have 83 of that so this is
going to be 70, get the same

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.827
color, this is going to be equal
to 70 plus 13, plus 13/100.

00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:58.733
70 plus 13/100 and what's 70
plus 13, well that of course

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:01.483
is going to be 83/100.

00:03:03.388 --> 00:03:04.721
And we are done.
