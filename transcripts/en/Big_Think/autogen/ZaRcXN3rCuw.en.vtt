about progress is that we think of it as

my kind of straight line you know we
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.070
my kind of straight line you know we
have like the x-axis and the y-axis and

you know the kind of line going
diagonally upward and that is you know

when we have these moments and then we

when we have these moments and then we
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.479
when we have these moments and then we
have these valleys and we have these

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
have these valleys and we have these
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610
have these valleys and we have these
moments and that may slope up more

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
moments and that may slope up more
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.900
moments and that may slope up more
upward over time but it certainly has

upward over time but it certainly has
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.270

peaks and valleys simultaneously so it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
peaks and valleys simultaneously so it
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.319
peaks and valleys simultaneously so it

the presidency of a major political

the presidency of a major political

party and it's not coincidental that
 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.840
party and it's not coincidental that
that nomination coincides with the most

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850
that nomination coincides with the most
 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.480

simply don't have a frame of reference
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.899
simply don't have a frame of reference

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909
for this but both of those things happen

peaks will all eventually outweigh the

peaks will all eventually outweigh the

valleys but I don't think that we should
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.420

ever be nonchalant or kind of look at

ever be nonchalant or kind of look at

this country they had the potential to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270
this country they had the potential to
 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.479
this country they had the potential to
fail at any moment and the ones that

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489
fail at any moment and the ones that
 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.620
fail at any moment and the ones that
succeeded that we think of as succeeding

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630
succeeded that we think of as succeeding
 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.390

did so precisely because of ones that

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
did so precisely because of ones that
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.009
did so precisely because of ones that
preceded it that actually did not

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019
preceded it that actually did not
 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.710
preceded it that actually did not
achieve those objectives and so if we're

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
achieve those objectives and so if we're
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.020
achieve those objectives and so if we're
talking about you know civil rights in

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030
talking about you know civil rights in
 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.440
talking about you know civil rights in
the 1960s well we'd have to say that the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450
the 1960s well we'd have to say that the
 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.080
the 1960s well we'd have to say that the
kind of first thrust of that was in the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090
kind of first thrust of that was in the
 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.090
kind of first thrust of that was in the
19th century at the end of slavery and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100
19th century at the end of slavery and
 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.289
19th century at the end of slavery and
the kind of dawning of segregation and

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299
the kind of dawning of segregation and
 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.330
the kind of dawning of segregation and
those sorts of practices so it's

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340
those sorts of practices so it's
 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.699
those sorts of practices so it's
possible for movements that are morally

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709
possible for movements that are morally
 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.920
possible for movements that are morally
right to actually not achieve their

right to actually not achieve their
 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.640
right to actually not achieve their
goals and in that regard Hillary

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650
goals and in that regard Hillary
 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.130
goals and in that regard Hillary
Clinton's nomination represents a

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140
Clinton's nomination represents a
 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.620
Clinton's nomination represents a
particular kind of progress around

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630
particular kind of progress around
 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.800
particular kind of progress around
gender and sex and inclusion in this

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810
gender and sex and inclusion in this
 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:26.140
gender and sex and inclusion in this
country and it also highlights the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150
 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.140
intransigent and entrenched means at

know men are still more likely to vote

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739
know men are still more likely to vote
 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.440
know men are still more likely to vote

think has been said enough i try not to
 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.490
think has been said enough i try not to
say it but I think we're talking about a

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500
say it but I think we're talking about a
 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.920
say it but I think we're talking about a
kind of interest reflex about patriarchy

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930
kind of interest reflex about patriarchy
 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.120
kind of interest reflex about patriarchy
a very masculinist idea that people have

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130
a very masculinist idea that people have
 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.520
a very masculinist idea that people have
been waiting I think feeling like they

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530
been waiting I think feeling like they
 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.949
been waiting I think feeling like they
had to suppress and now they get to

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959
had to suppress and now they get to
 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.460
had to suppress and now they get to

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470

express it I was talking to a cab driver

understand how the country could think

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479
understand how the country could think
 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.210
understand how the country could think
that a woman is up to the task of being

that a woman is up to the task of being
 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.550
that a woman is up to the task of being
the president despite the fact that

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560
the president despite the fact that
 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.250
the president despite the fact that
there are these dozens of countries as

there are these dozens of countries as

there are these dozens of countries as
you can point to where women have had

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900
you can point to where women have had
 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.590
you can point to where women have had
presidencies and you know the countries

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600
presidencies and you know the countries
 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.230
presidencies and you know the countries
still exist they didn't kind of collapse

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240
still exist they didn't kind of collapse
 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.120
still exist they didn't kind of collapse
and go out of existence and so these are

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130
and go out of existence and so these are
 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.570
and go out of existence and so these are
dynamics I think are very real and in a

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580
dynamics I think are very real and in a
 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.879
dynamics I think are very real and in a
way that we had not anticipated and wait

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889
way that we had not anticipated and wait
 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:46.779
way that we had not anticipated and wait
I don't think we even thought was

I don't think we even thought was
 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.860
I don't think we even thought was
possible the current presidential cycle

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870
possible the current presidential cycle
 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.650
possible the current presidential cycle
has brought those to the surface and I

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660
has brought those to the surface and I
 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.939
has brought those to the surface and I
don't think that is also i don't think

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949
don't think that is also i don't think
