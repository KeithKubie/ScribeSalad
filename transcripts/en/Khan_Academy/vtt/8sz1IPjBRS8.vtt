00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.540
On the Khan Academy web app,
which I need to work on a

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.570
little bit more to make it a
little bit faster, they have

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.590
this one module that's called
the graph of the line.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.690
It has no directions on it, and
I thought I would make a little

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.800
video here, at least to explain
how to do this module, and in

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.870
the process, I think it'll help
people, even those of you who

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.820
aren't using the module,
understand what the slope and

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.590
the y-intercept of a line
is a little bit better.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.380
So this is a screen shot of
that module right here, and the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.550
idea is essentially to change
this line, and this line right

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.640
here in orange is the line
specified by this equation

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.840
right here, so right now it's
the equation of the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.510
line 1x plus 1.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.450
It has a slope of 1, you can
see that, for every amount it

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.210
moved to the right it moves up
exactly 1, and has 1

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.620
for its y-intercept.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.130
It intersects the y-axis
at exactly the point 0,1.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.920
Now, the goal of this exercise
is to change your slope and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.410
your y-intercept so that you go
through these two points, and

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.300
this point's-- half of it's off
the screen, hopefully you can

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.940
see them if you're watching
these in HD-- you can

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.730
see these two points.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.700
Our goal is to make this line
go through them by essentially

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.210
changing its equation.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.110
So it's a kind of a tactile way
of-- you know, as tactile as

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.010
something on the computer can
get-- of trying to figure out

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.560
the equation of the line that
goes through these two points.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.890
So how can we do that?

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.650
So you can see here, when I
change the slope, if I make

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.270
the slope higher, it
becomes more steep.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.410
Now the slope is 3.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.090
For every 1 I move to the
right, I have to go 3 up.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.210
My change in y is 3 for
every change in x of 1.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.470
Or that's my slope.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.130
My y-intercept is still 1.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.260
If I change my y-intercept, if
I make it go down, notice it

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.920
just shifts the line down.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.180
It doesn't change its
inclination or its slope, it

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.720
just shifts it down along
this line right there.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.850
So how do I make my line go
through those two points?

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.890
Well it looks like, if I shift
it up enough-- let's shift up

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.210
that point-- and then let's
say let's lower the slope.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.050
This looks like it has
a negative slope.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.130
So if I lower my slope, notice
I'm flattening out the line.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.880
That's a slope of 0.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.480
It looks like it has to be
even more negative than that.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.200
Let's see, maybe even more
negative than that, right?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.360
It has to look like a line that
goes bam, just down like that.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.750
Even more-- that looks close.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.810
Let me get my y-intercept
down to see if I can

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.110
get closer to that.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.940
It still seems like my slope
is a little bit too high.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.870
That looks better.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.950
So let me get my y-intercept
down even further.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.000
It's now intersecting way
here, off the screen.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.050
You can't even see that.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.480
I just realized this is
copyright 2008 Khan

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.100
Academy, it's now 2009.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.310
It's almost near
the end of 2009.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.680
I could just change that.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.470
Maybe I'll just
write 2010 there.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.840
OK.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.280
So y-intercept.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.940
Even more.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.210
So I lowered the y-intercept
but our slope is still

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.080
not strong enough.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.870
The y-intercept is
actually off the chart.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.200
It's intersecting at minus 18.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.450
That's our current y-intercept.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.730
But the slope of minus 5
is still not enough, so

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.240
let me lower the slope.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.760
So if I lower the slope, let's
see, if I lower the y-intercept

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.830
a little bit more,
is that getting me?

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.650
There you go.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.790
It got me to those points.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.960
So the equation of the line
that passes through both

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.970
of those things is
minus 6x minus 22.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.430
Let's do another one.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.740
So, once again, it resets it,
so I just say the equation 1x

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.540
plus 1, but it gives me these
two new points that I have

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.060
to make it go through.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.480
And once again this is going to
be a negative slope, because

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.370
for every x that I move
forward positive, my y

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.140
is actually going down.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.030
So I'm going to have a negative
slope here, so let me lower

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.890
the slope a little bit.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.920
It's actually doing fractions,
so this thing jumps

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.600
around a little bit.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.510
I should probably change
that a little bit.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.210
That looks about right, so let
me shift the graph down a

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.170
little bit by lowering
its y-intercept.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.420
By lowering its y-intercept,
can I hit those two points?

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.410
There you go.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.890
This is the equation of that
line that goes to the points

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.670
minus 5,1 and the
points 9,minus 9.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.340
You have a slope of minus 5/7.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.140
For every 7 you go to the
right, you go down 5.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.980
If you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, you're going to

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.840
go down 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.040
And that, we definitely
see that on that line.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.980
And then the y-intercept is
minus 18 over 7, which is a

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.270
little over 2, it's about a
little over-- it's what,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.010
a little over 2 and 1/2.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.050
And we see right there
that the y-intercept is

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.420
a little over 2 and 1/2.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.340
That's the equation
for our line.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.860
Let's do another one.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.170
This is a fun module, because
there are no wrong answers.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.580
You can just keep messing with
it until you eventually get

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.570
that line to go through both of
those points, but the idea is

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.670
really give you that intuition
that the slope is just what the

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.560
inclination of the line is, and
then the y-intercept is how far

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.900
up and down it gets shifted.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.110
So this is going to be
a positive slope, but

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.490
not as high as 1.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:06.510
It looks like, for every 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.440
12, for every 12 we go to the
right, we're going

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.810
to go 1, 2, 3 up.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.260
So our slope is going to be 3
over 12, which is also 1 over

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.070
4, and we can just look
at that visually.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.680
Let's lower our slope.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.750
That's 3/4, not low enough.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.580
1/2, not low enough.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.060
1/4, which I just figured out
it is, that looks right, and

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.020
then we have to lower
the y-intercept.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.470
We're shifting it down,
and there we go.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.840
So the equation of this line,
its slope is 1/4, so the

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.150
equation of the line
is 1/4x plus 1/4.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.220
So hopefully, for those of you
trying to do this module, that,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.060
1, explained how to do it, and
for those of you who don't even

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.980
know what this module is, it
hopefully gives you a little

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.070
intuition about what the slope
and the y-intercept do

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.040
to an actual line.
