00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.290
Now, we're ready for the next step.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.790
So far, you've seen quite
a few buttons and labels.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.560
But remember, the UI kit offers
a diverse palette of UI controls.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.470
This gives us the freedom to
choose UI elements that make for

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.160
the most intuitive user experience.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.210
In the next step, Color Maker,
we have three UI switch controls.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.660
Which are fairly similar to buttons
with one new type of event.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.220
When the user flips the switches,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.670
we see the combination of the three
color components in the window.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.990
Here we'll use three controls
hooked up to three outlets and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.960
we'll route the events from all
three into a single action.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.580
The code and story board
are complete but the outlets and

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.350
actions aren't connected yet.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.090
Go ahead and download the project
from the downloadable section.
