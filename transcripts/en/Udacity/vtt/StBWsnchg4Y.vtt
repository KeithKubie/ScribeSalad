00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.485
Shifting up or moving in the positive y-direction, means replacing y with y

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.850
minus k. This goes along with the same reasoning that we used for the shift

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.725
downward. We just need an opposite sign here to indicate the opposite direction

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:14.400
of motion.
