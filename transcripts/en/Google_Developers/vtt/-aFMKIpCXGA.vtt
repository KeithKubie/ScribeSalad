&gt;&gt; MARSLAND: Hi, my name is Paul Marsland
and I’m here to talk about EZAsset. So,

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:15.910
what is EZAsset, EZAsset is a Web based asset
management system for both government and

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.550
business and we also have another side for
home inventories. So, what we do with the

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.970
government and business is we track computers,
IT equipment, weapons, medical records for

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.969
hospitals. And then on the home side we track,
art, jewelry, cars whatever people have for

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:41.500
their assets. So, what are we integrated with,
with Google? We’re integrated with Google

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.920
Docs for importing and exporting asset information
in this system very easily and quickly. And

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.590
then we are also integrated with Calendar
for a maintenance Calendar task for the asset.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.809
And then we just ported EZ Home over to the
App engine. The App engine has been pretty

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.430
exciting so far because of many different
reasons which we’ll get into a little later.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.490
So, a little bit of history for EZAsset and
it’s deployment. First of all we started

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.499
EZAsset in Columbus, Ohio—-we had our own
servers. And so, we’re managing as a hosted

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:22.920
application in our home office. We than decided
to move to the Cloud because we have lots

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.100
of expectations and excitement about the Cloud,
and so, we went to EZ Two. And so, in EZ Two

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.320
they gave you a very raw, very raw set of
servers and so, you have to control patch

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:40.359
management, low-balancing database management
back-ups, everything there. And so, when we

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:46.609
were on EZ Two for about a year and then App
engine was brought to our attention. So, we

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.179
decided to move the App engine for a couple
of different reasons and mostly the reasons

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.810
are maintenance and scalability. So, Google
is very, very good at keeping secure and scalable

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.520
solutions, and so, why should we waste—-not
waste—-but should we use the resources on

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.410
our side to do things that Google that is
very, very good at. We are good at development,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:18.140
we are not necessarily good at server management
and so, we are letting Google do their thing

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.959
while we get to do our thing. Some other things
to add about the Google and EZ Two differences,

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.349
so, today we are using EZ Two with a lot of
our integration points for our business and

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.340
we’re using All Sub for authentication means
for Google users to be able to use Google

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.129
processes such as Docs and Calendars for things
that we didn't have to develop yet are still

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:47.170
able to add a rich interface for any customer.
For App engine, for the reason that we’re

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.280
moving a lot—for the reason that we’re
moving over to App engine is because we don’t

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.690
want to have to worry about the server, server
integrity, the patching, the security features,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.730
the backing-up. We believe that Google should
be able to--Google is very good at this and

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.950
we believe that we should let Google do what
they’re passionate about and we will do

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.980
what we are passionate about, the development
of an asset management system. So, moving

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.189
to App engine, so there have been some interesting
things with App engine deployment. So, we

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:25.719
have our product over on the EZ Two which
is pretty much like developing on your own

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:30.019
servers. App engine is a little different,
so App engine provides its platform level

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.019
which gives you the capability to have this
scalability and high availability of your

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.560
application to all your users so you don’t
have to worry about that. But, at the sane

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.400
time there is cost, there’s pluses and negatives
to this. Negatives are yet to develop inside

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.460
this framework and this platform that it allows
for this capability and scalability. So, what

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.099
that means is that you have to do things a
little differently. One of the big challenges

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.950
that we had was the database, and so, today
or before we were on the EZ Two, we were using

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.459
the Hibernate connection to a POS grass back
end. So, a sequel based data store. Today,

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:19.190
we are now using the JPA to go into the data
store for the Google App engine. Other things

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:27.419
that were challenges were uploading, this
seems kind of silly but with normal servers

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.139
that you have, you have no issues with uploading
data to them because you have control over

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.040
where people can have access to and dump these
things into wherever you want to do it. For

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.599
example, images, so we take images for assets,
so you can take a picture of, say, your car

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.180
and say, this is what my car looks like. For
App engine, it’s a little different. So,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.550
we have limitations because we have to actually
place this information to the data store,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.780
so, there is a one mega byte image restrictions.
So, we have to do some resizing of images

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.889
as people upload images that are very large.
Also things that were technically difficult

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.400
were--there is a file limit size on the App
engine. And so, let’s say a thousand files,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.680
a thousand files which is something that developers
never had to worry about in the past because

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.670
you have your own server, it doesn’t matter
how many files that you have. That’s it.
