which he comes up with loads of numbers

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:17.190
which he comes up with loads of numbers
 

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.769
which he comes up with loads of numbers
and basically says look this deficit

00:29:18.769 --> 00:29:18.779
and basically says look this deficit
 

00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:21.080
and basically says look this deficit
that I'm dealing with is neckers deficit

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:21.090

is taken kind of seriously the fact is

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840
is taken kind of seriously the fact is
 

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.389
is taken kind of seriously the fact is
is that while some of the calculations

00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399
is that while some of the calculations
 

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:46.519
is that while some of the calculations
were good it really was missing this

00:29:46.519 --> 00:29:46.529
were good it really was missing this
 

00:29:46.529 --> 00:29:50.659

calculations and one of the things he
 

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.749
calculations and one of the things he
says which is sort of terrifying look

00:29:56.749 --> 00:29:56.759
says which is sort of terrifying look
 

00:29:56.759 --> 00:29:58.849

look first of all there's no way to

00:29:58.849 --> 00:29:58.859
look first of all there's no way to
 

00:29:58.859 --> 00:30:00.889
look first of all there's no way to
really make these calculations because I

00:30:00.889 --> 00:30:00.899
really make these calculations because I
 

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:03.200
really make these calculations because I
