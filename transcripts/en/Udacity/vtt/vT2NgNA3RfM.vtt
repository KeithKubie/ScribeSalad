00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.939
So let's see if we can compare the flash
disk and the combination of the two.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.708
Let's say that we have a user who
will play a game for two hours, and

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:15.003
the game issues reads to 2 GB of data
and writes to another 10 MB of data.

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:19.221
And then after these two hours the user
switches to watching a movie for

00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:24.380
two hours where throughout this two
hours we will read 1 GB sequentially.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.550
And then the user does
this three more times.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.588
If we have a disk that can read 100
MBs a second, if we read sequentially,

00:00:32.588 --> 00:00:37.460
and read or write 1 MB per second,
if we do it randomly, and

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.970
if we have flash that can access
1GB per second either way.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.790
What is the total access time for
all the data here, if we use disk?

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.710
What is the total access time with
the disk in this whole, 4 times 4 hours?

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.440
What is the total access
time if we use pure flash?

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.938
And what is the total access
time if we have a disk and

00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:03.320
a 4 GB flash cache that
is initially empty?
