00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.710
Entering into World
War I, the British

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.320
had the world's dominant navy.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.450
And they use it immediately
to their advantage.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.100
You might remember
from previous videos,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.180
Britain declared war on Germany
because of their invasion

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.650
into Belgium in
early August of 1914.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:23.620
And it was in November of
1914 that the British declared

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.200
the entire North
Sea area a war zone.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.160
Which essentially is
telling any ship, come here

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.916
at your own risk.

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:36.790
You might be destroyed,
and especially you're

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.690
not allowed to carry
any contraband.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.250
But they included
food as a contraband.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.410
So this essentially
began the blockade

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.320
of Germany and Austria-Hungary.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.740
So this is the blockade
of the Central Powers.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.120
And this had major
implications for the war.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.030
It continued throughout
the entire war.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.780
It essentially caused the
Germans, or the Central Powers,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.670
especially the Germans
and the Austrians

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.970
to have to ration food.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.640
We're talking about
1,000 calories a day.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.140
You could look at the number
of calories in your average Big

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.762
Mac and think about how
little food that was.

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:15.720
And there's many estimates
of what that caused.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.460
That obviously made it
hard for the Central Powers

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.430
to get war munitions
and things like that.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.850
But it also made it very
difficult for them to get food.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.770
And there are estimates that
this rationing, this inability

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.920
to get food, lead to
malnutrition, even led

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.660
to starvation.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.201
And there's estimates
that this might

00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:39.000
have led to in excess of
400,000 civilian deaths

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.960
either directly or indirectly
due to malnutrition

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.180
or starvation amongst
the Central Powers.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.770
So this was a pretty serious
tactic that was undertaken.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.500
Now, the Germans did not
have as dominant of a Navy.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.930
Most of their Navy was
actually focused right off

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.430
of the coast of Germany, right
around there, in the North Sea.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.770
But they also wanted to
disrupt trade with the British.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.300
They recognized the British
Isles, they're islands.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.260
They're dependent on trade
for food and for supplies.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.320
So in 1915 in February, the
Germans declared the seas

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.290
around the British Isles,
they declared this whole area,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.280
a war zone.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.590
Similarly, they declared
that a war zone as well.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.810
And because their surface
fleet was concentrated

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:41.960
right over here,
the way that they

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.709
would enforce that,
they would essentially

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.430
try to keep people from
trading with the British Isles

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.610
is through submarine warfare.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.110
And World War I
is the first time

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.644
that submarine warfare
becomes a significant factor.

00:02:54.644 --> 00:02:56.560
We're talking about very
primitive submarines.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.470
But we are talking
about these vessels that

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.140
could go underwater
and essentially

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.800
send torpedoes into boats.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.030
Now, thinking about
that as a backdrop,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.950
we now forward to May of 1915.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.190
So let's go to May of 1915.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.600
You have the passenger
liner, the RMS Lusitania.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.790
And RMS literally stands
for Royal Mail Ship

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.410
because it carried some mail.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.357
It's a big ship.

00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:24.940
If you've ever seen
the movie Titanic,

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.800
think of a ship like that.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.630
And it was setting sail from
New York to Liverpool, England.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.030
And it was apparently
a passenger ship,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.440
but it was also carrying cargo.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.300
But the Germans,
they said, look,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.450
this could be fair game
for us, especially if it's

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.170
carrying munitions, especially
if it's a British ship.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.230
And in the
advertisement that was

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.890
in New York for
the Lusitania that

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:58.770
was going to leave
on May 1, 1915,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.950
the German embassy actually
placed an advertisement.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.470
And this is worth reading.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.970
They wrote, "Notice,
travelers intending

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.920
to embark on the
Atlantic voyage are

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.940
reminded that a
state of war exists

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.000
between Germany and
her allies and Great

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.550
Britain and her allies.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.170
That the zone of war
includes the water

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.250
adjacent to the British Isles.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.190
That in accordance with
formal notice given

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.560
by the Imperial German
government, vessels flying

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.000
the flag of Great Britain,
or any of her allies,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.955
are liable to destruction
in those waters.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.780
And that travelers
sailing in the war zone

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.270
on ships of Great Britain or her
allies do so at their own risk.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.990
From the Imperial
German embassy."

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.830
And this is dated April 1915.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.430
So that's the backdrop.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.150
The Lusitania sets
sail May 1, 1915.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.150
On May 7, 1915--
the number 15 keeps

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.400
jumping into my
brain-- on May 7, 1915,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.320
it's almost reached its
destination of Liverpool.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.450
That's Liverpool
right over here.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.490
It's around 10 or 15 miles
off the coast of Ireland.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.030
And right there it
encounters a German U boat.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.630
So this right over here
is a German U boat.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.550
And that German U boat sends
a torpedo into the Lusitania.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.550
Now the torpedo, as you could
imagine, rams into the ship.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.310
And then shortly after
the torpedo hits,

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.755
you have this huge explosion.

00:05:35.755 --> 00:05:37.460
And the huge
explosion is actually

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.220
one of those question
marks of history.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.480
Now, the ship goes down,
taking down with it

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.420
most of its passengers.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.130
So there were 1,959 total
passengers and crew.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.110
And 1,195 of them actually died.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.360
Now there were other ships
that went down due to German U

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.390
boats, but what was
famous about this one,

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.500
at least from an American
history point of view,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:15.380
is that there were 128 Americans
who also died on board.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.930
And so you could imagine,
this led to a lot of people

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.670
were concerned on
the American side.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.890
Why did this happen?

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.560
These were American civilians.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.370
And it essentially led
to a harsh reprimand

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.300
from Woodrow Wilson.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.140
And just as a little bit of
context, once war broke out--

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.090
and war had broken
not even a year

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.470
before the sinking
of the Lusitania--

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.480
the Americans' position
was to be neutral.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.540
It did not want to enter
into this European conflict.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.040
With that said, the Americans
were disproportionately

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.620
trading with the Allies
not the Central Power.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:56.140
They were providing supplies, at
a minimum, at a trading level.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.880
And they were providing
monetary support.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.190
They were providing loans to
the Allies disproportional

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.290
to the Central Powers.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:09.050
So even though there was
this formal neutrality,

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.360
there was more implicit
connection to the Allies.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.410
So Woodrow Wilson, he still
wants to keep America out

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.030
of the war at this point.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.730
So we're talking about May 1915.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.790
And so he essentially
just sends a stern warning

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.940
to the German empire.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.580
Says, you must apologize.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.820
You must take action to
prevent this type of thing

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.570
happening in the future.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.690
And the German empire
actually complies.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:40.060
On September 9-- let me
write this on the timeline.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.010
So right over here.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.920
So in May, you have
the Lusitania sunk.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:54.390
And then in
September, the Germans

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.695
agree to not attack
passenger ships.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.440
And so even though the
sinking of the Lusitania,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.440
especially in a lot of
American history classes,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.460
is often given as a trigger
for America entrance into war,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.160
this whole thing happened
and America stayed neutral

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.410
throughout this entire period.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:26.310
And America wouldn't actually
enter the war until April 1917.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.630
So the Lusitania was
just one of many things

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.481
that happened in the years
running up to the war.

00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:32.980
And if we fast
forward a little bit,

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.780
in 1916 the next presidential
election where Wilson

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.960
won re-election, he
ran on a platform of,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.290
he kept us out of war.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.590
So the sinking of the Lusitania
was a significant event.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.580
One could argue because
the Germans did not

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.060
want the US to enter on
the side of the Allies,

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.950
it was why the Germans
agreed to loosen up,

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.110
at least for a couple of years,
on their U boat campaigns.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.010
As we'll see, once we get
into 1917, the Germans,

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.880
out of desperation,
start to become

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.530
more aggressive on
their U boat attacks

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.490
again, which is one
of the catalysts

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:18.140
that the US claims drove
them into World War I.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.010
But with that said,
just as a little bit

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.650
of context-- and oftentimes
when we look back at history,

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.020
it seems very cut and dry.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.810
It seems obvious.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.600
Oh yes, we had to go to
war, et cetera, et cetera.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.040
I have a few quotes here
from William Jennings Bryan,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.470
who was Woodrow Wilson's
secretary of state.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.470
And a few of these
are pretty telling.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.245
So this first one
is September 1914.

00:09:42.245 --> 00:09:44.620
This was before any of the
stuff happened with Lusitania,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.340
but war had broken
out in Europe.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.730
And he had this
message that he wrote

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.800
to Woodrow Wilson to
essentially advocate

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.470
why we should stay
out of the war

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.500
and why there should be
some type of mediation

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.130
to try to get the
war to end as opposed

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.970
to just letting
it run its course.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.300
And he wrote to Wilson,
"it is not likely

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.240
that either side will win
so complete a victory as

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.290
to be able to dictate terms.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.310
And if either"-- and this
is interesting and strangely

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:16.600
foreshadowing-- "and if either
side does win such a victory,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.890
it'll probably mean
preparation for another war.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.540
It would seem better to look
for a more rational basis

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.890
for peace."

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.670
Now, the other quotes here--
and this is the question mark

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:34.010
around that second explosion--
William Jennings Bryan wrote,

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.290
"ships carrying contraband
should be prohibited

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.530
from carrying passengers.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.560
It would be like putting
women and children

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.180
in front of an army."

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.990
And so this is one of those
big questions of history.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:49.080
It was known that the Lusitania
was carrying light ammunition.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.135
So it was carrying
a light munitions.

00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:56.010
Now, the Germans claimed
that it was actually

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.090
carrying heavy munitions.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.160
And to some degree,
that second explosion

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.200
tends to back that up.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.660
And there was all sorts of shady
things about a lot of the cargo

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.360
that the Lusitania was carrying,
even though they claimed

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.850
that it was these
perishable goods.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.940
It wasn't being stored in a
refrigerated part of the ship.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.550
And so there was
reason to believe

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.630
that it was carrying
actually heavy munitions.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.180
And that second explosion seems
to point in that direction

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:21.930
as well.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.920
And then even after World War
I, the British Navy actually

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.770
spent multiple times
trying to destroy

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.420
the wreck of the Lusitania.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.550
And some people say in order to
maybe get rid of some evidence

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.550
that it was actually
carrying far more munitions

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.170
and maybe was, from the
Germans' point of view,

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.300
a fairer target than
was actually made out.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.740
So regardless, it's a
very interesting incident,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.010
not necessarily directly
tied to America's entrance

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.700
into World War I. But it
is one of many events.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.750
And this whole idea of
blockades and German U boats

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.750
against civilians,
this was something

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:03.420
that was a cause of repeated
concern for the Americans.
