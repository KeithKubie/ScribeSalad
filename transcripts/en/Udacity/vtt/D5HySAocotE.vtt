Let's say a user orders a t-shirt
online, and later on decided that they

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.610
actually want to order two more for
two of their friends.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.630
Before checking out, they update their
shopping cart from one t-shirt to three.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.300
Would this be a create,
read, update, or delete?
