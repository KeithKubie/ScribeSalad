00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.570
Donald Trump is trying to find
a replacement for Obamacare,

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:06.039
probably one where
I'm gonna guess

00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:07.708
cancer patients are prescribed
a round of golf

00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:09.710
and a visit
to a strip-club buffet.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.613
-(laughter) -But it's proving
to be tougher than he thought.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:14.381
Take a look.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:17.184
Now, I have to tell you it's an
unbelievably complex subject.

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:21.388
Nobody knew that health care
could be so complicated.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.357
-(laughter)
-Nobody knew.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.826
No one had any (bleep) idea.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.594
It was a total out of the blue.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:30.497
We got sideswiped with
the complexity of health care.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:31.765
Our favorite reaction

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.433
to the president's
"bewilderness" came from

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:37.204
Bernie Sanders
who did this on CNN. "Ah!"

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:39.239
(laughter)

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:44.478
(applause and cheering)

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.681
I don't know if you guys

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.083
are gonna get this reference,
but this reminds me

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.553
of the preacher
from <i>Poltergeist II.</i>

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:56.590
-Ha, ha! You're all gonna die!
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.825
By the way,

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.827
Bernie looks great.

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:03.197
So much color in his face!

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.332
He looks like
a beautiful little strawberry

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:09.336
that got caught in a spider web.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.104
Comedians, what's the last thing

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:13.440
that made Bernie laugh
like this?

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.108
-Henry.
-Chris, I want to correct you.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:17.444
He's not actually laughing.
He's having a heart attack.

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:18.512
-All right, yeah. Points. Yeah.
-(laughter and groaning)

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.681
I'm sorry. He's right.
He might be right. Angela.

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:23.884
When he remembers
he can get rock hard erections.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.353
-HARDWICK: All right, points.
Yeah. -(laughter, cheering)

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:31.592
(laughter)

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.293
-He can.
-HARDWICK: I was not expecting

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:34.828
the space work
right after that.

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:37.464
That caught me by surprise.
Points. Brendon.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.766
When he successfully
sent Marty home

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.535
by harnessing a lightning bolt.

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:42.903
HARDWICK:
All right, points. Yeah.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.638
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)
-Oh!

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.908
82.2 gigawatts.

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.843
HARDWICK:
No, it's, uh...

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:52.513
"1.21 jigawatts. 1.21.

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:52.613
-1.21 jigawatts."
-(laughter)
