00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.199
Hoping to get your pearly whites brighter?

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:02.199
Try radioactive toothpaste!

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:06.890
Is that a sad, boring piece of toast?

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.180
Spread on some radium butter for a tasty treat.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.180
Looking worn out?

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.280
Don’t forget to treat your skin with radium
cosmetics, for that bright, youthful look.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.480
Considering what we now know about the dangers
of radiation, these products seem preposterous.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.270
But they were real.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.660
In the early 20th century, the harmful effects
of radiation exposure weren’t fully known

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.970
until a group of women in New Jersey paid
a fatal price for us to find out.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.060
So, what is radium anyway?

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.390
Well, radium is a chemical element that was
discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.820
It’s found in uranium ore and is formed
when uranium and thorium break down.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.310
It’s highly radioactive, which means it
gives off energy called radiation.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.140
And that radioactivity is actually useful
in treating cancers, which is exactly what

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.489
radium was used for shortly after its isolation.

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.680
In addition to all of that, it also gives
off a pretty cool faint, blue glow.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.860
Now, at the beginning of the 20th century,
the mystical healing properties and glow of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.350
radium were being used by advertisers to sell
a range of products from food to cosmetics.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.600
It was like the early 1900’s version of
kale, except instead of being a leafy green,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.040
its horrifically deadly radiation salts.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.600
Sometimes this was just a clever marketing
ploy, but certain products, like the drink

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.460
Radithor, actually contained small amounts
of the chemical element.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.030
The elixir was famously used by celebrity
golf champion Eben Byers, who later died from

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.030
radiation poisoning.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.959
But it wasn’t radium’s medicinal uses
that led to the exposure of it dangerous side

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:24.959
effects.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.689
It was its use in glow-in-the dark paint.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.840
In Orange, New Jersey, the United States Radium
Corporation used a radioluminescent paint

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.310
called “Undark” to illuminate the dials
on watches used by the military.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.020
The women working in the factory who painted
the watches were instructed to use their lips

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.389
to fashion their brushes to a fine point.

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:46.020
And while their clothes and hair would glow
from the radiation exposure, they were all

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.240
assured it was safe.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.990
But then, the eventually nicknamed “Radium
Girls” started to become gravely ill.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.311
Their teeth fell out, their bones broke, their
jaws actually fell apart.

00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:57.311
It’s really a horrific part to this story
that we can’t fully get into here.Now, there

00:01:57.311 --> 00:01:58.311
are articles online and a few books you can
check out if you want to know just how much

00:01:58.311 --> 00:01:59.311
these women suffered.

00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.311
And we think you should, but be advised, it
is not for the faint of heart.

00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:01.311
At first, the miraculous radium wasn’t the
suspected culprit for all of this.

00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:05.749
But, in 1925, a medical examiner made the
shocking discovery: the radium that they were

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:11.280
putting on their hair, clothes, skin and lips
had been absorbed into the women’s bones.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.709
Radium, as it turns out, is easily mistaken
for calcium by the human body.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.090
And once it’s absorbed, the radium blasts
the bones with alpha rays, resulting in bone

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.030
damage, cell mutation and cancer.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.931
Some of the workers sued the U.S. Radium Corporation,
but their employer fought back, blaming the

00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:29.900
women’s worsening health conditions on syphilis.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.760
The women settled their case out of court,
receiving a lifetime annuity and medical benefits.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.689
Within a decade, they had all died.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.659
But the Radium Girls story continued after
their court case.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.000
The ruling set the precedent that workers
could sue employers based on damages for on-the-job

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
abuse.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.219
And their story led to further investigation
into the adverse effects of radiation.

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:53.060
Today we use radiation in a lot of different
ways, from x-rays to treating cancer.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.349
We better understand radiation and its risks,
and there are several laws in place to protect

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.340
us from the dangers of radiation.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.739
Unfortunately, it took a tragic event for
someone to stop and take a look at the possible

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.329
dangerous effects of radioactive material
on the human body.

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.670
