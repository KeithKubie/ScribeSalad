00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.830
The social readjustment rating scale looked at different types of life events

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.558
that could be considered stressers. Each event could be scored on a range from

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:13.763
10 to 100, depending on how stressful it was. At the top of the list, we see

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:17.938
death of a spouse being the most stressful life event. At the bottom of the

00:00:17.938 --> 00:00:23.354
list with a rating of 11, we see really minor legal violations. And with a

00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:27.663
rating of 12 there's Christmas. So. here we see that holidays are even on the

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:32.400
scale of stressful life events, although they aren't necessarily bad things.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.607
So, this shows that even positive things can be stressful. Have you ever the

00:00:35.607 --> 00:00:40.280
phrase, I need a vacation from my vacation? That's just another example to show

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.504
that stress is not just associated with uncomfortable or unwanted things like

00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:49.920
divorce or death of a spouse. It's also associated what what we consider to be

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.460
positive or fun events, like vacations or holidays.
