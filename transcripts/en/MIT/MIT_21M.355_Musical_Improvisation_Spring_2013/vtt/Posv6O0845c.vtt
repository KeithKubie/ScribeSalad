00:00:20.707 --> 00:00:22.290
TIM RAY: I guess
first of all I wanted

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.920
to entertain any questions you
might've had about the concert.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.368
I know Mark is having you
write up some reports.

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:33.000
Actually I got an advanced
copy of one person's report

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.190
that had some really
interesting comments.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.660
One of the comments
that this person wrote

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.360
was about hearing--
trying to listen

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.470
for the difference between
the improvised sections

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.690
and the written sections.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.230
What was your feeling on that?

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.460
Did you feel like you had
a pretty good sense of when

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.918
we were improvising and when
we were playing written music?

00:00:54.918 --> 00:00:59.830
Was it a little hard to
tell sometimes, right?

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.990
I actually tell-- we hear
that comment a lot, actually.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.200
Including from symphony players.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.254
It might have been hard for you
to tell, don't think that means

00:01:11.254 --> 00:01:12.218
anything negative.

00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:15.110
Like I say, a lot of musicians
come up to us afterwards

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.235
and they go, I don't know
what you guys were doing,

00:01:17.235 --> 00:01:19.570
or how you were
blending the composition

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.860
and the improvisation.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.330
And that's, to me, is sort
of an affirmation of one

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.485
of my goals for this group,
is to blend composition

00:01:29.485 --> 00:01:32.920
and improvisation in
kind of a seamless way.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.460
I mean, it's obviously
not seamless,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.260
but to make that-- make
those lines blurry.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.470
And I think a lot of
composers of modern music--

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.490
I know Mark Harvey's
compositions do somewhat

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.980
the same thing, as well
as of course Greg's.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.450
And a lot of people
I know sometimes

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.070
look for that kind of blurry
line between composition

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.770
improvisation.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.686
Because it's really all
the same thing, right?

00:01:57.686 --> 00:01:59.600
It's just composition,
you write it down.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.940
Improvisation is
spontaneous, but still it's

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.940
all kind of the same thing.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.039
The piece that you transcribed
from an improvisation,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.139
did you play that--
were you playing it

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.520
exactly how it
sounded originally?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.550
Or did you kind
of reinterpret it?

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.838
Because it sounded
like a real piece.

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:21.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.150
Yeah, that's--

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.450
GREG HOPKINS: (LAUGHING)
What do you mean by that?

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.470
TIM RAY: Yeah, right.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.080
GREG HOPKINS: I
know what you mean.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.288
I know exactly what you mean.

00:02:26.288 --> 00:02:28.530
TIM RAY: Sounded like real
music, not improvisation.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.190
No, I'm teasing.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.380
No, that's a good question.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.810
That's another one
people ask a lot.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.885
Yeah, that was, again,
that was sort of Eugene's.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.240
That was something
that he had improvised

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.030
with a different piano player
years ago in this cathedral.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.060
Now he talked about it
a little bit, I know.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.601
GREG HOPKINS: Oh, you're talking
about the piano-cello piece.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.850
TIM RAY: Yeah, the
piano-cello piece, right.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.227
And as he said,
they wrote it out.

00:02:53.227 --> 00:02:54.310
I mean, they wrote it out.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.650
Eugene kind of just
memorized his cello part.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.150
And his part was
pretty much as played,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.620
as improvised back however
many years ago that was.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.690
And then the piano part, they
wrote it out and of course,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.350
being a jazz player
I changed it.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.780
So I mean I basically
followed the intent of it,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.440
you know, and I played
something specific to what

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.640
was played back then, as
according to the music.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.050
But then I did some other--
I changed it up a little bit.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.570
Made it a little
bit more-- gave it

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.015
a little bit of a personal
thing, a personal touch.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.620
But yeah, that's
one of the things.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.160
I know you weren't
here last week

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.760
when we were doing the thing
with diatonic improvisation,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.882
but basically that's
what that was.

00:03:39.882 --> 00:03:42.340
It was a whole thing
about just improvising

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.980
in the key of D major.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.790
And Eugene and this
guy, Paul Halley,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.082
was the pianist, basically
did an amazing job of kind

00:03:51.082 --> 00:03:52.040
of creating this thing.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.890
And as you said, it
sounded like real music.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.223
It sounded like something
that could have been composed.

00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:58.120
It had sections and
melody in the cello,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.810
melody in the piano,
all kinds of variations

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.790
and accompaniments.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.290
And like I said,
that was just one

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.660
of those things that kind
of worked out really well

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.580
improvisationally and
happened to be recorded.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.636
And so that that's why
it keeps getting played.

00:04:15.636 --> 00:04:18.010
But yeah, so I don't know if
that answered your question,

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.079
but that's kind of
the genesis of that.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.030
So, cool.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.040
And then Greg and I--

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.560
GREG HOPKINS: He probably played
the piece though, many times,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.061
right?

00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:27.893
TIM RAY: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:29.530
Eugene's played that
piece many times.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.820
GREG HOPKINS: So it's not
improvisation of the moment,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.250
it's a creation that he
recreates many times over

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.750
and over and over.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.600
So they kind of played
it similar each time.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.860
TIM RAY: Right, yeah.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.300
You know, and
sometimes it's funny

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.960
because we, Greg and I and Mark,
are kind of jazz-- you know,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.500
what we might call
hardcore jazz guys.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.710
Who sort of believe
in the sanctity

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.170
of spontaneous improvisation.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.070
But actually, if you look back
not that long ago in history

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.370
that happened a lot.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.990
Duke Ellington spans
a perfect example.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.830
Cootie Williams would
take a trumpet solo

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.707
and Duke would say, I like
that, do that solo again.

00:05:08.707 --> 00:05:10.790
The next thing you know,
that Cootie Williams solo

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.310
becomes part of the book.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.200
What started off as an
improvisation, or at least

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.460
largely as an improvisation,
became part of the music.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.331
So there's a little bit of
history even in the jazz

00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:21.830
world--

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.455
GREG HOPKINS: Well,
a lot of jazz music

00:05:23.455 --> 00:05:27.220
starts out as improvisation
and becomes concrete.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.010
Like some of Charlie
Parker's tunes.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.540
And he would play them
the same each time.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.515
OK, this is the melody.

00:05:37.262 --> 00:05:39.220
And they're nothing but,
really, improvisations

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.064
that become part of history.

00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:44.730
TIM RAY: Indeed.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.110
And then, the duet
that Greg and I

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.069
did, I made a little comment
at the beginning about I

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:57.610
didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.670
And it's kind of
true, I don't really

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.890
know what's going to happen.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.224
That's one of those
moments, which

00:06:04.224 --> 00:06:06.890
I like to do in our program, and
Greg and I have done this a lot

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.210
over the course of our--

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.709
GREG HOPKINS: We never decide
what tune we're going to play.

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:12.460
TIM RAY: Yeah, well
we don't decide it.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.330
I'm happy to have Greg start.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.130
And I don't know, did you--
when you started did you know--

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.460
GREG HOPKINS: I had no idea.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.150
TIM RAY: I had a
feeling you were--

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.691
GREG HOPKINS: I was
searching around,

00:06:22.691 --> 00:06:25.230
I was kind of doing a
little prelude stuff.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.510
Saying, now what do I feel
like I want to play here?

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.960
Well, we just played something
in sharp key so I said,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.430
we're going to go into flats.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.630
Because I wanted to
have a different taste.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.030
And A-flat came out, OK, well
let's-- I know this tune.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.150
And, hey let's play
rhythm changes in A-flat,

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.360
and then we went into
the Thelonious Monk

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.020
tune "Little Rootie Tootie".

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.030
Which we-- I know that
Tim knows and I know.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.590
So basically after a
little fooling around,

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.060
OK, let's do that, no problem.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.130
But we had fun
with Monk's riffs,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.200
so then we really
played the composition.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.925
And as a composer, I think
that's-- I really appreciate

00:07:13.925 --> 00:07:22.610
that, when an improviser or a
soloist plays the composition.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:29.670
Because that's a strong way
to approach a improvisation--

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.470
playing the musical composition
instead of just playing

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.980
your horn, your instrument.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.350
And playing a bunch of licks
and making the changes is fine,

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.280
but what does it all mean
related to Mr. Monk's music?

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.610
Because I put myself not
as so much a soloist,

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.480
it's not about me
as much as it's

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.600
about how can I interpret
his composition.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:08:02.880
So I'm more like the conduit
instead of the focal point.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.530
So we had a lot of
fun with his riffs.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.890
TIM RAY: Yeah, we did.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.460
And that gets a little bit back
to what we were talking about

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.790
with the assignment,
which is this tune

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.583
of Greg's, [? "Karagassian". ?]

00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:16.254
GREG HOPKINS: Oh,
you have that one?

00:08:16.254 --> 00:08:18.170
TIM RAY: Yeah, you guys
all brought it, right?

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.740
All right, so we're going to
start playing in just a second.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:28.280
But the idea, being to--
obviously, get the foundation.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.530
In other words,
learn the melody,

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.100
get comfortable with the minor
blues progression-- which

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.539
is what the improvisation
is based on-- if you're not

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:40.080
already comfortable
with that, and then use

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.200
some of the motifs in the melody
to inform your improvisation.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.330
Use to improvise in the motivic
fashion, as much as you can.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.650
I mean, you don't--
obviously, no one-- well,

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.120
I shouldn't say no one.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.820
It would be rare to hear
an improvisation created

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.450
completely out of motivic
stuff, although I'm

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.670
sure it's been done.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.770
GREG HOPKINS: Sure it is.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.820
TIM RAY: Some of my favorite
improvisers do that.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.860
I mean they don't--

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.260
GREG HOPKINS: I'm always
playing the melody up here.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:14.360
Even when I play a standard
tune, I'm on the melody.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.661
So then you're never at
a loss for what to do.

00:09:19.661 --> 00:09:21.410
I don't really have
to think of something.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.800
It's here.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.856
Do something with that.

00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:24.980
TIM RAY: Yeah, that's true.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.896
GREG HOPKINS: But then
what do you do with it?

00:09:26.896 --> 00:09:29.400
You have to know your
compositional techniques.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.260
Repetition, sequence,
transposition, elongation,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.910
augmentation, diminution,
transformation, embellishment,

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.492
all that stuff.

00:09:41.492 --> 00:09:42.852
TIM RAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:42.852 --> 00:09:44.310
GREG HOPKINS: And
then sometimes we

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.602
play stuff, little
cannons back and forth.

00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:49.310
Question and answer,
question and answer.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.470
TIM RAY: Yeah, cool.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.592
So, should we jump
into this piece?

00:09:56.592 --> 00:09:57.300
What do we think?

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.030
Yeah, we've got plenty of time.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:05.310
OK, so [? "Karagassian". ?] I
know I suggested maybe we have

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.250
you guys do some-- you
know, pair up to do some

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.220
improvisations.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.860
But maybe just for
rehearsal sake,

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.040
why don't we all
play the melody.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.574
And we'll see if we're
on the same page.

00:10:19.574 --> 00:10:22.110
GREG HOPKINS: So, as you know
this is written for my cat.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.910
My late cat [? Karagassian. ?]
I wrote the piece probably

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.660
in 15 minutes.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.170
It just came out.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.970
Because the cat
had so much spirit.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.250
And it's all here.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.310
You know cats,
they're very playful.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.690
So this melody's very playful.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:45.786
It's meant to be had
a lot of fun with.

00:10:45.786 --> 00:10:48.760
TIM RAY: Yes, indeed.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.290
So yeah, so let's
all play the melody.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.320
If you guys on guitar
want to do some chord

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.825
changes in the
three-four measure

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.700
you can, or you can just
stay with the melody

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.690
if you want to do that.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.700
Let's just do that and
see where we're at.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.170
And then we'll get
into some improv.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.210
Do you want to
count it off, Greg?

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.325
GREG HOPKINS: One,
two, a one, two, three.

00:11:15.325 --> 00:11:18.085
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:48.225 --> 00:11:49.350
TIM RAY: That's a hard one.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:12:19.838
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:21.000
All right.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.810
Not bad.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.620
GREG HOPKINS: Not bad at all.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.036
But the inflection
is pretty good.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.140
Yeah, it's really
soft and distant.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.607
And then in the third measure
we can clobber that note.

00:12:33.607 --> 00:12:35.440
Actually, play a different
note than E-flat.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.800
That's like a crash.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.060
One more time.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.090
A one, two, a one, two.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:49.940
Yeah, but softer.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:50.490
Much softer.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.430
Just touch it.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:55.310
One, two, a one, two.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:56.260
That's it.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.380
One, two.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.194
Loud.

00:13:00.194 --> 00:13:00.860
Two, three,four.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.780
One, two.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.270
So I always put a doit on that.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.270
You know what a doit is?

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.500
Where you fall up?

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.190
It's a fall up instead
of a fall down.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.990
TIM RAY: Yeah, it's always
hard on a piano, right?

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.110
I usually just
[INAUDIBLE] short little--

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.526
GREG HOPKINS:
That's an old term ,

00:13:28.526 --> 00:13:31.400
nobody talks about
that stuff anymore.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.260
D-O-I-T it's called doit.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.900
Doy-eet.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:37.930
TIM RAY: Where are we?

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:38.960
GREG HOPKINS: Bar nine.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.470
Third line.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.620
Two, a one, two, three.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.125
Two, three.

00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:53.130
Three, four.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.530
Two, three.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:56.300
Three, four.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:00.990
Good.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.320
A two, a one, two.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.520
Quiet.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.010
Two, three.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.370
Yeah, nice.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.490
So the fermata would
just be for the ending.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.110
And then we would go
to that three four bar

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.910
and then go right back to the
beginning and start the blues.

00:14:44.184 --> 00:14:46.100
TIM RAY: The blues is
in four four by the way,

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.560
and I know the chart's
not clear about that.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.290
But, yeah four four blues.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:50.915
For the improv.

00:14:50.915 --> 00:14:51.706
GREG HOPKINS: Yeah.

00:14:51.706 --> 00:14:53.240
So the whole ending
part is supposed

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.780
to create this tension,
a little angst.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.010
With the rhythm, four against
three, and then the four

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.290
goes faster than you think.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.750
And then when we start
to play the blues form,

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.504
it relaxes back
to regular tempo.

00:15:06.504 --> 00:15:08.670
So the cat's kind of clawing
its way up the curtain.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.180
But we don't play-- we
don't improvise on that,

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.930
but you could certainly
include the motifs

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:19.888
in your improvisations.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:23.860
TIM RAY: Cool.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.950
GREG HOPKINS: Should we
do it with some solos?

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.240
TIM RAY: Yeah, let's
do it with some solos.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.191
Yeah.

00:15:27.191 --> 00:15:29.690
GREG HOPKINS: Now, we perform
it as a totally conversational

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.220
piece.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.120
There's no accompaniment.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:38.710
Everybody's just soloing
at the same time, which

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:43.010
is an interesting
style which I like.

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.790
I tend to play a lot less when
I'm playing conversationally.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:51.226
Because you want the
person to talk back to you.

00:15:51.226 --> 00:15:53.475
You can't be like
some professors who

00:15:53.475 --> 00:15:54.974
just talk and talk
and talk and talk

00:15:54.974 --> 00:15:56.280
and you can't say anything.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.430
OK.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.160
Just take notes.

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:02.610
TIM RAY: Cool.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.570
But you want to-- maybe
we'll start with-- well,

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.140
let's play the melody again.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.395
And then, and then maybe we'll
do a little bit of soloing.

00:16:12.395 --> 00:16:13.550
I'll maybe keep the form--

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.220
GREG HOPKINS: It's going to
be tough with this many people

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.280
to play conversationally.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.430
TIM RAY: Yeah, well maybe
by the end we'll get there.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.760
We won't start there, though.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.571
But I would like to hear
some people kind of pair off.

00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:28.070
But you want-- maybe we should
do, like, individually first.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.361
GREG HOPKINS: Yeah, I think so.

00:16:29.361 --> 00:16:32.430
Let's do a chorus each.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.780
TIM RAY: Cool, all right.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.600
GREG HOPKINS: And will you comp?

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.612
TIM RAY: Yeah,
I'll do some comp.

00:16:37.612 --> 00:16:40.070
GREG HOPKINS: Yeah, do
some typical comping.

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.820
Base notes, you play the melody.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.710
I mean, all you need
really is base and melody.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.050
Two parts to have counterpoint.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.110
Any two lines could
be counterpointal.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.990
Then there's conversational.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.120
Much more fun than
playing alone.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.532
GUEST SPEAKER: And we've
all-- everybody's assignment

00:17:02.532 --> 00:17:04.102
was to prepare, right?

00:17:04.102 --> 00:17:07.170
Some thoughts about how
you would treat the motif.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.754
So why don't we start there?

00:17:08.754 --> 00:17:11.859
Then we see how that expands.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.020
TIM RAY: Cool.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.663
GREG HOPKINS: So, do the melody
once and then we'll start.

00:17:15.663 --> 00:17:17.329
So just go around,
you want to go first?

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.200
We'll go around.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.090
We can start there.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.673
A one, two.

00:17:25.673 --> 00:21:46.429
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:46.429 --> 00:21:47.470
TIM RAY: Yeah, all right.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.970
Cool.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.194
Let's stop there.

00:21:49.194 --> 00:21:49.860
Nice, all right.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.750
Great, it's great to
hear all of you play.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:53.490
Excellent, thank you.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.370
GREG HOPKINS: So we
all played one chorus.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.130
TIM RAY: Yeah, so we
all did one chorus.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.890
While I heard a lot
of really nice ideas,

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.660
I didn't hear a whole
lot of use of the motifs.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.350
Let's look at those real quick.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.280
GREG HOPKINS: I heard
the first motif a lot.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:07.540
TIM RAY: Did you?

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:07.750
OK.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.333
GREG HOPKINS: Yeah,
some of you played

00:22:09.333 --> 00:22:14.100
that opening, which
I did five times.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.330
But I transposed it each time.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:20.904
So it kind of created a
little line cliche, as we say.

00:22:20.904 --> 00:22:21.570
TIM RAY: Indeed.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.410
Indeed.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:22.910
Right.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.993
So that first one, I think
we looked at these just

00:22:24.993 --> 00:22:26.240
briefly last time.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.100
Yeah, the first one
is a good one to grab.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.190
The repeated note,
that's a nice one.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.370
GREG HOPKINS: Number
two, number two.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.372
That's funky.

00:22:36.372 --> 00:22:37.830
TIM RAY: That's
pretty funky, yeah.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.560
GREG HOPKINS: You
could go [PLAYS MUSIC].

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.210
You could go [PLAYS MUSIC].

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.736
You could go [PLAYS MUSIC].

00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:44.180
You could go [PLAYS MUSIC].

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.669
You could go [PLAYS MUSIC].

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.470
Just play it, you
could do-- yeah,

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.630
we could do several
choruses just on that.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.600
TIM RAY: Just on that, I know.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.620
And we probably have.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.330
GREG HOPKINS: By
changing notes, I'm

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.680
using the rhythmic
contours of motif.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.590
So, the da da da da, I could
do anything I want there.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:21.373
[PLAYS MUSIC]

00:23:21.373 --> 00:23:22.340
Yeah.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.620
You could work your way through
creating interesting melodies

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.575
by changing the notes.

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:32.080
TIM RAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.922
Do you want to do a little
motivic exercise, maybe?

00:23:34.922 --> 00:23:36.380
We'll go-- we'll
do the same thing.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.040
We'll go around the--

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.748
GREG HOPKINS: Let's
just play that motif.

00:23:38.748 --> 00:23:39.577
Da da da da.

00:23:39.577 --> 00:23:40.160
TIM RAY: Yeah.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.360
GREG HOPKINS: So you
can play four notes.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.820
One two three four.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.027
You can play any
intervals, though.

00:23:48.027 --> 00:23:48.610
TIM RAY: Cool.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.847
GREG HOPKINS: Not yet.

00:23:53.847 --> 00:23:55.430
This is my warm up,
Mark, for the day.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:56.927
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:56.927 --> 00:23:58.052
GUEST SPEAKER: Pretty good.

00:23:58.052 --> 00:23:59.927
GREG HOPKINS: It's a
good tune to warm up on.

00:23:59.927 --> 00:24:00.570
TIM RAY: It is.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.411
So, you want to do
everybody four measures?

00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:04.410
GREG HOPKINS: Let's do--

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:04.970
TIM RAY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:05.080
Sure.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:05.870
Four bars each.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:06.430
TIM RAY: What do you think?

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:06.930
OK.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:08.160
Just doing that motif.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.500
Just the repeated note motif.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:09.860
All right.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.693
Why don't you start.

00:24:10.693 --> 00:24:12.530
GREG HOPKINS: A two, a one, two.

00:24:28.036 --> 00:24:35.561
Good Nice idea.

00:24:35.561 --> 00:24:36.060
Yeah.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:57.340
Do another one.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:57.980
You go.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.650
One.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:24:59.090
AUDIENCE: From this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.881
GREG HOPKINS: Yeah.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.060
Flute.

00:25:17.121 --> 00:25:17.912
TIM RAY: You ready?

00:25:24.856 --> 00:25:25.685
Yeah, nice.

00:25:25.685 --> 00:25:26.710
GREG HOPKINS: Next solo.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.500
Yeah.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.470
So we're setting parameters now.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:52.799
You have to use that material
and create with that.

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:54.840
It's like, I mean we're
sculptors, Let's face it,

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.300
we're just shaping stuff
out of these materials.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.960
So sometimes it's really
good to limit yourself.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.040
That's what an etude
is, an etude is always

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.880
like one idea for
the whole page.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.562
And the composer of
the etude does it

00:26:08.562 --> 00:26:12.260
in all the different
keys so you'll learn it.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:15.320
So it's really good to set the
parameters like that I think.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.820
TIM RAY: Yeah, oh
I think so too.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.590
I think it's a great
way to-- you know,

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.960
there's all kinds of parameters.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.310
You can obviously-- we're
doing the little motivic thing

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.380
with the four
notes, but you can,

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.410
obviously-- there's any
number of other motifs

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.460
you could do that with.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.250
You can do set
parameters, as far

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:33.830
as the range of
your instruments,

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.070
or dynamics, or
rhythmic density,

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.530
you know, do a solo
with all quarter notes.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:41.070
Right?

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.240
Or do a solo with all
quarter note triplets, right?

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.610
Something like that,
that's another great way

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:50.755
to kind of expand your range.

00:26:50.755 --> 00:26:52.130
In other words,
expand your range

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.950
of what you're doing
with improvisation.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.020
Let's do another one of those.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.037
Let's see, what's another
good motif to grab?

00:27:02.037 --> 00:27:03.620
GREG HOPKINS: Bar
nine is pretty good.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.906
That might be a little hard.

00:27:13.906 --> 00:27:15.540
Well, the opening motif is good.

00:27:19.157 --> 00:27:19.740
TIM RAY: Cool.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:20.580
Cool.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.190
Yeah, let's do the same thing.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.170
Four measures again?

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:25.810
GREG HOPKINS: Four measures.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.240
We'll do the opening motif.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.240
Two, a one, two, three.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:44.520
Nice.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.700
Nice.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:50.720
Go ahead.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.505
Change direction.

00:27:56.883 --> 00:27:57.383
Nice.

00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:20.615
TIM RAY: Yeah.

00:28:50.792 --> 00:28:51.500
GREG HOPKINS: OK.

00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:56.440
So, I mean, how would you
practice something like that?

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.932
Well, let's play that motif.

00:28:59.932 --> 00:29:00.890
Just those three notes.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.745
OK, let's go up in half steps.

00:29:08.745 --> 00:29:11.370
So I'm going to sequence it, I'm
going to play it in every key.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:17.216
OK, and then we
go (PLAYS MUSIC).

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:24.700
Yeah.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:32.290
So the first one, D
G, D G, D G D. Now,

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.830
what am I-- I'm
hearing in my head,

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.138
I'm hearing five one five.

00:29:36.138 --> 00:29:38.280
So I'm hearing it in the key.

00:29:41.867 --> 00:29:45.170
Up a half.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:47.710
So an A-flat now.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:52.450
Let's do it in A. A.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.506
Next key.

00:29:55.506 --> 00:29:56.398
Next key.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.580
Next key.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:02.300
Next key.

00:30:20.865 --> 00:30:21.855
Yeah, good.

00:30:21.855 --> 00:30:23.840
OK?

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.820
So then we could (PLAYS MUSIC).

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:35.490
You can put it in, and we could
do the same thing going down.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:36.940
We could do the motif down.

00:30:44.445 --> 00:30:46.320
I mean, that's what you
do when you practice.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.930
You do really mundane--
maybe not mundane,

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.240
you do really small,
little things.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.370
I mean, it might
take me 10 minutes

00:30:56.370 --> 00:31:00.410
to really feel comfortable
with that, just those intervals

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:02.907
going up in sequences like that.

00:31:02.907 --> 00:31:03.990
TIM RAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:05.698
GREG HOPKINS: And then
you could sequence

00:31:05.698 --> 00:31:08.550
things four different ways.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.020
Let's sequence it
in whole steps.

00:31:19.602 --> 00:31:22.060
Up a whole step, I'm going to
go up a whole step each time.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:31.811
Too high?

00:31:31.811 --> 00:31:32.310
Yeah.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:34.890
So the person is going
to be in G then A then B

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:39.130
then C-sharp, then E-flat,
then F, and then G again.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:39.727
Right?

00:31:39.727 --> 00:31:40.310
TIM RAY: Yeah.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:41.282
Absolutely.

00:31:41.282 --> 00:31:42.490
GREG HOPKINS: Can we do that?

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.000
TIM RAY: Sure.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.291
GREG HOPKINS: Let's just go up.

00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:45.269
Skip the first note.

00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:47.310
Now I'm going to sequence
just the first measure.

00:32:03.699 --> 00:32:04.198
Right.

00:32:04.198 --> 00:32:05.100
That's it.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.547
There I go.

00:32:15.547 --> 00:32:17.880
It's the whole thing, now
it's a whole different animal.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.302
Now it sounds like a
progression, right?

00:32:20.302 --> 00:32:21.010
TIM RAY: It does.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:21.930
Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.180
GREG HOPKINS: So
that creates it.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.941
And we can do it
in minor thirds.

00:32:31.941 --> 00:32:32.440
OK?

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.070
Let's do that over a G pedal.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.770
Yeah, that creates kind
of a bluesy feeling.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.220
It's like a G diminished chord.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.303
TIM RAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.645
Right, yeah.

00:33:02.645 --> 00:33:04.770
GREG HOPKINS: So now I'm
creating counterpoint just

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.620
with the motif.

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.120
Then we could do
it in major thirds.

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:18.270
That's an interesting one too--

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.020
TIM RAY: It is.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:19.460
GREG HOPKINS: You think?

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:19.670
TIM RAY: Oh yeah.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:20.390
Absolutely.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.556
GREG HOPKINS: This is-- I
learned all this from him.

00:33:22.556 --> 00:33:27.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:30.537
Let's do that over a D pedal.

00:33:30.537 --> 00:33:31.120
TIM RAY: Sure.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:32.078
GREG HOPKINS: One, two.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.120
Then we could do cycle four.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.710
So we did half steps,
whole steps, minor thirds,

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.700
major thirds, what's
the next interval?

00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:02.860
Above a major third
is a perfect fourth.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.940
So this is going-- there's
going to be 12 of them.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.810
This is cycle five, right?

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:09.715
TIM RAY: Sure, yeah.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:20.340
Yeah, right.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.179
Or you can just--

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:21.840
GREG HOPKINS: Now we're
going to expand it.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.250
We're going to
play a minor triad.

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.791
Instead of just one five, we're
going to play one three five.

00:34:33.694 --> 00:34:36.480
Let's play up and
down a minor triad.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.219
So we embellished the lick.

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:46.719
That's fine.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:50.429
You can add notes
whenever you want.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.120
Why'd you do that?

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:52.620
I wanted to.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:58.950
G minor, so now we're
going to do cycles,

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:02.830
so we're going to go a forth
up to C minor, fourth up to F

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.670
minor, B-flat minor, E-flat
minor, A-flat minor, D-flat

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.300
minor, G-flat minor, B minor,
E minor, A minor, D minor,

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.925
back to G. Slowly.

00:35:12.925 --> 00:35:13.520
Ready, go.

00:35:45.101 --> 00:35:46.965
So now I'm going to
take that same idea

00:35:46.965 --> 00:35:48.180
and do it in whole steps.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:54.920
And so on.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:59.060
It's all just grunt work.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.270
But that's what Coltrane did.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.780
He used to practice in his
apartment eight hours a day.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:08.450
Eight hours a day just on
these-- what he was playing.

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:11.160
He made up his own etudes.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.150
Yeah, he did.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:15.967
Which is what all the good--
all the great players do.

00:36:15.967 --> 00:36:17.050
TIM RAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:18.960
I mean, certainly--

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.590
GREG HOPKINS: This is the model.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.490
This is the model.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.420
This has dozens of ideas.

00:36:26.452 --> 00:36:27.910
TIM RAY: Yeah, and
certainly that's

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:30.782
the idea of any kind of
work on improvisation.

00:36:30.782 --> 00:36:32.990
You know, when you're sitting
alone at home thinking,

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.570
you know, because
everyone always says,

00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:35.985
well I don't know how to
practice improvisation.

00:36:35.985 --> 00:36:36.760
GREG HOPKINS: Yeah,
what should I do?

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.880
Oh, I'm going to play
my scales every day.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.546
OK, that's fine.

00:36:38.546 --> 00:36:40.790
TIM RAY: Because
it's spontaneous.

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:43.400
GREG HOPKINS: You got make
goals, a set of goals.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:48.880
And we can tell you what goals,
what projects to work on.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.630
TIM RAY: But yeah.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:53.580
But a lot of it's just about
coming up with stuff like this.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.560
Obviously, as Greg said,
we can tell you stuff

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.050
or you could go
buy books that have

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.340
patterns and stuff like that.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.170
And that's all great,
but sometimes it's

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.586
just about what
we're doing, which

00:37:02.586 --> 00:37:03.910
is like, OK, let's try that.

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:05.160
Now let's try it up a fourth.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.090
And let's find this
little two bar thing.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.010
I mean, if you want
to get more difficult

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:14.464
you can find something
even in a tune like this.

00:37:14.464 --> 00:37:16.130
Something that's a
little more difficult

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.639
and try that in all 12 keys.

00:37:17.639 --> 00:37:19.305
GREG HOPKINS: Let's
do bar 17, you know.

00:37:19.305 --> 00:37:19.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:20.645
TIM RAY: Yeah, right.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.310
No, I'm not going to try it.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:28.850
GREG HOPKINS:
That's a-- basically

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.570
it's this a B-flat lick.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.132
Yeah, that was my
idea, I want to go

00:37:41.132 --> 00:37:44.860
from B-flat to B-flat with some
kind of maybe 12 tone idea,

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.990
I don't know what it is.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:50.080
TIM RAY: Yeah, so
that's, as Greg says,

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:56.264
a lot of just sitting alone
at home work that's, I think,

00:37:56.264 --> 00:37:57.180
that's really helpful.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.388
All the great players did it.

00:37:58.388 --> 00:38:00.380
They all spent 10,000 hours.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.800
Is that the current idea?

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.470
GREG HOPKINS: I
do the same thing.

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.310
I do the same thing
with my scales.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.340
How do you practice your scales?

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.320
Well, you do them in intervals.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.610
I mean, what is a melody?

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.760
Let's define melody.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.220
This is a good place to do it.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.450
Let's have a real technical
definition of melody.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:19.450
Anybody, what is melody?

00:38:21.817 --> 00:38:23.400
First thing that
comes into your head.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.445
What's the melody?

00:38:24.445 --> 00:38:26.225
AUDIENCE: Whatever
you'd sing after you're

00:38:26.225 --> 00:38:28.010
done listening to it.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.870
GREG HOPKINS: Yeah, whatever
you hear-- what did you say?

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:31.425
AUDIENCE: Whatever
you would sing

00:38:31.425 --> 00:38:32.925
after you were done
listening to it.

00:38:32.925 --> 00:38:36.144
GREG HOPKINS: Good, yeah,
whatever you'd sing.

00:38:36.144 --> 00:38:38.560
You're a melody player, violin,
you're all melody players.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:39.980
Yeah.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:41.620
You guys, too.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.550
What's melody to you?

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:49.048
AUDIENCE: It's
kind of the song--

00:38:49.048 --> 00:38:50.673
GREG HOPKINS: It's
the song, very good.

00:38:50.673 --> 00:38:51.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.970
GREG HOPKINS: Many
people say that.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:53.820
It's the main idea.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:58.040
It's the meaning.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.390
Technically, is this music?

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.800
No, this is paper
with ink on it.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.220
This is graph paper.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.040
This is graph paper.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.790
Pitch goes up and down,
time goes that way.

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:12.210
This is not music.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:15.640
It's only music when you
realize it, when you play it.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:22.040
So, the better you are
at creating intervals,

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.400
the better you'll be
at melody playing.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.650
A melody is a
series of intervals

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:29.860
in some kind of rhythm.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:44.288
So if I play-- that's the sixth.

00:39:44.288 --> 00:39:49.150
So six down, fourth
up, third up,

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:53.320
minor sixth down, half step
up, half step, half step.

00:39:56.794 --> 00:39:58.960
That's what a melody is,
it's a series of intervals,

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.100
that's all.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.280
In some kind of time, right?

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:12.490
Every melody-- that's a
third, and then a fourth.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.620
Another third, second
second, major seventh.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.970
So, when we're playing
our scales, right?

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.920
That's all the
same scale, I just

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.045
played different intervals.

00:40:51.045 --> 00:40:52.620
I'll play the scale
in seconds, I'll

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.810
play the scale in thirds,
fourths, fifths, sixths,

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.260
and sevenths.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.380
Let's play G melodic minor.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.680
No, G-natural minor.

00:41:10.724 --> 00:41:11.930
Good, yeah, up and down.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:12.840
One note in the top.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.340
Go.

00:41:21.369 --> 00:41:22.285
Now play it in thirds.

00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:32.180
Now play it in fourths, slowly.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.145
Now in fifths.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.040
Nice.

00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.220
Sixth is really pretty.

00:42:13.232 --> 00:42:17.290
Sevenths is even more diverse,
a little obtuse, maybe?

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:36.730
Yeah.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:39.370
Octaves.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:39.962
Ninths.

00:42:39.962 --> 00:42:41.670
I mean, you could
expand it even further.

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:43.130
TIM RAY: Sure.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.870
GREG HOPKINS: You
do that, right?

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:45.000
TIM RAY: Yeah.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:45.540
GREG HOPKINS: You've got
to learn your intervals.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.331
TIM RAY: Of course.

00:42:46.331 --> 00:42:47.297
Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:47.297 --> 00:42:49.130
GREG HOPKINS: And also
inherent in the scale

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:55.211
is diatonic triads and
diatonic seventh chords.

00:42:55.211 --> 00:42:56.210
Do you do that in class?

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.054
GUEST SPEAKER: We
haven't done that.

00:42:58.054 --> 00:43:01.400
Have you done that with Tom?

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.150
GREG HOPKINS: Yeah,
play up all the triads

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:05.210
in the G minor scale.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.250
TIM RAY: Yeah, well, right.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.810
If you're doing natural minor.

00:43:17.334 --> 00:43:18.500
GREG HOPKINS: Let's do that.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.800
It's just building blocks.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.027
This is the building blocks
of melody and harmony.

00:43:46.027 --> 00:43:47.250
TIM RAY: Yeah, that's true.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:48.910
GREG HOPKINS: And then
as you study each scale,

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:49.995
each scale is different.

00:43:49.995 --> 00:43:52.520
Each scale has
characteristic notes

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.560
that make it function
different than other scales.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.540
That's what makes
the scales different,

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.300
is the different notes.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.820
And how the architecture
of the scale

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:06.080
works and draws things together.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.666
So, I mean that's what we
study when we practice.

00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:10.730
I'll practice
scales and I'll try

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:14.190
to really get the
meaning out of the scale.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:39.140
This scale, natural
minor, is-- Yeah, I

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.730
mean there's certain things that
make that scale work, right?

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:42.120
TIM RAY: Sure, absolutely.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.110
GREG HOPKINS: Flat sixth, right?

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:43.943
TIM RAY: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:43.943 --> 00:44:45.140
Absolutely.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.140
GREG HOPKINS: So if I'm
playing a natural minor,

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:52.140
I immediately know that the flat
sixth is a real strong note.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.670
Let's just play a natural--
we'll play a natural minor just

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:56.407
for a minute.

00:44:56.407 --> 00:44:56.990
TIM RAY: Sure.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:59.270
GREG HOPKINS: G, so it'll
be like C minor, right?

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.222
Another chord?

00:45:00.222 --> 00:45:02.580
TIM RAY: Right, yeah.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.650
GREG HOPKINS: So one,
two, a one, two, three.

00:45:18.562 --> 00:45:20.130
Yeah.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:21.370
TIM RAY: Yeah, all right.

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:22.370
GREG HOPKINS: So
you're using D seven?

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:23.640
TIM RAY: Yeah, I used D seven.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.530
GREG HOPKINS: Oh,
you used D seven, OK.

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:25.750
TIM RAY: Yeah, I threw that in.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:26.680
Which is not technically part--

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.513
GUEST SPEAKER: We did
this with [INAUDIBLE],

00:45:28.513 --> 00:45:30.480
and so you're already
talking [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.938
GREG HOPKINS: This
is aeolian mode.

00:45:31.938 --> 00:45:33.270
It's called the aeolian mode.

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:34.860
Let's just play G minor C minor.

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:35.540
TIM RAY: Yeah.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.665
GREG HOPKINS: One bar each.

00:45:36.665 --> 00:45:37.770
One two three four--

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.447
I think modes is a great way
to start learning harmony.

00:45:55.447 --> 00:45:56.530
TIM RAY: Absolutely, yeah.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.730
GREG HOPKINS: Because
there's only one note,

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:00.030
really, that's really strong.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:04.500
So here were playing G minor
for a bar and C minor for a bar.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.410
G minor, C minor.

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:07.260
What's the note that
changes the most?

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:12.870
When you play the C minor
it's going to be the E-flat.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.050
The E-flat.

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:18.000
So the G minor has
a D in it, right?

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.125
In then you go to C minor.

00:46:19.125 --> 00:46:21.875
[SINGS NOTE]

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.987
So that's the
meaning of aeolian.

00:46:27.987 --> 00:46:29.070
TIM RAY: Absolutely, yeah.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:30.820
GREG HOPKINS: You could
play E-flat major,

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:34.890
would be a good
chord too, I think.

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:37.680
Let's play a bar each,
G minor and C minor.

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.930
Let's start over here, guitar.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:42.580
One, a two, a one,
two, three, four.

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:48.570
Good.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:01.020
Yeah.

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:49.669
Yeah, OK.

00:47:49.669 --> 00:47:50.210
Got the idea?

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:50.960
Yeah, that's good.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.730
I mean that's really
good for your ear.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:55.530
Now I'm really working
on a small slice

00:47:55.530 --> 00:48:00.940
of harmonic information
that I could put to use.

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:04.080
Now you played D seven before,
what scale would that be?

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.035
TIM RAY: Yeah, right?

00:48:05.035 --> 00:48:08.730
So, D seven has got
what note in it--

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:10.500
GREG HOPKINS: What
note does D seven have?

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.030
TIM RAY: --that doesn't
belong in the aeolian--

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.485
GREG HOPKINS: That's different.

00:48:14.485 --> 00:48:15.360
TIM RAY: Yeah, right.

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.090
You played it, Chris.

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:16.600
F-sharp, right?

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:16.950
GREG HOPKINS: F-sharp.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:17.449
Yeah.

00:48:20.434 --> 00:48:21.934
So that's kind of
like G-- now we've

00:48:21.934 --> 00:48:23.434
got to learn G
harmonic minor scale.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.030
Which has that very interesting
augmented second interval.

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:44.220
Gives it an exotic, Middle
Eastern or Detroit flavor.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.790
Let's play harmonic minor.

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:52.230
One, two, three.

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:04.190
Let's play the triads in
harmonic minor-- slowly.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:32.500
One, two-- Yeah.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.816
The three chord's very
interesting, augmented chord.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.440
And the four chord
is still minor.

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:54.280
So it's similar to aeolian
but it has the much preferred

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.350
leading tone, the F-sharp.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:58.210
TIM RAY: Yes, indeed.

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:00.710
GREG HOPKINS: Just for fun, now
let's play G minor for a bar

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:02.961
and D seven flat nine for a bar.

00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:03.710
What do you think?

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:05.990
TIM RAY: Yeah.

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:07.295
GREG HOPKINS: Flute first.

00:50:07.295 --> 00:50:08.400
Nah, I'll start.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:42.565
Two, a one, two, three--
Yeah, yeah, nice.

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.970
Yeah, and so on.

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:37.445
It's another small
slice of harmony

00:51:37.445 --> 00:51:40.720
but it's different
than the first one.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.590
So you practice that and you
practice it, and then it sinks

00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:44.570
in your ear.

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:46.580
Because this is nothing
but ear training.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:51.940
All this is just ear training
so you can pick your flavors.

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:55.020
OK, I want this flavor, I
want that color, that mood,

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:57.985
that sound.

00:51:57.985 --> 00:51:59.480
Then there's melodic minor.

00:52:02.811 --> 00:52:04.435
Yeah, because when
you play a minor key

00:52:04.435 --> 00:52:06.010
you don't just
play one scale, we

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:09.085
mix four or five
minor scales together.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.860
And if I play a
certain note, he'll

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:18.172
hear it and play the voicing
behind me, or whatever.

00:52:18.172 --> 00:52:18.880
TIM RAY: Exactly.

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.810
That's where listening
comes into play.

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:23.310
Listening to the
person you're with.

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:25.310
GREG HOPKINS: When Wayne
Shorter was in the Army

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:29.240
he used to spend a
month on one scale.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:34.300
He would practice the
key of D-flat for months.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.486
He'd play every tune
he knew in D-flat.

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:38.610
He'd practice the scales,
he'd practice the chords,

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:43.060
he'd play rhythm changes,
blues, everything in one key.

00:52:46.777 --> 00:52:48.110
And Coltrane did the same thing.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:51.750
All the guys that practiced.

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:54.080
I have a tape of Clifford
Brown practicing the bridge

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.086
to "Cherokee" for an hour.

00:52:58.086 --> 00:52:59.460
And you know he
did it every day.

00:53:02.136 --> 00:53:03.010
Played with his mute.

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.620
TIM RAY: Cool.

00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:09.710
So I also wanted
to get back to--

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:14.620
and this great
information, certainly-- I

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:16.870
wanted to get back the idea
of having you guys pair up

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:18.080
a little bit.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:21.580
And maybe try it without me
doing the accompaniment, which

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:27.960
of course is about listening, as
I was saying just a second ago,

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.546
listening to who you're with.

00:53:30.546 --> 00:53:33.460
Without the accompaniment
it becomes--

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.570
what becomes more important?

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:37.470
This is like as Greg
and I and Eugene

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:38.886
were doing with
the song, where we

00:53:38.886 --> 00:53:40.635
were all kind of soloing
at the same time.

00:53:40.635 --> 00:53:43.420
That's what I want to try to
get you guys to do a little bit.

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.410
And what aspect of
music becomes more

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:49.580
important in that situation.

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:52.015
Something we haven't really
talked about yet today.

00:53:55.340 --> 00:54:00.390
GREG HOPKINS: So let's have
flute, sax, and guitar.

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:04.360
TIM RAY: What I was getting
at was rhythm, right?

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:09.460
Again, getting back to the
idea that we're all time

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:10.230
keepers, right.

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:13.885
I mean, when you hear
somebody like Greg who

00:54:13.885 --> 00:54:20.164
is a great improviser, his
rhythmic ideas are very clear.

00:54:20.164 --> 00:54:21.580
His rhythmic ideas
are very clear,

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:23.500
and if he does
something intentionally

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.440
that's a little less
clear, he follows it up

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.310
with something that's more clear
so that the people around him

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:30.130
know where the beats are, right?

00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:32.680
So that's another thing that's
really important to work on

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.160
and I know we did a little
thing with rhythm with Eugene

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:35.682
last time.

00:54:35.682 --> 00:54:37.848
AUDIENCE: So are we doing
an accompaniment solo type

00:54:37.848 --> 00:54:39.348
thing or more like
a conversational?

00:54:39.348 --> 00:54:41.848
TIM RAY: I think we should try
doing like a conversational--

00:54:41.848 --> 00:54:43.400
GREG HOPKINS: Conversation.

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.440
So nobody's really
comping, you're

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:50.650
all playing your own ideas.

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:53.665
I'm leaving space for
other people's ideas.

00:54:53.665 --> 00:54:54.290
TIM RAY: Right.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:58.120
So what we'll do is
maybe have you guys play.

00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:02.250
You're all improvising again,
leaving space, conversing.

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:04.570
I'll do a baseline for 12
bars and then I'll drop

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:06.120
and you guys keep going.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.220
OK?

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.515
So this will be improv.

00:55:09.515 --> 00:55:10.890
We're not going
to do the melody,

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:13.940
just starting right
with the improv.

00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:16.120
Feel free to throw in
some motivic stuff, some

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:19.160
of the things Greg was talking
about in terms of the scales,

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:24.150
obviously G minor scale can
figure prominently in this.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.070
OK, so here we go.

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:26.575
Right at the top of the improv.

00:55:26.575 --> 00:55:30.305
One, a two, a one, two, three--

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:14.330
GREG HOPKINS: One more?

00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:15.310
One more.

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:39.190
Not bad.

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:40.610
That was good.

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:41.680
TIM RAY: That was good.

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.990
Everybody feel where
the time was, right?

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:46.620
Felt pretty secure to me.

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:49.934
And then listening, really nice.

00:56:49.934 --> 00:56:51.600
One of the motifs we
haven't touched on,

00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.465
which is the quarter
note triplets, right?

00:56:53.465 --> 00:56:55.040
Quarter note
triplets are tricky,

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.240
because that's against
the feeling of duple.

00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.410
Against the feeling
of two and four,

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:03.939
which is-- any
song in four four,

00:57:03.939 --> 00:57:05.730
most songs tend to
spend most of their time

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:08.530
either quarter
notes, eight notes.

00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:12.020
Any kind of triplet feeling
is sort of against that.

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:13.550
So when there's
not accompaniment,

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:15.217
you have to be
really careful to--

00:57:15.217 --> 00:57:17.800
I mean I'm not saying don't play
them, I think they're great--

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:21.581
but just be really careful to
articulate where your landing

00:57:21.581 --> 00:57:22.080
them.

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.460
Because that's usually the thing
that gets rushed or dragged

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:26.867
and that sometimes
can send you--

00:57:26.867 --> 00:57:29.450
GREG HOPKINS: And sometimes if
somebody's playing quarter note

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:31.825
triplets, maybe the other
person would play quarter notes

00:57:31.825 --> 00:57:33.890
against that.

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.490
Just to be obstinate, or
to have that counterpoint

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:40.410
so I can tell that
they're really triplets.

00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:47.320
I mean, sometimes you don't
want to use mimicry too much.

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:52.400
If somebody plays an idea, don't
just play the same idea back.

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:55.160
Play something different.

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.010
If I say hello, you
don't say hello.

00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:58.110
Well, I guess you do.

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:01.900
What's your name?

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.190
What's your name?

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:07.830
Yeah, you have to
have an answer.

00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:11.280
So let's do a flute,
guitar, and violin.

00:58:15.345 --> 00:58:16.720
TIM RAY: We'll do
the same thing.

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.970
I'll start off with the
baseline and then I'll drop out.

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:22.650
But you guys keep going.

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:23.870
OK, here we go.

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:27.610
One, a two, a one,
two, three, four--

00:59:36.134 --> 00:59:37.800
GREG HOPKINS: Not
bad, yeah it was good.

00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.480
TIM RAY: OK, nice.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:42.430
So-- oh no, go ahead.

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:46.200
GREG HOPKINS: Same as before,
nice use of the motifs.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.260
Sometimes I'll just
play the melody.

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.360
And Tim and Eugene
will play around it,

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:52.567
and sometimes Tim will
quote some of the melody.

00:59:52.567 --> 00:59:53.650
TIM RAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:59:57.550 --> 00:59:59.330
A couple things to
just be careful of,

00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:02.060
I know you guys
are, to some degree,

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.500
kind of hanging
on to the rhythm.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.300
I know, which is, of
course, what we all

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.610
do in this situation.

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:09.880
You're like, sometimes
you're kind of white

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:14.890
knuckling the beats instead of
just kind of letting it flow.

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:17.280
And I think sometimes
when that happens,

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.900
you start to lose a
little bit of linear flow.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:23.940
I felt like there was a lot
of root improvisation based

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.930
on the roots going on.

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:26.470
GREG HOPKINS: It was
a little block style.

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:27.344
TIM RAY: Yeah, right.

01:00:27.344 --> 01:00:30.160
And again, it's not to say
that if you did it again

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.350
you might do something
entirely different.

01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:36.840
But it's just one thing
to be aware of, right?

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.880
And this is one of these
situations where you try it

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.620
again and you say,
OK I'm going to not

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.120
focus on the root
so much I'm going

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.480
to try to do more linear
stuff, more scales.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.850
Maybe focus on the third or the
fifth, or just, like I said,

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:56.600
be a little bit more free
with what you're doing.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.180
So, again it's nice stuff.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:04.040
GREG HOPKINS: Let's
do flute and piano,

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.210
and you get another chance.

01:01:08.909 --> 01:01:09.700
TIM RAY: All right.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.060
Same thing.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.820
One, two, a one,
two, three, four--

01:02:20.719 --> 01:02:21.510
GREG HOPKINS: Bang!

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:25.640
OK, you stopped before the end.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.980
We're still playing the fourth.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:30.092
We're still playing
12 bar forms, right?

01:02:30.092 --> 01:02:31.300
Did they stop before the end?

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.281
TIM RAY: Yeah , we--

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:34.780
GREG HOPKINS: Or maybe it was
just really good use of space.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:36.160
TIM RAY: Yeah.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.185
It's either that or you
owe us three measures.

01:02:38.185 --> 01:02:39.210
I don't know.

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:41.537
We'll come back and
collect next year.

01:02:41.537 --> 01:02:43.120
GREG HOPKINS: Let
me show you-- here's

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.440
an interesting way to practice.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.020
This is going to be
a revolving trio.

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:50.529
I'm going to start
with you three, OK.

01:02:50.529 --> 01:02:52.820
Then you're going to drop
out, you're going to join in,

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.482
and then you're
going to drop out,

01:02:54.482 --> 01:02:55.690
then you're going to join in.

01:02:55.690 --> 01:03:00.580
Then you're going to--
whatever three people.

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.350
And no base line.

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:04.350
A one, two, a one,
two, three, four--

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:23.170
OK.

01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:24.310
TIM RAY: Yeah, all right.

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:24.840
GREG HOPKINS: To you?

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.340
Yeah.

01:06:27.606 --> 01:06:30.230
It's a nice way to practice and
then you don't-- everyone's not

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:32.604
jamming in your ear, and again
you're setting parameters.

01:06:32.604 --> 01:06:35.360
We're going to have three people
playing or two people playing.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.500
TIM RAY: Yeah.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.080
Yeah, you guys are
doing a great job.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.375
I mean, I can tell--

01:06:39.375 --> 01:06:42.000
GREG HOPKINS: You're keeping the
form and your ideas are clear.

01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.900
TIM RAY: Very nice.

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:48.930
And again, hearing some of
the motifs come into play,

01:06:48.930 --> 01:06:50.065
that's very cool.

01:06:50.065 --> 01:06:51.190
GREG HOPKINS: I'm thrilled.

01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:52.350
TIM RAY: Yeah, I--

01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:54.475
GREG HOPKINS: [? Karagassian ?]
will be very happy.

01:06:54.475 --> 01:06:56.599
TIM RAY: I know we're
getting close to out of time.

01:06:56.599 --> 01:06:58.560
Are there any
questions about some

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:02.919
of this stuff we've been
talking about, scales, modes?

01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:05.085
GREG HOPKINS: I need to
stress what Tim said before.

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:10.820
Melodies and harmonies are fine,
but the most important thing

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.180
in this music is rhythm.

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.760
Rhythm.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.120
Rhythm.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.210
It's like location
in real estate.

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:20.080
Rhythm.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:20.580
Rhythm.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.600
You could play any
note, it doesn't matter,

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:28.990
if it's in the right time and
it swings, people will buy it.

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.932
TIM RAY: That's true.

01:07:29.932 --> 01:07:31.390
GREG HOPKINS: It's
absolutely true.

01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:33.920
It's a rhythmic art form.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.215
Came from dancing.

01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:40.530
TIM RAY: Yeah, that's true.

01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:43.980
GREG HOPKINS: I do
an analogy my class.

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:45.990
Let me just get to the
board right behind you

01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:48.820
for one second.

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:51.850
Chalk, mighty chalk.

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:52.380
Harmony.

01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:54.130
We study all this harmony.

01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:56.145
I'm going to give
it an H that big.

01:07:56.145 --> 01:07:59.730
But I'm a melody guy, so
melody is more important.

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:06.390
But rhythm is-- and
actually it should

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:08.780
go to the top of the building
to under the basement,

01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:12.514
and make an R out to
Mass Ave and back.

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.149
TIM RAY: Very cool, thank you.

01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:19.270
That's-- I would
agree with the that.

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:22.290
GREG HOPKINS: Rhythm is--

01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:23.970
TIM RAY: So work on rhythm.

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:27.590
GREG HOPKINS: Sometimes
I just play one note.

01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:28.569
TIM RAY: Yeah, I know.

01:08:28.569 --> 01:08:30.527
GREG HOPKINS: Let's play
a minimalistic chorus,

01:08:30.527 --> 01:08:31.450
just me and you.

01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:32.260
TIM RAY: OK.

01:08:32.260 --> 01:09:21.454
GREG HOPKINS: Two, a
one, two, three-- Yeah,

01:09:21.454 --> 01:09:23.370
so we left a lot of
space, but when we came in

01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:28.170
with the rhythms, they
were very strong that time.

01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:33.350
So sometimes I think I'm
playing like a melodic drummer.

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:36.270
I want to lay that melody
down so people know right

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:37.819
where it is.

01:09:37.819 --> 01:09:40.544
And sometimes I don't,
sometimes I'll float.

01:09:40.544 --> 01:09:41.420
TIM RAY: Right.

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.500
And I think most of the
good players did that.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.124
They'd float for
awhile and then they'd

01:09:45.124 --> 01:09:47.210
lock it in with something
really specific.

01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:50.830
That's one of things I work
on with some of my students.

01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:52.939
Play a phrase, it
floats, and then play

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:54.410
something that really locks in.

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:56.951
So that you know the difference,
you can hear the difference,

01:09:56.951 --> 01:09:59.280
and you can feel the
difference in your hands

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:04.720
as to what the different--
whatever your instrument is.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.890
So you can feel the difference,
how it affects the music

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:09.950
and how it affects
your improvisation.

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:12.440
So, yeah that's
another great-- there's

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.160
all these exercises, etudes,
whatever you want to call them,

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:18.570
for improvisations
which are great to do.

01:10:18.570 --> 01:10:21.340
GREG HOPKINS: Transcribing
is really good,

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:23.969
because you can't really
notate jazz rhythms.

01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:25.510
You can write the
notes down, but you

01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:27.750
can't notate how
they're playing them.

01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:29.780
So you've got to listen.

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:32.410
And now copy Miles'
articulation,

01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:35.180
or Clifford Brown's
articulation, or whoever,

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.499
Chet Baker.

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:39.540
Because they would all
play a little differently,

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:43.980
but-- it's all the tongue.

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:44.896
It's all articulation.

01:10:47.899 --> 01:10:49.440
Because it's wind
instruments, I mean

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.470
that's where a lot of
the language comes from.

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:54.220
And piano.

01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:56.170
TIM RAY: But even with
piano or guitar, still,

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:58.980
the articulation makes
all the difference.

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:01.335
You could do a whole solo
just based on two notes.

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:11.120
And be somewhat interesting.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.078
I mean, it's not going
to be super interesting,

01:11:13.078 --> 01:11:16.120
but just two notes with
articulation and strong

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.800
rhythms, you can make
an interesting solo.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.110
Like I say, on any instrument.

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:22.360
I think that's true.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.980
Drummers do it.

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.606
That's how they solo.

01:11:26.606 --> 01:11:29.070
It's all about how
they hit the thing.

01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.930
They don't have 88
keys to play with,

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:33.325
they've just got four
drums and a couple symbols.

01:11:33.325 --> 01:11:35.075
GREG HOPKINS: And for
the wind instruments

01:11:35.075 --> 01:11:37.200
it's really just a matter
of slurring and tonguing.

01:11:44.274 --> 01:11:45.690
Some short notes,
some long notes,

01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:47.065
some slurred notes
in the middle.

01:11:55.345 --> 01:11:56.720
You've got to
tongue but it can't

01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.700
be-- you can't
tongue too hard or it

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.920
sounds too much
like a classical.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:09.120
It's got to have the funkiness
and looseness of the swing.

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:14.130
So yeah, working on your
articulation is very important.

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:16.775
That's what we do, right?

01:12:16.775 --> 01:12:18.275
GUEST SPEAKER:
Unfortunately I think

01:12:18.275 --> 01:12:20.447
we have to wrap because
it's the end of the period.

01:12:20.447 --> 01:12:22.030
GREG HOPKINS: Is it
3 o'clock already?

01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:23.071
GUEST SPEAKER: It's 3:30.

01:12:23.071 --> 01:12:24.147
GREG HOPKINS: It's 3:30?

01:12:24.147 --> 01:12:25.230
I'm going to get a ticket.

01:12:28.345 --> 01:12:32.258
GUEST SPEAKER: So let's give
a round of applause for Greg.

01:12:32.258 --> 01:12:35.120
GREG HOPKINS: Thank you.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.449
Yeah, good play.

01:12:36.449 --> 01:12:37.490
TIM RAY: Yeah, nice play.

01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:38.800
GREG HOPKINS: And have no fear.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.190
Have no fear.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:43.752
Play whatever you want.

01:12:43.752 --> 01:12:46.160
And try and hear it.
