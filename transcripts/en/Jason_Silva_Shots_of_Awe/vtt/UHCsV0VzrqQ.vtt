[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.340
JASON SILVA: So first of all,
thank you all for being here.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.620
My name is Jason Silva.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.172
I'm the host of the
TV show "Brain Games"

00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:11.630
on the National
Geographic Channel.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.430
I'm also the creator
of "Shots of Awe"

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.820
in partnership with
Discovery Digital Networks.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.300
And I'm really honored to
be here today with you guys

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.220
and with my very dear
friend Steven Kotler, who

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.520
is a "New York Times"
best-selling author,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.030
brilliant thinker, co-founder
of the Flow Genome Project,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.800
and just one of my favorite
people in the world.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.800
And we've been having
these mind jams every time

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.160
we hang out here in New York.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.610
We've never recorded it.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.500
So we thought, why don't
we get together and put

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.390
this on camera, and
invite a bunch of people,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.890
and let's talk about creativity,
innovation, flow states,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.840
and all that good stuff.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.757
So Steven, what's up?

00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:50.840
STEVEN KOTLER: Hey, Jason.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.450
I don't know how
I top that intro.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.360
JASON SILVA: Well,
that was just to set up

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.660
a little bit of context.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.840
But to really get
things started,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.890
I'm going to ask you
to define flow states.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.849
This is your specialty.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.670
So for those that are not
familiar with the concept,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.840
even though we keep hearing
about it in the press,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.260
we keep hearing about it in
the media-- welcome, welcome.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.759
Have a seat.

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.490
Yes.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.495
But flow states are associated
with peak human performance,

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:18.995
right?

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.120
It's when we seemingly
achieve the impossible.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.292
So tell us, what
are flow states?

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:24.750
STEVEN KOTLER: So
you may know flow

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.860
by a lot of other
synonyms-- runner's high,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.620
being in the zone.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.410
If you're a basketball player,
you call it being unconscious.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.344
If you were a beatnik
jazz musician,

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:34.760
you called it being
in the pocket.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.890
If you're a stand-up comic,
you call it the forever box.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.650
Flow is sort of
a technical term.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.081
And it is technically
defined as an optimal state

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:43.830
of consciousness, a
state of consciousness

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.390
where we perform our best
and we feel our best.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.290
It refers to those moments
of rapt attention and total

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.667
absorption, where we get so
focused on the task at hand

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:56.000
that everything else disappears.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.820
So your sense of self, your
sense of self-consciousness,

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.210
they vanish completely.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.380
Time dilates, which is
a fancy way of saying it

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.710
passes strangely.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.400
So sometimes it speeds
up, and five hours

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.810
will go by in five minutes.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.082
And occasionally it
slows down, and you'll

00:02:10.082 --> 00:02:12.040
get that freeze-frame
effect-- maybe any of you

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.590
have been in a car crash
or seen "The Matrix."

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.300
And throughout, all
aspects of performance--

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.450
that's mental and physical--
go through the roof.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.220
And if you want a quick
and dirty definition of it,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.950
flow is as close to
picture-perfect decision

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.140
making as we can
possibly get, which is

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.560
where the state gets its name.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.150
In the state of
flow, every decision,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.390
every action leads seamlessly,
fluidly, perfectly,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.000
to the next.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.670
Flow feels flowy.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.577
So it's actually
a technical term.

00:02:39.577 --> 00:02:41.410
It came out of, actually,
one of the largest

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.760
psychological studies ever done.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.968
And when they were interviewing
people, about it they

00:02:44.968 --> 00:02:46.360
kept using this term, flow.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.400
So that's where it came from.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.540
JASON SILVA: So I'm
obsessed with flow states.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.770
I've experienced them regularly.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.480
But since I was a
little kid, when

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.880
I got into this wonderfully
inspired headspace--

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.450
everything seemed effortless--
but creating a flow state,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.060
eliciting a flow state,
catalyzing a flow state,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.300
has always been
kind of enigmatic.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.350
It's like peak experience,
this haphazard phenomenon that

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.710
sometimes emerges and
sometimes it doesn't.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.310
But as a control freak, I've
always wanted to understand,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.730
what are the precursors for
triggering these ecstatic

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.496
moments, these
highly lucid moments.

00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:23.870
And for me it's
always been, when

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.036
it comes to writing, when
it comes to speaking, when

00:03:26.036 --> 00:03:29.220
it comes to, as you say, lateral
thinking, free association,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.260
connecting the
dots in a new way.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.920
And you guys-- you and Jamie
Wheal, part of the Flow Genome

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.550
Project-- have started to
really peek beneath the lid,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.720
so to speak, and figure out
what's going on in the brain

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.630
when we go into
these flow states.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.790
Now, you guys are
saying, what I remember

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.100
reading is the advances in
psychology, neurobiology,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.670
psychopharmacology, and
technology, all these four

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.390
pillars are advancing so fast,
that now all of a sudden,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.840
we get to see what's going on.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.820
We get to stop speaking
in woo-woo terms,

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.550
and be like, what's happening,
and how can we reproduce this,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.432
and how can we benefit from it.

00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:07.640
So tell me about these
advances and what you guys are

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.780
doing with Flow Genome Project.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.840
STEVEN KOTLER: Yeah.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.630
We can actually,
believe it or not,

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.630
thank George Bush Sr. for this.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.710
1990, declared it the
Decade of the Brain.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.810
And money flooded
into neuroscience.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.709
And most it was spent on
neuroimaging technology.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.260
So we got really, really good
at peering inside the brain

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.930
and figuring out
what's going on.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.280
So for the very first
time in history,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.900
we actually are now starting
to decode what happens in flow.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.690
And I'll just give you a
little bit of the neuroscience,

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.250
just so you have some context.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.560
Two main things are important.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.379
From a neuroanatomical level,
normally the old idea of what

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.420
happened about ultimate
performance--and I'm sure

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.690
you're all familiar with
it-- the 10% brain myth,

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.750
the idea that we're only
using 10% of our brain.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.840
So ultimate
performance, aka flow,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.260
must be the full
brain on overdrive.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.230
Turns out we had it
exactly backwards.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.252
In flow, parts of the brain
are not becoming hyperactive.

00:04:59.252 --> 00:05:00.502
They're actually deactivating.

00:05:00.502 --> 00:05:01.990
They're shutting down.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.180
The technical term for this is
transient-- meaning temporary--

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.930
hypo, H-Y-P-O, it's
the opposite of hyper,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.490
it means to slow down, to
shut down, to deactivate--

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.890
frontality, which refers
to the prefrontal cortex,

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.870
the part of your brain
that's right back here.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.317
Prefrontal cortex is
your executive function.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.150
It's all of your higher
cognitive functions.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.750
It's the part that you
most associate with you,

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.920
so your sense of morality,
your sense of will,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.900
your sense of self,
complex decision making.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.830
In flow, that portion
of the brain shuts down.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.460
So why does time pass
so strangely in flow?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.770
Because time, it turns
out, is calculated

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.510
all over the prefrontal cortex.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.760
And as parts of it
start to wink out,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.280
we can no longer separate past,
from present, from future.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.862
We're plunged into what's
called the deep now.

00:05:44.862 --> 00:05:47.070
Another thing that happens
in the prefrontal cortex--

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.685
and this is probably
the best part--

00:05:48.685 --> 00:05:50.960
is when the dorsal lateral
prefrontal cortex-- and there's

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.001
going to be a quiz later.

00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:54.000
So I hope you're
all taking notes.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.020
When this portion of
your brain shuts down,

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.020
it does a lot of things.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.450
But one of the most
important things it does,

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.760
is it's your inner critic.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.042
So that nagging,
always-on, defeatist voice

00:06:02.042 --> 00:06:03.750
that's in your head
that doesn't shut up,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.470
that won't leave you
alone, shuts up in flow.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.720
So we experience this
profound liberation.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.520
We are literally free of
ourselves for the first time.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.370
As a result, creativity
goes up, risk-taking

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.500
goes up, et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.810
There's also a
combination of five

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.470
of the most potent
neurochemicals

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.810
the brain can produce.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.300
These are all
performance-enhancing

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.799
chemicals.

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:25.420
But they serve a
second function,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.986
which is they're all
feel-good, pleasure drugs.

00:06:27.986 --> 00:06:29.360
And just to give
you an idea, one

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.943
of the chemicals
that shows up in flow

00:06:30.943 --> 00:06:33.090
is dopamine, which you guys
have probably heard of.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.830
Dopamine-- well, let's back up.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.602
Cocaine is widely considered the
most addictive drug on Earth.

00:06:38.602 --> 00:06:41.060
All that happens when somebody
uses cocaine, is the brain--

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.600
JASON SILVA: They get dopamine.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.040
STEVEN KOTLER:
They get dopamine.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.450
So you get dopamine.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.390
You get endorphins.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.390
And just endorphins are
opiates, natural version

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.130
of heroin or morphine,
just the one our brain

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.610
produces as painkillers.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.370
But the most common
endorphin in the brain

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.660
is 100 times more powerful
than medical morphine.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.130
The combination--
so first of all,

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.870
if you wanted to go out
onto the street and cocktail

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.790
the street drug
versions of this state,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.460
you'd end up dead or in a coma.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.189
Would not work.

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:07.480
Some of the drugs would
actually cancel themselves out.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.940
Your brain does it perfectly.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.280
Which means flow is the most
addictive state on Earth.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.814
We will go extraordinarily
far out of our way

00:07:14.814 --> 00:07:16.980
to get more of it-- as
Jason, I'm sure, will attest.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.890
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:18.960
Well, one of the
things that's blown

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.490
my mind about the attention
that flow has gotten recently

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.270
in the media is that
it's given it a language.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.910
It's given us an ability to
describe the ineffable ecstasy

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.670
of being in that zone,
being in that pocket--

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.780
whether it's the jazz musician
when he is improvising

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.660
and he literally transcends
himself, the basketball player

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.410
achieving the impossible,
the snowboarder,

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.540
the elite athletes pushing
beyond the limits of the sport.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.560
Something is happening
in this moment.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.750
And I remember there was
some science recently

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.480
where they scanned
the brains of rappers.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.660
And they had them
freestyle lyrics, which

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.702
means completely improvised.

00:07:55.702 --> 00:07:58.160
And then, of course, they had
them recite memorized lyrics.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.618
And what they said
is exactly that.

00:07:59.618 --> 00:08:01.790
The lateral prefrontal
cortex, the inner critic,

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.640
the self-editing, goes away.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.240
Or as your partner, Jamie Wheal,
says, your inner Woody Allen.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.050
That self-crippling self-doubt,
that self-consciousness,

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.210
that so often acts
as paralysis for us--

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.240
to be free from that
is such ecstasy.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.630
And so what I'm curious about
is how do you take this and make

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.460
this mainstream?

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.851
Because yes, it is all about
us getting high and entering

00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:27.600
these flow states.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.070
But then what do we do
with these flow states,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.260
when we say we achieve
the impossible?

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.010
You give a lot lectures,
corporate talks

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.130
all over the world because
apparently people doing

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.190
business are 10 times
more productive when

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.130
they achieve flow.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.460
So it's like, can you grab this
high that artists are using,

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.940
that athletes are using, and
bring it into the workplace,

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.070
and bring it into
these new spaces

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.184
so that we can essentially
upgrade society.

00:08:47.184 --> 00:08:48.600
I mean, this is
an ambitious idea,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.020
but this is what you guys are
doing at Flow Genome, right?

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.310
STEVEN KOTLER: It is
kind of what we're doing.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.240
And they're not 10 times-- so
McKinsey did a 10-year study.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.820
And they found top
executives in flow

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.320
are five times more productive.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.130
So it's 500% more productive.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.670
It means you could
go to work on Monday,

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.810
spend Monday in a flow
state, take Tuesday

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.570
through Friday off,
and get as much done

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.930
as your steady-state peers.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.190
That's how much of an
amplification in performance

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.280
you're actually talking about.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.810
What we now know is--
and it's interesting.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:19.971
So for a really long
time, studying flow

00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:22.095
was problematic because
how do you know if somebody

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:22.550
was in a flow state?

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.910
You had to give them a
subjective questionnaire.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.480
And it's flimsy science.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.490
And it's extremely
well-validated questionnaire.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.240
There's about 50 years'
worth of research.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.730
But what started happening
in the past 25 years

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.500
is, for reasons I'll get to in
a second, action adventure sport

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.800
athletes-- snowboarders,
skiers, surfers,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.980
whatnot-- they got
better at reliably

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.895
and repeatedly reproducing
the state of flow than anybody

00:09:45.895 --> 00:09:47.770
else pretty much in the
history of the world.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.815
As a result, we've seen
near-exponential growth

00:09:50.815 --> 00:09:53.190
in ultimate human performance
in action adventure sports.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.530
So incredible things have
happened in the past 25 years.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.260
More impossible feats had
been done than ever before.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.380
From a research
perspective, they gave us

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.210
something we've never
had before, which

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.470
is at the upper
level of competition,

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.590
these men and women
are performing at--

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.150
if they're not in flow, they're
going home in a body bag.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.730
Or they're going
to the hospital.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.330
So suddenly, our
research subjects,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.030
if they lived through
the experience,

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.570
we knew they were in flow.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:21.480
And having this as a backdrop,
a data set to work with,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.010
has allowed us to
work backwards.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.320
We now know there are 17
triggers, 17 pre-conditions

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.410
that lead to more flow.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.493
And we also know there's
something called the flow

00:10:30.493 --> 00:10:33.550
cycle, a four-stage process
the state moves through,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.650
which is sort of the
map of the territory.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.941
You combine these things,
like we do at the Flow Genome

00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:39.794
Project-- and this
isn't, I mean there's

00:10:39.794 --> 00:10:41.210
lots of different
people out there

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.500
teaching flow and whatnot.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.587
But I'll just give
you our numbers.

00:10:44.587 --> 00:10:46.670
We've taught-- I don't
even know how many people--

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.430
thousands of people
at this point.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.524
On average, when people
come through our courses--

00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:52.690
six-week course, by the
way, not even a hard course.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.023
The homework's a little strange.

00:10:54.023 --> 00:10:56.320
But it's a six-week course.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.990
People are reporting a fivefold,
so a 500%, increase in flow,

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.470
a 500% increase in creativity,
and a 300% increase

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:04.720
in self-confidence.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.989
And the last one, by the
way, self-confidence--

00:11:06.989 --> 00:11:08.780
we had no idea that it
was going to happen.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.905
It was just something that
emerged out of the data.

00:11:10.905 --> 00:11:12.810
We were really shocked by it.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.680
But yes, the state is
entirely trainable.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.420
And as we get better
at our neuroscience,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.170
it's going to get more
and more trainable.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.290
JASON SILVA: So eventually
we'll get to the point

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.248
that we can literally be
able to press a button

00:11:23.248 --> 00:11:25.650
and get into our highest
state, so to speak.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.191
STEVEN KOTLER: You
can do it already.

00:11:27.191 --> 00:11:29.600
I mean, so one of the ways
they induce flow artificially

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.380
now is transcranial
magnetic stimulation.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.880
They literally shoot a
big neuromagnetic pulse

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.840
through the brain.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.440
They knock out the
prefrontal cortex,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.980
inducing artificial flow,
kicking people into flow.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.160
DARPA did this.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.550
They took a group of snipers
and they trained them up in flow

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.430
by knocking out the
prefrontal cortex.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.980
They found they learned 200%
to 500% faster than normal.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.820
They redid the study with
novice, nonmilitary archers,

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.300
riflemen, and pistol shooters--
three different categories.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.740
They found the time it takes
to go from novice to expert

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.780
can be cut in half by flow.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.857
So yes, there is
already a button for it.

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:06.190
JASON SILVA: Which is wonderful.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.000
So besides it
being a wonderfully

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.690
smart and productive technique
to assimilate and to learn,

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.700
there's also its
connection fundamentally

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.880
to the human condition.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.990
Jamie Wheal had a
wonderful TEDx Talk

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.730
called-- your partner--
from "Altered States

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.590
to Altered Traits" and this
idea of hacking the flow state.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.530
He said most of us, while we
recognize these flow states,

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:32.910
we get hooked on the state
instead of raising the stage.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.260
So we go there.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.310
But then when we come back into
ourselves Monday morning again

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.810
and it's like, what
the fuck, right?

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:39.130
STEVEN KOTLER: Right.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.900
JASON SILVA: And part of the
thing that he was talking about

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.710
is that if you think
of our self systems,

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.590
the way that our
homeostasis right now,

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.050
we're like a colander.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.440
And we're full of holes.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.251
And no matter how much flow
we pour in, we're draining.

00:12:50.251 --> 00:12:52.000
So you have to be
constantly pouring it in

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.530
to achieve any kind
of equilibrium.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.190
But then he talks about the
idea of turning our colander

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:00.420
into a chalice so that we could
literally make flow the default

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.340
condition.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.820
Now, technology is
advancing exponentially.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.030
We have new construction
kits for our reality.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.270
You explore this in abundance
in "Bold" and your new book

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.640
"Tomorrowland."

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.180
Can you speculate about how
we might raise the stage,

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.557
reverse-engineer ourselves,
creating a default flow state?

00:13:19.557 --> 00:13:21.390
STEVEN KOTLER: It's an
interesting question.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.670
One thing for sure, there's no
such thing as a permanent flow

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.660
state.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.975
JASON SILVA: Bummer.

00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:29.350
STEVEN KOTLER:
The neurochemicals

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.700
that produce flow
are in short supply.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.630
So once you burn
through them, and you

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.030
can burn through some
of them in 20-- dopamine

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.946
and norepinephrine will
burn out of your brain

00:13:37.946 --> 00:13:38.880
in about 20 minutes.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.510
Takes a little while
to replenish them.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.934
So there's no--
occasionally people

00:13:42.934 --> 00:13:45.350
will come up to me like, I
live in a permanent flow state.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.250
And I'm like, yeah.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:47.249
We have a word for that.

00:13:47.249 --> 00:13:48.980
We call it schizophrenia.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.670
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.165
STEVEN KOTLER: So you don't
get to live in a permanent flow

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:52.360
state.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.650
You can cycle through it.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.820
And you can shorten the
distance between cycles very,

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.380
very quickly.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.520
So you can move through it.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.480
There's a lot ninjutsu to there.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.760
But I mean, what does
it mean for society

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.897
if the 500% more productivity,
if you just-- I'm

00:14:05.897 --> 00:14:07.480
going to throw out
some other numbers.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.090
And they seem
really, really wonky.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.110
And we don't have
enough time to go

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.430
into them because they're huge.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.370
Creativity in flow,
500% to 700% amplified.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.360
Motivation goes up
a similar level.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.180
Learning goes up
a similar level.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.530
So think about what this
means for education.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.170
There's studies done on college.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.070
If we can get kids through
college in three years,

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.550
the savings and
the amount of money

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.254
that comes into the
economy is significant.

00:14:31.254 --> 00:14:32.920
How do you accelerate
learning that way?

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.470
We know how.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.430
Flow will already do it.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.000
We know that flow massively
increases the immune system.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.980
It boosts the immune system
and resets the nervous system.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.660
Herb Benson at
Harvard has said he

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.740
thinks that flow is
responsible for most

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.719
cases of so-called
spontaneous healing.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:49.010
He thinks it's actually the
neurobiology of flow that's

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:49.702
underneath it.

00:14:49.702 --> 00:14:52.160
That may be overstepping the
case, as far as I'm concerned.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.350
But it's still intriguing
and worth pursuing.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:59.050
So health care, education,
technology, on, and on, and on.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.720
What it does is it puts
society into hyperdrive,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.479
or at least I think it does.

00:15:03.479 --> 00:15:04.520
JASON SILVA: I love this.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.182
So I want to connect this back
to the idea of technology,

00:15:07.182 --> 00:15:08.890
because you write a
lot about technology.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.900
And we've bonded around our
shared love of new construction

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:12.910
kits for our reality.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.340
But OK, so we live
during disruptive times.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.650
We live during
exponential times.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.020
Everything is changing.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.810
Nobody really understands
why until they

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.540
understand exponential change.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.310
Ray Kurzweil from Google
explains, we think linearly.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.620
Our brains evolved in a
linear and local world.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.250
But we live in a world
now that is exponential.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.130
And the best example is 30
linear steps gets you to 30;

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.890
30 exponential steps
gets you to a billion.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:37.980
Now, what does this mean?

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.250
It means that the smartphone
in your pocket today

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.790
is a million times cheaper,
a million times smaller,

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.750
a thousand times more
powerful than what

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.410
used to be a $60 million
supercomputer that

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.050
was half a building
in size 40 years ago.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.580
It means a young kid in
the savannas of Africa

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.880
with a smartphone has
better communications

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.740
technology than the US
president had 25 years ago.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.660
So new tools for new
realities, new possibilities.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.315
Now, you co-wrote
"Abundance," bestselling book

00:16:03.315 --> 00:16:04.190
with Peter Diamandis.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.830
You just released "Bold."

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.610
And now you're releasing
"Tomorrowland," where science

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.760
fiction becomes science fact.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.550
So talk to me.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:16.510
Muse with me a little bit about
this idea of these new brain

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.272
scaffoldings that
we're creating and how

00:16:18.272 --> 00:16:19.730
they're ushering
in new possibility

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.740
spaces for ourselves.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.281
And then tell me if
you think there's

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:25.380
a connection between whether we
can leverage these flow states,

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.170
if these new tools
require new minds in order

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.932
to build the future
we want to build.

00:16:31.932 --> 00:16:33.265
STEVEN KOTLER: It's interesting.

00:16:33.265 --> 00:16:34.681
The thing that's
interesting to me

00:16:34.681 --> 00:16:36.930
about, and that I focus
on in "Tomorrowland,"

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.140
is the next step out.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.920
Yes, we all know
that science fiction

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.130
is becoming science fact.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.840
And that's everywhere.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.990
The random fact of the week--
50% of your body can now be

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.895
replaced by bionics--

00:16:47.895 --> 00:16:48.770
JASON SILVA: Amazing.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.380
STEVEN KOTLER: which is insane.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.170
What's really interesting
to me about all this stuff

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.590
is, for example, bionics.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.420
Not only do we have bionic
limbs for replacement parts

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.850
and things like that for
paraplegics and quadriplegics.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.280
But we're starting to
get exoskeletons, so

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.460
strap-on braces.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.319
There are now ankle braces
and knee braces, bionic ankle

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.780
braces and knee braces
for the elderly.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.140
And they put energy
back into the system.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.329
Our brain evolved in such
a way that getting old

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.050
was something that happened.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.760
There was nothing we
could do about it.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.089
And the number one
complaint about getting old

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:24.619
is a loss of mobility.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:28.322
So we now have technology that
is taking that away here today.

00:17:28.322 --> 00:17:30.780
And it's only getting better,
because as Jason pointed out,

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.750
these are all on
exponential growth curves.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.500
So what's interesting to
me about the transformation

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.916
of science fiction
to science fact

00:17:35.916 --> 00:17:37.944
is less about the
whiz-bang technologies,

00:17:37.944 --> 00:17:39.360
and more about the
fact that we're

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.530
starting to fuck with really
deep evolutionarily adaptive

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.390
systems.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.760
We're starting to
really poke into what

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.430
it means to be human at
a really, really, really

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.087
deep level.

00:17:50.087 --> 00:17:51.920
And it's going to start
getting interesting.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.945
Because a lot of
the things-- it's

00:17:52.945 --> 00:17:54.111
not even our belief systems.

00:17:54.111 --> 00:17:56.480
It's the things that our
belief systems are built on.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.880
JASON SILVA: It's the substrate.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.440
STEVEN KOTLER: Exactly.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.050
That's exactly true.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:00.820
JASON SILVA: It's a great line
about Edward O. Wilson, where

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.920
he says, we have decommissioned
natural selection.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.760
And now we must look
deep within ourselves

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.800
to decide what we
wish to become.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.050
I mean, we've already
changed the physical,

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.120
the external, world.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.320
If you look at a
city, what is that?

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.990
Congealed intent, as
McKenna would say,

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.650
congealed imagination.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.630
If you look at the
topography of Manhattan,

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.490
that's shaped more by
mind, and agency, and will,

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.230
and technology than
it is by geology.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.070
So the mind has already
trumped matter in so many ways.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.210
But it's like, now we're
experiencing a recursion,

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.600
because now we're folding the
mind in on itself to start

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.530
to play with biology itself.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.640
So biotechnology, mastering
the information processes

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.520
of biology,
rewriting our genome.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.370
Having invented the gods,
we can turn into them.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.884
STEVEN KOTLER:
And the one-- I'll

00:18:41.884 --> 00:18:44.050
give you one example if we
want to talk about really

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:46.970
crazy technology, mind
uploading, the idea that we

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.310
can store ourselves
in silicon, upload

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.640
our brains into computers.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.290
And it sounds absolutely crazy,
sounds like make-believe.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.627
People are working on it today.

00:18:55.627 --> 00:18:57.210
And it's actually a
multi-part system.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.620
And a couple of the parts,
like the playback mechanism,

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.600
we have already.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.480
The VR devices that are at
Facebook, the next generation

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.940
of Oculus can play it back.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.680
We've already got
things that we can

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.140
plant in the brain that
can record basically all

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.070
the inputs of all your senses.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.250
So nobody quite knows what
it is that constructs a life.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.730
But pretty soon, if we go
by Ray Kurzweil's numbers--

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.380
and maybe you can, and maybe
you can't-- but his numbers,

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.230
by 2045, we'll be able to
simulate a brain inside

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.810
a computer.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.100
Which means we'll be able to
store ourselves in a computer.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.475
So the interesting
question to me

00:19:27.475 --> 00:19:31.030
is, think about
how much blood has

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.780
been spilled in the past hundred
years in the name of religion.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.170
Think about how
much religion uses

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.080
the threat of the hereafter
to steer morality and shape

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.190
behavior.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.000
But what happens to
theological morality

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.060
in the face of
technological immortality?

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.890
And it sounds like
a crazy question,

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.890
but it's a question we're
going to actually have

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.044
to deal with this century.

00:19:50.044 --> 00:19:51.460
JASON SILVA: I
mean, it's no joke.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.060
I mean, Larry Page
from Google is

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.200
funding Calico, the California
life extension company.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.410
Craig Venter created the
first artificial life form.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:00.076
And when they asked
him, are you worried

00:20:00.076 --> 00:20:02.400
about playing God, he
said, who's playing?

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.020
I mean, there are
legitimately brilliant,

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.140
smart, accomplished people
invested in this stuff.

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.850
And the fact-- I
mean, what is it?

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.600
It was Freeman Dyson that
says in the very near future,

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.370
a new generation of artists will
write genomes with the fluency

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.710
that Blake and
Byron wrote verses.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.190
So if you think of technology as
a conduit to new possibilities,

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.100
new modes of human expression,
new modes of human agency-- so

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.790
the technology of
the oil painting

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.194
allowed van Gogh to emerge.

00:20:29.194 --> 00:20:30.860
The technology of the
musical instrument

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.460
allowed Beethoven's genius.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.310
What are we going to
make with biology?

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.750
What are our artists
going to "imagineer"

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.492
with the canvas of life?

00:20:39.492 --> 00:20:41.450
STEVEN KOTLER: And it
sounds crazy, by the way.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.980
What he's saying sounds crazy.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.550
But synthetic biology--
which essentially

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.850
treats genetic code
like computer code-- it

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.940
allows us to write
life from scratch.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.359
Right now, it's new fuels,
new foods, new medicines.

00:20:52.359 --> 00:20:53.900
But a guy named
Andrew Hessel-- who's

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.845
a friend of ours,
who's at Autodesk,

00:20:55.845 --> 00:20:57.720
he's a distinguished
researcher at Autodesk--

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.070
is literally building
a DNA typewriter,

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.640
meaning it's a
user-friendly interface

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.390
for synthetic biology.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.600
So if you imagine what
happened to the web,

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.890
the web had been
around for 20 years.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.950
Nobody but computer
scientists and the military

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.750
are using it, because
there was no way to get on.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.166
You had to be a
computer scientist

00:21:14.166 --> 00:21:15.270
if you wanted to play.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.406
Marc Andreessen
comes along in 1993.

00:21:17.406 --> 00:21:20.230
He creates Mosaic,
which becomes Netscape.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.470
And we have 26 websites online
in 1993, 10,000 the next year,

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.100
and a million the year after.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.080
Andrew's creating
a DNA typewriter,

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.830
which is a
user-friendly interface

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.850
for synthetic biology.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.050
So this idea that artists are
going to be programming life

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:38.560
and creating in life is probably
five to 10 years away, longest.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.100
This is, it's here now.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.450
And I have no idea
what comes next.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.330
What I do think-- and
I've said this before.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.500
It's always been, especially
with these [? edge ?]

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.735
technologies, there's
always subculture

00:21:49.735 --> 00:21:50.930
that drives it forward.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.650
And there's this-- I call
it the rebel instinct.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.740
Each generation seems to
outdo the next generation.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.030
So we did weird hair.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.530
And then we did weird clothes.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.745
And then we did body piercings
and some low-grade tattoos.

00:22:02.745 --> 00:22:04.620
And then we started
doing body modifications.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.890
And now we're doing
biohacking, the cutting edge.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.504
People are inserting
technology into their body.

00:22:09.504 --> 00:22:10.920
So I think what
we're going to see

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.985
is the punk rockers of the
future with cat eyes, and cat

00:22:15.985 --> 00:22:18.110
tails, and angel--
there's already a guy.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.735
"Harper's" did that
story about the guy

00:22:19.735 --> 00:22:22.030
who's trying to build angel
wings that are surgically

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:22.784
implanted.

00:22:22.784 --> 00:22:23.700
This is what's coming.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.060
So I do think it's
going to be a punk rock

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.300
ethos that drives this forward.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:33.400
JASON SILVA: Now I want to ask
you about this idea of-- see,

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.097
I think this stuff
is astonishing.

00:22:35.097 --> 00:22:37.430
I think if you pay attention
to what's happening-- well,

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.125
if you pay attention to
anything-- as Darwin used

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:41.850
to say, "Attention,
if sudden and close,

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.540
graduates into surprise;
and this into astonishment;

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.135
and this into
stupefied amazement."

00:22:46.135 --> 00:22:48.343
And yet most of us don't
pay attention to this stuff.

00:22:48.343 --> 00:22:52.100
Most of us go through our day,
kind of busy, kind of bored,

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.740
kind of waiting for the next
hit of some kind of ecstasy.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.300
But I mean, we don't lose sleep
over these transformations.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.970
We are not in a permanent
state of astonishment.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.950
Can you tell me about
the brain chemistry

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.210
of why we are walking around
half asleep most of the time,

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:09.930
instead of marveling at
these new possibilities that

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.805
are emerging, that are
going to fundamentally

00:23:11.805 --> 00:23:13.320
be changing humanity?

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.749
Why isn't this on the front
page of everything, every day?

00:23:15.749 --> 00:23:17.790
I mean, I know you write
about this for "Forbes."

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.498
I know you're seeing
more and more of it.

00:23:19.498 --> 00:23:21.740
But it's not everywhere
the way it should be.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.810
I mean, why isn't everybody
talking about this

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.627
all the time?

00:23:25.627 --> 00:23:27.210
STEVEN KOTLER: That's
a real question?

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.126
JASON SILVA: Honestly.

00:23:28.126 --> 00:23:30.330
Yes.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.335
STEVEN KOTLER: Well, I
don't know, actually.

00:23:32.335 --> 00:23:33.210
I wonder that myself.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.585
JASON SILVA: But don't you
think that there is an urgency

00:23:35.585 --> 00:23:38.620
here, the self determination
of the species being at stake.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.080
We should be setting
up playgrounds

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.802
for new evolutionary paradigms
to be experimented with.

00:23:43.802 --> 00:23:45.760
STEVEN KOTLER: If you
want a biological answer,

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.130
it's the amygdala, which
is the part of your brain

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:49.120
that generates fear.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.540
And so consciousness
explained very, very simply,

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.270
the brain takes in a
whole lot of information.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.070
And there's a bunch of filters.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.785
And the filters are
in front of what

00:24:00.785 --> 00:24:02.660
is pattern recognition
and future prediction.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.770
That's all that's going on
at a really deep level--

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.144
information coming
in, grabbed by

00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:08.000
the senses, bunch of filters.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.540
And then we're
looking for patterns.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.500
And then we're
making predictions

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.166
into the future based
on those patterns.

00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:14.770
That's essentially what your
brain is doing at all times.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.770
The first filter everything
hits is your amygdala.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.880
It's where all information goes.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.390
Why?

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.970
Because the amygdala
governs fight or flight,

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.900
safety and security.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.027
So fear--

00:24:26.027 --> 00:24:27.360
JASON SILVA: Gets our attention.

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.443
STEVEN KOTLER: It gets--
but it's the first filter

00:24:29.443 --> 00:24:30.160
anybody puts up.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.470
It's the very first thing
anything that scares you,

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:36.510
and all our cognitive biases
exist to narrow reality.

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.940
If you look at what the
cognitive biases do,

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.200
they're information
processing shortcuts.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.760
All biases are like processing
shortcuts gone wrong,

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.760
because we take in
so much information.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.870
They've done
calculations, on average--

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.880
and if you go by
the old numbers,

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.000
it's 11 million bits of
information a second.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.500
If you go by the
new numbers, it's

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.320
400 billion bits of
information a second.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.165
Whatever the case--

00:24:58.165 --> 00:24:58.420
JASON SILVA: It's
what's coming in.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.920
STEVEN KOTLER: --the
brain-- what's coming in.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.640
The brain is
massively overwhelmed.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.951
Your working memory can hold
about 40 bits of information

00:25:04.951 --> 00:25:05.450
at once.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:07.000
That's all you can
hold in your head,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.930
and you've got 400
billion bits coming in.

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:13.640
So almost everything that
we think of as reality

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.840
is not reality, obviously.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.340
It just gets thrown out.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.170
And the first thing
that's throwing it out

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:19.530
is anything you're scared of.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.660
So why is this not
on the front page?

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.709
Because all this stuff is scary.

00:25:23.709 --> 00:25:24.750
It can go horribly wrong.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.337
We were talking about what's
great with synthetic biology

00:25:27.337 --> 00:25:28.920
and what artists are
going to produce.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.490
I wrote an article
for "The Atlantic"

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:34.120
not too long ago about
customizable bioweapons that

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.230
can target individual people--
meaning I could now assassinate

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.150
the president using
synthetic biology,

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.790
and he's going to
think he got a cold.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.440
And it's only targeting
the president.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.600
And it's doable today.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.094
So this stuff gets scary fast.

00:25:46.094 --> 00:25:48.260
JASON SILVA: But see, that
does get very scary fast.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.950
But when the answer-- yes.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.954
But the answer that
I found Kurzweil

00:25:52.954 --> 00:25:54.620
has given, that I
found very compelling,

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.850
is he said, well, that's
always been the case.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.000
Technology has always
been a double-edged sword.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.360
Fire can cook our foods
or burn our enemies.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.360
Perhaps the most powerful
information technology

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.320
that's ever been
created is the alphabet.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.120
And the alphabet can
be used to compose

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.240
beautiful Shakespearean sonnets
that expand our interior world.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.940
But the alphabet
can also be used

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.972
to move people to kill each
other, and kill the other,

00:26:14.972 --> 00:26:15.930
and so on and so forth.

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:18.870
So it's like, these
tools extend our will.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.810
But they can extend our
will in any direction.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.690
So yes, it's up to
us to make sure we

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.850
use these things wisely.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.737
But that's always been the case.

00:26:27.737 --> 00:26:29.570
And we haven't destroyed
ourselves thus far.

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.070
So I think we have a
pretty good track record.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.350
Also, if you look at the
work of Steven Pinker,

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.320
he says the world
has been getting

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.028
less violent for the
last couple decades.

00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:38.500
The world is less violent
now than it's ever been,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.060
contrary to the doom and gloom
things we see in the media.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.490
So do you think
that there's hope

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.000
that, in spite of these new
tools being more dangerous,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.620
we somehow will
have the conscience

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:48.674
to not destroy ourselves?

00:26:48.674 --> 00:26:50.340
STEVEN KOTLER: I don't
know if we're not

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.160
going to destroy ourselves.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.576
I will-- to pull it back to
flow states, one of the things

00:26:53.576 --> 00:26:56.454
that we know about
flow-- and a lot of this

00:26:56.454 --> 00:26:57.995
has to do with all
the neurochemicals

00:26:57.995 --> 00:26:59.360
that show up in flow.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.090
Besides all the
performance enhancement

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.690
and their addictive
nature, they're

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:04.004
all social bonding chemicals.

00:27:04.004 --> 00:27:05.920
So if flow is one of
these technologies that's

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.000
going to drive us
into the future--

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.370
all of the social
bonding chemicals, all

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.240
the norepinephrine and
dopamine which show up in flow,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.260
that's romantic love.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.430
Endorphins, that's
maternal love.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.070
Anandamide is that same kind
of psychoactive chemical

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:23.014
that's in marijuana, makes
you open to new ideas,

00:27:23.014 --> 00:27:23.930
and love your friends.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.230
JASON SILVA: We love that.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.600
STEVEN KOTLER: So these are
really potent social bonding

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.100
chemicals.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.330
The point is that
flow expands empathy.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.880
And a lot of these
new technologies

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.804
seem to be able play with that.

00:27:33.804 --> 00:27:34.720
We can expand empathy.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.261
You were talking
about the difference

00:27:36.261 --> 00:27:37.541
between states and stages.

00:27:37.541 --> 00:27:38.540
JASON SILVA: Absolutely.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.414
I mean, when you start
talking about empathy,

00:27:40.414 --> 00:27:43.530
I get excited, because there's
a great line from "Interstellar"

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.580
that talked about how
empathy rarely extends

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.710
beyond our line of sight.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:48.824
And one of the things that
our new technologies do

00:27:48.824 --> 00:27:49.990
is extend our line of sight.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.540
I mean, if you think
virtual reality,

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.310
that potentially is
an engine of empathy.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.101
You put somebody inside
of a virtual space,

00:27:55.101 --> 00:27:58.200
place them in a Syrian refugee
camp, you extend their empathy.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.024
A lot more difficult to ignore.

00:28:00.024 --> 00:28:02.440
So you think the combination
of these external technology,

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.600
and potentially
these flow states

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.280
and this internal
technologies could

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.196
allow us to create a
more empathetic species--

00:28:07.196 --> 00:28:09.730
could actually create
a shift that scales?

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.934
STEVEN KOTLER: Look at
the-- you've got to--

00:28:11.934 --> 00:28:13.600
I disagree with the
"Interstellar" line,

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:14.180
for example.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.230
Because what religion
is, basically,

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:20.880
is a way to extend empathy
beyond clan and kin.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.060
That's what it was.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.399
You go back 500 years.

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:26.940
If I wasn't related to you, if
you didn't live in my village,

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:27.565
you were other.

00:28:27.565 --> 00:28:29.450
And I wanted to fight
you and kill you.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.770
Religion allowed
us to extend that.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.830
Suddenly, oh, wow.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:33.560
He's a Christian?

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.390
I'm a Christian.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.190
OK, we don't have
to kill each other.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.410
So we've seen what
these-- we've also

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.170
seen them backfire, of course.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.400
But we've seen technology,
language, massively

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.980
extend empathy before.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:49.570
This is a much more
visceral version of it.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.570
I mean, I don't think
it's everybody on ecstasy.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.270
But it definitely opens you up.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.910
And you're closer to it.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.610
So I think there's
a lot of hope.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:02.070
But I also think the thing
about exponential technology

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.920
at this point is it does
put the power of God

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.314
into the hands of individuals.

00:29:06.314 --> 00:29:07.730
And that's what's
different today.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:10.240
JASON SILVA: Promethean--
stealing fire from the gods.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.319
Well, tease the name
of your next book.

00:29:13.319 --> 00:29:14.610
STEVEN KOTLER: "Stealing Fire."

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:15.276
JASON SILVA: OK.

00:29:15.276 --> 00:29:18.850
So it was originally-- we
had a whole conversation

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.750
about this idea of
mapping the highest

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.880
possible states of
human consciousness,

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.830
mapping our ecstasies,
creating a kind of cartography

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.130
of ecstatic states.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.060
And so can you talk a little
bit about "Stealing Fire,"

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.550
flow states, and how these
emerging technologies are

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:38.680
allowing us to basically get
higher than we've ever gotten;

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.610
to explore new
spaces of ecstatic

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:44.430
rapture; the neurobiology
of mystical experience;

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:45.530
and so on and so forth.

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:46.850
Hacking nirvana.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:47.950
Beyond flow.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:48.830
Hacking nirvana.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.042
STEVEN KOTLER: Well, so
the idea that-- Jason's

00:29:51.042 --> 00:29:52.750
talking about a book
that I'm writing now

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.010
with my partner on the Flow
Genome Project, Jamie Wheal.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.343
And it's called "Stealing Fire."

00:29:56.343 --> 00:29:59.250
And the core idea is
there's a whole swatch

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:03.230
of experiences-- psychedelic
experiences, drug experiences,

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.766
flow states, so-called mystical
experiences, et cetera, et

00:30:05.766 --> 00:30:06.266
cetera.

00:30:06.266 --> 00:30:08.910
And when you start adding them
together and looking at them,

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.368
first of all what
you find is, from

00:30:10.368 --> 00:30:14.000
a neurobiological perspective,
very, very, very similar.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.130
For example, meditative
states and flow.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:20.936
In flow, the dorsal lateral
prefrontal cortex goes off.

00:30:20.936 --> 00:30:21.810
We talked about that.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:23.393
But another portion
your brain, called

00:30:23.393 --> 00:30:25.420
the medial orbital
prefrontal cortex--

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.260
which is creative
self-expression-- goes crazy,

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.630
becomes really hyperactive.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.987
Because flow, creativity,
goes through the roof,

00:30:31.987 --> 00:30:34.070
this portion of the brain
gets really hyperactive.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.640
In meditative
states, because you

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.540
don't need creative
decision making,

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.010
that portion of the
brain shuts off.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.920
Other things turn up.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.700
When you look at
it, it's basically

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.324
a set of knobs and levers.

00:30:44.324 --> 00:30:45.740
We're turning down
certain things.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.820
We're turning up certain things.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.695
We're turning on certain
things, turning off.

00:30:48.695 --> 00:30:50.700
But it's a set category.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.350
And what we're discovering,
really in the past 100 years,

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.170
and much more in
the past 25 years,

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.810
is there's-- I call it an upper
possibility space of human

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:02.290
experience that has almost
been completely off the map.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.804
And by upper, I mean
north of happiness.

00:31:04.804 --> 00:31:06.720
Things start at happiness,
and they get weird.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.511
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:31:07.511 --> 00:31:10.160
STEVEN KOTLER: But there's
a whole huge space up there

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.360
that we haven't inhabited.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.010
And when people tripped into
it, we thought they were crazy.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:16.620
We burned them at
stakes for a long time,

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.150
or we called them drug addicts.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:20.490
And we wrote them off and
banished them, whatever.

00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:22.250
All this stuff is
being opened up.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.072
And more interestingly,
it's being

00:31:24.072 --> 00:31:25.155
opened up technologically.

00:31:25.155 --> 00:31:28.610
And it seems like when things
get opened up technologically,

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.170
we're less afraid of them.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.620
Michael Persinger
creates the God Helmet.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.940
He basically puts in on, it
shoots electromagnetic fields

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.220
into your right temporal lobe.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.910
We know right temporal
lobe epilepsy,

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:41.787
when this part of the
brain gets excited,

00:31:41.787 --> 00:31:43.120
we have out-of-body experiences.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.226
We have near-death experiences.

00:31:45.226 --> 00:31:46.850
By the way, the same
part of your brain

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.160
gets very excited in dreaming.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.190
So we have this
experience every night.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.287
But we can now stimulate
this with technology.

00:31:53.287 --> 00:31:54.370
Doesn't work all the time.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:55.330
Doesn't work for everybody.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.079
But we're getting
better and better at it.

00:31:57.079 --> 00:31:59.900
And people are-- we might be
hesitant about taking a drug,

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:00.770
or we write it off.

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.389
But if it's
technologically mediated,

00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:03.930
we're a lot more
comfortable with it.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:04.635
JASON SILVA: A lot
more open to it.

00:32:04.635 --> 00:32:06.990
STEVEN KOTLER: It's
allowing us to open up

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:09.360
this really crazy space that
we don't really understand.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.110
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.500
Well, I mean, it
captures my imagination,

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.170
especially when you
say north of happiness.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.170
Because I mean, what is
the self-help movement,

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.330
the happiness movement,
billion-dollar industries.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.180
People trying to figure out
new metrics for happiness

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.388
because it turns out that
getting everything you want

00:32:23.388 --> 00:32:25.240
is not going to make you happy.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.944
And that experiences,
for example,

00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:28.360
are more valuable
than things when

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.780
it comes to longer-form
satisfaction and satiation.

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.630
But we are an
existential species.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.640
We are an agitated species.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.536
With our minds, we can
ponder the infinite.

00:32:38.536 --> 00:32:39.910
Now I'm channeling
Ernest Becker.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:41.472
We can ponder the
infinite, yet we're

00:32:41.472 --> 00:32:44.130
housed in heart pumping, breath
gasping, decaying bodies.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:47.710
So our greatest
ecstasies are haunted,

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.900
are shadowed by the fact
that they are temporary,

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.269
that we are finite-- no
matter how many times we get

00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:54.810
the goosebumps and
are moved to tears

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:57.810
by beautiful art, or beautiful
ecstasy, or beautiful rhapsody.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.310
So my question for
you-- when you're

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.140
talking about
north of happiness,

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.760
technological
mediation, I'm reminded

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.330
of David Pearce's work,
"The Hedonistic Imperative."

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:08.140
Are you familiar
with David Pearce?

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.070
He's a transhumanist
philosopher that

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.620
believes that we are going
to institute a paradise

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.350
engineering, as
he calls it, where

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.320
we're going to be using
new biotechnologies

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.120
and nanotechnologies to
shift our hedonic treadmill

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.680
and to literally
neuroengineer gradients

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.550
of bliss that will make even our
greatest ecstasies today pale.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:29.415
He calls them our Darwinian,
old-school ecstasies

00:33:29.415 --> 00:33:31.040
compared to what
we're going to create.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.930
Where do you stand on
that idea, not just

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.820
in terms of the science, but
in terms of the poet in you?

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.730
Does this excite you, this
idea of creating spaces

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:45.065
so much more north of happy, and
what that's going to be like?

00:33:45.065 --> 00:33:47.440
STEVEN KOTLER: So we have
something called an hedonic set

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:47.940
point.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.780
An hedonic set point
basically means

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:54.600
that somewhere between ages six
and 12, the amount of happiness

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.210
and sadness you're going to
feel in life is pretty much set.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:01.164
It's why you feel the same
emotionally at 10, at 20,

00:34:01.164 --> 00:34:02.510
at 30, at 40.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.661
It's roughly the same
bandwidth of emotion.

00:34:04.661 --> 00:34:06.910
It's because we have these
things called emotional set

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:07.090
points.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.250
And they get locked down.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.530
I'm less interested
in the super-ecstatic.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.949
I just think it's interesting.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:17.334
But it's very bizarre.

00:34:17.334 --> 00:34:19.000
And I have no idea
what comes from that.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.300
But what happens if we
can just shift everybody

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.770
and we're 3% happier?

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.550
And that's really,
really possible.

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.228
For example, we know--
mass amounts of research

00:34:29.228 --> 00:34:30.644
back this up--
that the people who

00:34:30.644 --> 00:34:33.080
have the most flow in
their lives, it's often

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.469
said that people with the
most flow in their lives

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:35.540
are the happiest
people on Earth.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:36.870
And it's actually a misnomer.

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.664
Happiness is a
temporary condition.

00:34:38.664 --> 00:34:40.330
People with the most
flow in their lives

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.690
score off the charts
on life satisfaction

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:43.650
and well being tests.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.950
So it's meaning and it's
overall possibility.

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.199
JASON SILVA: Beyond happiness.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:49.150
STEVEN KOTLER: Right,
it's beyond happiness.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.770
So we know flow, repeated
exposure to flow,

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.840
can shift your
emotional set point.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.310
It's one of the only things
that can actually shift this.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:59.360
So that's where it starts
to get interesting.

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.750
Because we know
this is possible.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:01.880
We know this is doable.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.200
So what happens if we move an
entire society a couple degrees

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.140
up that ladder?

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.314
That's interesting to me.

00:35:07.314 --> 00:35:08.980
JASON SILVA: That's
a happy place to be.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.146
STEVEN KOTLER: Well, it
means a whole lot less fear.

00:35:11.146 --> 00:35:14.000
So that first filter we were
talking about gets damped down.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.466
And then the possibility
space gets really interesting.

00:35:16.466 --> 00:35:17.174
JASON SILVA: Wow.

00:35:17.174 --> 00:35:18.890
That gets me very happy, bro.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.830
STEVEN KOTLER: I'm so glad.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:27.845
JASON SILVA: So can we talk
a little bit about your work?

00:35:27.845 --> 00:35:29.970
People say that people who
live in their flow state

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.930
kind of build their
whole lives around it.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.190
You live in a dog
sanctuary that you

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.934
created, which I think is one
of the most amazing things ever.

00:35:37.934 --> 00:35:40.100
Because you're this amazingly
gifted writer, writing

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.350
all these New York
bestsellers, but you

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:42.450
live with all these dogs.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.700
Can you tell me a little bit
about what you discovered

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.519
about animals, and how that
gets you into your flow state,

00:35:47.519 --> 00:35:48.060
a little bit?

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.190
STEVEN KOTLER: Well,
a couple of things.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.460
JASON SILVA: I'm in awe of
that aspect of your life.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.460
STEVEN KOTLER: I run a animal
sanctuary called Rancho de

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:53.960
Chihuahua.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.330
And we deal with hospice
care and special needs care

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.490
for really sick small dogs.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.374
And really, really sick.

00:36:00.374 --> 00:36:01.790
Most of our animals
show up to us,

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.340
they come directly
from vets often,

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.680
with a month to live, two months
to live, that kind of thing.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.740
Flow is at the heart of
our healing methodology.

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.025
And as I said earlier, it
boosts the immune system.

00:36:11.025 --> 00:36:12.400
It resets the
[INAUDIBLE] system.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.540
Our animals live for
a really long time.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.660
So we actually do put these--
we were talking about,

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.430
is flow trainable?

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:22.330
We put our dogs in
the flow all the time.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:26.097
It's actually not hard.

00:36:26.097 --> 00:36:28.180
By the way, we don't know
if it's all animals that

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.180
are hard-wired for flow.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.320
We know it's dogs.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.470
And we know at some point
down the mammalian chain,

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:34.740
it probably cuts off.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.280
And we don't know where.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.806
But we absolutely know
dogs can get into flow.

00:36:38.806 --> 00:36:40.430
What else do you want
me to talk about?

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.780
JASON SILVA: No, no.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.980
I just wanted you
to talk about that.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.040
But I also want to bring
up the subject, just

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.870
because usually when
I'm in a flow state,

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.200
I'm usually very quickly
marveling at something,

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.270
because I'm a very
curious person.

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:50.820
So I'm always like, I want
to get into a flow state

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.687
and see a movie.

00:36:51.687 --> 00:36:53.270
I want to get into
a flow state and go

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:55.310
for a walk in some
beautiful spot,

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.870
maybe like Big Sur or whatever.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:59.550
And there was this great book
by Allison Griffiths called

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.810
"Shivers Down Your Spine."

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.690
It talked about cinema,
Gothic cathedrals,

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:03.847
and the immersive view.

00:37:03.847 --> 00:37:05.930
And so she was talking
about external technologies

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:08.800
that we use to trigger
these states of rapture,

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.690
states of awe.

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:12.210
And she said Gothic cathedrals
are designed in a certain way

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.770
to put you in touch with the
sublime, to hack your brain,

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:16.520
and put you in awe right away.

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:18.680
The modern incarnation of
that, the IMAX Theater.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.180
She says you go into an IMAX
Theater, and right off the bat,

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.380
the space is already doing
something to your perception.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:26.730
It's already doing
something to your mood.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.630
And there's been a
lot of recent science

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.402
about this emotion of awe.

00:37:30.402 --> 00:37:32.360
That it turns out that
experiences that stretch

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.980
your perceptual boundaries
force you to create

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.500
new maps of the world.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.800
And in assimilating
these new experiences,

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.610
you experience this
cognitive ecstasy, this awe.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:43.610
And after the moment
passes, you're

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:46.361
left with increased
feelings, residual feelings,

00:37:46.361 --> 00:37:48.360
of heightened creativity,
heightened well being,

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.880
heightened satisfaction--
which is already wonderful.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.135
And additionally, these
experiences of awe

00:37:53.135 --> 00:37:54.480
are anti-inflammatory.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.060
So they're also good for you.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.609
So what is your take on
this side emotion of awe

00:37:59.609 --> 00:38:00.900
and where it fits in with flow?

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.180
STEVEN KOTLER: Yeah.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.790
What we know about
awe, actually,

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:06.720
is-- so one of the triggers
for flow, one of the things

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.490
that will drive us into
flow is what's technically

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:10.780
called a rich environment.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.070
Which is a fancy way of
saying lots of novelty,

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.570
lots of complexity, lots
of unpredictability.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.920
Complexity is what triggers awe.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.320
So when you stare
up at the night sky,

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.750
and you see a billion galaxies,
and you cannot process it,

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.220
your conscious mind
literally cannot process it.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.960
So what happens in flow is
we trade conscious processing

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.160
for subconscious processing.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.260
Flow is the only
time we actually

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.540
get to watch the
subconscious mind work.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.760
And the reason it's
such a weird state,

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.510
conscious thought travels
about 150 miles an hour.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.870
Subconscious thought, 2,000
to 5,000 miles an hour.

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.970
So it's hyperspeed
decision making.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.759
Awe is the front
edge of a flow state.

00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:50.300
So when you look up
at the night sky,

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.170
and you get sucked
in, and time dilation,

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:53.700
everything freezes for a minute.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.120
That's actually the front
end of the flow state.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.320
And so we know from-- this
is Teresa Amabile's work

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.350
at Harvard.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:02.908
She figured out that the height
in creativity that shows up

00:39:02.908 --> 00:39:05.730
in flow actually outlasts
the flow state by a day,

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:06.940
by two days.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.940
It suggests-- and this
is really incredible.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.490
One thing we know-- and the best
example of this is something

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.120
called the Red Bull
Creativity Project.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.410
Red Bull, the energy
drink company,

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.600
teamed up with MIT and TED.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.757
And they did the largest
study of creativity ever done.

00:39:21.757 --> 00:39:22.840
They looked at everything.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.839
They learned two things.

00:39:23.839 --> 00:39:26.960
One, creativity is fundamental
to society-- big surprise.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.810
Two, we can't teach anybody
how to more creative.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:30.970
We suck at it.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:32.930
So what Teresa Amabile
discovered at Harvard

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:35.140
is flow actually
trains the brain up

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.050
to be more creative
over the long haul.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.980
It extends for a couple of days.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.390
What we're seeing in
awe is it extending

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:43.580
for a couple of hours.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.830
It's a small-scale
flow state, basically.

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:48.970
JASON SILVA: Wonderful.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.960
Well, we've got
five more minutes

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.390
for the official talk portion.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.740
And then we'd love to open it
up to questions from you guys.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:59.540
So if you want to start
thinking about some questions.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.740
Do you have a question?

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.865
STEVEN KOTLER: I want to
actually turn the question

00:40:02.865 --> 00:40:04.537
you asked me back on you.

00:40:04.537 --> 00:40:06.870
Which is-- because you've
been thinking about this a lot

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.078
and talking about this a lot.

00:40:08.078 --> 00:40:10.470
But what do you
think this means?

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.300
If we can start
producing these states,

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.310
if we can start opening up
this so-called ecstatic space--

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:17.460
and by the way, if we
use the word "ecstasy,"

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.060
I'm not talking
about the club drug.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.510
I'm talking about-- the Greek
root for ecstasy is "ekstasis."

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.480
It means to get
out of your head.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.160
And just--

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.330
JASON SILVA: Be
beside ourselves.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.160
STEVEN KOTLER: To
be beside ourselves.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.760
And by the way, we
did a research study

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.884
at the Flow Genome Project.

00:40:29.884 --> 00:40:31.977
We wanted to see how
much money people spend

00:40:31.977 --> 00:40:33.060
getting out of their head.

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.410
So we basically added
up all the things

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.000
people do to get
out of their heads.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.380
And we did it in the most
conservative possible way

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.530
we could have done the math.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.010
It's $10 trillion a year.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.550
One sixth of the
global economy is

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:48.692
what we spend getting
out of our heads,

00:40:48.692 --> 00:40:49.900
and getting out of ourselves.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.370
That's what we spend.

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.990
JASON SILVA: The
altered states economy.

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:53.480
STEVEN KOTLER: The altered
states economy, exactly.

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.260
It's one sixth of
the global economy.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.540
JASON SILVA: Yeah, which
I think is wonderful.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.620
Because when we get
out of our heads, not

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.740
to bring up psychedelic
language, but

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.950
we dissolve boundaries.

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.450
We dissolve
boundaries of thought.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.050
We dissolve patterns
in our thinking.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.340
We see the world in a new way.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.790
We get something akin to the
astronaut overview effect.

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.615
We see the gestalt
from a different angle.

00:41:11.615 --> 00:41:14.030
So I feel like it makes
us less rigid people,

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.650
more compassionate people,
more tolerant people.

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:19.810
Only good comes from getting
out of our heads, I find.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.010
I find it to be a
wonderfully romantic release

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.150
to get rid of yourself
for a little while,

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.510
and to find that there's
something there afterwards.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:28.230
STEVEN KOTLER: I
think the only problem

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.200
with it is it's
massively addictive.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.685
You can pretty easily
go down the rabbit hole

00:41:32.685 --> 00:41:34.741
of I want my brain to be
turned off all the time

00:41:34.741 --> 00:41:35.740
and you don't come back.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.489
JASON SILVA: But what
about taking lessons

00:41:37.489 --> 00:41:39.634
from that other space and
then having integration?

00:41:39.634 --> 00:41:41.300
There's a lot of stuff
in the literature

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.810
now, in the science,
in the news,

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.820
about psychedelic
psychotherapy--

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.915
so giving PTSD
patients some MDMA

00:41:46.915 --> 00:41:49.960
and compressing 10 years
of normal psychotherapy

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.500
into six hours.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.440
The kind of
ontological shift that

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.450
can be triggered by these
technologies of inner space

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.810
and what that can lead us to.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:59.643
Michael Pollan's article
in "The New Yorker"

00:41:59.643 --> 00:42:01.620
recently was saying,
maybe what we

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.330
can do is not just
talk about how

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.080
we can help people
that are pathologically

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.510
suffering from PTSD.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.010
But what about
taking those insights

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.718
and applying them for
people that are OK,

00:42:09.718 --> 00:42:11.770
so making well people better.

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:13.510
Could we use
psychedelic therapies

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:17.920
for people that would identify
as not being traumatized.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.485
STEVEN KOTLER: If
you go back to-- I

00:42:19.485 --> 00:42:21.860
don't know what you guys know
about psychedelic research.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:25.191
But before Nixon shut it all
down, thousands of studies

00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:25.690
were done.

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:28.184
And most of them-- a lot of
them were done on addiction.

00:42:28.184 --> 00:42:29.975
Psychedelics turn out
to be very, very good

00:42:29.975 --> 00:42:31.230
for fighting addiction.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:33.710
But they're also, most of
them were done on creativity.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:35.411
Which is why Steve
Jobs said, LSD

00:42:35.411 --> 00:42:37.660
is one of the three great
things I've done in my life.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.591
I think you have to be
fairly repressed for LSD

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:42.340
to be that great of
an experience for you,

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:44.080
but OK, whatever.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.745
It's Steve Jobs for you.

00:42:45.745 --> 00:42:47.560
He was.

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:52.080
But it definitely opens up a
whole new level of possibility.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.370
If you go back-- you mentioned
the PTSD MDMA studies.

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:58.230
If you guys actually
look at those studies,

00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.480
they're astounding.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:03.840
They looked at war veterans--
Iraq and Afghanistan-- people

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:05.970
with really serious PTSD.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:08.460
And they looked at sexual
trauma victims and child abuse

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.160
victims.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.740
And they were finding that they
could overwrite the PTSD in one

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:14.460
to two sessions.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.850
So 20 years of
therapy doesn't work.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.090
All the drugs we've got
on the market don't work.

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:21.697
But two MDMA sessions
seem to work really fast.

00:43:21.697 --> 00:43:22.780
JASON SILVA: There you go.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.750
No surprise there, actually.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:26.460
Cool, guys.

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.010
Well, we'd love to turn it over
to some questions from you.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.170
This has been really fun.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:34.434
But I feel like you guys could
probably catalyze some offshoot

00:43:34.434 --> 00:43:34.975
conversation.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:38.612
WOMAN 1: Two questions.

00:43:38.612 --> 00:43:40.570
The first was when you
were talking about flow,

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:43.750
and you said, we have this
interesting opportunity

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:46.510
to study extreme sports.

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:50.050
And the ones that
are really flowing

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:52.150
are the ones that
are successful.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:55.590
And yet, the ones that aren't
flowing go to the hospital

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.010
or die.

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:58.470
But you said when
you're in flow,

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:00.690
you can have higher risk taking.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:03.520
So is it possible they're in
flow, but they just are risky,

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:07.635
and therefore they
have an accident?

00:44:07.635 --> 00:44:09.260
STEVEN KOTLER:
Certainly you have that.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.440
Scot Schmidt, who was one
of the early extreme skiers,

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.420
said flow makes you
feel like Superman up

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.970
until the moment you're not.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:19.760
Which is very, very true.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.830
And certainly in
the shit happens

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:23.976
category, stuff happens.

00:44:23.976 --> 00:44:25.100
You can be in a flow state.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.340
You can be flying down the
hill on a mountain bike

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:28.779
and hit a rock.

00:44:28.779 --> 00:44:30.320
And you put yourself
in the hospital.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.200
I broke 84 bones
that way, literally.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:38.237
So yes, there is some of that.

00:44:38.237 --> 00:44:40.070
And risk-taking definitely
goes [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:41.861
There's a study that
just actually came out

00:44:41.861 --> 00:44:46.380
of Germany that showed that
people, every time-- risk

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.130
is one of the things
that focus attention.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:49.220
It drives you into flow.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.210
It's a really
great flow trigger.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.400
And it also drives
dopamine in the brain,

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.900
which is a focusing chemical,
among everything else it does.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.610
So all this stuff is really
great to drive you into flow.

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:02.141
But over your lifetime,
absolutely you

00:45:02.141 --> 00:45:03.640
will take greater
and greater risks,

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.190
and greater and greater risks,
and greater and greater risks.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:09.850
So that will definitely happen.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:12.030
Usually what happens
with the younger action

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.990
sport athletes is they
have Kodak courage.

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:18.130
They're getting by on youth,
and balls, and adrenalin.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:20.140
And it will only get you so far.

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:23.190
Usually what happens
with flow, because it's

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.690
a much calmer space, people
tend to make better decisions

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.130
as a general rule.

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:31.800
You obviously can still kill
yourself in flow states.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.040
But as a general rule,
people make better decisions.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.157
JASON SILVA: So it would
be a better-informed risk

00:45:36.157 --> 00:45:37.365
if you were to take the risk.

00:45:37.365 --> 00:45:39.100
STEVEN KOTLER: It's a
better informed risk, yeah.

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.760
WOMAN 1: My second
question was, I just

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.720
spent the weekend in an
art of dying conference.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.500
And they do use
psilocybin to ease anxiety

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.560
at the end of life.

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:53.200
So in terms of the flow, or
training people with flow,

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.520
do you think that it would
limit the fear of death?

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:01.662
And also, is it possible to
be in the flow in later years?

00:46:01.662 --> 00:46:03.370
I mean, obviously you
can die at any age.

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:04.740
But is there any--

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:05.990
STEVEN KOTLER: There's no age.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:08.040
So what we know about
flow is it's ubiquitous.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.612
It shows up in anyone,
anywhere, provided

00:46:10.612 --> 00:46:12.070
certain initial
conditions are met.

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:14.740
So there's no age limits
on flow whatsoever.

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:17.920
We also know-- so
what psilocybin

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.780
does is it creates a sense
of oneness with everything.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.620
Where that sense
comes from, actually,

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.890
is transient hypofrontality.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:27.490
So there's a part of your
brain, the right parietal lobe,

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:31.030
that is what separate--
generates a barrier

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.180
between self and others.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:35.040
So it exists so I can
walk around this room

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:36.690
and not bump into furniture.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:38.265
So if I have a stroke
or brain damage

00:46:38.265 --> 00:46:40.597
to this part of my
brain, I can't sit down

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:42.680
on a couch, because I don't
know where my leg ends

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.270
and the couch begins.

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:46.240
So during intense
concentration--

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.970
like shows up in
meditation, or flow,

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.220
or things like this-- part
of the brain shuts down.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.960
And we can no longer
separate self from other.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.342
And that point,
you're convinced--

00:46:55.342 --> 00:46:57.050
because there's no
other data available--

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.620
that you are one
with everything.

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:02.340
The same thing is going on if
you're using psilocybin or LSD.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.800
It's the same mechanism.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.020
All the roads lead to Rome.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.660
It doesn't matter
how you get in.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:11.340
So in terms of using flow to
combat end-of-life anxiety?

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.200
Absolutely.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.950
Absolutely, it would
work very, very well.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.020
It might be interesting
to couple it

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.345
with psilocybin or some
of those other therapies.

00:47:18.345 --> 00:47:18.970
WOMAN 1: Right.

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:22.640
Because the people that are
doing the research in this,

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.760
it's not like the psilocybin
is giving you anything.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:29.850
What it is, it's activating
what you already are capable of.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.860
JASON SILVA: Well, I
think what Rich Doyle says

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.450
is that psychedelics, they don't
really have an effect per se.

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:36.740
But they're nonspecific
amplifiers of consciousness.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.410
So what really sculpts
the psychedelic trip

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:41.256
is your set and your setting.

00:47:41.256 --> 00:47:42.880
So the setting is
the place that you've

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.710
pre-configured, that
you've architected,

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:46.300
where the trip is
going to unfold.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:47.841
And of course, the
set is what you're

00:47:47.841 --> 00:47:49.510
bringing to that--
your predispositions,

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.700
your fears, your
anxieties, your intention,

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:55.180
what you want to resolve, what
you want to probe and explore.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.520
And what you come to
perceive in those moments,

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.910
according to the work of
Rich Doyle, who I adore,

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.760
is that you come
to perceive, first

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.571
of all, the feedback
loops between

00:48:04.571 --> 00:48:07.070
your creative and linguistic
choices and your consciousness.

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:08.611
In other words, once
the trip starts,

00:48:08.611 --> 00:48:10.250
you realize just how
much where you are

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:13.070
is determining your
subjective experience.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:15.610
If you're in a mystical,
beautiful park in Big Sur,

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:18.450
you start to feel mystical,
beautiful sensations.

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:20.650
But you're feeling those
already unconsciously just

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:21.590
by being there.

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:24.610
But the trip, in amplifying
and bringing forth

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:26.865
that subconscious feeling,
all of a sudden the theater

00:48:26.865 --> 00:48:30.880
of the moment is informed
by the stage that you're in.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.630
So if you're in that
beautiful place,

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:35.890
it's already coloring the
trip towards beautiful spaces.

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:37.470
If you pre-configure
music-- there's

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:38.928
an article by
Timothy Leary written

00:48:38.928 --> 00:48:42.092
in the '60s called "Programming
the Psychedelic Experience."

00:48:42.092 --> 00:48:44.550
Which was all about the idea
that if you could successfully

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.089
pattern and pre-configure
the input signals that

00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:48.880
were coming in when a
person is in a highly

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.740
suggestible psychedelic state,
you could script the journey.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:55.320
You could literally
outline and steer

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.140
awareness and subjectivity.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.620
So you could create your own
compressed version of a Joseph

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:00.820
Campbell hero's journey.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.440
You could take the psilocybin,
depart from the ordinary,

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.090
go down the rabbit hole, learn
new things about yourself,

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:09.050
see the world in a new way,
have cathartic realizations,

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:10.650
and make the return.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:14.000
And holy moly, talk about
compressing a journey

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:14.906
into a journey.

00:49:14.906 --> 00:49:16.530
But I think this is
really fascinating.

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:17.700
You can tell I'm very
passionate about this.

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:18.840
STEVEN KOTLER: Jason Silva,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.530
JASON SILVA: No, no.

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:22.450
But there's a lot to do here.

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.690
But really, the key idea
is that consciousness

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.960
is a collaborative act
between subject and object.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.510
And it becomes even more
so a collaborative act

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:34.760
between subject and object when
you are in a psychedelically

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.670
addled state.

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:38.310
You realize that
mind, that awareness,

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:41.050
is a co-production
between self and world.

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:42.990
It's all about
these feedback loops

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:45.110
that you just come to
witness and you come to see.

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:47.530
So that can either be
a frightening bummer

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.470
if you're in the
wrong set and setting,

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:54.390
or can be nirvana in the
right set and setting.

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:56.582
STEVEN KOTLER: What Jason said.

00:49:56.582 --> 00:49:58.199
I don't know how to follow that.

00:49:58.199 --> 00:50:00.240
JASON SILVA: OK, we've
got a couple more minutes.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:00.740
Any?

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:01.690
Yes.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:04.219
WOMAN 2: So is there any way
that those really negative

00:50:04.219 --> 00:50:06.260
feelings that you associate
with the frontal lobe

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.760
can actually stimulate
a state of flow?

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.970
Because I had a moment of
terrible fear and anxiety,

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:14.600
like crippling, and I gave
the best talk of my life.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.110
STEVEN KOTLER: Oh, yeah.

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:17.485
WOMAN 2: And then the next
week, I was really meditative.

00:50:17.485 --> 00:50:19.031
And I gave a really boring talk.

00:50:19.031 --> 00:50:20.030
STEVEN KOTLER: Oh, yeah.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.960
So I said earlier,
there's a flow cycle.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.240
The first part of the
cycle is known as struggle.

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.060
And it is-- your prefrontal
cortex may go away in flow.

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.950
This is all prefrontal cortex.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:31.730
Struggle is called
struggle for a reason.

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:32.940
It is really unpleasant.

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.290
It is a learning phase.

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:35.362
It is a loading phase.

00:50:35.362 --> 00:50:37.820
You are loading and overloading
the brain with information.

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:45.690
I often found when I was a-- I
made my living as a journalist

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:46.940
for 20, 25 years.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.720
And I always found
the best stories,

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.780
I wanted a flow
state experience.

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:53.110
But I would find that
I had to be really--

00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:54.260
the trip had to scare me.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.130
The journey had to scare me.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:56.610
That night before,
I wasn't sleeping

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:58.735
for weeks, because I was
going off to the Himalayas

00:50:58.735 --> 00:51:00.080
to go chase whatever.

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.630
I would really work myself
into a state, a really negative

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:06.180
state, so that even a little
bit of a positive experience

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:07.180
could kick me into flow.

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:08.740
It didn't take
much at that point,

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.960
because I had freaked myself
out so much ahead of time.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.810
So yeah.

00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:17.860
Both Jason and myself will tell
you we're both flow junkies.

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.280
And we're both totally neurotic.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.200
And a lot of the reason
I think I got into this

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.090
is because it's bad up here.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:29.040
I've got to do a lot
to get out of here

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:31.650
under normal conditions.

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:32.590
JASON SILVA: I agree.

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:34.090
Very neurotic.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.559
And not only that,
but I'm obsessed

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:38.100
with Ernest Becker, who wrote
the book "The Denial of Death,"

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.410
because I'm extremely haunted
by the idea of transience

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:42.520
and mortality.

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.210
And I can vouch for the fact
that when I'm in a flow state,

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:47.652
it's the only time
when bliss rules.

00:51:47.652 --> 00:51:49.110
There's no thoughts
about, oh, this

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:50.276
is all going to end one day.

00:51:50.276 --> 00:51:53.180
So why even be excited, because
it's all temporary, anyway.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:54.960
And everything
dissolves into nothing.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.650
But when I'm in a
flow state, and I'm

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:58.570
watching an amazing movie or I'm
listening to beautiful music,

00:51:58.570 --> 00:52:00.105
or I'm being blown
away by the ideas

00:52:00.105 --> 00:52:01.780
that somebody's
sharing-- holy shit.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:02.970
I'm in the eternal now.

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:06.400
And death doesn't exist.

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.180
MAN 1: Yeah.

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:09.530
I'm curious.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:12.555
How are these flow states--
you talk about extreme sports.

00:52:12.555 --> 00:52:14.480
I've been a surfer for 30 years.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.560
In the last 10 years, the
shit that's been happening,

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:18.940
you can't even believe it.

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.920
And is it epigenetics
through YouTube?

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.180
Or is it-- people are getting
into these flow states.

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.596
And you see somebody
do something.

00:52:25.596 --> 00:52:27.690
It's like that
Laird Hamilton photo

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:30.070
that came on "Surfer" magazine.

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:32.785
I mean, literally, just
everyone was, what the hell?

00:52:32.785 --> 00:52:35.336
And five years later,
everybody's doing it.

00:52:35.336 --> 00:52:36.710
And I see it over
and over again.

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:37.430
And it just fascinates me.

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:39.721
STEVEN KOTLER: That was one
of the-- one of the reasons

00:52:39.721 --> 00:52:41.760
that I got interested
in this field is

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.370
from for my early
career as a journalist,

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:46.520
I chased action sport
athletes around mountains

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:47.480
for five, six years.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.660
And obviously, I'm not
an action sport athlete.

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:52.330
So I broke a lot of
bones along the way.

00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:54.790
And I would have these
year-long injuries,

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:57.010
where I'd have 65 hairline
fractures in my leg

00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:58.710
and I didn't move for a year.

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:01.870
And I would come back to
the sport a year later.

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:05.140
And it was like 30 years
of evolution in a year.

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.550
And my first question was,
what the hell's going on?

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:09.530
How is this even possible?

00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:13.970
So what actually happened in
action sports, a lot of it

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:16.520
was-- so creativity
is a flow trigger.

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.200
Creativity is amplified by flow.

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:19.960
But the actual
pattern recognition

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.450
when you link
ideas together, you

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:23.770
get a tiny squirt of dopamine.

00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:25.020
We've all had this experience.

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.000
You've done a crossword puzzle.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
You get an answer right.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.020
That little rush of
pleasure you get afterwards,

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:30.470
that's dopamine.

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:32.830
Dopamine also tunes
signal-to-noise ratios,

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:35.430
meaning it allows us
to see more patterns.

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:38.192
So the reason you get one
crossword answer right,

00:53:38.192 --> 00:53:39.900
and then you get a
couple in a row right,

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.580
it's because dopamine is
helping you see more patterns.

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:45.210
Creativity-- and it happened
because of snowboarding.

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:46.880
Snowboarding was a banned sport.

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.650
So people started
hiking their snowboards

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:49.510
to the top of the mountains.

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:51.510
If you're hiking your snowboard
to the top of a mountain,

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:53.759
you don't want to be the
fastest person to the bottom,

00:53:53.759 --> 00:53:56.180
because you just spent four
hours getting to the top.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:57.390
And that's stupid.

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:00.510
So instead, it became the
most creative way down

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:01.380
is the winner.

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.740
And there's not just one winner.

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:03.880
Everybody can win.

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.962
So this was adopted.

00:54:05.962 --> 00:54:07.420
It was free riding
in snowboarding.

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:10.040
It became free skiing,
and free surfing,

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.380
and on, and on, and on.

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:13.640
And it became about creativity.

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.230
And that in combination with
the risk and the other factors

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:20.180
just started driving
so much flow.

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:22.820
But the other thing
that happened, in 1986

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:24.400
we invented the VCR.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.570
And it sounds really funny.

00:54:26.570 --> 00:54:29.636
But try to learn a
dynamic action sports move

00:54:29.636 --> 00:54:31.510
from a static magazine photo.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:32.230
It sucks.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:33.250
It's really hard to do.

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:34.666
But with the
invention of the VCR,

00:54:34.666 --> 00:54:38.656
by 1986, I think it was
50% of American homes had

00:54:38.656 --> 00:54:40.130
a VCR in it by that point.

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:41.880
And suddenly, especially
for skaters, they

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.230
were the first to notice it.

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.805
You could pause and rewind.

00:54:44.805 --> 00:54:47.730
And it became this
training manual.

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:50.790
So technology,
coupled with flow,

00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:53.880
created this massive
feedback loop that

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.095
led us to where we are today.

00:54:55.095 --> 00:54:55.230
MAN 1: Yeah.

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.105
I'm old enough to grow
up with the magazines.

00:54:57.105 --> 00:54:59.829
And I had a pivotal
moment where I

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:01.870
was trying to learn how
to do an off the lip when

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:03.360
I was young and [INAUDIBLE]
top of the wave.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.810
And I saw so many pictures.

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:06.470
And I would hit,
and I would stop.

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:09.590
And a friend said, you're
stopping with the picture

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:10.450
as it flows--

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:11.030
STEVEN KOTLER: That's awesome.

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:12.800
MAN 1: And I was
like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:13.510
STEVEN KOTLER:
That's pretty funny.

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.620
MAN 1: And then five
years later, everybody's

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.150
learning it through
the whole motion

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:18.890
that we didn't have back then.

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:20.056
STEVEN KOTLER: That's funny.

00:55:20.056 --> 00:55:22.050
Yeah, I was talking
to Ian Walsh,

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:23.570
who's another great surfer.

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:24.820
And he was talking about this.

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:26.700
And he says, by the
time he goes home--

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.060
he lives 10 minutes from Jaws.

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:31.120
But by the time
he's home from Jaws,

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.610
somebody has uploaded the
footage of his session

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:34.420
onto YouTube.

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:36.310
And he can start doing
video playback review

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:39.320
as soon as he gets home because
of where the technology is.

00:55:41.225 --> 00:55:42.600
JASON SILVA: Any
other questions?

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.100
Yeah.

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.330
MAN 2: Are either of
you, during this talk,

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:47.010
were either of you
in a flow state?

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.770
And if so, how'd you get there?

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:51.999
And if not, why not?

00:55:51.999 --> 00:55:53.040
JASON SILVA: Interesting.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:56.660
We both do a lot of
speaking all the time.

00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:58.940
And I was talking to
him about this earlier.

00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:02.810
Sometimes the
focusing that happens

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:06.400
when you are in
front of people--

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.420
which means I don't feel
entitled to people's time

00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:10.320
at all.

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:13.390
So my brain, right off the
bat, is getting really focused

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:16.080
and making sure that
whatever it's doing up here

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:17.880
is going to be
useful information.

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.110
There's not a lot
of "ums" or "buts"

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.319
or taking my time when I talk.

00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:24.110
Because I don't feel
entitled to your time.

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:26.000
So I get really focused.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.220
And then there's that space
where knowledge and skill

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:30.950
set meets opportunity.

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:34.130
It's not easy, but it's not too
hard, that I get overwhelmed.

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.950
It's just enough that I'm in a
happy place, where I'm really

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:38.790
focused, but I can handle this.

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:42.275
And yes, there are moments
when I go into deep flow.

00:56:42.275 --> 00:56:43.959
What about you?

00:56:43.959 --> 00:56:45.000
STEVEN KOTLER: Sometimes.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.690
But interestingly, when we
train people up in flow,

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:49.899
obviously, risk is important.

00:56:49.899 --> 00:56:51.606
I talk a lot about
action sport athletes.

00:56:51.606 --> 00:56:53.200
And everybody's
always like, oh, but I

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.900
don't want to take physical
risks to get into flow.

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:56.530
That sucks.

00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:58.238
I don't want to break
bones and whatever.

00:56:58.238 --> 00:56:59.650
And I say well, great news.

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:00.980
You don't need physical risk.

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.240
You can replace it
with emotional risk,

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.880
intellectual risk,
or social risk.

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:07.310
And the cool thing
is social risk,

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:09.840
your brain can't
tell the difference

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.990
between physical danger
and social danger.

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:14.980
They're processed in the
exact same structures.

00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.010
Which is why fear
of public speaking

00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:18.530
is the number one
fear in the world,

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:20.490
and not, say, getting
eaten by a grizzly bear.

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:22.580
You would think from an
evolutionary perspective,

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:25.160
getting eaten by a grizzly
bear is something scary.

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.670
But no, it's public speaking.

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:29.720
And the reason is if
you go back 300 years,

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:32.600
and you screwed up socially,
you get kicked out.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:33.640
Kicked out of the tribe.

00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:34.160
Exiled.

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:34.659
Banished.

00:57:34.659 --> 00:57:35.750
Capital punishment.

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:38.430
So the brain can't tell the
difference between social fear

00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:39.510
and physical fear.

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:42.980
So being on stage-- even if
you do it a lot-- it definitely

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.447
focuses you a lot.

00:57:44.447 --> 00:57:45.530
And I think Jason's right.

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:47.320
I don't feel entitled
anybody's time.

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:50.060
So I don't want
to bore you guys.

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:52.898
So that helps drive
attention, as well.

00:57:52.898 --> 00:57:53.894
In the back.

00:57:53.894 --> 00:57:55.388
WOMAN 3: Hi.

00:57:55.388 --> 00:57:57.180
You mentioned, Jason,
the eternal now,

00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:01.172
which is a term that's
obviously connected sometimes

00:58:01.172 --> 00:58:02.725
to spirituality and mysticism.

00:58:02.725 --> 00:58:04.681
And I think you touch
on that lightly.

00:58:04.681 --> 00:58:06.240
Can you guys talk
a little bit more

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.150
about any correlations with
spirituality and mysticism,

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:11.412
if at all in your research
with the states of flow?

00:58:11.412 --> 00:58:12.870
JASON SILVA: Oh,
he definitely can.

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:16.290
You know about the neurobiology
of mystical experience.

00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:18.170
It's a chapter in
your new book, right?

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.470
STEVEN KOTLER: Yeah.

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:20.390
There's a chapter in
"Tomorrowland" on it.

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:24.220
So earlier when I was talking
about knobs and levers

00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:29.190
in the brain-- I'm not saying
that there's no mystery.

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:33.080
And I personally am an atheist.

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.610
But just because
I can tell you how

00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:38.430
the neurobiology of
spiritual experience works,

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:39.890
all that means is
these experiences

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:40.973
are mediated in the brain.

00:58:40.973 --> 00:58:44.260
So if you're spiritually
inclined, if you're religious,

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:47.380
what I'm talking about does
not disavow what you believe.

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:50.230
It just says these experiences
are mediated through the brain.

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:53.010
But we now know
that flow states,

00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:55.730
so-called mystical experiences,
psychedelic-- these

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:57.950
are all the same
structures in the brain.

00:58:57.950 --> 00:59:02.550
And we're getting really good
at figuring out where they are,

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:04.090
and how to precipitate them.

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:06.370
Where I think that's
interesting is

00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:09.600
I think we're at the
very front edge of this.

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.570
I think for years,
and years, and years,

00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:14.520
if you go by what the Buddhist
meditators have told us,

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.480
that these things go
on and on forever.

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.520
There's layer, after
layer, after layer.

00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:22.190
I think we're at the front
edge of decoding that stuff.

00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:24.214
I'm really interested
to what happens

00:59:24.214 --> 00:59:25.380
as we get deeper and deeper.

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.390
Because there are weird
questions, even in flow.

00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:28.848
We were talking
about this earlier.

00:59:28.848 --> 00:59:31.850
You have access to really
high-quality information.

00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:33.337
90% of it makes sense.

00:59:33.337 --> 00:59:35.670
90% of it, you're like, OK,
I get where this comes from.

00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:38.480
10% of it doesn't make
any sense whatsoever.

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.310
And it really feels magical.

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.770
And there's not an easy
way to explain it away.

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:45.567
I'd certainly love an
explanation for it.

00:59:45.567 --> 00:59:47.400
And I think poking
deeper into these realms,

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.233
especially into the
science of these realms,

00:59:49.233 --> 00:59:50.660
is going to get us there.

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.814
But open questions.

00:59:52.814 --> 00:59:54.980
JASON SILVA: I think this
will be our last question,

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.180
and then we'll just
do a little chit chat.

00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:58.660
But yep?

00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:03.620
WOMAN 4: You had talked about 17
ways to get into a flow state.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.260
Risk has been like--

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.556
STEVEN KOTLER: OK, so if
you go to stevenkotler.com--

01:00:07.556 --> 01:00:11.260
K-O-T-L-E-R is how you
spell my last name--

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:15.600
if you type in your email,
you'll get a free PDF for flow

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.370
in performance.

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:18.632
And it breaks down all
17 of those triggers,

01:00:18.632 --> 01:00:20.090
and a little bit
of the flow cycle,

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:22.670
and tell you how to apply them.

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:25.760
But you can finish
asking your question.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.670
WOMAN 4: You had focused
primarily on risk, and action

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:30.400
sports, and so forth.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.680
So I'm just wondering what are
the other really important ones

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.460
that you would argue.

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.825
JASON SILVA: I would say
one of them is cannabis.

01:00:38.825 --> 01:00:40.408
STEVEN KOTLER: That's
not on the list.

01:00:40.408 --> 01:00:42.370
JASON SILVA: And
especially now the ubiquity

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:43.960
of medical marijuana,
turning points.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.460
There's actually a
lot of literature

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.830
I found online about
weed and flow states.

01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:49.820
Certainly Carl Sagan,
I think, would agree.

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.071
A lot of jazz
musicians would agree.

01:00:52.071 --> 01:00:53.320
STEVEN KOTLER: He's not wrong.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.940
If you want the cheapest
flow hack in the world--

01:00:55.940 --> 01:01:01.040
20-minute run, cup of coffee,
marijuana, that order.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.230
It's the exact same
neurochemical cocktail as flow.

01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:05.880
Simple.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.100
But I'll go with the classic.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.150
MAN 3: The other?

01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.900
STEVEN KOTLER: No.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:13.690
You need-- you want to
exercise to the point

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:15.960
that the voice in
your head is gone.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:16.700
And that's it.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.879
So go for a long walk.

01:01:18.879 --> 01:01:20.420
And when the voice
in your head sorta

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.790
quiets down, drink
a cup of coffee,

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:25.180
smoke a joint-- that order.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:25.910
There you go.

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:27.686
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:28.594 --> 01:01:29.760
JASON SILVA: It's the truth.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.000
STEVEN KOTLER: It is the truth.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.610
But to answer your question,
the most famous of all flows

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:41.080
triggers is what's known as
the challenge skills balance.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.610
So the idea here-- and you
alluded to it a second ago-- is

01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:49.200
we pay most attention-- so
every one of these flow triggers

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.660
are literally just ways of
driving attention into the now.

01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.570
Flow follows focus.

01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:56.640
So all these triggers
are-- basically

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:00.020
the 17 triggers that we know
of-- they're the 17 things

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.820
evolution shaped your brain
to pay the most attention to.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.170
So one of them is called the
challenge skills balance.

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:09.070
It means I pay the most
attention to the task at hand

01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:13.410
when the task at hand makes
me stretch but not snap.

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.390
So you want something
that's difficult.

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:17.497
It's beyond your
skill set but not

01:02:17.497 --> 01:02:19.330
too difficult that it's
starting to generate

01:02:19.330 --> 01:02:20.720
massive amounts of fear.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.830
It's a tricky balance to find.

01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:24.890
For example, under-performers
don't like it

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:27.020
because you hit this
sweet spot, it's

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.529
usually the point you start
to get really uncomfortable.

01:02:29.529 --> 01:02:30.570
There's no way around it.

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:33.340
You're beyond your
comfort zone, literally.

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:36.020
But for overachievers,
they screw up

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:39.936
because overachievers-- so a guy
named Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

01:02:39.936 --> 01:02:42.310
is often called the godfather
of flow-- he's a University

01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:45.466
of Chicago psychologist-- and
a Google mathematician sat

01:02:45.466 --> 01:02:46.840
down and tried to
figure out what

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.520
is the exact
challenge-skills ratio.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.080
And the number, the gradient
difference they came up with,

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.496
back of the envelope
calculation--

01:02:52.496 --> 01:02:53.770
this is not a real number.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:54.860
This is not real science.

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:56.030
It's pretend science.

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:57.360
But the number was 4%.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.940
So a 4% difference between
challenge and skills.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:04.824
What happens with really high
performers is we'll blow by 4%

01:03:04.824 --> 01:03:05.740
without even noticing.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.470
We'll take on challenge that's
10% greater, 20% greater,

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:09.690
30% greater.

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:12.010
Generates so much fear,
you will block yourself

01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:13.240
from a flow state.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:16.550
So we pay the most
attention to those things

01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:18.500
where we stretch but don't snap.

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:20.020
They call it the flow channel.

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:22.050
What it basically means that
there's not enough stimulation,

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:22.570
you're bored.

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:24.361
You're not paying a
whole lot of attention.

01:03:24.361 --> 01:03:25.980
Too much stimulation,
there's anxiety,

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:27.140
and it'll kick you out.

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.410
In between is this sweet
spot, this flow channel.

01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:32.570
And that can be applied
anywhere, obviously-- sports,

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:34.280
creativity, writing, whatever.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.530
In my writing, I always
know I'm going to write.

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:39.270
So I tend to believe
that, for me at least,

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:41.460
other people will
argue with me, I guess.

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:44.320
But for me, the best writing
is just really honest.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.740
I want to tell the truth, tell
the truth, tell the truth.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.630
I always know that
I'm in that sweet spot

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:53.000
when I'm a little nervous
to publish something

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.770
because I've been a
little too vulnerable.

01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:56.967
That's how I know that I've
been in that sweet spot

01:03:56.967 --> 01:03:57.800
while I was writing.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.425
Does that help?

01:03:58.425 --> 01:03:59.222
WOMAN 4: Mhm.

01:03:59.222 --> 01:04:00.180
JASON SILVA: Beautiful.

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.170
Well, I think we're going to
end the formal discussion.

01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:05.620
But we're going to mingle
here for a little while.

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:07.250
And yeah.

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:08.400
Thank you so much, guys.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.095
STEVEN KOTLER: Thank you, guys.

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:10.600
JAMIE WHEAL: And you take
just take physical fitness out

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.300
of the beach muscles,
cosmetic and aesthetic.

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:16.500
And you turn it into
athletic and neurokinetic.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.000
So you've just completely just
rebooted physical culture.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.250
And actually, it's more of
a throwback to 19th century

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:23.100
Germany and the
gymnasium effects, which

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.800
is a throwback to Plato,
and the original Academy,

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.425
and Pythagoras.

01:04:25.425 --> 01:04:28.450
