00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.500
Welcome to Ruben select what an incredible run we've been on since the creation

2
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:07.530
of our own independent production company just two years ago.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.520
Before I do anything else,

4
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.760
I got to give a huge thanks to all of you who have supported us from the

5
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:15.240
beginning as well as everyone who's joined along the way.

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.200
We've truly been on this adventure together and it's been an incredible ride.

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.100
You've enabled us to build a show in a production company that I couldn't be

8
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.680
prouder of.
You helped us build our home studio,

9
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:29.130
purchase top of the line equipment,
hire more great team members,

10
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.280
take the show on the road and so much more thanks to you.

11
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.920
We've not only survived youtube demonetization,

12
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.600
but I've also been able to say no to joining other networks are taking deals

13
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:40.860
that weren't the right fit.

14
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.910
Keeping our independence has allowed us to have the conversation that I believe

15
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.850
can help heal the divide in this country and in the world,

16
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.050
but these conversations that we foster here are only one part of the solution

17
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.580
and now it's time to kick it up a notch.
It's time to build real community.

18
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:00.870
Around the conversations we're having here on the Rubin report.
After emailing,

19
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:02.820
chatting with and meeting so many of you,

20
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:06.840
I'm completely convinced that the next steps in this adventure are to build a

21
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:10.860
home where you can not only listen to us but where others can listen to you as

22
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:15.000
well.
Social media can be great,
but it's really not the place for honest,

23
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:16.050
thoughtful dialogue,

24
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.800
so we're going to build something on Patriot and that can get you more involved

25
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:22.050
directly with us as well as each other.

26
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.750
All the while getting away from the outrage machine.

27
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.690
Think of it as the same space instead of a safe space.

28
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.220
Patrion will be our place to connect with you and most importantly for you to

29
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:36.240
connect with each other here you'll be able to share comments,
critiques,

30
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:40.650
and opinions with other people who are just as engaged in these ideas as you
are.

31
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.150
We'll build an ideologically diverse community of free thinkers from all around

32
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:48.750
the world,
all in one place.
That's where Reuben select comes in.

33
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.120
This'll be our home base for all things.

34
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:54.990
Ruben report powered by the very people who support the show you.

35
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.180
This is your direct link to me,

36
00:01:57.181 --> 00:02:00.960
myself and my team will be in the comments and conversations ready to interact

37
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:04.200
with you as you interact with each other.
Plus,
if you join,

38
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:07.440
you'll get some cool perks such as behind the scenes footage,
bonus clips,

39
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.210
livestreams chats,
and much more as we grow,
our goal stays the same.

40
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:13.050
Having honest,

41
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:16.650
unfiltered longform discussions with people from every walk of life,

42
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.500
some of whom I agree with,
and some of whom I disagree with.

43
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.430
This thing has gone from a little youtube channel to something that's actually

44
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:27.300
moving the dial of the conversation as our influence grows.

45
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:29.610
So does our ability to really affect change,

46
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:34.320
and I want you to be as much part of that as I am,
as our community builds,

47
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:37.080
will be able to expand the team,
produce more content,

48
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.450
and introduce you to more people and ideas,

49
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.660
which will give you the tools to fight for what you believe in.

50
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.360
Level up in the conversation by joining Reuben.
