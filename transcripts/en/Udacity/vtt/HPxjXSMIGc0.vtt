00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:01.635
Let's recap what we've learned so far.

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:06.444
Parallel computing is all about many threads solving a problem by working together.

00:00:06.444 --> 00:00:08.712
The key is this working together.

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:10.848
Any books on business practices or teamwork will tell you

00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:13.222
that working together is really all about communication.

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:16.047
In CUDA, this communication takes place through memory.

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:19.769
For example, threads may need to read from the same input location.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.953
Threads may need to write to the same output location.

00:00:22.953 --> 00:00:26.258
Sometimes threads may need to exchange partial results.
