00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
(Mitch) Over the past year we've shown you the ins and outs of some crazy science

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.820
but have you ever wondered whose hands these are?

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.880
Or how these videos are made?

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.100
You're about to find out!

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.260
(Snazzy music)

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.860
(Greg) Hi I'm Greg
(Mitch) And I'm Mitch, and we are the creators of AsapScience

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.380
And we thought it would be cool to give you guys a behind the sences look

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.000
at how we create the episodes, who we are, and what we do.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.200
(Greg) So instead of doing a "Draw my Life", cause we are always drawing our science videos

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.240
We are doing a "Real Life my Life"

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.000
We put out a video asking you guys to ask us questions

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.240
So we are going to answer some questions

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.780
We are going to give you a little behind the scenes on how our videos are made

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.240
And that's what we are going to do today

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.460
(Mitch) So the first question is "which country do you live in?"

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.160
(Greg) 1, 2, 3
(Both) Canada!

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.940
(Mitch) "What is your educational background?"

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.040
(Greg) So I went to the University of Guelph

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.360
Where I took Biological Science and minored in Studio Art

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.020
And then, after that, I went to teacher's college, where I learned to become a teacher

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.880
at UFT at the University of Toronto

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.580
And for the last year I've actually been in the UK teaching the folks in academy. Shout out!

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.260
(Mitch) I also went to the University of Guelph and had a Biological Science degree

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.540
And I'm clearly less educated because that's where it  ended for me

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.160
But then I worked in some labs and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.400
(Greg) Simple mind
(Mitch) Yes, simple mind

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.820
(Greg) Next question "What made you start the channel?"

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.060
(Mitch) Well, we just thought YouTube was pretty cool

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.720
and we had seen some other, you know, educational channels out there that we thought were really effective

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.080
And we just sorta thought We love science. We  love explaining science to people.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.980
Why don't we start up this channel that's sort of like 'quick accessible science'

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.040
more specifically for people who didn't think they like science

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.320
We thought it would be awesome to reach out to people who think science is boring

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.840
Or think science sucks or didn't get to go as far as we did to find those really awesome things

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.100
Cause when you are in high school sometimes science can seem boring

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.660
They don't teach you the really awesome things.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.620
(Greg) I think one of the first thoughts we had was

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.920
We had lots of friends around us, and what we would do when we were hanging out was

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.360
explain to them specific science concepts that we knew in a simple way

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.940
that we thought would engage them

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.380
That was one of our first light bulbs, when we thought

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.460
'We should probably do this in a medium where more people can access it'

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.800
So the next question is "How did you think of and make up the AsapScience logo?"

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.600
(Mitch) So we had a big chart with, like, names related to science

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.000
and, you know, there was, like, a couple of them that we wanted and the YouTube channel was already taken

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.320
(Greg) Some are so bad!

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.080
'But how?'
(Mitch) It was like 'Ever Wonder?'

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.260
'Quick Science'
(Greg) No, 'Ever Wonder' was good

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.400
(Mitch) yeah
(Greg) We almost did 'Ever Wonder'

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.760
(Mitch) So then eventually we were like, AsapScience.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.480
And we are fans of A$AP Rocky and we were like

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.180
Thats a pretty sweet name and like

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.000
'As Soon As Possible Science' and that was cool.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.920
That kinda conveyed the message we were trying to get across

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.920
(Greg) But the 's' is not a dollar sign in ours

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.360
(Mitch Muffin) Yeah, unfortunately we are not making as much money as him.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.160
In terms of logo, if you watch our very very first video

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.820
We didn't even have a logo, we just drew it out, the AsapScience name.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.140
And in my mind I was like 'every time we are going to change it up'

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.040
So the secound video we ended up making this AsapScience logo

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.940
But then after that we got a little bit lazy and then decided to just use that footage

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.220
Over and over and then this ended up becoming our logo forever

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.060
(Greg) How do you choose your topics?

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.460
(Mitch) Well, when we first started, we had a list of stuff

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.500
That we had come up with before even starting the channel

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.780
Stuff that we thought was cool from university or friends had asked before

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.360
So we just compiled a big list

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.180
(Greg) You are all aprouching us through Facebook and Twitter

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.520
and actually in the YouTube comments

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.040
So I do spend a lot of time reading all your Facebook comments and YouTube comments

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.380
I have a list on my phone of 275 topics that are really really genius

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.880
That have been thought of by you, so that's something we really appriciate

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.920
"What is the process of making a video?"

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.120
(Mitch) Why don't we just go show you?

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.020
(very ebullient music)

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.040
So this our office space

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.060
Our new office space

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.460
(Greg) Im tired

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.740
So the first step is figuring out an idea

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.780
So, sometimes its based on breakthroughs in science that we find intresting

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.280
Or books we read. Or, what happens is, a lot of time is, we don't know everything

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.520
So we get a lot of great ideas from you, and we have to figure out what the answers are

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.420
and how we are actually going to create a video from the infomation

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.300
and that involves research. So the second step is doing research

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.700
Books, a lot of the time online using peer-reviewed journals and articals

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.240
We like to use PubMed, Google Scholar,  and websites that can get us to those types of infomation

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.560
(Mitch) We've got lots of markers

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.120
We are in the business of markers.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.880
Sadly, I should have kept all the ones originally, I started chucking them out after they started going dry

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.020
I usually just kinda set them up here. and I've got everything ready to go

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.580
Millions of white board markers.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.840
Ill make a graveyard for them one day.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.240
Generally once we have the script, I just come over here.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.720
We dont actually finalize the script until we're drawing

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.760
So, we've got the camera pointing down on the white board.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.700
And you can just draw

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.240
(Greg) So even though Mitch has been drawing on a white board a lot this year

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.780
originally we had the idea of sort of animations and explaining science through art

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.600
Because, actually, I'm an artist. And a lot of the time I would like to blend science and art together

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.200
So these are paintings that I created of proteins

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.060
The are visual depictions of proteins through a software called PIMAL

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.340
They are very delicate, intricate images, so Ive used them

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.220
And then I painted them on a canvas using oil paint

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.360
And lastly this is BjÃ¶rk who is a huge inspiration for us. She blends art and science in a very special way

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.620
That we really look up to

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.700
(Mitch) So here is our fancy, state of the art, recording studio.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.320
As you can see, all the things you need. Clothes on the left.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.560
Towels and blankets on the right.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.700
I basicly set it up with blankets and stuff, just to pad the noise, right?

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.560
Because you want to have a room where there's not a lot of echo, so you can just get dry vocals

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.200
"Dreams are an amazing phenomenon.  And considering you spend roughly 6 years of your life dreaming

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.000
Its quite curious that we often brush them aside to be quickly forgotten.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.480
But, what are dreams?

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.040
And like the many science-fiction stories or movies, could we ever record

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.480
and figure out what we are seeing while we're dreaming?"

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.980
So basically, you bring the footage- so we have tons of different clips from the video

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.440
And we have different audio that I've now edited

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.020
And so I have to match up the video footage with the recorded audio.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.880
So its not the other way around. Some people think I talk to the video footage.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.000
But instead, we record one audio track and I come and

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.240
take the video and sort of stream it all together with the different clips.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.840
To add up to the timing of the video

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.500
(Exuberant, ultra-cool AsapScience Background music)

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.600
So the last step is to add the music. Usually we use the original song that I wrote

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.760
But every now and then I feel like writing a new song or adding a new jingle that suits that video perfectly.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.240
So, Im a musician and I have a music background.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.380
You can check out my own stuff at mitchellmoffit.com

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.840
to listen to my own music there. It was just a nice way to incorporate my own interests to the videos

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.480
And have music and science kind of collaborate on the AsapScience channel.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.000
(upbeat techno-rad)

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.960
"So, what are your jobs outside of AsapScience? Ive always wanted to know."

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.020
(Greg) Well I just completed a year of teaching abroad in the UK.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.940
In a place called Folkestone where I taught science.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.680
It was a really amazing experience. I got to actually do practicals and experiments

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.980
and engage with the classroom really well.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.780
As well as on the side I would go home and I would help with this YouTube channel

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.060
and engage millions of people.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.020
(Mitch) A year ago, we didn't really know that could be a job

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.320
Like, you just kind of start for fun and then it picks up.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.860
Now it's both of our full time jobs.
(Greg) both of our full time jobs, yeah.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.780
"Are you planning on collaborating with SciShow, Vsauce, MinutePhysics or any other

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.320
science related channels?"

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.940
(Mitch) Yeah, we'd love to, totally. I mean we had the chance to sort of collaborate with Vsauce3, Jake.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.060
And hopfully we can do that again. And we also just got to collaborate with Bill Nye!

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.360
Our dream come true, which is really cool.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.540
"Did you fight over who got to narrate the videos?"

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.160
(Greg) No. His voice is a lot better than mine.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.720
I narrated two of them, and its true, I sound like a honey badger.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.820
"Ever wonder why both coffee and alcohol have the unfortunate tendency to make you pee?"

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.020
(Mitch) "Reveal one of your biggest secrets"

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.160
(Greg) um...

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.480
Oh my god, I cant think of any that are appropriate.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.420
(Mitch) yeah, you dont have to answer

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.040
(Greg) "Please sing for us in that voice, Mitchell. That would be so damn awesome"

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.300
(Mitch) um... what? The Periodic Table song?

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.640
(Greg) or like Whitney Houston

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.200
(Mitch) no

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.740
(Greg) "Where did you learn how to draw?"

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.080
(Mitch) I didn't, really. Like, I just, Greg actually has an art degree.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.560
But he was in a different country so I had to start drawing, and was like drawing

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.840
So i would just, kind of,  look up different images of cartoons and try to figure it out

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.020
And try to make it as simple as possible, which added to our aesthetic

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.000
(Greg) Everyone says "oh, I cant do art". Anyone can do art.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.600
Its about practice. And its about teaching yourself. And its about just making sure you figure out the craft.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.100
(Mitch) "What is your favorite movie?"

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.520
(Greg) 2001 "The Space Odyssey" by Stanley Cooper

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.140
For reasons that we all know

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:42.540
"What is your favorite video game?"

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.960
(Mitch) Zelda! Its the best video game ever made. Im obsessed with it.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.000
I've played every Zelda game, and its awesome.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.640
so "Does the research for your videos ever change your lives?"

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.480
(Greg) Yes, I think it does. For example: after we did the scientific power of naps

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.620
we are power nap gurus now

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.100
In fact, I have power naps every day, and I always make sure they are less than 20 minutes

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.900
And I honestly do think it does help.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.280
Coffee and alcohol, consume those a lot.
(Mitch) Yeah

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.680
Hangover cure
(Greg) Pee a lot... Hangover cure!

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.360
(Mitch) And stuff like productivity. You learn about it and then you're like, or procrastination

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.860
You're like, "I cant procrastinate now, I just told like a million people to stop procrastinating"

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.540
(Greg) And then there's tips. In a lot of our videos we have tips and give examples of things you should do

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.920
And it's a lot easier to follow now. I mean, we are learning as we are making these videos

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.180
just the same as you're learning when you watch them and it definitely effects our lives.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.980
Hopfully in the same way it effects yours.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.680
