00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159
were defective in nucleotide excision
 

00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:37.769
were defective in nucleotide excision
repair and moreover that there were

seven genes that were responsible for

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:42.289
seven genes that were responsible for
 

00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:45.159

this disease meaning mutation in any of
 

00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:48.549
this disease meaning mutation in any of
these genes could cause defect in

these genes could cause defect in
 

00:25:48.559 --> 00:25:50.919
these genes could cause defect in

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200
fertilized homo log and so we of course
 

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.260

we have not one but two or more logs and
we decided to investigate but these

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:01.930
we decided to investigate but these
 

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:05.550

purify them and test them for fertiliser

00:38:26.849 --> 00:38:26.859
