<i>I went on a journey and I
 went all over the Amazon</i>

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:07.540
<i> to try and find out the
 truth about the Amazon.</i>

00:00:08.273 --> 00:00:10.709
<i>This idea of these nasty people</i>

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.746
<i> destroying the Amazon,
 they're not.</i>

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.048
<i> They are just people
 trying to make a living.</i>

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:18.584
<i> And what I saw was this
 endless poverty trap.</i>

<i> Three years ago now,</i>

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:25.658
<i> I'd bought an illegal
coca plantation by mistake.</i>

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.793
<i>These are raw coca leaves.</i>

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:29.462
<i> They have the highest
 alkaloid content</i>

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.631
<i> of any coca leaves
 in the world.</i>

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:35.101
Which means they make
really good cocaine.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.069
And they're mine.

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:39.606
- ( audience laughter )
- ( Charlie laughs )

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:44.076 line:0%
So, I became a coca lord
by mistake.

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.377 line:0%
( audience laughter )

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:50.983
<i>Now, I didn't mean to buy a
cocaine plantation, obviously.</i>

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:52.418
<i>But, I bought it over the phone.</i>

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:54.453
<i> A friend of mine phoned
 me up and he said</i>

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:58.023
"There's this piece of land
at the end of a logging road

00:00:58.023 --> 00:01:01.093
and the head of the National
Park needs someone to buy it.

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:04.463
The illegal loggers are
going up this track

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:05.498
they're going through the land

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.900
and into the National Park
to cut the hardwood trees.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.670
And if someone can buy
that piece of land

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.239
we stand a chance of
protecting that part

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.541
of Manu National Park."

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.043
But, what I actually got

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.110
you know, when I got there

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.646
and saw it several months
later was, you know

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:23.849
hundred acres of severely
degraded secondary rainforest.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.886
And two hectares
of illegal coke.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.222
I also got an illegal
logging camp

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.525
with an illegal
logger living in it.

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:35.495
<i> That's Elias there,
 on the right.</i>

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.965
<i>I bought the land off Tito,
his dad here on the left.</i>

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:42.869
And Elias was one of
the most infamous

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.972
notorious, illegal
loggers in the area.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.507
The National Parks hated him,
he was a thief

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:50.743
he was a liar, he was
this, he was that.

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.746
And as a result, I was
absolutely terrified of him.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:57.617
He was so muscly. I've never
seen a human being...

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.985
You can't kind of get it
from that picture, but yeah.

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:01.454
Anyway, I was terrified of him.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.060
And I would... camped on the
land when I first went there

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.461
and I'd lie down, I could
hear the chainsaws at night

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:10.496
and I'd come out in the morning

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:12.398
and there'd be a massive
pile of hardwood

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.100
in the driveway to my land.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.202
And then, two hours later,
it had gone.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:19.238
This kind of went on, it
went on and then one day...

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.142
So, we were filming this as
a part of a TV documentary

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.745
and Gavin,
the director said to me

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.546
"You know, you've really
gotta go meet this guy."

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.982
And I said,
"I'm scared. I don't want to."

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.652
And I talked to National Parks,
one of them actually said

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.354
"You've bought the most
dangerous piece of land

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:37.156
off the most dangerous family

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:39.825
in the most dangerous
part of Southern Peru."

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:43.062
And, you know, that scared
the hell out of me.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:44.230
And I'm camping on it.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.965
( audience laughter )

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:48.534
And a few years earlier,
in exactly the same spot

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:50.470
where I was camping, a
group of geologists

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.606
had been basically, held
up with guns and robbed.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.707
It was a... scary prospect.

00:02:55.707 --> 00:02:57.343
So, I didn't want to meet Elias.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.579
Anyway, Gavin said,
"You're gonna have to."

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.947
and he forced me to do it.

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.214
So, we marched
through the forest.

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:04.817
And I tracked Elias, he's
really hard to find.

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:07.052
I tracked him through--
I could find wet footprints.

00:03:07.052 --> 00:03:08.187
We did this for about an hour

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:09.589
and eventually
I heard a chainsaw.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.226
And basically, I
doorstepped this man

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:16.095
in the middle of cutting a tree
down, with a whole film crew.

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:18.497
And it was a really
weird moment because

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:20.766
he was like,
"What the hell is going on?"

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:22.702
You know, really remote
part of the Amazon

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.504
this bloke turns up with a
boom pole and a camera.

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:27.206
- ( Charlie laughs )
- ( audience laughter )

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.975
Anyway, he's not going
to attack us, is he?

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:32.178
Anyway, we sat down and
we hung out and...

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:34.714
I basically said
"You gotta leave.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:37.916
You know, it's not working.
You can't stay on this land.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.918
You are the bad illegal logger.

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:42.221
I don't want you on this land,
you're gonna have to leave."

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:47.727
And he spun me this line about
how he had a disabled daughter

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:51.964
and it's all he could do,
you know, to survive and...

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:55.001
keep her, and you know
keep his family alive.

00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.469
And you know, I
didn't believe him.

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:58.370
So, I'm gonna show you this now.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.375
( instrumental music )

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:04.877
Are you there?

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:08.314
Hey!<i> Como estas?</i>

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:10.482
( Charlie laughs )

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.785
<i> Como estas?
 Hola!</i>

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:14.721
- ( girl mumbling )
<i> -Como estas?</i>

00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:16.956
Yeah!

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.392
Hello.

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.694

<i> Meet your family.</i>

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.677

Cameraman:<i> Charlie...</i>

00:05:56.288 --> 00:05:58.157
<i> Do you wanna kick
 them off the land?</i>

00:05:58.157 --> 00:05:59.225
Nope.

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:04.330
You know, this has just
made my decision...

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:09.302
infinitely more complicated.

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:14.840
I was all agreed in my mind,

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.576
I was gonna chuck
Elias off the land

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.077
until I went around to
his house.

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.616
What sort of a bastard
would I be if I did?

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:24.750
There's no way.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.622
( instrumental music )

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:32.625
Charlie:
<i>Behind every horrific story</i>

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:36.128
<i> lie a bunch of perfectly
 decent people</i>

00:06:36.128 --> 00:06:38.030
<i> just trying to survive.</i>

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:42.801
And I was completely unarmed
as a human being to do it.

00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:45.471
I had no idea what
I was going to do.

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.639
So, I went on a journey

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.809
to find out the truth
about the Amazon

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:53.679
trying to find out how can
we tackle these problems.

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:56.749
And we can tackle them
by understanding them.

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:59.218
So, I went on a kind of
journey of understanding.

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:00.886
<i> This is Erasmus.</i>

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:06.726
<i> He's one of 35,000 gold
 miners in Southern Peru.</i>

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:10.797
<i>The gold mining is a huge
 environmental problem.</i>

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:14.200
<i> You know, this is like a
 modern day gold rush.</i>

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.035
<i> But, these guys
 are chasing dust,</i>

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:17.536
<i> they're not
 chasing nuggets.</i>

00:07:17.536 --> 00:07:22.241
And they use a whole load of
chemicals within that process

00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.376
Mercury particularly.

00:07:24.376 --> 00:07:26.879
If I give you a sense
of scale there.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.716
There's a truck.
That dot there.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.385
<i>When you see that, you start
 realizing how big it is.</i>

00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:37.490
<i>There's whole towns have cropped
 up to supply this trade.</i>

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:39.591
<i> And towns of
 thousands of people.</i>

00:07:39.591 --> 00:07:40.793
There's prostitution,

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:43.295
there's human trafficking,
there's crime.

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:46.765
And you know, it's a horrible
modern day gold rush.

00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:51.136
<i> So, I went to work with
Erasmus on his gold mine.</i>

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:52.472
<i> This is one day,
 they got--</i>

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.541
<i> This is six and a half
 grams of 24 karat gold.</i>

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:58.544
That's worth about $190 bucks.

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:03.048
So, it takes around 20 tons
of toxic waste

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:05.684
to make a gold wedding ring.

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:09.255
<i> Here's a little clip
 of me doing that.</i>

00:08:10.021 --> 00:08:13.025
( Charlie breathing heavily )

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.695
Charlie:<i> Every 16 hours,</i>

00:08:16.695 --> 00:08:19.432
<i> the mats are rinsed
 and shaken out</i>

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.138
<i>before the gold bearing sludge
is scraped into a barrel.</i>

( Erasmus continues in Spanish )

00:09:06.244 --> 00:09:10.049
So, he's mixing the
mercury with the sludge?

( Erasmus speaking Spanish )

00:09:17.122 --> 00:09:17.890
One hour?

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.124
-Yes
-Yes?

00:09:19.124 --> 00:09:20.226
One hour.

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:26.632 line:0%
( Erasmus speaking Spanish )

00:09:48.954 --> 00:09:52.625
Charlie:<i> Mercury poisoning
can result in brain damage</i>

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:58.029
<i>kidney damage, lung failure
and possibly miscarriage.</i>

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.900
<i>Illegal miners dump nearly
30 tons of this heavy metal</i>

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.470
<i>into Peruvian rivers every year.</i>

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:09.541
<i>And a recent study found that
many people in local communities</i>

00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:11.510
<i> had mercury
 levels in their bodies</i>

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.779
<i>five times the safe limit.</i>

00:10:15.914 --> 00:10:19.952
And somewhere in there,
there's a whole lot of gold.

00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:23.089
But, I can't see any.

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:28.960
So, that's the image I took of
that guy while he was doing--

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.830
<i> He stirred that mercury
with his feet for an hour.</i>

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.399
<i>When you do that, you realize,
 these guys aren't rich.</i>

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:36.802
Okay. The bad guys aren't rich.
The gold miners aren't--

00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:38.904
No one's getting rich
off this at all.

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:41.173
It's actually the reverse.

00:10:41.173 --> 00:10:43.142
This guy wanted to
go to university.

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:46.244
He'd gone to become a gold miner
to save up for university.

00:10:46.244 --> 00:10:47.780
He was never gonna
go to university.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.582
He was poisoning
himself to death.

00:10:50.382 --> 00:10:53.285
He hadn't been paid
for two weeks.

00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:54.820
The other two workers
that worked there

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.022
hadn't been paid
for three months.

00:10:57.956 --> 00:11:02.294
And what I saw was this endless
poverty cycle, this trap.

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:04.929
People stuck in
this poverty trap

00:11:04.929 --> 00:11:05.964
that they couldn't get out of.

00:11:05.964 --> 00:11:08.500
The longer they worked
and not got paid

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.569
the more they were
committed to work.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:13.639
<i>So it was all really just
 miserable and tragic.</i>

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:17.343
<i>This was where we got our water
from and washed every day.</i>

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.744
<i>This is a mercury tailings</i>

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:21.279
<i>a sort of gold mining tailings
 pond full of mercury.</i>

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.282
So, it makes you realize that

00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:25.418
these guys aren't
doing that for fun.

00:11:26.217 --> 00:11:28.687
This idea of these nasty people

00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:30.722
destroying the Amazon,
they're not.

00:11:30.722 --> 00:11:32.692
They're just people
trying to make a living.
