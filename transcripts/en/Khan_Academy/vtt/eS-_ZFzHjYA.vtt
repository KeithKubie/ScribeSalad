00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.570
Where we left off
in the last video,

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.470
we had come up
with an expression

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.470
as a function of x
of our combined area

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.254
based on where we make the cut.

00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:09.670
And now we just
need to figure out

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.190
where this hits a minimum value.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.359
And to do that, we
just have to take

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.150
the derivative of this
business, figure out

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.300
where our derivative is
either undefined or 0,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.520
and then just make sure that
that is a minimum value,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.380
and then we'll be all set.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.700
So let me rewrite this.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.434
So our combined area
as a function of x,

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:31.600
let me just rewrite this
so it's a little bit easier

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.560
to take the derivative.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.500
So this is going to be
the square root of 3 times

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.380
x squared over-- let's
see, this is 4 times 9.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.370
This is x squared over 9.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.200
So this is going to
be 4 times 9 is 36.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.990
And then over here
in blue, this is

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:55.470
going to be plus 100
minus x squared over 16.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.350
Now let's take the
derivative of this.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.590
So A prime, the derivative
of our combined area

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.414
as a function of
x, is going to be

00:01:04.414 --> 00:01:06.580
equal to-- well, the
derivative of this with respect

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.670
to x is just going to be
square root of 3x over 18.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.900
The derivative of this
with respect to x,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.840
well, it's the derivative
of something squared over 16

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.940
with respect to that something.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.090
So that's going to be that
something to the first power

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.947
times 2/16, which
is just over 8.

00:01:28.947 --> 00:01:31.030
And then times-- we're
just doing the chain rule--

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.380
times the derivative of the
something with respect to x.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.030
The derivative of 100
minus x with respect to x

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.680
is just negative 1,
so times negative 1.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.950
So we'll multiply negative
1 right over here.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.960
And so we can rewrite all
of that as-- this is going

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.390
to be equal to the square root
of 3/18 x plus-- let's see,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.050
I could write this
as positive x/8.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.720
So I could write
this as 1/8 x, right?

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.460
Because a negative 1 times a
negative x is positive x/8.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.570
And then minus 100/8, which
is negative 12.5-- minus 12.5.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.030
And we want to figure out an
x that minimizes this area.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.951
So this derivative right over
here is defined for any x.

00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:22.450
So we're not going to get our
critical point by figuring out

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.006
where the derivative
is undefined.

00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:25.380
But we might get
a critical point

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.560
by setting this derivative
equal to 0 to figure out

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.940
what x-values make
our derivative 0.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.912
When do we have a 0 slope
for our original function?

00:02:32.912 --> 00:02:34.620
And then we just have
to verify that this

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.330
is going to be a minimum
point if we can find an x that

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.970
makes this thing equal to 0.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.280
So let's try to solve for x.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.550
So if we add 12.5
to both sides, we

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.660
get 12.5 is equal to--
if you add the x terms,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.190
you get square root
of 3/18 plus 1/8 x.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.790
To solve for x, divide both
sides by this business.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.550
You get x is equal to 12.5
over square root of 3 over 18

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.860
plus 1/8.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.990
And we are done.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.959
At x equals this, our
derivative is equal to 0.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.250
I shouldn't say we're done yet.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.120
We don't know whether
this is a minimum point.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.370
In order to figure out whether
this is a minimum point

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.090
we have to figure out whether
our function is concave upward

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.877
or concave downward when x
is equal to this business.

00:03:25.877 --> 00:03:28.210
And to figure that out, let's
take the second derivative

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.470
here.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.540
So let me rewrite
the second derivative

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.680
of all of this business.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.144
The second
derivative, well, this

00:03:37.144 --> 00:03:39.060
was the same function
as this right over here.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.810
So let me rewrite it.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.540
So A prime, the derivative
of our combined area,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.110
was equal to the square root of
3/18 x plus 1/8 x minus 12.5.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.460
The second derivative
is going to be

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.050
square root of 3/18 plus 1/8.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.960
So this thing right over
here is greater than 0,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.790
which means we're concave
upward for all x's.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.260
Concave upwards, which
means for all x's.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.380
We're kind of doing a
situation like this.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.815
So if we find an x
where the slope is 0,

00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:16.190
it's going to be
over an interval

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.315
where it's concave upwards.

00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:19.250
This is concave
upwards for all x.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.470
So we're going to be
at a minimum point.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.880
The slope is 0 right over here.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.820
This right over here
will be a minimum point.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.470
So once again, this is
going to be a minimum point.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.040
Now, if we actually
had a 100-meter wire,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.690
this expression
isn't too valuable.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.644
We'd want to get a pretty
close approximation

00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:38.060
in terms of where
to actually make

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.880
the cut, an actual
decimal number.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.040
So let's use a
calculator to get that.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:52.600
So we have 12.5 divided by
square root of 3 divided

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:00.310
by 18 plus 1 divided
by 8 gives us--

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.520
and now we deserve
our drum roll.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.050
This is 56.5.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:14.090
So this is approximately
equal to 56.5 meters.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.830
So you make this
cut roughly 56.5--

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.500
I'll write roughly-- 56.5
meters from the left-hand side.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.190
And you will minimize
the combined area

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.733
of both of these figures.
