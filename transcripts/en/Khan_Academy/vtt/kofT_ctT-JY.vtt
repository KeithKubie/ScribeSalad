00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.400
- [Narrator] Why do midterm
congressional elections matter?

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.020
- Congressional elections matter

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.860
because they are often
and have increasingly been

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.150
a referendum on the president.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.450
So it is a kind of real test

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.610
from real voters doing real voting

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.450
about whether people approve
of what the president's doing

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.630
or disapprove of what he's doing.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.300
But then there's also
an important question

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.970
of who has control of Congress?

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.900
If the president's party
has control of Congress

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.190
the way it's been working
in recent history is,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.480
that means he's basically gonna get

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.770
a rubber stamp for what he wants to do.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.210
If the president's party is
not in control of Congress

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.080
that means there are gonna
be more investigations

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.480
into the executive branch.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.570
And that's of course what the
legislature is supposed to do

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.350
but it means more investigations,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.950
it means that Congress might try

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.320
and pass its own legislation

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.440
and then work to some kind of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.430
accommodation with the president.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.840
Given the partisanship in
America right now though,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.010
when you have the executive
in the control of one party

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.610
and the legislature in the
control of another party,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.550
it also very well could
mean complete gridlock

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.960
and a situation in which
many of the nations

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.160
most important questions
don't get answered.
