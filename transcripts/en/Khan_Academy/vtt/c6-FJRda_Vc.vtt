00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.130
y is directly proportional to x.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.700
If y equals 30 when
x is equal to 6,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.130
find the value of
x when y is 45.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.480
So let's just take this
each statement at a time.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.080
y is directly proportional to x.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.960
That's literally
just saying that y

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.480
is equal to some
constant times x.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.360
This statement can
literally be translated

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.315
to y is equal to some
constant times x.

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:27.770
y is directly proportional to x.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:36.060
Now, they tell us, if
y is 30 when x is 6--

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.420
and we have this constant
of proportionality--

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.390
this second statement
right over here

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.000
allows us to solve
for this constant.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.730
When x is 6, they
tell us y is 30

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.740
so we can figure out
what this constant is.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.530
We can divide both
sides by 6 and we

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.210
get this left-hand side is
5-- 30 divided by 6 is 5.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.830
5 is equal to k or
k is equal to 5.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.030
So the second sentence tells us,
this gives us the information

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.930
that y is not just k
times x, it tells us

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.330
that y is equal to 5 times
x. y is 30 when x is 6.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.810
And then finally, they say, find
the value of x when y is 45.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.010
So when y is 45 is
equal to-- so we're just

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.580
putting in 45 for y--
45 is equal to 5x.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.690
Divide both sides
by 5 to solve for x.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.830
We get 45 over 5 is 9, and
5x divided by 5 is just x.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.804
So x is equal to 9 when y is 45.
