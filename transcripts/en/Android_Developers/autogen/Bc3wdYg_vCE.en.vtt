00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:29.140 align:start position:0%
that's not how you do it then obviously
 

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's not how you do it then obviously
that's<00:20:29.680><c> a</c><00:20:29.860><c> barrier</c><00:20:30.370><c> for</c><00:20:30.580><c> people</c><00:20:30.610><c> continued</c><00:20:31.300><c> on</c>
