00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.410
Did you know that the soap you use to wash
your face may actually alter the density of

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.410
krill poop?

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.710
It’s actually a big deal.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.610
Hi guys, Lissette here for Dnews.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.490
You may already be familiar with how plastic
in the ocean is killing wildlife, but it’s

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.440
more than just plastic soda rings strangling
seabirds and fish.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.449
The impact of plastic goes far beyond just
what we can immediately see - especially because

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.349
of tiny bits of plastic that end up in the
ocean, called microplastics.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.339
They’re having a ton of secondary effects
and unexpected consequences.

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:41.219
Though there is no standard definition, microplastics
are generally defined as smaller than 5 mm.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.539
In the ocean, these come from larger pieces
of plastic that have degraded over time or

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.879
straight from our products - like the small
plastic beads in our body wash and the plastic

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.249
fibers in our clothes.

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:56.319
A recent study published in the journal Environmental
Science and Technology, found plastics could

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.940
be changing food dispersion!

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.029
Researchers found that zooplankton - which
are small marine animals like krill and copepods

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:05.129
- eat microplastics.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.129
Not good.

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:10.450
Because once the tiny sea creatures eat these
plastic bits, they then excrete them in their

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.420
fecal pellets - yeah poop.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.909
The thing is, this plastic makes their feces
weigh less so it sinks much more slowly....

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.909
And the fact that they’re sinking more slowly
means there’s also more time for other animals

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.109
to eat these pellets, marine animals like
turtles, fish and birds..

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.960
Without the plastic, the feces would sink
faster, getting to the bottom of the ocean

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.009
where it would be consumed by coprophagous
bottom dwellers.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.079
But, now all of a sudden, it is being consumed
by a new group of marine life.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.609
Which is a big problem.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:42.609
First, because the plastics themselves contain
toxic chemicals.

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.539
And second, because plastics absorb toxins
from the surrounding water - this makes their

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.259
toxicity many times greater than the surrounding
water itself.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.590
So, when marine animals eat the plastic poop
pellets, it could be deadly.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.749
The microplastics contain chemicals - like
BPA and Phthalates and when consumed can cause

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:06.869
organ damage, genetic mutations, reproductive
issues, developmental abnormalities and disrupt

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.899
hormone systems.

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.730
In their study, Rochman and colleagues found
that exposure to polyethylene microplastics

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.800
for two months led to liver stress and altered
gene expression in japanese medaka fish (Oryzias

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800
latipes).

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.319
In another study, which was published in the
journal Environmental Pollution, scientists

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.790
found that goby fish, that were exposed to
microplastics, readily confused them for food,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.010
which in turn decreased the amount of real
food they ate.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.299
Again, not good.

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.120
And multiple studies on mollusks, have found
that BPA leads to endocrine disruption that

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.019
causes mollusks to have additional female
organs, engrossed sex glands, and even higher

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.019
mortality.

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.180
Basically, microplastics can really make some
marine life sick.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.830
And because we eat these fish, they may end
up making us sick too - as was suggested by

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.480
the United Nations Environment Programme through
their call to ban microplastics from cosmetics.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.769
However, research on the impact of microplastics
in humans is currently limited.

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.510
But, with more than five trillion bits of
plastic currently in the ocean that reaches

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.540
concentrations of up to 100,000 particles
per cubic meter and more being pumped into

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.269
our environment, it definitely warrants more
research.

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.090
Especially given that one tiny plastic bead
that came from a soap can be cycled through

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.549
multiple fish and fish poo back to fish and
on to us to repeat the cycle all over again.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.849
But this is just one of the many stories you
could tell about our oceans.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.720
Why not tell your own in your style with a
website?

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.489
No domain extension will help you tell your
story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.
