» CARLA HAYDEN: Good evening!  
And welcome.

00:12:03.152 --> 00:12:05.429
We are so pleased to see all of 
you here tonight for a very, 

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.430
very special evening.

00:12:12.764 --> 00:12:15.206
We have to start out with saying
Aloha to students and faculty of

00:12:15.207 --> 00:12:18.081
the University of Hawaii who are
watching 

00:12:22.224 --> 00:12:27.232
via livestream at the Center 
for... 

00:12:28.294 --> 00:12:32.255
I knew it was going to do that.
Oceanography research and 

00:12:32.256 --> 00:12:34.256
education on 

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.650
the University of Hawaii's Minoa
campus.  Excuse me.  I am an 

00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:43.577
arts and sciences major.
And I knew that.  But we are so 

00:12:43.578 --> 00:12:45.724
delighted to have you here 
tonight and on behalf of the 

00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:49.351
Library of Congress it's my 
pleasure to 

00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:53.402
welcome you as we continue a 
wonderful five-year 

00:12:53.403 --> 00:12:55.403
collaboration with the Daniel K.

00:12:56.695 --> 00:12:58.695
Inouye Institute to commemorate 
the 

00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:01.485
life, the legacy and the values 
of the late senator Daniel 

00:13:01.486 --> 00:13:03.486
Inouye.

00:13:05.227 --> 00:13:07.227
As many of you know, he valued 

00:13:08.574 --> 00:13:11.270
friendship before politics, 
country before political party, 

00:13:11.271 --> 00:13:13.271
and honor above all else.

00:13:16.401 --> 00:13:18.448
He was a champion of freedom and
fairness and he it is a 

00:13:18.449 --> 00:13:20.911
privilege for us to celebrate 
his legacy this evening.

00:13:24.636 --> 00:13:26.283
This event is made possible by 
the generous donation from the 

00:13:26.284 --> 00:13:28.284
Daniel K.

00:13:30.623 --> 00:13:32.898
Inouye Institute and we are 
grateful, very grateful to have 

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:34.899
with us this evening the driving
force behind his legacy.

00:13:39.087 --> 00:13:41.087
Mrs. Irene Inouye.

00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:46.141
[Applause]

00:13:49.637 --> 00:13:51.549
We are looking forward to next 
year's celebration and we are 

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.550
hoping that all 

00:13:55.859 --> 00:13:56.252
of you will join us and be part 
of a wonderful, wonderful 

00:13:56.253 --> 00:13:58.253
celebration.

00:14:00.183 --> 00:14:02.183
I'm not going to call upon the 

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.670
director of the John Kluge 
Center, Mr.

00:14:07.602 --> 00:14:08.224
John has kill, who will 
introduce the lecture and the 

00:14:08.225 --> 00:14:12.097
panelists.
[Applause]

00:14:16.854 --> 00:14:20.990
» Thank you.  As many know, Dr. 
Hayden has brought energy and 

00:14:20.991 --> 00:14:25.009
dynamism to the library, only 
here two years, less than two 

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.010
years, and many of us are 
excited to be part of that.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.988
As for the Kluge Center itself, 
under Dr. Hayden it's centered 

00:14:31.989 --> 00:14:35.684
on the original mission to be a 
bridge on scholarship on the one

00:14:35.685 --> 00:14:38.552
hand and policymakers and 
interested public on the other. 

00:14:38.553 --> 00:14:40.553
Tonight's event exemplifies that
purpose.

00:14:43.086 --> 00:14:45.157
Senator Inouye was a larger than
life figure here in Washington 

00:14:45.158 --> 00:14:47.158
and in his home state of Hawaii.

00:14:50.113 --> 00:14:51.759
As a young man after the ban was
lifted on Japanese Americans 

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.085
serving their countries he 
enlisted in the army and served 

00:14:56.086 --> 00:14:58.086
in a unit of Japanese 

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.379
American soldiers who fought 
with extraordinary gallant triin

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.380
Italy, France and Germany.

00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:07.577
On October 21, 1945, in the 
war's final weeks in Europe, he 

00:15:07.578 --> 00:15:09.578
was severely wounded.

00:15:11.728 --> 00:15:13.813
He had just taken out two German
machine gun nests.  He lost his 

00:15:13.814 --> 00:15:15.814
right arm.

00:15:18.173 --> 00:15:20.634
He returned home with a 
distinguished service cross, 

00:15:20.635 --> 00:15:22.635
bronze star medal, two 

00:15:24.813 --> 00:15:27.522
purple hearts, 12 other medals 
and citations and not 

00:15:27.523 --> 00:15:31.304
incidentally a commitment to 
bipartisanship that may have 

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.305
stemmed from the lifelong 
friendships he formed in an army

00:15:34.942 --> 00:15:36.942
hospital with another wounded 
veteran, 

00:15:37.947 --> 00:15:39.588
the future Republican senator 
vice presidential candidate and 

00:15:39.589 --> 00:15:41.589
presidential candidate, Kansas's
bob Doyle.

00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:46.351
After coming home and finishing 
law school Mr. Inouye became 

00:15:46.352 --> 00:15:48.628
Hawaii's first representative in
1959, the year Hawaii became a 

00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:50.629
state.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.703
Three years later he was elected
senator.  Part of a freshman 

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.704
class inspired by President 
Kennedy, which included 

00:15:58.051 --> 00:16:00.051
President Kennedy's brother, 
Edward.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.786
Senator Inouye served nearly 
half a century in the senate 

00:16:03.787 --> 00:16:09.402
leaving a rich legacy that 
includes the National Museum of 

00:16:09.403 --> 00:16:11.403
the Native American prominent 
service 

00:16:12.926 --> 00:16:15.376
on the Watergate committee and 
Iran contracommittee and on the 

00:16:15.377 --> 00:16:18.234
senate appropriation committee 
he chaired in the last several 

00:16:18.235 --> 00:16:20.235
years of his career.

00:16:21.538 --> 00:16:23.174
He was awarded the congressional
medal of honor in 2000 for his 

00:16:23.175 --> 00:16:25.175
military service.

00:16:26.924 --> 00:16:28.558
After his death he was 
posthumously awarded the 

00:16:28.559 --> 00:16:30.559
Presidential Medal of Freedom, 
becoming the first senator to 

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.134
receive both of those awards.
Tonight the John W.

00:16:38.249 --> 00:16:40.249
Kluge Center at the library and 
I do I 

00:16:41.264 --> 00:16:43.264
do Daniel K.

00:16:46.487 --> 00:16:48.606
Inouye institute commemorate 
senator's moral courage, public 

00:16:48.607 --> 00:16:50.607
service and civic engagement.

00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:56.572
I would now like to introduce 
our distinguished panelists 

00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:54.706
tonight.  First E.J.

00:16:57.207 --> 00:16:58.440
Dionne, who writes about 
politics in twice-weekly column 

00:16:58.441 --> 00:17:03.217
for The Washington Post where he
worked since 1990.  Also a 

00:17:03.218 --> 00:17:04.258
government professor at 
Georgetown, a visiting professor

00:17:04.259 --> 00:17:07.316
at Harvard, and a senior fellow 
at the Brookings Institution.

00:17:11.824 --> 00:17:13.824
He's the sole author of seven 
books, 

00:17:16.366 --> 00:17:18.366
most recently "Why the Right 
Went Wrong."

00:17:20.112 --> 00:17:22.983
He made his name as a major 
political intellectual with the 

00:17:22.984 --> 00:17:26.247
publication of "Why Americans 
Hate Politics" in 1991.  It's 

00:17:26.248 --> 00:17:28.248
not a new thing.

00:17:32.776 --> 00:17:35.449
Ross Douthat joined op-ed New 
York Times in April 2009, 

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.450
previously senior editor at the 
Atlantic.

00:17:40.572 --> 00:17:43.049
He's the author of four books, 
this year "To Change the Church.

00:17:48.948 --> 00:17:52.548
"  As well as "Grand New Party,"
"Grand New Party: How 

00:17:48.948 --> 00:17:49.366
Republicans Can Win the Working 
Class and Save the American 

00:17:49.367 --> 00:17:51.367
Dream.

00:17:53.278 --> 00:17:55.278
"  Our conversation will be 
moderated by 

00:17:57.325 --> 00:17:59.559
Ann Compton, normer ABC News 
White House correspondent Ann 

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.560
joined in 1973 and covered seven
presidents, traveled 

00:18:04.645 --> 00:18:06.068
around the globe and through all
50 states with the president, 

00:18:06.069 --> 00:18:09.928
vice presidents as well as first
ladies.  We're delighted she can

00:18:09.929 --> 00:18:14.002
be with us.  After the 
conversation we'll allot time 

00:18:14.003 --> 00:18:16.003
for audience questions.  That 
would be after some pre-recorded

00:18:17.045 --> 00:18:19.213
questions from students at the 
University of Hawaii campuses.

00:18:19.214 --> 00:18:23.079
Please join me in welcoming our 
distinguished panelists to the 

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.080
stage.

00:18:27.302 --> 00:18:29.302
[Applause]

00:18:47.301 --> 00:18:52.211
» ANN COMPTON: Good evening.  
Thank you.  Aloha to the 

00:18:52.212 --> 00:18:56.757
students who are watching, and 
to all of you who have come 

00:18:56.758 --> 00:18:58.758
tonight to talk about the 
American dream.

00:19:03.752 --> 00:19:05.600
It probably goes back to we hold
these truths to be self-evident,

00:19:05.601 --> 00:19:08.278
all men are created equal, life,
liberty and the pursuit of 

00:19:08.279 --> 00:19:10.797
happiness.  But where is the 
American dream today?

00:19:15.478 --> 00:19:17.902
And is there -- can there be 
such a thing in a world as 

00:19:17.903 --> 00:19:19.903
Dionne verse and deeply divided 
as our times as these.

00:19:26.112 --> 00:19:28.804
Senator Dan Inouye lived the 
American dream.  In fact, he 

00:19:28.805 --> 00:19:31.070
bled for it as President Obama 
said in his eulogy when the 

00:19:31.715 --> 00:19:34.954
senator died.
Ross, I'm going to start with 

00:19:34.955 --> 00:19:39.665
you.  You wrote recently about 
the American dream and said "it 

00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:42.974
ain't in California."
[chuckles]

00:19:44.188 --> 00:19:45.615
» ROSS DOUTHAT: But possibly 
Hawaii.

00:19:45.616 --> 00:19:47.616
Right.

00:19:49.884 --> 00:19:52.549
Well, that column was about -- 
employ, in certain ways I would 

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.920
say that the state of California
has become especially in the 

00:19:56.921 --> 00:19:59.637
presidency of Donald Trump a 
kind of idealized view of 

00:20:01.456 --> 00:20:03.300
America's political future for 
some liberals and progressives 

00:20:03.301 --> 00:20:08.431
and Democrats in the sense that 
in California you have a 

00:20:08.432 --> 00:20:11.121
situation where the Republican 
Party as nationally is pretty 

00:20:11.122 --> 00:20:13.122
dysfunctional, 

00:20:14.193 --> 00:20:16.193
but unlike nationally, it's 
pretty much irrelevant as well.

00:20:18.902 --> 00:20:20.762
And in that sense, California, 
you know, therefore California 

00:20:20.763 --> 00:20:24.937
is sort of not only as always 
sort of on the cutting-edge of, 

00:20:24.938 --> 00:20:28.735
you know, new technology in 
Silicon Valley and the movie 

00:20:28.736 --> 00:20:31.224
industry and so on, but also 
seen as being kind of on the 

00:20:31.225 --> 00:20:33.644
cutting-edge of where 
progressive politics could hope 

00:20:33.645 --> 00:20:38.778
to be if the darkness of the 
Trump era should pass and the 

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.779
emerging democratic majority 
should finally emerge.

00:20:42.886 --> 00:20:45.347
So the column I wrote was 
basically saying that, you know,

00:20:45.348 --> 00:20:47.348
while that might 

00:20:48.859 --> 00:20:50.523
be true, if you look at the sort
of sociological landscape of 

00:20:50.524 --> 00:20:52.524
California, if 

00:20:53.807 --> 00:20:56.657
you look at sort of the social 
structure that has emerged 

00:20:56.658 --> 00:20:58.658
there, it doesn't look 

00:21:00.314 --> 00:21:02.982
at all like what I think many 
progressives, E.J. probably 

00:21:02.983 --> 00:21:06.265
included, would argue is the 
essence of the American dream.  

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:07.901
We can sort of go back and forth
on what that essence is, but I 

00:21:07.902 --> 00:21:09.902
think most people would say it 
has something to do 

00:21:14.125 --> 00:21:16.604
with a mix of kind of, you know,
a sort of strong economically 

00:21:16.605 --> 00:21:18.605
stable middle 

00:21:19.683 --> 00:21:21.571
crass and various forms of sort 
of social equality and upward 

00:21:21.572 --> 00:21:23.840
mobility that sort of intersect 
in different ways.

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:28.885
And the society that California 
has, 

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.666
even under progressive 
governance is a much more 

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:35.119
stratified society in which, for
various complicated reasons of 

00:21:38.853 --> 00:21:40.700
public policy and sort of 
overall macro-trends, the middle

00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:45.271
class has basically been priced 
out, and so you have an 

00:21:45.272 --> 00:21:47.272
extremely wealthy upper class 

00:21:48.742 --> 00:21:50.358
that has sort of entrenched its 
privileges in various ways 

00:21:50.359 --> 00:21:55.272
through land use regulations and
restrictions on building and 

00:21:55.273 --> 00:21:57.273
everything else, and then 

00:21:58.757 --> 00:22:00.816
you have an increasingly 
immigrant based working class 

00:22:00.817 --> 00:22:03.221
that sort of serves as sort of 
the service sector for that 

00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:07.275
economy, and you have very 
little in between.  And once you

00:22:07.276 --> 00:22:09.312
control for cost of living, 
extremely high child poverty 

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.218
rates, extremely high racial 
gaps.  You know, again whatever 

00:22:13.219 --> 00:22:18.097
else the American dream means, 
it has something to do with the 

00:22:18.098 --> 00:22:18.918
equality of the races and 
equality of opportunity and so 

00:22:18.919 --> 00:22:20.919
on.

00:22:22.672 --> 00:22:25.112
And so the takeaway from the 
column, I guess, was that if 

00:22:25.113 --> 00:22:29.019
this is the future and if this 
is particularly the future that 

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.048
progressives are hoping to build
after the age of Donald Trump 

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:36.164
should pass, then there's still 
considerable work to be done if 

00:22:36.165 --> 00:22:38.823
that future is going to sort of 
dove tail with what, again, I 

00:22:41.691 --> 00:22:42.713
think traditionally Americans 
have sort of imagined the 

00:22:42.714 --> 00:22:46.463
American dream to be.
And just to personalize it a 

00:22:46.464 --> 00:22:51.022
tiny bit as I did in the column,
I'm from the east coast but I 

00:22:51.023 --> 00:22:53.023
was actually born in San 
Francisco in 1979.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.656
And I was born there because my 
father was from southern 

00:22:58.657 --> 00:23:00.657
California, and he 

00:23:01.746 --> 00:23:04.409
grew up in Santa Monica in a 
period when that was a kind of 

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:06.410
middle-class paradise.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.186
His dad was a pretty 
unsuccessful small businessman, 

00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:11.187
I think it's fair to say.

00:23:14.178 --> 00:23:16.178
He ran a bicycle shop badly and 
had 

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.586
various sort of salesman-y 
Willie Lowman-ish jobs, and my 

00:23:20.587 --> 00:23:23.951
grandmother sort of held the 
house together.  But they were 

00:23:23.952 --> 00:23:25.987
in no way what you would 
consider sort of a major 

00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:28.643
American successes.  They were 
sort of slightly below the 

00:23:28.644 --> 00:23:30.644
middle class.

00:23:34.448 --> 00:23:36.732
And yet they, you know, owned a 
small sort of mission-style home

00:23:36.733 --> 00:23:39.014
in a neighborhood that was close
to the ocean 

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:44.566
and felt like earthly paradise 
and were surrounded by people 

00:23:44.567 --> 00:23:46.567
with similar means and 
aspirations.

00:23:48.336 --> 00:23:50.573
And there are automatic kinds of
sort of inevitable reasons why 

00:23:50.574 --> 00:23:52.824
that couldn't last, but it's 
still notable that it didn't 

00:23:52.825 --> 00:23:57.781
last.  If you go back to Santa 
Monica now, all the houses like 

00:23:57.782 --> 00:23:59.782
the one where my dad grew up 
have been torn down to make way 

00:24:01.475 --> 00:24:03.475
for structures that are two or 
three 

00:24:04.575 --> 00:24:07.443
times too large for the lots 
they sit on and all cost 4 or $5

00:24:07.444 --> 00:24:09.444
million, and that world is gone.

00:24:11.129 --> 00:24:12.585
And, you know, it was a racially
segregated world, it was 

00:24:12.586 --> 00:24:15.660
stratified in all kinds of other
ways.  There are all kinds of 

00:24:15.661 --> 00:24:17.962
reasons why it's never coming 
back can be, but it's 

00:24:21.233 --> 00:24:24.143
still notable it existed and 
then disappeared and its 

00:24:24.144 --> 00:24:26.730
disappearance is one of the 
realities underlying some of our

00:24:27.375 --> 00:24:31.709
present political discontents.
» ANN COMPTON: E.J., is the 

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.710
American dream even possible in 

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.254
a society, in a political 
society, that is as divided as 

00:24:38.255 --> 00:24:41.303
Washington is now, as this 
country is now?

00:24:41.304 --> 00:24:46.214
» E.J. DIONNE: Could I say a 
couple things first if I may?  

00:24:46.215 --> 00:24:49.083
Whenever I'm with my friend 
Ross, I feel obligated to defend

Pope Francis...
[ Laughter ]

00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:54.435
And now I feel obligated to 
defend California and his 

00:24:54.436 --> 00:24:57.521
grandfather.
[ Laughter ]

00:24:57.938 --> 00:24:59.938
» E.J. DIONNE: I want to say 
it's a joy to be 

00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:05.389
at the Library of Congress and I

00:25:07.735 --> 00:25:10.212
am ---I am the son of a 
librarian, so to have the opener

00:25:10.213 --> 00:25:13.698
of a program like this be the 
Librarian of Congress for me is 

00:25:13.699 --> 00:25:15.330
higher than having the president
of the United States here.  So I

00:25:15.331 --> 00:25:17.207
want to...
[ Laughter ]

00:25:17.208 --> 00:25:19.208
[Applause]

00:25:23.586 --> 00:25:24.404
» ROSS DOUTHAT: More true now 
than in some administrations.

00:25:24.405 --> 00:25:27.465
» E.J. DIONNE: You can interpret
that in many different ways and 

00:25:27.466 --> 00:25:29.466
they're probably all true.

00:25:32.665 --> 00:25:33.085
Second, it's a real joy to be 
here as part of the Inouye 

00:25:33.086 --> 00:25:35.968
program.  This is my second 
Inouye event this year.

00:25:42.373 --> 00:25:45.063
And I got to do a talk in Hawaii
and learned an enormous amount 

00:25:45.064 --> 00:25:47.086
about Hawaii politics.  It's 
great to start with a little 

00:25:48.765 --> 00:25:50.765
knowledge or a learning curve is
awesome.

00:25:51.894 --> 00:25:53.960
But I realize, when I was 
thinking about the American 

00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:55.961
dream, Inouye is part of that.

00:25:58.894 --> 00:26:01.542
And that it's one of the ironyst
of our history that Japanese 

00:26:01.543 --> 00:26:05.463
Americans and non-whites in 
general in Hawaii broke through 

00:26:05.464 --> 00:26:07.464
partly because of their service 
in World War II.

00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:14.327
And that Hawaiian politics were 
revolutionized by a group of 

00:26:14.328 --> 00:26:17.234
veterans led by Senator Inouye 
that created the modern 

00:26:17.235 --> 00:26:19.235
Democratic party.

00:26:20.734 --> 00:26:21.771
So I thank the folks associated 
with Senator Inouye for giving 

00:26:21.772 --> 00:26:23.772
me this education.

00:26:25.865 --> 00:26:27.711
Last, I want to say I'm a huge 
fan of Ross despite our 

00:26:27.712 --> 00:26:32.286
disagreements.  I teach a class 
at Georgetown on median politics

00:26:32.287 --> 00:26:34.287
and I realized you 

00:26:35.399 --> 00:26:37.236
better pay attention to this 
online thing in this median 

00:26:37.237 --> 00:26:39.237
politics class.

00:26:40.526 --> 00:26:42.610
My first two guests were a 
23-year-old blogger for the 

00:26:42.611 --> 00:26:44.611
throng.

00:26:45.725 --> 00:26:47.725
My first two blogger guests, my 
first 

00:26:49.435 --> 00:26:51.435
opening to that world, a 
22-year-old blogger --

00:26:51.477 --> 00:26:51.894
» ROSS DOUTHAT: Surely 24, must 
have been, at least.

00:26:51.895 --> 00:26:53.895
» E.J. DIONNE: I'll double 
check.

00:26:56.152 --> 00:26:59.042
A 23-year-old blogger named Ezra
Klein.  So I tell my students 

00:26:59.043 --> 00:27:01.043
that my class is 

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.279
way ahead of the mainstream 
media, and I've always been 

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.280
grateful to Ross for being 
there.

00:27:08.007 --> 00:27:10.269
You know, ill thought a lot 
about this topic in the last few

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.270
weeks, thinking, 

00:27:15.989 --> 00:27:18.466
you know, about the event 
tonight, and a really vexed idea

00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:21.163
that, you know, it can be seen 
as a kind of romantic view of 

00:27:24.426 --> 00:27:26.901
what opportunity is like in 
America given the group's 

00:27:26.902 --> 00:27:29.786
history who have been excluded 
from it.  But the other side of 

00:27:29.787 --> 00:27:31.787
it, and it may 

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:36.294
be most powerful, when it's used
as a call upon us to make our 

00:27:36.295 --> 00:27:38.295
country what it 

00:27:39.393 --> 00:27:41.393
not -- what it isn't yet but 
ought to be.

00:27:43.474 --> 00:27:45.474
And sort of two uses like that 
came to mind.

00:27:47.537 --> 00:27:49.816
One was, of course, Martin 
Luther King's "I have a dream" 

00:27:49.817 --> 00:27:51.817
speech and he 

00:27:53.682 --> 00:27:56.072
was very explicit in saying, it 
is a dream deeply rooted in the 

00:27:56.073 --> 00:27:58.073
American dream.

00:27:59.146 --> 00:28:02.003
And as you suggested at the 
beginning, he too invoked the 

00:28:02.004 --> 00:28:04.004
declaration, I have a dream that
one day this nation will rise 

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.400
up and live out the true meaning
of its creed, we hold these 

00:28:09.401 --> 00:28:11.401
truths to be self-evident that 
all men are created equal.

00:28:14.134 --> 00:28:16.134
But it also can be used as a 
critique.

00:28:19.385 --> 00:28:21.927
Many of you know probably 
Langston Hughes's most famous 

00:28:21.928 --> 00:28:25.447
poem "what happens to a dream 
deferred does it dry up like a 

00:28:25.448 --> 00:28:27.448
raisin in the sun.

00:28:29.369 --> 00:28:31.369
"  And what I had forgotten is 
how that 

00:28:32.439 --> 00:28:33.890
poem ends, which is what happens
to a dream deferred, the last 

00:28:33.891 --> 00:28:36.161
line of the poem is "or does it 
explode.

00:28:39.275 --> 00:28:41.275
"  And it's a sort of reminder 
what can 

00:28:43.641 --> 00:28:44.242
happen when we hold up these 
ideals and then don't live up to

00:28:44.243 --> 00:28:47.115
them.
I was trying to think about, 

00:28:47.116 --> 00:28:49.116
what is the definition of this?

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:55.530
And I think one take is that 
hard work leads to success.

00:28:57.382 --> 00:28:59.382
That's one kind of definition of
the American dream.

00:29:01.468 --> 00:29:03.897
The other is that the next 
generation will do better than 

00:29:03.898 --> 00:29:05.898
the previous generation.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.480
Those are sort of vexed now.

00:29:14.222 --> 00:29:16.223
We still believe -- we're still 
optimists even after everything 

00:29:16.224 --> 00:29:18.224
we've 

00:29:20.061 --> 00:29:21.495
gone through, 61% of the 
population, according to Gallup 

00:29:21.496 --> 00:29:23.496
believes that young people will 
live better than their parents.

00:29:27.321 --> 00:29:29.176
But there has been a decline in 
some of these numbers right at 

00:29:29.177 --> 00:29:31.177
the turn of 

00:29:32.274 --> 00:29:33.514
the millennium, 74% of us 
believe that people who work 

00:29:33.515 --> 00:29:35.515
hard can get ahead.

00:29:37.921 --> 00:29:39.921
And that fell to 58% at the end 
of the recession.

00:29:41.639 --> 00:29:43.509
And to go to just briefly to 
your point, can we achieve this 

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.510
in a country 

00:29:47.718 --> 00:29:49.978
so divided, it strikes me that 
we will have trouble sort of 

00:29:49.979 --> 00:29:54.481
creating public policy that 
might move us forward because we

00:29:54.482 --> 00:29:57.339
are so deadlocked about what 
that policy should be.  But even

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.340
our view of the American 

00:30:02.698 --> 00:30:05.428
dream is now shaped 
bipartisanship, the optimism 

00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:07.429
that people had in the Gallup 
survey went up because so many 

00:30:09.977 --> 00:30:11.413
Republicans switched from 
negative to positive after 

00:30:11.414 --> 00:30:13.414
President Obama was out of 
office.  That's on the one side.

00:30:15.704 --> 00:30:17.704
And the other side, there is -- 
I was 

00:30:21.297 --> 00:30:23.137
looking at a study of 
millennials, the Obama years, 

00:30:23.138 --> 00:30:27.467
African American millennials 
were more optimistic and more 

00:30:27.468 --> 00:30:28.685
likely to believe in the 
American dream than white 

00:30:28.686 --> 00:30:30.686
millennials were.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.703
So it's our view of this is 
shaped partly by politics, 

00:30:36.704 --> 00:30:38.704
partly by race and partly by 
where we fit in the society.

00:30:40.853 --> 00:30:43.344
» ANN COMPTON: You know, you 
touch on exactly what the Kluge 

00:30:43.345 --> 00:30:45.807
Center does, and that's to 
connect thought to action, and 

00:30:48.065 --> 00:30:50.930
those two common measures of the
American dream as you just both 

00:30:50.931 --> 00:30:54.033
just pointed out, are you better
off than your parents were?

00:30:58.173 --> 00:31:00.173
And the other is, do you own a 
home?

00:31:01.868 --> 00:31:03.868
Ross, let me start with you, and
then 

00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:07.389
the Kluge answer would be, and 
what do we ought to do about it?

00:31:09.752 --> 00:31:11.375
Are you better off than your 
parents, are your kids, although

00:31:11.376 --> 00:31:13.376
they're small now, going to be 
better off than you?

00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:18.993
Are there things as a society 
you think can be done to push 

00:31:18.994 --> 00:31:22.782
that along?
» ROSS DOUTHAT: On the personal 

00:31:22.783 --> 00:31:24.783
front we 

00:31:25.891 --> 00:31:27.986
just went through a really bad 
real estate transaction, sort of

00:31:27.987 --> 00:31:31.359
exacerbated by illness.  It's a 
bad time to make that 

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.885
assessment.  I wouldn't want to 
-- I wouldn't want to apply our 

00:31:36.886 --> 00:31:39.986
particular situation to the 
country as a whole.  But to 

00:31:39.987 --> 00:31:42.051
generalize --
» E.J. DIONNE: I hope this 

00:31:42.052 --> 00:31:44.082
increases your appreciation for 
regulation.

00:31:46.342 --> 00:31:49.195
» ROSS DOUTHAT: That and 
speaking engagements and 

00:31:49.196 --> 00:31:51.196
honoraria as well, incredibly 
important.

00:31:53.286 --> 00:31:55.739
But, I mean, I think generally, 
you know, there's no question 

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.697
that over the last 40 years on 
this sort of "are you better off

00:31:59.698 --> 00:32:01.747
than your parents" question, the
country has gone through a long 

00:32:01.748 --> 00:32:03.748
period of stagnation.

00:32:05.829 --> 00:32:11.187
Tyler Keown, E.J. knows well, 
economist at George Mason wrote 

00:32:11.188 --> 00:32:13.037
a book called "the great 
stagnation," describing this 

00:32:13.038 --> 00:32:17.941
long period where the median 
income, which is as good a way 

00:32:17.942 --> 00:32:19.995
of measuring the sort of heart 
of American life as any, the 

00:32:21.978 --> 00:32:24.218
median income basically got 
stuck.  And so it wasn't a 

00:32:24.219 --> 00:32:29.192
period of collapse.  It wasn't 
the Great Depression, you know, 

00:32:29.193 --> 00:32:30.425
we slowly -- we've had, 
obviously, a severe recession 

00:32:30.426 --> 00:32:34.318
recently.  We slowly climbed 
back from.  But basically the 

00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:38.631
story of sort of a society where
the economy for most people 

00:32:38.632 --> 00:32:40.246
seems kind of stuck and where 
you aren't sort of -- you're 

00:32:40.247 --> 00:32:42.247
doing okay.

00:32:43.749 --> 00:32:46.210
You're not in poverty, you know,
you have welfare state programs 

00:32:46.211 --> 00:32:50.534
that sort of stabilize things 
during recessions, but what we 

00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:52.600
had gotten used to during these 
waves of expansion, you know, 

00:32:52.601 --> 00:32:56.915
during the Industrial Revolution
and then again in the post-war 

00:32:56.916 --> 00:32:58.916
boom just hasn't been there for 
most people.

00:33:01.444 --> 00:33:03.876
And over that same period you've
had a kind of hollowing out of 

00:33:03.877 --> 00:33:08.868
community in American life, 
because I think another aspect 

00:33:08.869 --> 00:33:10.312
of the American dream is, you 
know, if you go back to sort of 

00:33:10.313 --> 00:33:12.313
the 

00:33:13.407 --> 00:33:15.407
people who came to visit America
in the 

00:33:18.591 --> 00:33:20.420
19th century, Alexis Philtope 
most famously and what they 

00:33:20.421 --> 00:33:22.868
remarked on, well, you have a 
weaker state here than you often

00:33:22.869 --> 00:33:26.560
do in Europe.  You don't have an
established church.  You don't 

00:33:26.561 --> 00:33:28.561
have a lot of the big 

00:33:30.264 --> 00:33:32.317
institutions, but you have this 
incredible community spirit 

00:33:32.318 --> 00:33:37.912
often rooted in religion but 
also civic engagement and other 

00:33:37.913 --> 00:33:39.913
things from the New England 

00:33:41.236 --> 00:33:44.969
town meetings through the 
culture of the Midwest and so 

00:33:41.236 --> 00:33:46.125
on.  And that has obviously 
taken a hit over the last couple

00:33:46.126 --> 00:33:50.824
generations, and there's a long 
and complicated argument about 

00:33:50.825 --> 00:33:53.115
how those two things intertwine.
How is the decline of marriage 

00:33:53.116 --> 00:33:58.273
rates and the decline of church 
going and the decline of bowling

00:33:58.274 --> 00:34:00.558
leagues and all these things, 
how is that related to economic 

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:02.559
stagnation?

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.686
How do the two fit together?  
But that tangle is the sort of 

00:34:05.687 --> 00:34:10.352
-- that's the central policy 
problem, I think, sort of, you 

00:34:10.353 --> 00:34:12.812
know, how do you figure out, 
one, how to get the economy 

00:34:15.322 --> 00:34:17.325
working better for most 
Americans?  And at the same time

00:34:17.326 --> 00:34:19.326
how do you have a 

00:34:21.641 --> 00:34:24.523
kind of, you know, sort of civic
and familial and religious sort 

00:34:24.524 --> 00:34:28.030
of -- sort of a knitting back 
together of the social fabric.  

00:34:28.031 --> 00:34:30.031
And we have a lot of evidence 
from the 

00:34:31.507 --> 00:34:33.139
last five or ten years that this
-- you know, that things 

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.140
actually have gotten worse in a 
lot of respects.

00:34:38.721 --> 00:34:41.208
I mean, the opioid epidemic, 
suicide rates have gone up, you 

00:34:41.209 --> 00:34:43.486
know, you have a decline in 
American life expectancy for the

00:34:43.487 --> 00:34:45.487
first time.

00:34:46.971 --> 00:34:48.833
And that's sort of concentrated 
in particular parts of the 

00:34:48.834 --> 00:34:50.834
country and especially to E.J.

00:34:52.345 --> 00:34:54.345
's point, it seems to be -- 
there is 

00:34:59.682 --> 00:35:01.682
more sort of social

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.552
anime, mess civil in working 
class white America than blacks 

00:35:05.553 --> 00:35:07.594
and Hispanics.  That's the 
policy problem.

00:35:11.279 --> 00:35:13.336
And to the extent there's a 
solution, I think it lies 

00:35:13.337 --> 00:35:16.799
somewhere at the intersection of
the social and economic, that we

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.031
should be looking for policies 
that basically say, well, on the

00:35:19.032 --> 00:35:21.032
one 

00:35:22.117 --> 00:35:24.147
hand you probably do need to 
find ways to raise wages, get 

00:35:24.148 --> 00:35:27.841
more money into the hands of the
middle and working class.  At 

00:35:27.842 --> 00:35:30.734
the same time you want those 
policies to sort of somehow 

00:35:30.735 --> 00:35:32.785
create a virtuous cycle with 
families and 

00:35:35.841 --> 00:35:37.841
communities and so on and not 
just 

00:35:39.353 --> 00:35:41.828
become the kind of things that I
think since a lot of Trump 

00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:43.829
voters rebelled 

00:35:45.317 --> 00:35:47.706
against, the idea that, well, 
your -- I think the Democratic 

00:35:47.707 --> 00:35:49.707
party ended up in a 

00:35:51.603 --> 00:35:53.231
position where technically its 
economic policies are more 

00:35:53.232 --> 00:35:58.228
popular but people don't like 
the idea, well, my community has

00:35:58.229 --> 00:35:59.675
been hollowed out, the jobs are 
never coming back, but at least 

00:35:59.676 --> 00:36:01.676
I have Medicaid.

00:36:02.734 --> 00:36:04.195
They liked more the idea that 
Trump was selling of, you're 

00:36:04.196 --> 00:36:08.079
going to get the jobs back, 
ethics are going to be the way 

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.716
they were -- things are going to
be the way they were before and 

00:36:09.717 --> 00:36:11.717
I don't 

00:36:12.741 --> 00:36:14.393
think that was a completely 
honest sales pitch but spoke to 

00:36:14.394 --> 00:36:16.647
a challenge I think both parties
haven't been able to meet 

00:36:19.946 --> 00:36:22.173
that combined ideas sort of 
solid jobs and solid civic life 

00:36:22.174 --> 00:36:24.593
that sort of slipped away in big
parts of the country.

00:36:27.036 --> 00:36:30.169
» ANN COMPTON: Let's stick with 
the economics.

00:36:27.036 --> 00:36:30.921
» E.J. DIONNE: I think we agree 
to a significant degree.  

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:33.804
Actually I think one of the big 
questions we need to grapple 

00:36:33.805 --> 00:36:35.879
with is whether that decline in 
community, 

00:36:40.646 --> 00:36:42.282
family breakup and all of that 
is primarily -- conservative 

00:36:42.283 --> 00:36:44.283
sense, talk 

00:36:45.353 --> 00:36:47.214
about the cause going from there
to economic conditions, 

00:36:47.215 --> 00:36:49.451
progressives look at economic 
conditions and say, those 

00:36:52.765 --> 00:36:55.424
are actually fostering the 
decline of community, the 

00:36:55.425 --> 00:37:00.163
problems families confront, and 
in some different worlds, it 

00:37:00.164 --> 00:37:02.164
would be nice to have a 
conversation 

00:37:04.057 --> 00:37:06.116
where I would continue to argue 
that -- importance of economic, 

00:37:06.117 --> 00:37:07.962
but progressives and 
conservatives can say, you have 

00:37:07.963 --> 00:37:11.022
to care about the family and 
civic life and you have to care 

00:37:11.023 --> 00:37:13.023
about the economic base.

00:37:14.926 --> 00:37:17.775
But I think we've had a real 
crisis measured by the numbers 

00:37:17.776 --> 00:37:20.221
in social mobility since you can
date it from 

00:37:24.787 --> 00:37:27.466
1973, you can date it from 1980,
but opportunity does seem to be 

00:37:27.467 --> 00:37:30.492
sticking more to people in the 
upper middle class and above.

00:37:35.023 --> 00:37:37.734
My colleague at the Brookings 
Institution, Richard Reeves 

00:37:37.735 --> 00:37:39.735
wrote a book 

00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:42.842
called "Dream Hoarders" about 
the upper middle class.

00:37:44.335 --> 00:37:45.369
And it's easier -- that's not 
counting the extremely 

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:47.370
privileged.

00:37:49.655 --> 00:37:52.045
This is a broader top of the 
society, have been able to pass 

00:37:52.046 --> 00:37:57.644
along their advantages more 
efficiently to their kids than 

00:37:57.645 --> 00:38:00.334
earlier upper classes have been,
and actually I discovered, 

00:38:00.335 --> 00:38:04.414
Richard quoted something I said 
over lunch in the book, and 

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:06.415
thank God he's a friend because 
he quoted something I kind of 

00:38:09.743 --> 00:38:12.223
like to repeat instead of some 
damn fool thing I said over 

00:38:12.224 --> 00:38:14.224
lunch, which there were many.

00:38:15.927 --> 00:38:18.400
But I said that I spend my weeks
writing columns denouncing 

00:38:18.401 --> 00:38:23.100
inequality and my nights and 
weekends increasing it.  Because

00:38:23.101 --> 00:38:25.101
someone effectively in the upper
middle class, whatever class I'm

00:38:26.176 --> 00:38:28.668
in, somewhere up there, I have 
the opportunity to pass along 

00:38:28.669 --> 00:38:32.801
benefits to my kids, you know, 
for no particular virtue of 

00:38:32.802 --> 00:38:34.270
mine, just because I happen to 
be here, and I am going to do 

00:38:34.271 --> 00:38:39.459
whatever I can to help my kids, 
as all of us will do, but those 

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.917
kind of -- you know, the way in 
which those advantages kind of 

00:38:44.172 --> 00:38:46.172
bundle together, we have less 
social mobility.

00:38:47.833 --> 00:38:49.833
The second thing is, we have had
less 

00:38:52.369 --> 00:38:54.369
-- far less equally distributed 
income 

00:38:55.668 --> 00:38:57.668
growth, that in the sort of 
great period 

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.946
from World War II through the 
mid '70s, 1980, each quintile 

00:39:02.947 --> 00:39:04.947
tended to go up roughly equally.

00:39:07.896 --> 00:39:08.118
Not a great period of economic 
growth but shared economic 

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:10.119
growth.

00:39:11.165 --> 00:39:13.165
Since then we have -- it has not
been 

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:15.933
shared at all, that the middle 
and bottom has stagnated and a 

00:39:15.934 --> 00:39:17.934
lot of 

00:39:18.975 --> 00:39:20.221
benefits have gone to the top, 
and especially to the very top.

00:39:23.744 --> 00:39:26.639
And what we're discovering, this
is a question Americans have to 

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.313
be tough on ourselves about, is 
that, you know, in 

00:39:34.635 --> 00:39:36.484
some ways the American dream is 
now a sort of demand social 

00:39:36.485 --> 00:39:38.485
Democratic dream, 

00:39:41.195 --> 00:39:43.195
which is to say that the 
societies that 

00:39:44.265 --> 00:39:47.124
have less inequality tend to 
have more social mobility and 

00:39:47.125 --> 00:39:51.218
that there -- my conservative 
friends like to say, I'm not for

00:39:51.219 --> 00:39:53.219
equality of results but I am for
equality of opportunity.

00:39:55.937 --> 00:39:57.610
But what appears to be the case 
is if your class and incomes, 

00:39:57.611 --> 00:40:00.083
you know, your class system and 
your income 

00:40:03.169 --> 00:40:05.169
distribution gets too far out of
whack, 

00:40:06.384 --> 00:40:10.218
you lose the capacity for mass 
upward mobility.  Again, this 

00:40:10.219 --> 00:40:12.219
probably reflects the difference
in our political view, but I 

00:40:14.562 --> 00:40:17.247
think we need somewhat more 
egalitarian public policies in 

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.248
order to produce the degree of 
mobility that the American 

00:40:22.399 --> 00:40:23.229
dream suggests we ought to have.
» ANN COMPTON: I'm turning to 

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.230
education now.

00:40:28.791 --> 00:40:30.791
Both of you went to Harvard, and

00:40:31.073 --> 00:40:33.073
» ROSS DOUTHAT: He wrote a whole
book about it.

00:40:37.677 --> 00:40:39.919
Writes a book criticizing 
Harvard, joins the Catholic 

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.920
Church and writes a book 
criticizing the point.

00:40:42.195 --> 00:40:44.195
» ANN COMPTON: Ross, it's been 
more than 

00:40:45.268 --> 00:40:47.585
a decade since you wrote so 
lovingly of your Harvard years.

00:40:47.586 --> 00:40:49.586
» ROSS DOUTHAT: A fond critique.

00:40:52.734 --> 00:40:54.787
» ANN COMPTON: 300 pages down 
for 60 seconds for this 

00:40:54.788 --> 00:40:57.443
audience, and my question is, a 
decade later, any second 

00:40:59.499 --> 00:41:01.499
thoughts about your alma mater?

00:41:02.578 --> 00:41:05.445
» ROSS DOUTHAT: Oh, no, I mean, 
it's worse than it was.  No, 

00:41:05.446 --> 00:41:08.316
there haven't been second 
thoughts.  I mean, E.J.

00:41:12.511 --> 00:41:14.511
has sort of teed this up 
effectively, what E.J.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.498
was talking about in the Richard
Reeves Dream Hoarders 

00:41:18.499 --> 00:41:20.499
phenomenon, a personalized way 
what I was trying to 

00:41:23.562 --> 00:41:25.562
get at in that book, which was 
called Privilege.

00:41:27.877 --> 00:41:29.877
And the argument was basically 
sort of 

00:41:31.826 --> 00:41:34.254
ripped off from smarter people, 
the late Christopher Lash among 

00:41:34.255 --> 00:41:36.255
others, the 

00:41:38.236 --> 00:41:40.902
system of metaphor tock si does 
not, in fact, tend to be 

00:41:40.903 --> 00:41:42.903
Democratic, it tends to 

00:41:45.404 --> 00:41:47.635
create a new aristocracy that 
becomes in a different way 

00:41:47.636 --> 00:41:51.508
jealous of its privileges, has 
different forms of capital and 

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.333
so on and SAT scores matter much
more than ancient pedigrees and 

00:41:53.334 --> 00:41:55.334
so on.

00:41:57.903 --> 00:41:59.903
But in practice, it 
recapitulates many 

00:42:01.776 --> 00:42:03.423
of the vices of older 
aristocracies and also develops 

00:42:03.424 --> 00:42:06.285
certain vices of its own, like 
the belief that, well, because 

00:42:09.292 --> 00:42:11.292
we're

00:42:13.092 --> 00:42:15.092
meritocats, we deserve to rule 
unlike the aristocrats.

00:42:16.784 --> 00:42:18.784
So that was sort of it in a 
nutshell, 

00:42:20.264 --> 00:42:22.302
that basically if you look 
around these schools that are 

00:42:22.303 --> 00:42:24.303
there to sort of 

00:42:26.199 --> 00:42:28.478
educate the elites, they are, in
fact, perpetuating an elite that

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:31.572
itself is sort of both 
increasingly segregated from the

00:42:31.573 --> 00:42:34.451
rest of American society.  I 
mean, that's one of the 

00:42:34.452 --> 00:42:36.452
interesting 

00:42:38.137 --> 00:42:39.633
things about sort of the 
post-'70s dynamic in American 

00:42:39.634 --> 00:42:41.634
life, that you have 

00:42:43.119 --> 00:42:45.766
-- if you go back 40 or 50 years
and look at the distribution of 

00:42:45.767 --> 00:42:50.224
people with Ph.D.s and J. D. s, 
these advanced degrees, they're 

00:42:51.662 --> 00:42:53.142
pretty evenly distributed around
the country, you have clusters 

00:42:53.143 --> 00:42:57.851
in each state, sort of local 
groups of academic elites and 

00:42:57.852 --> 00:43:00.093
legal elites and so on and then 
you flash forward to the present

00:43:02.359 --> 00:43:05.038
era and they're much more 
concentrated in this sort of 

00:43:05.039 --> 00:43:08.323
major east coast and west coast 
urban centers and then sort of 

00:43:08.324 --> 00:43:10.324
college towns scattered around 
the country.

00:43:12.434 --> 00:43:13.860
So you have a kind of much 
stronger segregation by 

00:43:13.861 --> 00:43:16.100
education in the U.S. than you 
had 40 or 50 years ago and you 

00:43:19.153 --> 00:43:21.153
have sort of fewer local elites 
that are 

00:43:22.845 --> 00:43:24.729
sort of in touch with, you know,
Iowa, New Hampshire, whatever 

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:28.605
state they come from, and you 
have this nationally elite that 

00:43:28.606 --> 00:43:30.606
is less in touch with the 
country 

00:43:32.119 --> 00:43:34.374
than it would have been 40 or 50
years ago and that's a dynamic 

00:43:34.375 --> 00:43:36.645
the Ivy League schools and sort 
of the U.S.

00:43:39.659 --> 00:43:41.630
-- I mean, it's also notable 
that the "U.S. News and World 

00:43:41.631 --> 00:43:43.631
Report" ranks, right?

00:43:48.552 --> 00:43:50.826
When you think about sort of 
what -- the "U.S. News and World

00:43:50.827 --> 00:43:53.126
Report" rankings never change.  
I mean, of course they change 

00:43:53.127 --> 00:43:58.871
from year to year sometimes it's
Harvard, sometimes it's Yale.  

00:43:58.872 --> 00:44:01.329
Schools can sort of work their 
way up.  The University of 

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:03.772
Chicago sort of changed its 
admission policies ten or 

00:44:05.814 --> 00:44:08.483
fifteen years ago and it climbed
dramatically.  Things change, 

00:44:08.484 --> 00:44:10.484
but there's never a 

00:44:12.229 --> 00:44:13.230
start-up university in the Top 
Ten in the "U.S. News and World 

00:44:13.231 --> 00:44:15.231
Report" ranking.

00:44:17.143 --> 00:44:19.593
The newest university there is 
Stanford which was founded a 

00:44:19.594 --> 00:44:23.734
mere 120 years ago or whatever, 
and that in itself, I think, is 

00:44:23.735 --> 00:44:25.735
a significant 

00:44:28.075 --> 00:44:30.075
statement about what these sort 
of meritocratic factories do.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:34.750
They're there to sort of protect
their 

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:38.022
own privileges by creating, you 
know, by sort of reproducing the

00:44:38.023 --> 00:44:40.023
privilege of the families and 
students who attend them.

00:44:42.147 --> 00:44:44.147
And, you know, all societies 
have 

00:44:45.202 --> 00:44:47.202
elites, it's inevitable 
phenomenon.

00:44:49.041 --> 00:44:51.041
But it's still notable in a 
society 

00:44:54.413 --> 00:44:56.413
sort of that has such Democratic

00:44:59.352 --> 00:45:00.170
self-image that people often 
think of meritocats tock si and 

00:45:00.171 --> 00:45:02.171
democracy working 

00:45:03.473 --> 00:45:05.473
hand in hand but they often cut 
against each other.

» ANN COMPTON: I will point out 
E.J. graduated Harvard before 

00:45:07.796 --> 00:45:13.127
Ross was born.
» E.J. DIONNE: Oh, God...  did 

00:45:13.128 --> 00:45:14.159
you have to do that?
» ANN COMPTON: Because I'm even 

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.304
older than E.J.  But, E.J....

00:45:19.966 --> 00:45:22.046
well, go ahead and defend not 
only Harvard, but the --

00:45:23.075 --> 00:45:25.962
» ROSS DOUTHAT: He can't defend 
Harvard.  The Pope he can 

00:45:25.963 --> 00:45:27.404
defend, but not Harvard.
» ANN COMPTON: Look at the 

00:45:27.405 --> 00:45:30.671
generations coming out of 
colleges now, they've got that 

00:45:30.672 --> 00:45:32.672
college degree and they are 
crushed 

00:45:33.952 --> 00:45:34.778
by the size of their college 
debt.

00:45:34.779 --> 00:45:37.221
» E.J. DIONNE: One observation I
want to make 

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:42.690
is that two of my very favorite 

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.970
conservative writers, Ross and 
David 

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:49.244
Brooks, the late Charles 
Flathamer 

00:45:50.758 --> 00:45:53.235
referred to as his favorite 
liberal columnist...  God bless 

00:45:53.236 --> 00:45:56.519
Charles.  I find that their 
critique of American society is 

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.520
this close to being radical.

00:46:00.637 --> 00:46:02.076
And if we progressives have done
something Wright, Ross and David

00:46:02.077 --> 00:46:04.077
would 

00:46:06.787 --> 00:46:07.608
be radicals and not -- there is 
a radical element of that 

00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:09.609
critique.

00:46:12.988 --> 00:46:14.398
I would -- I don't want to go on
a long defense of Harvard.  It's

00:46:14.399 --> 00:46:17.050
a wonderful institution.  I 
happen to love it.  It was very 

00:46:17.051 --> 00:46:19.051
important to me.

00:46:21.154 --> 00:46:23.154
They have made efforts 
particularly in 

00:46:24.859 --> 00:46:25.865
recent years to try to create 
more opportunities for people 

00:46:25.866 --> 00:46:30.024
of, you know, sort of in the 
middle and at the bottom.  But 

00:46:30.025 --> 00:46:32.889
it is still about replicating an
elite.  And the problem isn't 

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.890
Harvard.

00:46:37.738 --> 00:46:39.738
It's a system of

00:46:41.243 --> 00:46:43.553
meritocracy where people come to
believe that they have all their

00:46:45.577 --> 00:46:48.245
privilege even when they 
haven't, and I think the problem

00:46:48.246 --> 00:46:50.323
with meritocracy as an idea is 
not that we should discourage 

00:46:51.579 --> 00:46:53.613
people from trying to be smarter
or trying to work harder and all

00:46:53.614 --> 00:46:55.614
those things.

00:46:58.993 --> 00:47:00.818
It's that people develop a sense
of dessert and then they look 

00:47:00.819 --> 00:47:05.298
down upon all kinds of other 
people who have not had the same

00:47:05.299 --> 00:47:07.299
good fortune.

00:47:09.614 --> 00:47:12.484
I have found over the years in 
my long life that you can tell a

00:47:12.485 --> 00:47:14.485
lot about someone's worldview by
whether they 

00:47:17.815 --> 00:47:19.241
think of themselves as totally 
self-made or the product of good

00:47:19.242 --> 00:47:22.726
fortune.
Now, you know, we're all 

00:47:22.727 --> 00:47:24.727
obviously a mixture of those 
things.

00:47:27.018 --> 00:47:29.473
None of this is not effort or 
the hard work people do or in 

00:47:29.474 --> 00:47:34.397
fact there are people who rise 
from the bottom to the top, but 

00:47:34.398 --> 00:47:36.398
it is to say not only is the 

00:47:37.666 --> 00:47:39.707
idea of being self-made a 
biological absurdity, but it 

00:47:39.708 --> 00:47:42.355
also overlooks all the 
opportunities that came your way

00:47:42.356 --> 00:47:44.448
through chance, through good 
fortune, through one teacher.

00:47:50.799 --> 00:47:52.860
I grew up in a place called Fall
River, Massachusetts.  Who is a 

00:47:52.861 --> 00:47:54.861
Fall River person?

00:47:57.579 --> 00:47:59.579
Today by the way, if I read my 
Twitter 

00:48:02.757 --> 00:48:05.210
right, it's Lizzie Borden's 
birthday, the most famous person

00:48:05.211 --> 00:48:07.211
from my hometown, I think.

00:48:09.927 --> 00:48:11.334
But I was having Ernie Munez, 
the former energy secretary is 

00:48:11.335 --> 00:48:14.397
from Fall River and I was 
talking to him about high school

00:48:14.398 --> 00:48:16.398
and my dad.

00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:20.069
One of my dad's best friend was 
a 

00:48:21.949 --> 00:48:23.949
teacher at Derphy high school 
and he 

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:27.723
looked at me and said, Mr. 
Delaire is why I do what I do 

00:48:27.724 --> 00:48:29.724
now.

00:48:31.005 --> 00:48:33.675
It was a great high school 
physics teacher who inspired 

00:48:33.676 --> 00:48:35.676
this working class kid to become
one of the world class people.

00:48:39.888 --> 00:48:42.335
But someone like Ernie Munez, 
perhaps to career like his, and 

00:48:42.336 --> 00:48:44.336
all of us can tell those 
stories.

00:48:48.301 --> 00:48:50.301
So in general I share a lot of 
what 

00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:53.809
Ross said about the problem of 
meritocracy because it suggests 

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:55.913
to an elite that they don't have
any 

00:48:59.186 --> 00:49:01.023
obligation to give back, that 
everything they earn they earn 

00:49:01.024 --> 00:49:03.878
because of their own merit.  You
know, grace doesn't enter into 

00:49:03.879 --> 00:49:08.575
it.  Luck doesn't enter into it.
Someone else's generosity 

00:49:08.576 --> 00:49:11.044
doesn't enter into it.  The help
from the state doesn't enter 

00:49:11.441 --> 00:49:13.441
into it.

00:49:15.117 --> 00:49:17.766
I'll close with one of my 
favorite tweets I ever sent out,

00:49:17.767 --> 00:49:22.309
which was during the Republican 
convention and Chris Christie 

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:24.343
was giving a speech about his 
father going to Rutgers, a state

00:49:26.973 --> 00:49:29.624
university, on the GI bill, a 
government program.  And it was 

00:49:29.625 --> 00:49:31.625
a friendly tweet.

00:49:33.131 --> 00:49:36.005
"It's lovely to see Chris 
Christie acknowledge the role of

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:38.006
government in his father's life.
"

00:49:42.183 --> 00:49:44.183
» ANN COMPTON: Well, I want to 
switch 

00:49:46.757 --> 00:49:48.757
over to the overarching current 
theme 

00:49:49.839 --> 00:49:51.287
that agented my life as a 
reporter for ABC News over the 

00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:53.288
course of seven presidents.

00:49:56.604 --> 00:49:58.604
The digital age has changed so 
much in our society.

00:50:02.367 --> 00:50:04.367
I look at not only how my kids 

00:50:07.351 --> 00:50:10.208
communicate, what they read, how
they communicate, but also how 

00:50:10.209 --> 00:50:15.357
Americans sometimes withdraw 
from personal communications, 

00:50:15.358 --> 00:50:17.358
how they rely on 

00:50:19.451 --> 00:50:22.343
information that doesn't have 
the same kind of good bones 

00:50:22.344 --> 00:50:24.344
structure of the 

00:50:25.409 --> 00:50:26.425
reporting of The Washington 
Post, New York Times, ABC News 

00:50:26.426 --> 00:50:29.915
as it once was.  The digital age
has changed everything, hasn't 

00:50:29.916 --> 00:50:32.177
it, Ross?
» ROSS DOUTHAT: Yes.

00:50:36.553 --> 00:50:38.553
Although one thing it hasn't 
changed 

00:50:41.023 --> 00:50:41.838
is sort of the economic 
landscape to the degree that 

00:50:41.839 --> 00:50:44.331
people thought it would.  I 
mean, this is one of the 

00:50:44.332 --> 00:50:49.236
interesting -- it's not a 
paradox, but it's an interesting

00:50:49.237 --> 00:50:51.283
tension, which is that the 
digital age is sort of -- it's 

00:50:51.284 --> 00:50:53.284
where 

00:50:55.425 --> 00:50:58.287
everything has ended up poured, 
and other areas of innovation 

00:50:58.288 --> 00:51:00.344
and technological progress and 
so on have 

00:51:04.215 --> 00:51:06.215
tended to wither a bit as we've 
focused 

00:51:07.689 --> 00:51:08.490
more and more of our energy and 
interest on these tiny low end 

00:51:08.491 --> 00:51:10.491
screens.

00:51:12.153 --> 00:51:14.153
And one of the -- there's an 
economist 

00:51:15.493 --> 00:51:17.493
Robert Gordon who wrote a book 
something 

00:51:18.573 --> 00:51:20.819
like "The Rise and Fall of 
American Growth" and one of the 

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:22.820
points at the end was that 
American growth historically 

00:51:27.818 --> 00:51:30.286
was incredibly diversified, you 
had growth in energy there and 

00:51:30.287 --> 00:51:32.287
growth in construction over 
there and so on.

00:51:34.402 --> 00:51:36.402
And the digital age is much 
narrower 

00:51:38.765 --> 00:51:40.765
and a sense it sort of 
recapitulates in 

00:51:42.051 --> 00:51:44.051
the economy what it does to us 
psychologically.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.800
It's a colonizer of our psyche 
and 

00:51:51.301 --> 00:51:53.958
focus and attention and also 
sort of absorbed a lot of, I 

00:51:53.959 --> 00:51:58.277
think, sort of energy and 
interest that 50 years ago would

00:51:58.278 --> 00:51:59.495
have been more diversified, sort
of spread out more across the 

00:51:59.496 --> 00:52:02.397
economy.
So that's the only counter 

00:52:02.398 --> 00:52:04.982
intuitive point that I would 
make on the change to everything

00:52:04.983 --> 00:52:06.983
point.

00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:10.069
I think to the question, I mean,
what 

00:52:11.941 --> 00:52:13.178
-- this is sort of the big 
unanswered social question of 

00:52:13.179 --> 00:52:15.179
American life over 

00:52:17.228 --> 00:52:20.099
the next 40 or 507 years, to 
what extent is digital media a 

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:25.221
potential substitute for the 
decline of community that E.J. 

00:52:25.222 --> 00:52:27.222
and I I think generally agree is
a real 

00:52:28.561 --> 00:52:31.454
problem in American life, to 
what extent is social media and 

00:52:31.455 --> 00:52:33.970
sort of the communities that 
form online sort of 

00:52:37.033 --> 00:52:39.033
substitutes for the decline of, 
you 

00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:42.323
know, Elks lodges and churches 
and so 

00:52:43.623 --> 00:52:46.103
on, to what extent is online 
dating an effective substitute 

00:52:46.104 --> 00:52:48.104
for the decline of real-world 
sort of institutions that 

00:52:49.579 --> 00:52:51.579
brought men and women together.

00:52:57.023 --> 00:52:59.023
Or to what extent is it a sort 
of hollow substitute basically.

00:53:01.129 --> 00:53:02.961
And since I'm conservative and 
critical and pessimistic, I tend

00:53:02.962 --> 00:53:05.045
to sort of emphasize the extent 
to which it 

00:53:08.135 --> 00:53:10.135
might be a sort of hollow 
substitute, 

00:53:11.394 --> 00:53:13.239
that, you know, of course people
do fall in love online and make 

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:17.317
friends online and all these 
things but very often they find 

00:53:17.318 --> 00:53:20.218
themselves with online friends, 
and, you know, a sort of online 

00:53:20.219 --> 00:53:24.568
life that seems to make 
teenagers, for instance, more 

00:53:24.569 --> 00:53:27.429
depressed than their peers were 
20 years ago.  But we're really 

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:30.508
early in the experiment and you 
can argue against me and say, 

00:53:30.509 --> 00:53:32.546
well, these things are just 
getting off the ground, people 

00:53:32.547 --> 00:53:36.643
are just learning to live 
online, it's's a disruptive 

00:53:36.644 --> 00:53:38.644
technology, people will get use 
to it and then it will actually 

00:53:39.949 --> 00:53:42.338
supply the community that we 
need.  But that's the question I

00:53:42.339 --> 00:53:46.845
think that is hanging over 
American society and obviously 

00:53:46.846 --> 00:53:48.846
not just American society going 
forward.

00:53:51.357 --> 00:53:51.772
Especially for people younger 
than me.

» ANN COMPTON: E.J.
» E.J. DIONNE: It's funny when I

00:53:54.158 --> 00:53:56.158
think about I know so many 
younger people and even 

00:54:00.289 --> 00:54:02.954
some older people who are, you 
know -- who lost their spouses, 

00:54:02.955 --> 00:54:08.285
got divorced, who met through 
online dating and I sometimes 

00:54:08.286 --> 00:54:12.240
wonder, that's probably more 
sensible than meeting in a bar. 

00:54:12.241 --> 00:54:14.735
Which is better?  People come to
each other with more 

00:54:14.736 --> 00:54:19.240
information...  I met my wife on
the D.C. Metro.  And so I always

00:54:19.241 --> 00:54:21.241
like to say, I really am a 
liberal.

00:54:25.219 --> 00:54:25.829
I owe a great deal to public 
transportation and the agency of

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:28.510
government.
And we've been together a long 

00:54:28.511 --> 00:54:32.808
time.
I didn't want to give it away, 

00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:35.902
the conservative answer, but I 
thought actually you were going 

00:54:35.903 --> 00:54:38.568
to give it, which is nothing 
about this technology changes 

00:54:38.569 --> 00:54:40.569
human nature.

00:54:43.729 --> 00:54:46.173
I think one of the things Ross 
and I broadly agree on is that 

00:54:46.174 --> 00:54:48.174
human nature is something given.

00:54:50.934 --> 00:54:52.980
You can alter the way people 
behave, and perhaps over time 

00:54:52.981 --> 00:54:55.259
this affects the way our 
consciousness works, but it 

00:54:55.475 --> 00:54:58.756
doesn't change that.
And there's a lot of me that 

00:54:58.757 --> 00:55:00.757
wants to 

00:55:02.863 --> 00:55:04.863
fight the idea that technology 
alters us 

00:55:05.981 --> 00:55:08.768
in all of these radical ways, 
and yet some of the change is 

00:55:08.769 --> 00:55:10.769
undeniable.

00:55:13.062 --> 00:55:13.868
And so much of it is how we 
educate ourselves to use this 

00:55:13.869 --> 00:55:15.869
media.

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:22.405
So on the one hand, the parody 
is of people whose entire friend

00:55:22.406 --> 00:55:25.480
groups are sort of online, 
people don't talk to each other 

00:55:25.481 --> 00:55:27.481
face-to-face.

00:55:29.558 --> 00:55:32.239
But the other side of that is 
online is often a way in which 

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.111
people organize themselves for 
actual social encounters 

00:55:38.798 --> 00:55:41.305
to create opportunities for 
face-to-face engagement, 

00:55:41.306 --> 00:55:43.525
neighborhoods have used 
technology to try to bring 

00:55:43.526 --> 00:55:45.526
people together.

00:55:47.013 --> 00:55:49.891
If you think back to the Obama 
campaign in '08, which was very 

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.993
innovative, a lot of it began 
online but ended with a door 

00:55:54.994 --> 00:55:56.994
knock, which is the 

00:55:59.562 --> 00:56:01.390
most infamous kind -- most 
intimate kind of -- a real human

00:56:01.391 --> 00:56:04.260
connection being made.  And I do
think it will -- and I agree 

00:56:06.104 --> 00:56:07.971
with Ross, I think I'm 
influenced by the same book, 

00:56:07.972 --> 00:56:13.144
that we have to ask ourselves, 
does this -- has this technology

00:56:13.145 --> 00:56:15.145
yet changed our lives the way 

00:56:16.698 --> 00:56:18.550
the invention of the light bulb 
or the automobile or the 

00:56:18.551 --> 00:56:20.551
telephone did or not?

00:56:22.257 --> 00:56:24.257
And we probably can debate some 
of those things.

00:56:27.382 --> 00:56:29.253
What I do worry is will we be 
innovative enough as a society 

00:56:29.254 --> 00:56:31.254
to replace all the jobs that are
potentially lost?

00:56:34.736 --> 00:56:36.736
And while we have been talking 
about 

00:56:38.754 --> 00:56:40.754
automation since the '50s and 
'60s, you 

00:56:42.462 --> 00:56:44.252
sense that that process of job 
destruction could be sped up and

00:56:44.253 --> 00:56:48.918
the question is, will we be 
innovative enough to create work

00:56:48.919 --> 00:56:50.919
or will the economy create work 
that will make up for that?

00:56:54.357 --> 00:56:56.661
I'm reminded a great wall to -- 
I can't remember if it was Ford 

00:56:56.662 --> 00:56:58.662
or GM.  We'll say GM.

00:57:02.862 --> 00:57:05.326
GM took Ruther, the head of the 
auto workers into a brand-new 

00:57:05.327 --> 00:57:07.327
plant with all 

00:57:10.511 --> 00:57:12.511
these robots and machines, and 
the GM 

00:57:13.989 --> 00:57:15.989
guy says to Walter Ruther, these
robots 

00:57:17.059 --> 00:57:19.059
won't be paying UAW dues and 
Ruther shot 

00:57:20.129 --> 00:57:23.275
back, yeah, and they won't be 
buying GM cars either.  And I 

00:57:23.276 --> 00:57:25.346
think that is a kind of struggle
we're going to have going 

00:57:25.347 --> 00:57:27.397
forward.
» ANN COMPTON: I want to ask one

00:57:27.398 --> 00:57:30.281
more question before we open 
this up to questions not only 

00:57:30.282 --> 00:57:32.282
from the audience but from the 
students in Hawaii.

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:40.510
It was suggested to me that one 
of the 

00:57:41.787 --> 00:57:44.260
good ways to look forward here, 
especially since both of you 

00:57:44.261 --> 00:57:46.261
have connections to and contact 
with the 

00:57:50.465 --> 00:57:53.123
younger people, young students, 
journalists, how are millennials

00:57:55.781 --> 00:57:57.858
rethinking their own view of the
American dream?  Let me start 

00:57:57.859 --> 00:58:03.589
with you, E.J.
Or do they think about it?

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:08.080
» E.J. DIONNE: There is some 
evidence -- I talked to 

00:58:08.081 --> 00:58:10.081
political poll administers who 

00:58:11.801 --> 00:58:14.659
have said that the -- pollsters 
who have said that the American 

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.934
dream idea does not resonate 
with younger voters, with 

00:58:18.393 --> 00:58:20.930
younger Americans in the way 
that it does with older folks, 

00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:22.931
although this 

00:58:24.229 --> 00:58:25.457
data on the difference between, 
you know, African Americans and 

00:58:25.458 --> 00:58:27.725
Latinos on the one side and 
whites on the other 

00:58:30.841 --> 00:58:32.841
suggests it's an even more 
complicated story.

00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:35.927
But I think there is a -- you 
know, I 

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.855
have three kids in their 20s 
that I have taught -- I've been 

00:58:39.856 --> 00:58:41.856
teaching now 15 years and have 
had really awesome students.

00:58:44.777 --> 00:58:46.777
And my sense from them -- so I'm
not 

00:58:51.407 --> 00:58:53.407
going to make it any more than 
that, is 

00:58:55.295 --> 00:58:57.191
that there is, for good reason, 
a somewhat -- slightly less 

00:58:57.192 --> 00:58:59.192
optimism about their way 
forward.

00:59:01.764 --> 00:59:04.006
They feel like they have had 
difficulties thrown at them that

00:59:04.007 --> 00:59:06.007
were not thrown at someone my 
age.

00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:11.589
You know, I was born in 1952 and
sort 

00:59:13.466 --> 00:59:16.121
of reached adulthood in one of 
the most extraordinary periods 

00:59:16.122 --> 00:59:18.122
of growth and opportunity in our
country's history.

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:22.230
And actually during the '90s 
when my 

00:59:23.305 --> 00:59:25.711
kids were little, I thought, 
gee, maybe by delaying having 

00:59:25.712 --> 00:59:27.712
kids I really lucked out and 
brought my kids into a world 

00:59:28.353 --> 00:59:30.353
that will match that great 
period.

00:59:33.716 --> 00:59:35.549
And then, you know, came 9/11, 
the wars, and then the economic 

00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:37.550
collapse.

00:59:39.267 --> 00:59:41.518
And so my sense is that there is
still a lot of -- I mean, you 

00:59:41.519 --> 00:59:44.375
know, young people have not lost
a natural sense of 

00:59:47.849 --> 00:59:50.021
optimism, but I think there is a
stronger sense of, you know, the

00:59:53.551 --> 00:59:55.551
obstacles that they face, and 
not the 

00:59:58.045 --> 00:59:59.891
easy sense that we got of, when 
I was a kid, that America was 

00:59:59.892 --> 01:00:03.969
literally sitting on top of the 
world.  You know, you think of 

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:08.713
all that optimism and call to 
service in the Kennedy years 

01:00:08.714 --> 01:00:10.714
that this is something 
different.

01:00:11.383 --> 01:00:13.023
» ANN COMPTON: Ross, take a 
swing at this before we actually

01:00:13.024 --> 01:00:13.842
get questions.
» ROSS DOUTHAT: Sure, I think 

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:15.843
E.J. is right.

01:00:17.735 --> 01:00:20.435
I think there -- if you think of
the millennial generation of 

01:00:20.436 --> 01:00:25.167
people who came of age after 
2001, you know, we have been 

01:00:25.168 --> 01:00:27.168
talking about a 40 or 50-year 

01:00:28.842 --> 01:00:30.483
stagnation, but really the worst
of it economically, setting 

01:00:30.484 --> 01:00:32.323
aside war and terrorism and 
everything else, has been the 

01:00:32.324 --> 01:00:34.324
last 15 years.

01:00:35.824 --> 01:00:37.824
And if that's your experience of
sort 

01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:40.139
of entering adulthood, entering 
consciousness as an American and

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:45.114
so on, you are naturally going 
to be, I think, more pessimistic

01:00:45.115 --> 01:00:47.115
about your prospects because 
your prospects have been worse, 

01:00:50.074 --> 01:00:51.294
worse by far than your 
generation and somewhat worse 

01:00:51.295 --> 01:00:53.295
than my cohort.

01:00:54.799 --> 01:00:56.799
Although 9/11 happened my senior
year 

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.348
of college, so there was -- 
there was a decline in the 

01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:03.349
number of consulting jobs 

01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:07.298
that my fellow meritocrats were 
able to take.  That was our 

01:01:07.299 --> 01:01:09.299
great tragedy.  Thank you for 
laughing.

01:01:12.028 --> 01:01:14.028
The irony rather than taking it 
seriously.

01:01:15.523 --> 01:01:17.523
But I would also say, I think 
this 

01:01:18.578 --> 01:01:20.430
thing to try to we've together 
the community and Internet 

01:01:20.431 --> 01:01:24.156
questions together a little bit 
one of the striking things 

01:01:24.157 --> 01:01:26.514
millennials and whatever we're 
call post-millennials, in 

01:01:26.515 --> 01:01:31.110
certain respects they are the 
best behaved generation in 

01:01:31.111 --> 01:01:33.111
modern American history in 

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.831
terms of drug use, teen 
pregnancy, car accidents, all of

01:01:36.832 --> 01:01:38.907
-- you know, this sort of 
laundry list of things that 

01:01:38.908 --> 01:01:40.908
people 

01:01:42.629 --> 01:01:44.927
worry about teenagers and early 
20-somethings getting up to, 

01:01:44.928 --> 01:01:46.973
this cohort is incredibly 
well-behaved.

01:01:53.404 --> 01:01:56.087
But that sort of good behavior 
coexists with a -- first of all,

01:01:56.088 --> 01:01:59.610
a certain -- a higher degree of 
unhappiness, which may be rooted

01:01:59.611 --> 01:02:05.126
in economic factors, may be 
rooted in sort of, you know, the

01:02:05.127 --> 01:02:10.236
digital age and the anxieties it
produces, and one of the reasons

01:02:10.237 --> 01:02:12.285
they're so well-behaved, you can
socialize online, so you're less

01:02:12.286 --> 01:02:14.750
likely to take the car out and 
get drunk with your friends.

01:02:18.249 --> 01:02:20.729
You're less -- you know, there's
less teen sex because perhaps 

01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:24.025
there's more sexting.  It sounds
like a joke but it's actually 

01:02:24.026 --> 01:02:26.026
probably statistically not.

01:02:27.522 --> 01:02:30.213
So you have this question, one, 
you know, is the greater safety 

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:33.676
worth perhaps the cost in 
happiness?  And, two, this 

01:02:33.677 --> 01:02:35.677
connects to the 

01:02:37.611 --> 01:02:40.103
economic as well, are 
millennials just sort of delayed

01:02:40.104 --> 01:02:44.416
in -- you know, the basics of --
the American dream when you were

01:02:44.417 --> 01:02:46.690
a kid, you know, you get 
married, you have kids, you own 

01:02:46.691 --> 01:02:48.691
a home, you know, you own a car,
you own a couple of cars.

01:02:54.157 --> 01:02:56.865
If those sort of visceral 
aspects, the American dream 

01:02:56.866 --> 01:02:58.947
circa 1957, millennials are 
getting married at lower rates, 

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:02.986
buying homes at lower rates, 
they are driving at lower rates.

01:03:05.529 --> 01:03:07.529
All of these things that sort of

01:03:09.321 --> 01:03:10.561
culturally we associate with 
American normalcy aren't 

01:03:10.562 --> 01:03:12.562
happening to the same degree.

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.491
And so the question hanging over
the next 20 years will be, are 

01:03:15.492 --> 01:03:17.492
millennials 

01:03:18.791 --> 01:03:21.261
going to do all the same things 
that E.J.'s Jenn ration did just

01:03:21.262 --> 01:03:26.606
ten or fifteen years later or is
there a real shift, not in human

01:03:26.607 --> 01:03:29.108
nature but human nature response
to the economy and everything 

01:03:32.784 --> 01:03:35.141
else, across the lifecycle 
millennials less likely to have 

01:03:35.142 --> 01:03:37.817
kids and more likely to be 
single and live in apartments 

01:03:39.237 --> 01:03:41.549
rather than suburban houses.  
Something we won't know for 

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:44.415
fifteen years or so.
» E.J. DIONNE: And other thing 

01:03:44.416 --> 01:03:48.106
about millennials, they are a 
progressive generation, probably

01:03:48.107 --> 01:03:52.236
the most progressive generation 
since the new dealers of the 

01:03:52.237 --> 01:03:55.509
greatest generation.  Some of 
that is because they are a more 

01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:57.510
Dionne verse generation.

01:04:02.095 --> 01:04:04.095

under 40 or 35, larger 
percentage African American, 

01:04:10.203 --> 01:04:13.327
Asians.  But significantly more 
liberal than cohorts and whites.

01:04:16.606 --> 01:04:18.878
I tell children, when my 
generation is gone and your 

01:04:18.879 --> 01:04:20.729
generation takes over, this will
problem be a more progressive 

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:26.081
country.  The only problem with 
that is I want to be around to 

01:04:26.082 --> 01:04:27.711
see the country when you guys 
take over, so I'm going to have 

01:04:27.712 --> 01:04:30.224
the figure out a way to solve 
that.

01:04:54.687 --> 01:05:00.141
every year is because we are 
linked up to students in Hawaii 

01:05:00.142 --> 01:05:01.174
and they have offered the two of
you some really interesting 

01:05:01.175 --> 01:05:03.175
questions.

01:05:06.491 --> 01:05:08.491
The first question we're going 
to hear is from Shannon.

01:05:09.984 --> 01:05:11.984
» Hi, I'm Shannon.

01:05:13.471 --> 01:05:15.471
I'm a communications student at 
UH, 

01:05:16.575 --> 01:05:18.419
and my idea of the American 
dream is a place where people 

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:19.667
can live happy and safely in a 
community with friends and 

01:05:19.668 --> 01:05:24.205
family.  My question is:  What 
do you think our generation can 

01:05:24.206 --> 01:05:28.093
do to make sure that we live 
happy and healthier today?

01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:31.836
» E.J. DIONNE: Oh, preach, Ross.
Go ahead.

01:05:33.891 --> 01:05:36.137
» ROSS DOUTHAT: My non-partisan 
answer as you can tell from 

01:05:36.138 --> 01:05:39.438
things I already said is that 
you should spend less time on 

01:05:39.439 --> 01:05:44.618
the Internet.  That's without 
getting into sort of whether you

01:05:44.619 --> 01:05:46.252
should convert to Catholicism or
which kind of Catholic you 

01:05:46.253 --> 01:05:48.253
should be.

01:05:51.903 --> 01:05:53.327
That's obviously important, but 
in a non-sectarian way I would 

01:05:53.328 --> 01:05:55.328
say there is a lot of evidence.

01:05:57.422 --> 01:05:59.422
It's not dispositive, but 
there's a 

01:06:00.924 --> 01:06:02.924
lot of reasonable evidence that 
social 

01:06:04.624 --> 01:06:07.088
life online is potentially more 
likely to lead to depression, 

01:06:07.089 --> 01:06:09.496
unhappiness, isolation, and less
likely to lead to 

01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:13.621
healthy friendships, healthy 
relationships, healthy marriages

01:06:13.622 --> 01:06:15.622
and so on.

01:06:18.332 --> 01:06:20.272
And, of course, you are -- you 
know, I'm still young enough 

01:06:20.273 --> 01:06:22.273
hopefully to know this 
reasonably well.

01:06:23.576 --> 01:06:25.576
Of course, you can't sort of 
become a 

01:06:26.849 --> 01:06:28.849
hermit and a Ludite and opt out 
of the 

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:32.612
social world of young people is 
an online social world.

01:06:33.938 --> 01:06:35.784
But figuring out how to have 
your relationships and 

01:06:35.785 --> 01:06:39.874
friendships and your connection 
to the world at large mediated 

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:41.875
through old-fashioned reality 

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:46.668
rather than digital reality 
seems like a really important 

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.669
step that either today's 
millennials or the generation 

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:52.607
after them is going to have to 
figure 

01:06:54.916 --> 01:06:57.163
out to get to the -- to get to 
the point where their 

01:06:57.164 --> 01:06:59.050
relationship and all of our 
relationship to technology 

01:06:59.051 --> 01:07:01.115
becomes a healthy one.

01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:09.756
So that's -- yeah, that's the 
non-sectarian.

01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:10.304
» E.J. DIONNE: I think I 
actually agree with every single

01:07:10.305 --> 01:07:12.305
word you said.

01:07:17.305 --> 01:07:18.937
And I do think that sort of -- 
I'm not Ludite.   I love the 

01:07:18.938 --> 01:07:22.391
technology.  I spend too much 
time on my phone like everyone 

01:07:22.392 --> 01:07:26.985
else does.  I can find out if 
the Red Sox are winning or not, 

01:07:26.986 --> 01:07:29.491
which is very satisfying, 
especially this season.

01:07:33.841 --> 01:07:35.841
So I am very much anti-Luddite, 
but I do 

01:07:36.922 --> 01:07:38.922
think that, again, there is 
evidence 

01:07:40.851 --> 01:07:42.947
that if you are involved in 
politics or service or religious

01:07:42.948 --> 01:07:44.948
congregation or 

01:07:46.643 --> 01:07:48.643
sports teams or a whole series 
of other 

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.200
activities with other people 
direct face-to-face, that that's

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:53.201
a helpful thing.

01:07:55.517 --> 01:07:58.358
The other virtue I have sort of 
toyed with a lot, I thought 

01:07:58.359 --> 01:08:02.278
about a lot, because it's a 
really complicated virtue, is 

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:04.279
virtue of loyalty.

01:08:05.989 --> 01:08:06.799
And I worry a lot about, on the 
one hand loyalty can be 

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.800
misplaced.

01:08:12.575 --> 01:08:14.575
Loyalty can demand, you know, 
the -- I 

01:08:16.716 --> 01:08:19.193
mean, I think they have loyalty 
in their slow gone, which 

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:21.855
reminds me, don't much too much 
on that.  On the other hand, I 

01:08:21.856 --> 01:08:23.856
worry about a society that has 
lost a sense of loyalty.

01:08:27.457 --> 01:08:29.716
Maybe this is from, you know, 
I'm from Massachusetts where -- 

01:08:29.717 --> 01:08:31.717
and loyalties are 

01:08:32.985 --> 01:08:35.225
so strong that the most powerful
-- you know, the old joke about 

01:08:35.226 --> 01:08:37.315
the version of Alzheimer's, you 
forget everything except your 

01:08:37.316 --> 01:08:42.474
grudges.  If somebody was on the
wrong team.  But I do think that

01:08:42.475 --> 01:08:44.475
there is -- I 

01:08:45.551 --> 01:08:47.973
worry about the decline of 
loyalty in this society from 

01:08:47.974 --> 01:08:50.445
employee to employee from 
employee to employer, our 

01:08:50.446 --> 01:08:52.446
loyalties to each other.

01:08:53.952 --> 01:08:55.952
It's how do we strengthen some 
of the bonds between us?

01:08:58.432 --> 01:09:01.546
How do we stick with each other 
when things get tough?  How can 

01:09:01.547 --> 01:09:02.965
friendship be demanding and not 
temporary, not just something 

01:09:02.966 --> 01:09:04.966
you pass through?

01:09:06.487 --> 01:09:08.487
And geographic mobility makes 

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:11.770
friendship more complicated than
it used to be.

01:09:12.262 --> 01:09:13.882
» ANN COMPTON: But you can keep 
in touch with each other.

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:15.941
» E.J. DIONNE: And that is where
actually you 

01:09:19.441 --> 01:09:21.441
can be anti-Luddite, because, 
you know, 

01:09:22.753 --> 01:09:24.975
it strikes me with my kids -- 
sorry -- my students, that they 

01:09:24.976 --> 01:09:27.832
maintain their bonds in some way
more successfully than we did.  

01:09:27.833 --> 01:09:29.833
That's a good thing.

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:33.593
But I just -- I sort of like 
people to try to think about, 

01:09:33.594 --> 01:09:36.303
what is loyalty and what does it
demand?  Because it's not 

01:09:36.304 --> 01:09:38.304
something we talk about much in 
our society.

01:09:39.393 --> 01:09:41.393
» ANN COMPTON: We have two more 
questions coming up.

01:09:42.652 --> 01:09:45.354
The next one is from a student 
in Hawaii, Jordan.

01:09:46.793 --> 01:09:48.793
» Aloha.

01:09:50.088 --> 01:09:51.521
My name is Jordan, recent 
graduate of the University of 

01:09:51.522 --> 01:09:53.522
Hawaii.  My idea of the American
dream is freedom.

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:59.161
My question for you is:  What 
does freedom mean to you?

01:10:01.014 --> 01:10:02.234
» ANN COMPTON: What does freedom
mean to you?  That's just a 

01:10:02.235 --> 01:10:04.235
small...
» E.J.

01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:07.970
DIONNE: This is like a college 
interview in reverse.

01:10:09.532 --> 01:10:10.959
[ Laughter ]
» ANN COMPTON: And we'll keep 

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:13.009
this short because we want to 
get to several more questions.

01:10:15.932 --> 01:10:17.932
» E.J.

01:10:20.089 --> 01:10:22.089
DIONNE: You know, I think 
freedom is 

01:10:23.666 --> 01:10:25.551
about having the capacity to 
affect the decisions that are 

01:10:25.552 --> 01:10:27.552
made that affect you.

01:10:30.746 --> 01:10:32.746
Which means that freedom is 
partly a 

01:10:35.109 --> 01:10:37.109
social matter and it's why I am 
a 

01:10:38.928 --> 01:10:40.928
passionate small

01:10:41.942 --> 01:10:42.987
ddemocrat and think institutions
should be democratized where 

01:10:42.988 --> 01:10:44.988
they can be.

01:10:47.284 --> 01:10:49.284
And then I think of your -- and 
then I 

01:10:50.825 --> 01:10:52.825
think the first amendment, the 
freedom 

01:10:53.921 --> 01:10:55.921
is sort of described in the 
first 

01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:00.460
amendment, a reasonable list of 
what it means to be free.

01:11:03.591 --> 01:11:05.476
But I will stop there because I 
should stop and let Ross answer,

01:11:05.477 --> 01:11:07.477
but these are 

01:11:09.586 --> 01:11:11.586
a kind of set of liberal 
freedoms, and I 

01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:16.156
also think there's probably 
another side of freedom that 

01:11:16.157 --> 01:11:18.440
I'll let Ross describe that may 
have to do with the freedom -- 

01:11:22.579 --> 01:11:24.579
how freedom relates to 
responsibility.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:25.874
» ANN COMPTON: Ross?
» ROSS DOUTHAT: You can't mess 

01:11:25.875 --> 01:11:28.743
up my answer...
[ Laughter ]

01:11:30.408 --> 01:11:32.408
» ROSS DOUTHAT: I have not the 
freedom 

01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:34.123
to answer the question my own 
way.

01:11:34.124 --> 01:11:36.793
» E.J. DIONNE: I want to control
the conditions on this stage...

01:11:37.611 --> 01:11:41.890
» ROSS DOUTHAT: I mean, yeah, I 
will -- I guess I'll try to wrap

01:11:41.891 --> 01:11:43.891
in what E.J. was referring to.

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:49.702
I think where the American dream
is concerned, I associate 

01:11:49.703 --> 01:11:51.703
freedom andic I'll sound again a
little like a 

01:11:54.688 --> 01:11:56.949
radical, but the freedom in 
America is not to be a prisoner 

01:11:56.950 --> 01:12:00.225
of a boss.  You have a boss, 
people have bosses, that's part 

01:12:00.226 --> 01:12:02.226
of life.

01:12:04.126 --> 01:12:06.126
But I always come back to a 
movie that 

01:12:07.498 --> 01:12:09.498
maybe is now too old for 
millennials to 

01:12:11.801 --> 01:12:14.656
have seen It's A Wonderful Life 
where he plays George Bailey 

01:12:14.657 --> 01:12:16.657
from Bedford Falls, 

01:12:17.757 --> 01:12:20.034
New York, and the whole idea 
behind George Bailey, he's a 

01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:24.563
businessman, runs a building and
loan and trying to get people 

01:12:24.564 --> 01:12:26.564
into their own homes and there's

01:12:29.097 --> 01:12:31.385
Old Man Potter, the sort of 
Plutocrat of the town who wants 

01:12:31.386 --> 01:12:33.386
people to rent from him in his 
slums.

01:12:35.696 --> 01:12:37.765
And the dream of home ownership,
the idea of owning your own home

01:12:37.766 --> 01:12:39.889
comes from having a kind of 
rooted independence 

01:12:43.778 --> 01:12:45.623
where you are not a prisoner of,
in his case, a landlord and the 

01:12:45.624 --> 01:12:47.624
case of being stuck in a job you
don't like, a boss and so on.

01:12:50.774 --> 01:12:51.584
And that's -- again, in the 
northwestern context I think 

01:12:51.585 --> 01:12:56.084
that is sort of -- that's the 
heart of economic freedom, is 

01:12:56.085 --> 01:12:58.133
the freedom to sort of make your
own choices for your own family 

01:12:58.134 --> 01:13:00.134
and have the resources, whether 
it's the 

01:13:03.654 --> 01:13:05.654
money, the car to drive and, you
know, 

01:13:06.962 --> 01:13:08.583
the territories, all these sort 
of icons of American life 

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:10.584
connected to that version of 
freedom.

01:13:12.903 --> 01:13:14.903
And the then to make the 
conservative 

01:13:15.976 --> 01:13:17.976
point, the question -- the 
argument that 

01:13:19.055 --> 01:13:21.055
most American thinkers in the 
founding 

01:13:23.211 --> 01:13:24.646
era and down to the 1950s or 
1960s would have made is that 

01:13:24.647 --> 01:13:27.715
freedom is not the same thing as
license.  And freedom is 

01:13:27.716 --> 01:13:29.716
confirmed in responsibility.

01:13:32.321 --> 01:13:34.190
You want to be free to be -- 
free to be a moral person, to be

01:13:34.191 --> 01:13:38.063
a good person, to be bound by 
sort of community rules and 

01:13:38.064 --> 01:13:40.064
ideas and aspirations.

01:13:41.378 --> 01:13:43.242
And that freedom disappears if 
it's just treated as a freedom 

01:13:43.243 --> 01:13:45.243
to do whatever you want.

01:13:46.524 --> 01:13:47.341
And that's the kind of society 
that ultimately succumbs to 

01:13:47.342 --> 01:13:50.160
tyranny.  Maximal freedom 
ultimately leads 

01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:55.143
people to want to submit 
themselves to some 

01:13:55.144 --> 01:13:57.144
authoritarian.
» E.J.

01:13:58.219 --> 01:14:00.502
DIONNE: Every time a bell rings,
an angel gets its rings.  I love

01:14:00.503 --> 01:14:02.503
what Ross just said.

01:14:03.955 --> 01:14:05.955
I wrote a column on It's A 
Wonderful 

01:14:07.244 --> 01:14:09.244
Life as embodying the New Deal 
ethic.

01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:12.009
What is intriguing in that movie
is the moment when George 

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.010
discovers what 

01:14:15.125 --> 01:14:17.125
the world would be like without 
him and 

01:14:18.421 --> 01:14:20.421
Bedford Fallless becomes 
Pottersville, 

01:14:21.789 --> 01:14:23.789
and what is so interesting 
because of 

01:14:25.333 --> 01:14:28.311
lack of economic autonomy and 
well-distributed property, 

01:14:28.312 --> 01:14:32.191
Bedford Falls becomes a 
gambling, prostitution...  and 

01:14:32.192 --> 01:14:34.192
to me one of the things I love 

01:14:35.725 --> 01:14:38.038
about that movie is how it links
the need for economic justice to

01:14:38.039 --> 01:14:40.039
the creation of personal virtue.

01:14:44.775 --> 01:14:46.775
And anyway, my wife -- we have 
hanging 

01:14:47.888 --> 01:14:50.128
a Wonderful Life poster my wife 
gave me one Christmas because I 

01:14:50.129 --> 01:14:51.567
love that movie.
» ROSS DOUTHAT: But it's an 

01:14:51.568 --> 01:14:53.568
economic freedom -- it's an 
economic opportunity 

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:58.222
that is rooted in ownership 
rather than dependence, which is

01:14:58.223 --> 01:15:00.724
a sort of --
» E.J. DIONNE: But a particular 

01:15:00.725 --> 01:15:02.741
kind of capitalism.

Aloha.

» My name is nick comb Tamm, a 
student at the University of 

01:15:19.721 --> 01:15:22.426

Chinese.  I moved here ten years

01:15:22.427 --> 01:15:25.741
from Hong Kong with my family.  
Our vision of the American dream

01:15:25.742 --> 01:15:29.748
is good access to education as 
well as the freedom to express 

01:15:29.749 --> 01:15:33.464
speech and the ways that we can 
practice journalism.  My 

01:15:33.465 --> 01:15:35.135
question to you is:  Do you 
think we'll have the same access

01:15:35.136 --> 01:15:39.914
to the freedom of speech and 
journalism the way we have today

01:15:39.915 --> 01:15:44.292

whether the future of freedom of

» E.J. DIONNE: I sort of have 
two thoughts on this that are 

01:15:57.016 --> 01:15:59.016
kind of intention.

01:16:02.397 --> 01:16:04.265
One is I am genuinely alarmed, 
as I think Ross is, by the 

01:16:04.266 --> 01:16:09.721
current administration, its 
attitudes toward the media, its 

01:16:09.722 --> 01:16:12.555
-- you know, its constant 
attacks.  The media as the enemy

01:16:12.556 --> 01:16:14.556
of the people, 

01:16:18.203 --> 01:16:20.203
that term the president uses is 
a term 

01:16:22.592 --> 01:16:25.272
that have people band in Russia 
because it has memories of 

01:16:25.273 --> 01:16:27.273
Stalinism.

01:16:28.791 --> 01:16:30.454
And I do worry about -- I'm 
going to see what has happened 

01:16:30.455 --> 01:16:32.845
to the kids of parents whoa are 
trying to cross the border.

01:16:36.506 --> 01:16:38.729
I'm not sure I fully get the 
link between the two except that

01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:40.730
I -- and 

01:16:42.243 --> 01:16:44.932
that we've gone through periods 
of, you know, restrictionism and

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:46.933
immigration and more open 
borders and kind of gotten 

01:16:48.473 --> 01:16:50.308
through those periods and I tend
to think Americans are 

01:16:50.309 --> 01:16:53.231
ultimately pragmatic on this 
question and they ---they open 

01:16:55.674 --> 01:16:58.212
up the borders again when they 
sort of feel that it's in the 

01:16:58.213 --> 01:17:00.213
interest of the country.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:03.951
But I do worry about a general 

01:17:05.047 --> 01:17:07.047
attitude that is coming from the

01:17:09.086 --> 01:17:11.086
government that is authoritarian
and

01:17:14.091 --> 01:17:16.367
it's sort of a strong man, if 
you will, view of the world that

01:17:16.368 --> 01:17:18.368
is very disconcerting.

01:17:20.451 --> 01:17:21.948
Having said all that, I think 
that we're -- one of the great 

01:17:21.949 --> 01:17:25.200
things about the U.S. is that we
are really good at correcting 

01:17:25.201 --> 01:17:27.201
our mistakes.

everyone loves, always do the 

01:17:31.612 --> 01:17:33.147
right thing after first 
exhausting all of the other 

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:35.148
possibilities.

01:17:37.017 --> 01:17:38.861

of exhausting the possibilities.

in here and then we'll open up

01:17:46.706 --> 01:17:49.164
» ROSS DOUTHAT: Freedom of the 
press issue is a weird one, 

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:51.165
because on the one 

01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:54.876
hand it is extremely unusual to 
have the president of the United

01:17:54.877 --> 01:17:59.448
States, you know, sweeting 
attacks on fake news and, you 

01:17:59.449 --> 01:18:01.449
know, institutions, including my
employer and so on.

01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:05.918
At the same time, the actual 
view from inside The New York 

01:18:05.919 --> 01:18:07.919
Times, and I think 

01:18:09.832 --> 01:18:12.075
probably from inside the Jeff 
Bezos own Washington Post as 

01:18:12.076 --> 01:18:17.427
well is that in practical terms,
you know, this is the Trump era 

01:18:17.428 --> 01:18:21.165
has been better for journalism, 
maybe worse for everybody else 

01:18:21.166 --> 01:18:22.418
but better for journalism than, 
you know, the five or ten years 

01:18:22.419 --> 01:18:24.419
before it.

01:18:25.508 --> 01:18:28.393
You know, the big threat to the 
press in America over the last 

01:18:28.394 --> 01:18:32.372
10 to 15 years, not to bring 
everything back to the evils of 

01:18:32.373 --> 01:18:34.373
the Internet, has been the 
Internet's effect on the media's

01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:37.736
business model, and the 
fascination and obsession with 

01:18:37.737 --> 01:18:40.009
Trump and the Trump 
administration and so on has, 

01:18:40.010 --> 01:18:42.010
you know, 

01:18:45.199 --> 01:18:47.233
been a kind of economic boon in 
many ways to the press and at 

01:18:47.234 --> 01:18:51.603
the same time whatever Trump 
himself may want to do, his 

01:18:51.604 --> 01:18:53.838
administration is not at all in 
a position to, I think, clamp 

01:18:53.839 --> 01:18:55.839
down effectively on the media in
the way 

01:18:59.385 --> 01:19:01.385
that, you know, see in genuinely
authoritarian countries.

01:19:02.921 --> 01:19:04.921
So I am of two minds.

01:19:07.236 --> 01:19:09.236
It's obviously a bad thing that 
-- you 

01:19:11.512 --> 01:19:13.771
know, to have a president sort 
of de-legitimizing the media, at

01:19:13.772 --> 01:19:15.772
the same 

01:19:19.137 --> 01:19:21.137
time there's a whole weird 
Bukuke 

01:19:22.834 --> 01:19:25.704
theater, Trump atacts The New 
York Times and it soars and next

01:19:25.705 --> 01:19:27.360
they're on the phone talking to 
him because he does that all the

01:19:27.361 --> 01:19:29.361
time.

01:19:32.912 --> 01:19:35.191

very much about journalism at 
the local level where the

great reporters trying to do

I'm going to push you guys, both
of you, on the immigration

issue.  Because on the one hand 
a lot of what

fascinating, I agree.

find your description of the

little weak in part because as 

01:21:24.529 --> 01:21:26.529

about the American dream,

freedom and immigration.

» ANN COMPTON: Do we have 
another microphone out there 

01:22:00.755 --> 01:22:02.001
there.
» I'll try to make two quick 

01:22:02.002 --> 01:22:04.730
points.  The first is to connect
back to the 

01:22:08.816 --> 01:22:10.816
first question, which is that 
one of the 

01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:15.218
questions for America going 
forward is does the society -- 

01:22:15.219 --> 01:22:17.219
does society end up 

01:22:19.745 --> 01:22:21.170
in this dynamic that you do see 
more in California than other 

01:22:21.171 --> 01:22:25.284
parts of the country where you 
have a combination of ethnic and

01:22:25.285 --> 01:22:28.175
generational stratification, and
this is part of what drives the 

01:22:30.215 --> 01:22:32.215
Trump phenomenon and support for
Trump 

01:22:33.218 --> 01:22:35.218
on the right, but exists in 
extremely 

01:22:36.226 --> 01:22:38.226
liberal

01:22:41.786 --> 01:22:44.675
states as well where the 
combination of declining birth 

01:22:44.676 --> 01:22:46.676
rates have created the 
phenomenon you described.

01:22:50.462 --> 01:22:52.462
A generation much more diverse 
and 

01:22:53.817 --> 01:22:55.885
include ethnic minorities than 
40 or 50 years ago co-existing 

01:22:55.886 --> 01:22:58.133
with an older generation that is
sort of richer and 

01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:08.596
whiter and obviously older, and 
that is a big source of 

01:23:08.597 --> 01:23:10.597
political attention.

01:23:12.357 --> 01:23:14.806
You talk about -- we talk a lot 
about class stratification, a 

01:23:14.807 --> 01:23:17.506
lot about racial stratification.
Having that kind of sort of 

01:23:17.507 --> 01:23:19.507
ethnic 

01:23:22.178 --> 01:23:24.178
divide between the generations 
tends, I

01:23:28.786 --> 01:23:31.369
think, to exacerbate class -- 
exacerbates polarization and 

01:23:31.785 --> 01:23:34.494
tension and so on.  So a huge 
challenge for America going 

01:23:40.314 --> 01:23:42.314
forward is, you know, having dug
deep 

01:23:44.972 --> 01:23:46.972
into policy but to figure out 
how

01:23:49.796 --> 01:23:51.796
to take a working class that is 

01:23:54.271 --> 01:23:56.343
increasingly racially diverse 
and advance their socioeconomic 

01:23:56.344 --> 01:23:58.344
interests in 

01:24:01.996 --> 01:24:03.996
a Peter where there is this sort
of

01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:08.442
generational -- alienation 
driven by race.  I'm not 

01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:10.443
providing solutions.

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:14.638
The briefer point I would make 
is echo something E.J. said, 

01:24:14.639 --> 01:24:16.618
when thinking about immigration 
tensions we're having now you do

01:24:16.619 --> 01:24:21.129
have to recognize there has been
this ebb and flow of immigration

01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:23.130
across American history, and the
period that we have 

01:24:25.598 --> 01:24:27.598
been

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:31.213
talking about as a model of what
American dream would look like 

01:24:31.214 --> 01:24:33.214
was a 

01:24:34.306 --> 01:24:36.956
period of extremely low 
immigration effectively cut off 

01:24:36.957 --> 01:24:38.957
by the -- not just 

01:24:42.757 --> 01:24:46.555
somewhat racist immigration 
rules in the 1920s.  I've been 

01:24:46.556 --> 01:24:48.385
what I would describe as a 
moderate immigration 

01:24:48.386 --> 01:24:52.650
restrictionist over the last ten
years, and, you know, one of the

01:24:52.651 --> 01:24:55.624
arguments I made is that you 
ended up getting the kind of 

01:24:55.625 --> 01:24:58.327
extremities of Trump in part 
because you had this 

01:25:01.685 --> 01:25:04.146
very large wave of immigration 
that sort of brought America's 

01:25:04.147 --> 01:25:08.215
foreign born populations up to 
levels we haven't had in 100 

01:25:08.216 --> 01:25:11.087
years and neither political 
party took that seriously, sort 

01:25:11.088 --> 01:25:15.607
of people who -- you know, who 
felt that it was happening too 

01:25:15.608 --> 01:25:17.420
fast, and if you can't take 
those concerns seriously, you 

01:25:17.421 --> 01:25:19.421
end 

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.160
up empower more demagoguic 
alternatives.

01:25:24.882 --> 01:25:26.531
I think the alternatives is if 
you look at illegal immigration 

01:25:26.532 --> 01:25:31.038
it's actually down over the past
10 or 15 years and in part some 

01:25:31.039 --> 01:25:34.326
of the Trump phenomenon is a 
reaction to a trend that has 

01:25:34.327 --> 01:25:36.327
already crested.

01:25:37.838 --> 01:25:39.923
It's sort of a delayed reaction 
to much larger scale 

01:25:39.924 --> 01:25:41.924
immigration, especially illegal 
immigration in the 

01:25:44.897 --> 01:25:46.561
early 2000s, and as sort of the 
culture internalizes the fact 

01:25:46.562 --> 01:25:50.411
that the great wave of Mexican 
immigration to the U.S. is 

01:25:50.412 --> 01:25:52.505
probably over, you'll have a 
lowering of tensions around that

01:25:52.506 --> 01:25:56.963
issue that will lead to better 
policies and fewer disasters 

01:25:56.964 --> 01:25:59.822
like the child separation 
policy.  Anyway...

one more quick question up here.

01:26:04.238 --> 01:26:07.477
» E.J. DIONNE: I'm going to 
sneak an answer to your question

01:26:07.478 --> 01:26:08.306
into the next one.
» ANN COMPTON: That's good.

01:26:08.307 --> 01:26:10.875
» E.J. DIONNE: I've been asked 
to move on.

01:26:12.353 --> 01:26:14.353
»AUDIENCE MEMBER:  So going off 
the 

01:26:16.689 --> 01:26:19.178
theme of increasing 
factionallization, you alluded 

01:26:19.179 --> 01:26:21.223
to increasing segregation among 
other lines, particularly among 

01:26:22.894 --> 01:26:25.147
educational lines, especially 
thinking about the recent 

01:26:25.148 --> 01:26:27.148
election and how the political 
divide is less so between red 

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:30.239
states and blue states, more 
between blue cities and the red 

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:35.691
rural areas.  I'm wondering if 
given the centrality of that 

01:26:35.692 --> 01:26:37.692
idea to the American dream the 

01:26:42.375 --> 01:26:44.260
idea of society where civic is 
with different educational 

01:26:44.261 --> 01:26:48.264
demographic plantation, what 
policies do you think could be 

01:26:48.265 --> 01:26:50.262
undertaken to minimize 
segregation and particularly to 

01:26:50.263 --> 01:26:53.928
have more integration among 
educational and other 

01:26:53.929 --> 01:26:56.018
demographic lines.
» ANN COMPTON: E.J.

01:26:56.019 --> 01:27:01.210
» E.J. DIONNE: That is a 
question that I think is central

01:27:01.211 --> 01:27:04.107
to the future and that I don't 
think we have good policy 

01:27:04.108 --> 01:27:06.990
answers to yet, because we 
clearly have a 

01:27:12.263 --> 01:27:14.263
situation in the country where 
certain 

01:27:16.178 --> 01:27:18.767
regions are people magnets, job 
magnets, investment magnets, a 

01:27:18.768 --> 01:27:21.445
figure of something like 85% of 
the venture capital goes to 

01:27:21.446 --> 01:27:23.446
three states.

01:27:25.353 --> 01:27:26.438
And this is not, as you pointed 
out correctly, simple red states

01:27:26.439 --> 01:27:28.439
and blue states.

01:27:30.163 --> 01:27:32.163
If you compare down state 
Illinois to 

01:27:33.223 --> 01:27:35.223
Metro Chicago, upstate New York 
to Metro 

01:27:36.455 --> 01:27:38.455
New York City or in my state, 
you know, 

01:27:40.558 --> 01:27:42.558
the mill towns, like the one I 
grew up 

01:27:46.187 --> 01:27:48.047
in Lowell or Lawrence or pug 
versus greater -- Boston, and 

01:27:48.048 --> 01:27:50.048
you saw this reflected in voting
patterns.

01:27:54.288 --> 01:27:56.189
This is a huge problem and 
economist tend to not like 

01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:58.190
regionally based 

01:27:59.512 --> 01:28:00.962
economic proposals to try to 
lift up one region because they 

01:28:00.963 --> 01:28:02.963
see it as inefficient.

01:28:05.139 --> 01:28:07.204
I heard economists argue what 
you do is benefit already 

01:28:07.205 --> 01:28:09.205
privileged people in those areas
and the benefits don't spread.

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:14.640
But I think there are ways of 
pursuing 

01:28:16.401 --> 01:28:18.401
-- I think we do need to pursue 
policies 

01:28:19.521 --> 01:28:21.184
that are place based and place 
based policies would help 

01:28:21.185 --> 01:28:23.907
different kinds of people on 
opposite sides of the divide.

01:28:27.446 --> 01:28:29.446
On the one side inner cities who
have 

01:28:30.918 --> 01:28:32.918
been hammered by 
deindustrialization and 

01:28:34.428 --> 01:28:36.913
on the other hand smaller and --
smaller towns and more rural 

01:28:36.914 --> 01:28:38.765
areas and factory towns that 
have been hollowed out, like 

01:28:38.766 --> 01:28:44.552
mine.  And I think we just have 
to find ways of doing that.  And

01:28:44.553 --> 01:28:46.000
I also think we have to find 
ways of making so-called bad 

01:28:46.001 --> 01:28:48.001
jobs better.

01:28:49.077 --> 01:28:51.077
There was nothing that said that

01:28:52.319 --> 01:28:54.162
working in a steel mill or auto 
mill was a good job except 

01:28:54.163 --> 01:28:56.163
unions came along and 

01:28:57.490 --> 01:28:59.346
people got paid a good wage, 
began to develop benefits, and 

01:28:59.347 --> 01:29:01.347
we've got to 

01:29:03.869 --> 01:29:05.869
figure out how to do that again 
for jobs in the service sector.

» ROSS DOUTHAT: The best thing 
the Trump administration has 

01:29:10.309 --> 01:29:12.309
done in this regard is to tax

» ROSS DOUTHAT: And I'm not 

01:29:14.856 --> 01:29:16.856
really kidding.

01:29:21.725 --> 01:29:23.991

» ROSS DOUTHAT: I'm not bitter. 

01:29:26.641 --> 01:29:28.086
I've done well with my Harvard 
degree.  Here I am on stage with

01:29:28.087 --> 01:29:30.087
you.

01:29:31.771 --> 01:29:34.506
I think there's room for a kind 
of -- for a kind of 

01:29:34.507 --> 01:29:37.385
experimentation that could cross
left-right lines.  I think 

01:29:37.386 --> 01:29:39.638
there's a better version of 
Donald Trump that, you know, 

01:29:39.639 --> 01:29:41.639
when Amazon announced it was 
going to go on the hunt 

01:29:44.597 --> 01:29:47.079
for a new corporate 
headquarters, that better 

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.537
version of Trump, instead of 
ranting against Bezos on Twitter

01:29:49.538 --> 01:29:52.446
would have gotten on the phone 
and said, I'm the president of 

01:29:52.447 --> 01:29:57.146
the United States and I've got a
lot of power, I want to use my 

01:29:57.147 --> 01:29:59.757
soft power to prevail upon you 
to consider going to St. Louis 

01:29:59.758 --> 01:30:01.594
rather than greater Washington, 
D.C.

01:30:01.595 --> 01:30:03.638
And, you know, as E.J. says, 
that's the kind of things 

01:30:06.224 --> 01:30:07.665
economists hate and it obviously
kind of smacks a little bit of 

01:30:07.666 --> 01:30:09.666
authoritarianism 

01:30:11.427 --> 01:30:13.951
and you could imagine it going 
in disastrous directions, but 

01:30:13.952 --> 01:30:15.985
I'm open to the idea that there 
are ways that the 

01:30:19.738 --> 01:30:21.738
federal government can sort of 
use soft 

01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:25.824
persuasive power around sort of 
corporate leadership and also, 

01:30:25.825 --> 01:30:28.278
you know, tweak and change tax 
policies and do a 

01:30:32.621 --> 01:30:34.482
bunch of things that could treat
these aglom rations of social 

01:30:34.483 --> 01:30:37.377
and economic capital of 
monopolies unto themselves.

01:30:42.767 --> 01:30:44.657
It's kind of a monopoly in its 
own right.  And the federal 

01:30:44.658 --> 01:30:47.752
government announced they were 
going to move agencies to other 

01:30:47.753 --> 01:30:49.410
parts of the country, that would
be a small way of starting to 

01:30:49.411 --> 01:30:52.604
break up that kind of cluster, 
and I don't think it would be a 

01:30:52.605 --> 01:30:55.705
bad thing.
» ANN COMPTON: We're going to 

01:30:55.706 --> 01:30:57.706
close with one last question 
from Hawaii.

01:31:00.066 --> 01:31:02.772
The question comes from a 
student named Harrison.

01:31:03.575 --> 01:31:05.575
» Hi, my name is Harrison.  I'm 
a journalism student at the 

01:31:05.863 --> 01:31:07.863
University of Hawaii.

01:31:09.155 --> 01:31:11.717
My version of the American dream
is doing what you love and being

01:31:11.718 --> 01:31:15.033
able to provide for those that 
love you.  If we do what we love

01:31:15.034 --> 01:31:18.746
but can't provide for those who 
love us, then how do we as a 

01:31:18.747 --> 01:31:20.747
society move towards a place 
where that can happen?

01:31:21.252 --> 01:31:23.856
» E.J. DIONNE: That man should 
be a columnist.  Either that or 

01:31:23.857 --> 01:31:26.900
a preacher.  That was a 
beautiful thing.

01:31:26.901 --> 01:31:28.901
» ANN COMPTON: It is.  That's 
why we wanted to end with it.

01:31:31.877 --> 01:31:32.935
So each of you use this as kind 
of your closing argument for 

01:31:32.936 --> 01:31:34.936
tonight.

01:31:38.409 --> 01:31:40.291
» ROSS DOUTHAT: I mean, I'll 
speak common -- I'll seek common

01:31:40.292 --> 01:31:45.090
ground and say that the public 
policies we should seek should 

01:31:45.091 --> 01:31:47.091
be policies that seek a little 
more economic equality than we 

01:31:49.807 --> 01:31:52.771
have right now but that seek it 
through by targeting precisely 

01:31:52.772 --> 01:31:55.233
the areas that the questioner is
talking about.  Basically saying

01:31:55.234 --> 01:31:59.246
we're going to provide a little 
more support for work and a 

01:31:59.247 --> 01:32:01.882
little more support for family. 
And we're going to reorient the 

01:32:03.539 --> 01:32:06.201
welfare state so that you have a
little more money when raising 

01:32:06.202 --> 01:32:09.974
kids, you have a larger earned 
income tax credit or something 

01:32:09.975 --> 01:32:11.975
like it, if you're working a 

01:32:13.255 --> 01:32:15.294
blue collar job and it gets you 
to a place that conservatives 

01:32:15.295 --> 01:32:17.295
could support because you're 
effectively like the GI 

01:32:20.239 --> 01:32:22.302
bill, you're sort of subsidizing
hard work and child rearing you 

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:24.303
gnome, the most conservative 
things of all.

01:32:27.107 --> 01:32:29.107
But you're doing it in a way 
that does 

01:32:30.827 --> 01:32:31.659
push the society towards a 
slightly more egalitarian income

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:33.660
distribution, because I think 
that is the core question.

01:32:35.963 --> 01:32:38.034
You should be able to -- if you 
work hard, you should be able 

01:32:38.035 --> 01:32:41.726
to, you know, get married, buy a
house and have a family.  And 

01:32:41.727 --> 01:32:44.973
not everybody wants to do that, 
but lots of people do.  And when

01:32:44.974 --> 01:32:46.974
America was working at its best,
lots of people were able to do 

01:32:48.257 --> 01:32:49.678
that, and I think that's a 
worthwhile goal for policymakers

01:32:49.679 --> 01:32:54.179
today as well.
» ANN COMPTON: E.J.?

01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:56.180
» E.J.

01:32:57.682 --> 01:33:00.405
DIONNE: The idea of getting to 
do what you love is one of the 

01:33:00.406 --> 01:33:02.406
-- in a way one of the great 
privileges of life.

01:33:06.173 --> 01:33:08.458
Because there are so many people
who are essential to our lives 

01:33:08.459 --> 01:33:11.560
who are not necessarily doing 
work that they love but work 

01:33:11.561 --> 01:33:13.561
that they have to do.

01:33:15.695 --> 01:33:17.743
And so I think the question is, 
you know, in the first instance,

01:33:17.744 --> 01:33:23.103
what are the ways of increasing 
the chances that people will get

01:33:23.104 --> 01:33:25.104
to do what they love, 

01:33:26.871 --> 01:33:28.927
and that probably has to do with
both access to education on the 

01:33:28.928 --> 01:33:30.928
one side but 

01:33:32.226 --> 01:33:34.226
also I think a whole lot more 
respect 

01:33:36.011 --> 01:33:38.011
than we show in our society to 
work that 

01:33:39.746 --> 01:33:41.746
does not necessarily require a 
college 

01:33:43.095 --> 01:33:45.095
degree but reflects class 
manship.

01:33:46.735 --> 01:33:49.215
I think that one of the -- if 
you compare our economy and 

01:33:49.216 --> 01:33:53.955
social attitudes to the Germans,
I think one of my friends at the

01:33:53.956 --> 01:33:56.659
Financial Times has written 
quite eloquently about, that 

01:34:01.222 --> 01:34:04.163
that's society has come to 
respect the work done by those 

01:34:04.164 --> 01:34:09.716
who do not automatically fall 
into some meritocratic elite and

01:34:09.717 --> 01:34:11.717
has rewarded it accordingly.

01:34:15.496 --> 01:34:17.496
And I'm heartened, you know, 
bless 

01:34:21.479 --> 01:34:24.361
Ross for his egalitarian 
approach, and it pains me that 

01:34:24.362 --> 01:34:26.628
there are not very many 
conservatives these days who are

01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:28.629
willing to embrace that kind of 
egalitarianism.

01:34:32.186 --> 01:34:34.755
In a way I think more 
conservatives, we look back and 

01:34:34.756 --> 01:34:37.249
think of Robert Taft as deeply 
conservative, and yet he was in 

01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:41.921
that era of shared commitment 
created by the New Deal and by 

01:34:41.922 --> 01:34:43.922
World War II.

01:34:46.676 --> 01:34:48.943
He was willing to say that the 
market all by itself, the 

01:34:48.944 --> 01:34:51.203
workings of the market all by 
itself will not guarantee the 

01:34:51.204 --> 01:34:53.204
good life for people.

01:34:55.553 --> 01:34:57.453
And I'd like to see us have a 
different kind of political 

01:34:57.454 --> 01:35:00.162
debate where a conservative like
Ross might correct 

01:35:03.269 --> 01:35:04.090
me in my -- perhaps I have too 
much hope in ex-government 

01:35:04.091 --> 01:35:07.722
program.  Perhaps I would be 
more willing to tax people than 

01:35:07.723 --> 01:35:09.723
he would.

01:35:13.661 --> 01:35:15.661
But yet we would share a 
commitment to 

01:35:17.799 --> 01:35:20.243
the idea that you can't make the
-- create the American dream 

01:35:20.244 --> 01:35:23.087
without individual effort but 
you can't create a 

01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:29.212
society in which the American 
dream is possible without some 

01:35:29.213 --> 01:35:31.213
collective action, some 
collective effort, and a real 

01:35:34.192 --> 01:35:36.192
commitment to each other and not
just to ourselves.

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:39.219
» ROSS DOUTHAT: The irony, it 
should be said, since we have 

01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:42.133
been both in different ways 
critical of the President of the

01:35:42.134 --> 01:35:44.999
United States tonight, the irony
of the Trump era is that one of 

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
the many 

01:35:48.235 --> 01:35:50.235
reasonston Trump was

01:35:52.414 --> 01:35:54.414
was ---in his bludgeoning way he
did provide that vision.

01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:58.380
There is isn't necessarily 
policy to 

01:35:59.451 --> 01:36:00.709
back it up, but the Donald Trump
Republican vision was closer to 

01:36:00.710 --> 01:36:02.710
what 

01:36:04.003 --> 01:36:04.839
you're describing than the Paul 
Ryan Mitt Romney vision four 

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.840
years before.

01:36:08.308 --> 01:36:10.308
I think that's something that 
the 

01:36:11.814 --> 01:36:14.179
populism of Trump is a sort of 
crude grasp at that center that 

01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:16.180
you're talking about.
» E.J.

01:36:18.258 --> 01:36:21.157

01:36:21.158 --> 01:36:23.158
insidious about what 

01:36:24.963 --> 01:36:26.963
Trump did is that it carried 
that 

01:36:28.966 --> 01:36:29.578
promise with policies that are 
actually antithetical to that 

01:36:29.579 --> 01:36:31.579
promise.

01:36:33.914 --> 01:36:35.762
I always felt, for example, that
when progressives and even 

01:36:35.763 --> 01:36:38.371
moderates say to a lot of folks 
who find at age 507 that 

01:36:42.026 --> 01:36:43.674
they -- age 50 they are not in a
job that provides them with 

01:36:43.675 --> 01:36:48.210
income they used to have to 
support their families and live 

01:36:48.211 --> 01:36:49.878
a decent life, and the typical 
policy person who happens to be 

01:36:49.879 --> 01:36:51.879
a 

01:36:53.247 --> 01:36:54.899
college educated comes along and
says, would you need more 

01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:57.246
training and education?  There's
truth to that but I think that 

01:36:59.538 --> 01:37:01.405
person has every right to think,
what that person is telling us 

01:37:01.406 --> 01:37:03.406
is we've got 

01:37:06.584 --> 01:37:09.226
to be more like them and it 
comes off as condescending and 

01:37:09.227 --> 01:37:12.711
not in any way genuinely 
empathetic.  When Trump said I'm

01:37:12.712 --> 01:37:16.752
going to bring back those 
factory jobs and coal jobs, of 

01:37:16.753 --> 01:37:19.230
course he wasn't going to do 
that.  I have a strong suspicion

01:37:19.231 --> 01:37:21.231
that many people who heard that 
and cheered know 

01:37:24.982 --> 01:37:27.463
that's not true, but they had a 
sense from that that he 

01:37:27.464 --> 01:37:31.639
understood the way they felt 
better than the person who kept 

01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:33.640
talking about training and 
education.

01:37:38.029 --> 01:37:40.093
So during the campaign, one of 
the nicest moments I had was I 

01:37:40.094 --> 01:37:42.094
suggested 

01:37:44.230 --> 01:37:45.484
that the hat I wanted to wear 
would say "make America 

01:37:45.485 --> 01:37:47.485
empathetic again.

01:37:48.574 --> 01:37:51.036
"  And a very nice person in the
audience came up to me and said,

01:37:51.037 --> 01:37:55.988
I love that, you're going to 
hear from me! And I got this hat

01:37:55.989 --> 01:37:57.989
and got my mail -- 

01:38:00.766 --> 01:38:02.766
it was a perfect for the Trump 
hat, but 

01:38:04.086 --> 01:38:06.799
it said "make America empathetic
again."  But my son said he did 

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.800
too good a job and it looks like
a Trump hat.

01:38:11.016 --> 01:38:13.016
But I do think that we are -- if
our 

01:38:14.713 --> 01:38:17.597
country dies, it will be because
of our absolute inability to 

01:38:17.598 --> 01:38:19.598
understand the 

01:38:20.696 --> 01:38:22.696
suffering and the pain of people
unlike us.

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:28.033
And that the worst kind of 
politics is 

01:38:29.767 --> 01:38:30.783
a politics that holds one 
group's pain against another 

01:38:30.784 --> 01:38:32.784
group's pain.

01:38:34.316 --> 01:38:36.316
And that's what we have to find 
a remedy for.

01:38:37.868 --> 01:38:39.868
» ANN COMPTON: The conversation 
tonight 

01:38:41.608 --> 01:38:43.608
proves that the concept of the 
American 

01:38:46.313 --> 01:38:48.876
dream is this conversation that 
is never ending.  Tonight, the 

01:38:48.877 --> 01:38:50.915

action.

you.
[Applause]

01:39:10.752 --> 01:39:11.578
» Here at the Library of 
Congress I have one thing to say

01:39:11.579 --> 01:39:15.911
to E.J.'s last comment is we 
need hats made that say "make 

01:39:15.912 --> 01:39:20.043
Congress great again."
But thank you for coming.  

01:39:20.044 --> 01:39:22.343
That's the most important thing,
the audience.  We really 

01:39:22.344 --> 01:39:24.344
appreciate your attendance 

01:39:26.569 --> 01:39:28.631
here and we have another 
partnership with the Inouye 

01:39:28.632 --> 01:39:30.710
foundation and have a program 
next year.  Stay tuned for that.

01:39:33.186 --> 01:39:35.517
We have revamped website of the 
Kluge Center so you can keep up 

01:39:35.518 --> 01:39:37.788
with what we're up to and future
events.  Thank you all again.

01:39:39.246 --> 01:39:41.246
[Applause]
