00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.070
Well, the next question that the privacy
policy should address is, you tell me

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.630
what you collect about me, so how do
you use this collected information?

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.480
What do you do about it or
what do you do with this information?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.750
Google says they're collecting it to
really improve your user experience,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.790
personalization search results that
they returned are the most relevant for

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.280
you, okay?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.043
And you and I maybe have very
different kind of interests.

00:00:26.043 --> 00:00:28.963
So even if you type the same
search query terms,

00:00:28.963 --> 00:00:33.410
what the return could be different
because of this personalization.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.560
So, the idea is the more we know about
you, the more information that we have

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.220
better is the experience that you
will have when you use their service.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.140
And they make their money
by selling advertisements.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.465
So the other thing that they
use your information for

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:55.065
is for serving targeted advertisements.

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:58.115
Although you can set preferences and
things like that.

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:01.036
But this information that we're
talking about, what they collect,

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:03.668
what you search for,
what sites you visit, things like that.

00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:08.456
Well, that's all used to try to figure
out what kind of advertisements you

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:12.650
will be most interested in as
that's how they make their money.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.670
So their information used
essentially to keep you hooked,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.390
which is the good user experience,
personalized user experience.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.070
And then be able to show you ads that
hopefully are of interest to you.
