00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.320
So what is Docker?

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.520
Docker is an open source tool that makes
it easier to create, distribute, and

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.990
run applications.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.250
It does this by packaging applications
as a set of container images that

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.110
include all of the dependencies
bundled with it.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.580
Container images can be run on any
machine where Docker is installed

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.490
which means containers or
assist admins dream come true.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.570
Reproducable and Consistant.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.410
Containers like processes start up and
shut down quickly.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.380
We're talking milliseconds here.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.790
At the same time, containers provide
the benefits of a virtual machine like

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.320
isolation between applications
running on the same machine.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.040
This means we don't have to worry
about conflicting dependencies between

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.580
our apps.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.280
For this course, we use Docker
to package, distribute, and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.170
run our application.
