00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The next of the Beta Sprints to present

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is one of two, that are based at Harvard

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and affiliated with the Berkman Center,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
one of the reasons we had outside reviewers was a

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
conflict of interest that might lead me to approve these

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
things of my colleagues, but I am delighted that these were chosen.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Jeffrey Snape and Carol Oehler

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and her colleagues worked on a project which would be

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
very different slides into the world of what might be possible

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and have very excited to see what they have to say.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The slides are coming up who did not have encouraged to

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
run a live demonstration but there is one of by the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
poster session if you would like to play around with ExtraMUROS

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and it has been working well today so we would be happy

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
if you have the opportunity to play around with it.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What we would like to do is introduce you to ExtraMUROS

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
which is a project whose aim is to shape the digital

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
public Library of America  into a user Center multimedia

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
library without walls built on public API.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And the aim of ExtraMUROS is to transform the way people discover, curate

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and disseminate questions -- collections of books,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
images, sounds, video, and other media.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
ExtraMUROS provides discovery, territorial

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and offering tools that allow users to effortlessly

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
create their own collections of multimedia projects.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And it is built using Zeega, an open source HTML platform that

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we are glad to say was a recent winner of the Knight Foundation's news challenge.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now the project is being led by MetaLab at Harvard

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And it's being developed in conjunction with the Loeb Library

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
at the graduate school of design, the Harvard Library Lab and Zeega.org

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now there are five main components to ExtraMUROS

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the first is shared access.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
ExtraMUROS interconnects online holdings

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 from libraries, heritage institutions, local historical associations

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and archives across the country as well as repositories

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
like Internet Archive, Flickr, and YouTube.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And visual discovery is a second -

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
rather than relying on keyword searches,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
ExtraMUROS allows users to explore collections and intuitive  and nonlinear ways,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
offering icon-based searching, personalized sorting trays

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and geographic visualizations of search results that are

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
zoomable. Duration. ExtraMUROS allows the general public,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
students of all ages, students

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and scholars to collaboratively curate,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
scholarand share online exhibitions,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
slideshows that combine text, individual images,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
audio and video great .  Multi-channeling,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
ExtraMUROS makes curated editions

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and multimedia projects accessible on iPADS

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and other mobile devices and online

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and are trying to build a bridge between the local

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and the national and the national and the local.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
ExtraMUROS makes it possible  to feature local archives

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and collections is a function of user location

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and envisages building DPLA kiosks of  literal physical

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
bridges that will host local and national curatorial projects.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Let's show you a little bit of what we have built so far.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
One interesting subject we focused upon was the history

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
of the American landscape this is a collection of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
digitized magic lantern slides from the Library of Congress

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and they're currently available on the Library of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Congress website, and digital form,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
but they are pretty difficult to access, browse, and use,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
so when using ExtraMUROS, can search within this collection,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
we are typing in American landscape we can view it as

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
images  or categories or even make our own collections.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Here, we are seeing user added collections and astronomy,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
starry night, fountain, Chicago world's fair. The

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Now we are looking at just images in the catalog about

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the Chicago world's fair. If we go to Flickr, we also find hundreds,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
thousands more photos of the same exposition.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And this is one of the Smithsonian collection

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and we allow users to add text

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and media they would encounter

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and we can add those to the ExtraMUROS database andd we

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
will type in where the Chicago fair was back in 1993.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And you get a lot of other extra metadata as well

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and so we're adding it to our database

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and if we go back to ExtraMUROS,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
we can see the new media that we have just added aa

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and we have made it a and the lab

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and we had that to the database

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and before we go back to ExtraMUROS vacancy at all

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and it allows us to add and incorporate text , audio

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and video across the web and so now, a

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Are also enabling tools to allow the public to curate

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
author and share and Augmentin annotate books.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Here's an example of all we are going to be showing you

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
right now on the user edited version of Robert Riddell's 1984 book,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
all the world is a fear that shows the potential of

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
integration of ExtraMUROS with a ShelfLife progress at

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
the Harvard library integration my integrated a new

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
project using the ExtraMUROS activator and research the database

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and we drag individual pages of the book to the editing

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
trade to rebuild the book's opening chapter added to

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
click on preview, as we are seeing right now,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
you will see what the published version will look like.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
You can also examine associated books in this case,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
they're looking at the ShelfLife stack of books related

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to all the world is a fair  as a means of excavating

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
footnotes are locating related or similar volumes. Now,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
let's go back to her outfit to the edition

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and see what this looks like after a little bit of editorial work.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Here we have highlighted the footnoted citation.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Click and we see the quotation from the original source,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and we see the source of the book itself, Lucy Osgood.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Taking advantage of the storytelling capabilities,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
we decide to develop a separate path relating to the

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
history of this specific book so that in a couple of clicks,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
we can show that Lucy Osgood donated $12,000 with the books to Harvard University

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and her pituitary shoes quoted as saying there is a

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
greater need of intelligent readers, then writers.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And she was eminently one of them, as it turns out.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Let's go back for a second to Riddell's book from you come across a Japanese pavilion

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and a subsequent illustration of versions of illustration

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
from Riddell's book and then we see,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
we have inserted a lantern slide of the Japanese pavilion

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
from the Library of Congress and we have overlaid,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
the slide dissimulation video of the world fare from UCLA.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
ExtraMUROS never copies of source files for each piece of

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
media has automatic TrackBack to its original location

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and if you open a tab,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
you can go back into these locations.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I saw that we need to stop,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
we have quite a bit more than we are going to show you

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
but I think we will skip it.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Do you want to do another beat or two

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and we can take one question for you guys but that is okay.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Here, this is a showing,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
another way of visualizing data so you can see it on a

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
map and you can search by location,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
you can see it by what kinds of media are available in

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
that location. And right now,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
we decided to pull out images

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and audio of amusement parks. Here,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
we find a collection from the Revere Beach historical

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Society. For those of you that don't know,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
just like the Coney Island of Boston.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
We can just review audio files. Here,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
we are just seeing the ideal files,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
oral histories from the Beach historical society

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and this last bit, you have made it so you can seamlessly

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
incorporate Google Maps Street view

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and we are having talk about someone talking about what

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
used to be there while you are viewing current images

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and here is an example out of her mouth have audio.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
It is no longer visible, of course. In conclusion,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
what the project seeks to do is transform the public

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Library of America into a participatory public space for

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
users don't just search and retrieve records, but rather,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
engage in individual and collective acts of making and doing

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and our vision is of a world in which libraries encourage

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
all citizens to treat the cultural patrimony of humanity

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
as if it were their own, to learn from it, to make things with it,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
to share these things than engage in a lifelong

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
societywide process of learning. Thank you great

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Pretty extraordinary and exciting, you guys.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I'm going to suggest one question,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
curtly shy hugely encouraging to go to , Web.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
It's nice to have it explained.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It -- it's amazing to experience this.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
One person who would want to lob a question of these guys?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Yes, please.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Hello? How would you handle a service,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
any of the services that you are sort of linked to?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
May be becoming available

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
or something like that when you are very respectfully,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
don't copy any of the source ? It is for archives and all that,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I guess it's not that much of a challenge for someone

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
like you to, to submit for some weird reason.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
That's definitely a question.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
We've been building into see -- whoa. Lots of Mike phone.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
We've been building in chat mechanisms to see if the

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
source of the file changes.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And then to notify users to see if that file has changed within their project.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
The realities that we have this kind of supposition that somehow digital information is everlasting.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Where as we think that paper is just sort of the more

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
like thing that could go and die at some point.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Of course till information will die as well

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and this project doesn't suppose total preservation.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I think it suggests that we need to think creatively

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
about what forms and where we can build those

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and we're different sources and sites,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
what would it mean to archived these is?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
You don't archive all of Flickr, different licensing

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and forms of items that could contribute have a project,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
it that might be one week comes into the system but then

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
it's archive life might be one that's independent of Flickr itself.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
[Applause]
