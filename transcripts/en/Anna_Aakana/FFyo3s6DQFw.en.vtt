00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.527
So, you know how you'll get really excited
about starting a new project?

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:06.230
Whether it's writing a book,

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.020
or making a song on guitar,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.199
or completely reinventing yourself in the
space you're in?

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:12.830
But then as the days go by,

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.821
your enthusiasm fades..

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.230
and fades..

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.824
and fades..until it just shrivels up and
DIES and you completely forget about it.

00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:26.643
The first, most important, and hardest
part of leveling up, is DECIDING to.

00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:28.914
You have so much willpower.

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:33.051
We, as human beings, whenever we decide
we really want something,

00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:35.567
we go after it, and we make it happen.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:37.915
There's no such thing as
"I'm too busy for that."

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:41.730
It's just, "Mm, I don't think I want to
invest the time necessary to complete

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.877
that goal."

00:00:42.877 --> 00:00:45.751
Which brings me, to the 
two biggest hurdles standing between

00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:48.203
you and what you want to accomplish:

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:50.352
Total time mismanagement

00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:53.087
and not setting realistic goals.

00:00:53.087 --> 00:00:57.989
We throw SO MUCH time away just doing
absolutely nothing.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.007
And then we have these, these GRAND goals
and ideas and dreams

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:05.506
that seem so overwhelming, that we never
finish them, because we don't

00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:07.434
start off small.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:11.644
If you really want to get something done,
be honest with yourself.

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:12.882
So if you tell me,

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:15.750
"I'm gonna write for 2 hours today."

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.598
Are you REALLY gonna write for two hours?

00:01:17.598 --> 00:01:20.822
Is that something that you are ACTUALLY
able to do?

00:01:20.822 --> 00:01:21.796
No?

00:01:21.796 --> 00:01:26.582
How about an hour? How about 30 minutes?
How about 15 minutes?

00:01:26.582 --> 00:01:29.915
15 minutes of writing? I can do that.
Totally. Totally do-able.

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:34.237
So if you want to reach this fabled
"level 5," start managing your time

00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:37.761
and setting goals that you KNOW that
you can complete.

00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:41.230
I use an at-a-glance planner, it breaks
down the week PER HOUR,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.345
it's AMAZING, highly recommend it,
and whenever I cross something off

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:50.990
of my list, I reward myself with a cookie.
Or chocolate. Something sweet.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.599
Something delicious. That is--
That's all that's needed to get

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.353
something out of me. (chuckles)
So you know, start,

00:01:56.353 --> 00:02:00.249
start leveling up, because you totally
can. It's just a matter of deciding to,

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.854
and then going from there.
Okay?

00:02:02.854 --> 00:02:03.433
Good luck.

00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:06.453
I'll see you next week.
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:02:06.453 --> 00:02:07.033
