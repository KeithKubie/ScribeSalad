&gt;&gt; LELAND: Hi, my name is Leland, I’m one
of the user experiences Androids on Android.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.960
And one of the things I like about the Android
browser is it does a lot of things I could

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.730
do on my desktop browser. I want to show you
some of that. So one of the things I like

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.100
about the Android browsers is I could play
Youtube videos directly from WebPages. So

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.539
here I am on Google news, and I’m going
to click on a Youtube video and here we go.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.539
It goes right into the Youtube app...
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT] it’s full site of a lead

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.050
care on Wall Street...
&gt;&gt; LELAND: And I could watch my daily news

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.150
video.
&gt;&gt; At the federal government announced that

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.730
$85 billion bail out plan for the insurance
giant AIG...

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.160
&gt;&gt; LELAND: So another cool thing is I could
save photos right to my phone. So here’s

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.079
a photo that my friend posted. I want to save
it, so I’m just going to long press on the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.530
photo, click save image, and it’s going
to download. So, while I wait for it to download,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.370
just go, click, open it, and it goes right
into the photo gallery. So in the photo gallery,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.950
you could do whatever I want but, you know,
one thing I’d love is that, like right from

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:13.979
the photo gallery, I can go and save it right
as a wallpaper. There we go. And there it

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.020
is, pretty cool. So the last thing I’m going
to show you is downloading mp3s. One of the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.420
things I like to do is follow one of my favorite
radio shows, the host posts mp3s. So all I

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.840
have to do is download them right from his
website. And what happen is, I don't have

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:45.279
to wait and watch it download, I could just
go back and browse the rest of the page.
Now, so I notice that the download's done

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:49.099
because the notification part blinked. So
I’m just going to go to the notification

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:52.990
bar and see that download's complete. Just
click on the file...

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.240
&gt;&gt; LEHRER: Hi, this is Bryan Lehrer, you’re
listening to WMIC...

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.520
&gt;&gt; There you go, you could start listening
to my favorite radio show.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.229
&gt;&gt; LEHRER: Streaming an mp3 downloads available
when you want to listen in WMIC.org and iTunes.
