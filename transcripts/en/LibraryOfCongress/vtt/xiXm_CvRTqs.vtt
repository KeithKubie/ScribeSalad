SO, WELCOME OUR FIRST AUTHOR.

00:08:24.498 --> 00:08:25.993
MAGDA DE PENA TO COME UP AND 
READ HIS BOOK, "LAST STOP ON 

00:08:25.994 --> 00:08:28.241
MARKET STREET."   
OKAY.  HERE WE GO. 

00:08:28.242 --> 00:08:32.522
[ APPLAUSE ]
 &gt;&gt; HELLO, GUYS, HOW YOU DOING? 

00:08:32.523 --> 00:08:35.795
&gt;&gt; GREAT. 
&gt;&gt; I'M EXCITED TO READ TO YOU 

00:08:35.796 --> 00:08:37.796
FROM LAST STOP ON MARKET STREET.

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:49.872
CJ PUSHED THROUGH THE CHURCH 
DOORS AND SKIPPED DOWN THE 

00:08:49.873 --> 00:08:51.873
STEPS.

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:56.015
THE OUTSIDE AIR SMELLED LIKE 
FREEDOM, BUT IT ALSO SMELLED 

00:08:56.016 --> 00:08:58.016
LIKE RAIN, WHICH FRECKLED CJ'S 
SHIRT AND DRIPPED DOWN HIS NOSE.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.167
HE DUCKED UNDER HIS IN A IN A'S 
UMBRELLA SAYING, HOW COME WE GOT

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:06.168
TO WAIT 

00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:10.923
FOR THE BUS IN ALL OF THIS WET? 
TREES GET THIRSTY TOO, HIS IN A 

00:09:10.924 --> 00:09:12.964
IN A TOLD HIM? DON'T YOU SEE 
THAT BIG ONE DRINKING THROUGH A 

00:09:12.965 --> 00:09:14.965
STRAW?

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.450
CJ LOOKED FOR A LONG TIME, BUT 
NEVER SAW A STRAW.

00:09:19.737 --> 00:09:21.976
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE A 
LITTLE GUY, IF YOU CAN SEE THE 

00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:24.213
STRAW THAT THAT TREE IS DRINKING
FROM, THEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE 

00:09:24.214 --> 00:09:26.214
ENTIRE BOOK.

00:09:32.742 --> 00:09:35.399
BUT WE WON'T GET INTO THAT NOW. 
FROM THE BUS STOP, HE WATCHED 

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.265
WATER POOL ON FLOWER PETALS, 
WATCHED RAIN PATTER AGAINST THE 

00:09:40.266 --> 00:09:42.266
WINDSHIELD OF A NEARBY CAR.

00:09:44.128 --> 00:09:45.352
HIS FRIEND, COLBY CLIMBED IN, 
GAVE CJ A WAVE, AND DROVE OFF 

00:09:45.353 --> 00:09:47.353
WITH HIS DAD.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.640
IN A IN A, HOW COME WE DON'T 
HAVE A CAR?

00:09:59.393 --> 00:10:02.242
WHAT DO WE NEED A CAR FOR? WE 
HAVE A BUS THAT BREATHES FIRE 

00:10:02.243 --> 00:10:05.345
AND OLD MR. 
DENNIS WHO ALWAYS HAS A TRICK 

00:10:05.346 --> 00:10:07.346
FOR YOU. THE BUS CREEPED TO A 
STOP IN FRONT OF THEM.

00:10:14.736 --> 00:10:17.586
IT SIGHED AND SAGGED AND THE 
DOORS SWUNG OPEN. WHAT'S THAT I 

00:10:17.587 --> 00:10:19.587
SEE, MR. 
DENNIS ASKED?

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.490
HE PULLED A COIN FROM BEHIND 
C.J.

00:10:24.513 --> 00:10:26.614
'S EAR, PLACED IT IN HIS PALM. 
IN A IN A LAUGHED HER DEEP LAUGH

00:10:26.615 --> 00:10:28.615
AND PUSHED C.J. ALONG.

00:10:31.272 --> 00:10:32.909
THEY SAT RIGHT UP FRONT, WHICH, 
BY THE WAY, IS ONE OF THE MOST 

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.910
IMPORTANT LINES IN THE BOOK AND 
NOBODY REALLY TALKS ABOUT IT.

00:10:41.446 --> 00:10:43.872
THE MAN ACROSS THE WAY WAS 
TUNING A GUITAR. AN OLD WOMAN 

00:10:43.873 --> 00:10:45.873
WITH CURLERS HAD BUTTERFLIES IN 
A JAR.

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:51.410
IN A IN A GAVE EVERYONE A GREAT 
BIG SMILE AND A GOOD AFTERNOON. 

00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:53.411
SHE MADE SURE CJ DID THE SAME.

00:11:03.474 --> 00:11:04.689
THE BUS LURCHED FORWARD, 
STOPPED, LURCHED FORWARD, 

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.724
STOPPED. NANA HUMMED AS SHE 
KNIT.

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:12.618
HOW COME WE HAVE TO GO AFTER 
CHURCH, CJ SAID. MIGUEL AND 

00:11:12.619 --> 00:11:15.263
COLBY NEVER HAVE TO GO NOWHERE. 
I FEEL SORRY FOR THOSE BOYS, SHE

00:11:15.264 --> 00:11:17.916
TOLD HIM, THEY'LL NEVER GET A 
CHANCE TO BEAT 

00:11:20.967 --> 00:11:22.967
BOBO AND THE SUP GLASS MAN, AND 
I HEAR 

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.458
TRICKSY GOT HERSELF A BRAND NEW 
HAT. CJ STARED OUT THE WINDOW 

00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:28.459
FEELING SORRY FOR HIMSELF.

00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:32.340
HE WATCHED CARS ZIP BY ON EITHER
SIDE, WATCHED A GROUP OF BOYS 

00:11:32.341 --> 00:11:34.341
HOP CURBS ON BIKES.

00:11:41.903 --> 00:11:43.352
A MAN CLIMBED ABOARD WITH A 
SPOTTED DOG. CJ GAVE UP HIS 

00:11:43.353 --> 00:11:47.021
SEAT. HOW COME THAT MAN CAN'T 
SEE? BOY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT

00:11:47.022 --> 00:11:50.276
SEEING, HIS NANA TOLD HIM? SOME 
PEOPLE WATCH THE WORLD WITH 

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:52.277
THEIR EARS.  THAT'S A FACT.

00:11:55.165 --> 00:11:57.165
THEIR NOSES TOO, THE MAN SAID, 
SNIFFING AT THE AIR.

00:11:59.854 --> 00:12:01.854
SOME MIGHTY FINE PERFUME YOU'RE 
WEARING TODAY, MA'AM.

00:12:04.736 --> 00:12:07.001
NANA SQUEEZED THE MAN HAND AND 
LAUGHED HER DEEP LAUGH.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.511
TWO OLDER BOYS GOT ON NEXT. CJ 
WATCHED AS THEY MOVED ON BY, AND

00:12:12.512 --> 00:12:14.512
STOOD IN BACK.

00:12:16.809 --> 00:12:18.430
SURE WISH I HAD ONE OF THOSE, HE
SAID, AND IF YOU CAN'T SEE IN 

00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:21.484
THE BACK, THEY'RE LISTENING TO 
HEADPHONES, THEY PROBABLY HAVE 

00:12:21.485 --> 00:12:23.485
AN IPHONE OR AN iPOD.

00:12:26.785 --> 00:12:28.785
NANA SAT DOWN HER KNITTING.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:32.472
BY THE WAY, IF YOUR GRANDMOTHER 
SITS DOWN HER KNITTING, YOU KNOW

00:12:32.473 --> 00:12:36.526
YOU MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE.  WHAT 
FOR? YOU'VE GOT THE REAL LIVE 

00:12:36.527 --> 00:12:39.607
THING SITTING ACROSS FROM YOU. 
WHY DON'T YOU ASK THE MAN IF 

00:12:39.608 --> 00:12:44.509
HE'LL PLAY US A SONG. CJ DIDN'T 
HAVE TO. THE GUITAR PLAYER WAS 

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.510
ALREADY PLUCKING STRINGS AND 
BEGINNING TO SING.

00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:52.062
TO FEEL THE MAGIC OF MUSIC, THE 
BLIND MAN WHISPERED, I LIKE TO 

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:54.063
CLOSE MY EYES.

00:12:55.718 --> 00:12:57.718
NANA CLOSED HER'S TOO. SO DID CJ
AND THE SPOTTED DOG.

00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:10.804
THEN THE DARKNESS, THE RHYTHM 
LIFTED CJ OUT OF THE BUS, OUT OF

00:13:10.805 --> 00:13:16.097
THE BUSY CITY. HE SAW SUNSET 
COLORS SWIRLING OVER CRASHING 

00:13:16.098 --> 00:13:19.216
WAVES, SAW A FAMILY OF HAWKS 
SLICING THROUGH THE SKY. HE SAW 

00:13:19.217 --> 00:13:20.857
THE OLD WOMAN'S BUTTERFLIES 
DANCING FREE IN THE LIGHT OF THE

00:13:20.858 --> 00:13:22.858
MOON.

00:13:24.343 --> 00:13:26.979
CJ'S CHEST GREW FULL AND HE WAS 
LOST IN THE SOUNDS AND THE SOUND

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.980
GAVE HIM THE FEELING OF MAGIC.

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:39.155
THE SONG ENDED AND CJ OPENED HIS
EYES, EVERYONE ON THE BUS 

00:13:39.156 --> 00:13:42.222
CLAPPED. EVEN THE BOYS IN BACK. 

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:47.720
NANA GLANCED AT THE COIN IN CJ'S
PALM, CJ DROPPED IT IN THE MAN'S

00:13:47.721 --> 00:13:50.401
HAT. LAST STOP ON MARKET STREET,
MR. DENNIS CALLED.

00:14:01.649 --> 00:14:03.649
CJ LOOKED AROUND AS HE STEPPED 
OFF OF 

00:14:04.905 --> 00:14:06.905
THE BUS, CRUMBLING SIDEWALKS, 
BROKEN 

00:14:08.554 --> 00:14:11.202
DOWN DOORS, GRAFFITI TAGGED 
WINDOWS AND BOARDED UP STORES, 

00:14:11.203 --> 00:14:14.656
HE REACHED FOR HIS NANA'S HAND. 
HOW COME IT'S ALWAYS SO DIRTY 

00:14:14.657 --> 00:14:16.682
OVER HERE. SHE MILED AND POINTED
TO THE SKY, 

00:14:20.971 --> 00:14:23.610
SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU'RE 
SURROUNDED BY DIRT, CJ, YOU'RE A

00:14:23.611 --> 00:14:25.611
BETTER WITNESS FOR WHAT'S 
BEAUTIFUL.

00:14:28.317 --> 00:14:31.990
CJ SAW THE PERFECT RAINBOW 
ARCING OVER THEIR SOUP KITCHEN. 

00:14:31.991 --> 00:14:33.208
HE WONDERED HOW HIS NANA ALWAYS 
FOUND BEAUTIFUL WHERE HE NEVER 

00:14:33.209 --> 00:14:35.209
EVEN THOUGHT TO LOOK.

00:14:37.487 --> 00:14:39.748
HE LOOKED ALL AROUND THEM AGAIN 
AT THE BUS ROUNDING THE CORNER, 

00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:44.216
OUT OF SIGHT. AND THE BROKEN 
STREET LAMPS STILL LIT UP 

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:46.452
BRIGHT. AND THE STRAY SHADOWS 
MOVING ACROSS THE WALL.

00:14:51.742 --> 00:14:53.764
WHEN HE SPOTTED THEIR FAMILIAR 
FACES IN THE WINDOW, HE SAID, 

00:14:53.765 --> 00:14:55.765
I'M GLAD WE CAME.

00:15:02.937 --> 00:15:06.688
HE THOUGHT HIS NANA MIGHT LAUGH 
HER DEEP LAUGH, BUT SHE DIDN'T. 

00:15:06.689 --> 00:15:08.689
SHE PATTED HIM ON THE HEAD AND 
TOLD HIM, ME TOO, CJ.

00:15:11.553 --> 00:15:14.001
NOW, COME ON, AND THE LAST PAGE 
YOU SEE, CJ AND HIS GRANDMOTHER,

00:15:14.002 --> 00:15:16.645
THEY'RE AT THE SOUP KITCHEN, BUT
THEY'RE NOT THERE TO EAT, 

00:15:16.646 --> 00:15:18.646
THEY'RE THERE TO SERVE.

00:15:21.147 --> 00:15:23.147
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR 
LETTING ME READ TO YOU.

00:15:25.219 --> 00:15:27.219
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:15:33.761 --> 00:15:35.761

THINGS IN LIFE. AND IN GIVING, 

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:40.278
