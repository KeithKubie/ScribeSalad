00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.350
What do you attribute your longevity to and your enthusiasm too,

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:09.300
because you've always been a guy who loves fighting and you always been a guy

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.130
who,
I mean,
you've had that enthusiasm for a long time,

4
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:14.964
man.

5
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.180
<v 1>You know,
not a lot of things,
uh,
can capture my attention.
You know,</v>

6
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.480
like I can't just watch TV for example,
you know,

7
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.910
like a football game and sit through the whole thing.
You know,

8
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:25.040
I'm not trying to dis for about another,

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.980
I just don't have that attention span or basketball or baseball fighting can

10
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:29.431
just like,

11
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:34.170
I'm talking to you in a fight goes on and I'm just like almost get zoned out,

12
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:37.100
you know?
So it's always had my attention since the kids tends to be for,

13
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.200
I knew that I could make money off of it.
It just attracted me,
you know,

14
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.530
it's that primal instinct,
survival,
whatever it is,

15
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:46.530
is just hardwired deep into me,
you know?
And my longevity.

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.310
One thing I definitely attribute to his not taking steroids,
man.

17
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.270
Just being natural,
enjoying this ride,
the natural form,
you know,

18
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.740
not like pushing my body towards limits that I'm bench pressing 400 pounds when

19
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:00.960
my ligaments are weak.
Things like that,
you know.

20
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.480
And I also think God made me for this,
you know,

21
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.950
the way that I've been fighting my whole career.
You know,
I,

22
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:09.270
I have really good defense.
The last right,
it didn't show,

23
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.280
but I'm also like built hard man.
I walked out of the hood,
looked at,

24
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.213
got clipped

25
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.350
<v 0>one left hand in the initial ft Dick kicked him,
which is crazy.</v>

26
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.950
He came out,
that was the first fight I ever saw with a opening flying sidekick.

27
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.390
Dick kick.
Luke came to the balls.
Sorry.
Um,

28
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.330
but then he clipped you with was a perfect straight left,

29
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.990
but you survived on the ground.
You survived in the ground.
You covered up,

30
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:35.250
you showed great defense in the ground.

31
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:37.620
You got back to your feet and you kept it together.
You know,

32
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:39.150
and the combination that you hit him with,

33
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:41.880
you'd hit him with that combination a couple times.
You did.

34
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:44.940
Is that something you prepared for that when you were switching and then

35
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:46.530
throwing that left hand,
is that,

36
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.010
did you prepare in a way that was up on that bet?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me

37
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.843
<v 1>and my coach,</v>

38
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.510
he's the one that do like all the taking the guy that had been with forever,

39
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:57.540
Paulina and nuns,
I think the greatest striking coach ever.
He,
er,

40
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.600
he showed me like,
Hey,
let's do this,
you know?
Oh Man,

41
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:02.560
I don't want to do on new techniques.
Come on,
let's just do it.
You know?

42
00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:04.080
And then we started doing it,
doing it,
doing it.

43
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:07.080
And this was like a while ago and there's for this fight and I had stopped doing

44
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:09.780
it,
you know,
cause a lot of techniques,
we work on my lap when,
when this shooting,

45
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:11.340
when he brings me a technique to the table,

46
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.850
we're going to rip it out 100 times in a week and the next week the same thing

47
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:17.820
to elite fields that I got it.
And they'd be like,
all right,
cool.
It's,

48
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.340
it's there in the tool shed when we need it.
We'll Polish it up.

49
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.850
So for this fight,
he's like,
Hey,
remember that technique?
Let's,
let's bring it,

50
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:26.730
I think it'll work here.
And I go,
man,
but he's a southpaw.
He's like,

51
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:30.090
I'm telling you the way he's moving the ways you know,
fighting with you,

52
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:33.870
it's going to work.
So we started doing it and boom,
money.

53
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.470
You caught him with a couple of times before you put them away with it.
Right?

54
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.690
I not with that one,
with that same exact ones,
similar ones,
but I didn't,
uh,

55
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.580
I didn't go full south park to the blitz,
you know,
I did a other different ways,

56
00:02:47.581 --> 00:02:48.060
you know,

57
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.680
and I also caught him a lot with like overhand and left hook as he was coming
in,

58
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:55.230
especially in the second one.
I caught him I think maybe twice with that come.

59
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.680
Yeah man,
that's a big knockout.
That was a big knockout.
He's a,

60
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.560
he's an interesting guy because he's really too big for one 70.

61
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.610
He's so fucking tall.
But you are a guy who doesn't cut much weight at all.

62
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.660
Like how much weight do you cut for Sec?
Whoa.
By the time I get into shape,
shape,

63
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:15.340
I'm around hundred and 82 pounds,
180 pounds.
So fight week,

64
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.190
I get over there and I'm like eight pounds away.
Some,

65
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.190
some pounds away and not so light.
Yeah,
it's nice.

66
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.370
I don't cut anything at 55 if,

67
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.410
if everything went right when he used to fight 155 I got there at 174 pounds,

68
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:33.760
173 pounds,
5% body fat,
and the rest is just water.
Man,

69
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:37.330
it would fucking kill me.
So I always felt that was too big for 55 you know,

70
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.360
I love the cause and competition was sifted,

71
00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:42.520
but it was just getting harder and harder.
Once it took those Ibiza away,

72
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.500
forget it.
There was no way for me to make that weight.
