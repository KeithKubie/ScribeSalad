00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780
[Hank klibanoff] "I started the Isaiah Nixon case with no
records but, what appealed to me was that

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.630
it was a voting case a man who in 1948
had been killed because he voted. Isaiah

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.939
Nixon is shot
three times on September 8th 1948 and on

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.760
September 10th he dies. The family plans
a funeral and then the family very

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.869
quickly left town. It was gonna be a
while until they felt it was okay to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.579
come back and when the family came back
and they're looking for Isiah Nixon's

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.260
burial place, they can't find it."

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.750
"The reason I started the civil-rights
cold cases project I just thought it was

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.400
important to to go back and look at
these and so if by examining these cases

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.970
some measure of justice can be brought
then that's worthwhile." [Ellie Studdard] "I chose the cold

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.920
cases class originally partially because
of my American Studies major, it seemed

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.790
like a class that would be interesting
and I obviously had some requirements to

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.070
fill and I would not have predicted how
influential professor klebanov would be

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:47.159
in the rest of my life."

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.210
[Ellie] "So when we first got to the cemetery we
got out, we grabbed notebooks, we were not

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.679
recording at the time which luckily
enough, professor Klebanov's journalism

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.299
instincts kicked in and he turned on his
cell phone and so I was just sort of

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.289
wandering down rows so I would go down
one get to the edge go up to the next

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.470
come back. When I got to the edge of the
cemetery and was about to turn, and this

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.769
cemetery is in the middle of the woods
so the edge wasn't a clear-cut kind of

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.450
grassy area it was just as soon as you
hit the woods that was the end, and I was

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.670
about to turn when I looked down and saw
this corner of cement that had been

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.980
uncovered from leaves and mud and it had
a couple letters sticking out and I saw

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.549
ISA on the corner of cement
and just below it SEP and I thought

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:48.269
there's no way there's no way. So quietly
so that I wouldn't draw attention to

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.859
myself in case I was wrong I knelt down
to the corner with cement and began

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:58.980
brushing off leaves and then scraping
away mud when I saw Isaiah and then when

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.269
I saw Nixon and when it said September
10th, it felt absolutely surreal the

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.040
whole moment is a little blurry a little
bit hazy because all of a sudden I just

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.370
knew I just knew that this was it and
that something we had never expected was

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.959
real. And there is an audio recording of
me saying I found it which to this day I

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.329
have no memory of saying without even
thinking I got up and I went over to

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.440
find the rest of our group."

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:41.960
(Ellie and Hank) "I found a thing that says Isaiah Nixon." "says what?" "Isaiah Nixon yea it was covered in mud"

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.139
"there is an Isaiah Nixon?" "yeah that's
what I was... because I saw something thats said Isaiah

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:51.140
so I uncovered the date it says
September 10th 1948" "Wow"

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.900
"there's a big smooth block it was like at the edge of the woods."

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:25.510
Because I noticed that all these slabs had this hand written in it so when i saw Isaiah i thought (unintelligible) ... but all
of this was covered in mud and roots

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.840
(crunching leaves) yeah it says father on the top but over
there they were like all handwritten

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:47.370
when they were on 1930,  so I
figured it could be..." "oh my god Ellie" and (unintelligible)

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:57.380
"Yes, this is April and that
says 1920, which is his birthdate"

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.860
[Hank klibanoff] "talking to her and saying I think we've
made a discovery you know then I tell

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.289
her what it is and she says "oh my goodness!"
pretty soon and I have her on FaceTime

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.270
I'm just holding up the camera and
showing her her father's... her father's

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:33.160
burial place that had eluded them for 67
years and her final words that day were

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.440
"I hope you're gonna give those students
an A"

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:01.240
[Dorothy] "it was just that close... golly."

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:30.980
[Dorothy] "September 10th...

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.240
(Crying)

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:08.689
[Dorothy] "When you first called me, I had a lot
still had a lot of anger and I think I

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:16.969
told you all I did, but after talking to
your group some of that was released and

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:24.409
I want to let you know now,  the anger
is completely released and thank you all

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:32.900
for that and so forth. I can just resolve
this it's been settled and then looking

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.210
at this it's just unreal."

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:53.599
"I can't say anymore except all that is
coming in my mind is thank you thank you

00:07:53.599 --> 00:08:01.569
thank you that's all I can think of
right now. Beautiful group my goodness

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:05.480
you have to invite me to your wedding."

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.560
[Ellie] "So
after we left the grave that fateful day,

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:18.280
we have stayed in touch she added me on
Facebook and it feels kind of like I've

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:24.110
got another mom on there watching me and
whenever I have a new update on the case

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:29.930
I like to make sure she knows just that
we're not letting it go yet and that we

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.459
aren't gonna forget Isiah Nixon just
because we found his grave, just because

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:37.399
it happened two years ago, and that it's
something that really changed my life

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:42.280
and I always feel like she should be a
part of that".
