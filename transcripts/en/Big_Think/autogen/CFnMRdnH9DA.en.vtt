00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.669
 
I think there's a possibility that the

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:11.679
I think there's a possibility that the
 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.830
I think there's a possibility that the
economic downturn will lead us to think

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840
economic downturn will lead us to think
 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.810
economic downturn will lead us to think
again about our values in general

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820
again about our values in general
 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.060
again about our values in general
including our views about poverty on the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070
including our views about poverty on the
 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.130
including our views about poverty on the
one hand and also of course our views

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140
one hand and also of course our views
 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.859
one hand and also of course our views
about consumption so I hope that will

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869
about consumption so I hope that will
 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.229
about consumption so I hope that will
happen I couldn't really say that I'm

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:25.239
happen I couldn't really say that I'm
 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.240
happen I couldn't really say that I'm
highly confident that it will happen

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250
highly confident that it will happen
 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.700
highly confident that it will happen
because you know once assumed once once

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710
because you know once assumed once once
 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.229
because you know once assumed once once
the downturn is over and the economy

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239
the downturn is over and the economy
 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.780
the downturn is over and the economy
picks up again you can't be sure that a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790
picks up again you can't be sure that a
 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.009
picks up again you can't be sure that a
bit of that old acquisitiveness and

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019
bit of that old acquisitiveness and
 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.630
bit of that old acquisitiveness and
competitiveness won't kick in

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640
 
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.760
 
so the most important is that you make a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
so the most important is that you make a
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.950
so the most important is that you make a
commitment to share some of your income

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
commitment to share some of your income
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.630
commitment to share some of your income
with the world's poorest people and I

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640
with the world's poorest people and I
 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.150
with the world's poorest people and I
suggest a scale as your income increases

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
suggest a scale as your income increases
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.490
suggest a scale as your income increases
as to how much you might share that

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500
as to how much you might share that
 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.530
as to how much you might share that
scale is in the book it's also on my

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540
scale is in the book it's also on my
 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.920
scale is in the book it's also on my
website the life you can save calm and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930
website the life you can save calm and
 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.630
website the life you can save calm and
you can go to the life you can save calm

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640
you can go to the life you can save calm
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.930
you can go to the life you can save calm
and see the scale and then pledge to do

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940
and see the scale and then pledge to do
 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.399
and see the scale and then pledge to do
that pledge to give the percentage

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
that pledge to give the percentage
 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.779
that pledge to give the percentage
that's appropriate to your income and so

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789
that's appropriate to your income and so
 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.430
that's appropriate to your income and so
that's two steps of the seven-point plan

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440
that's two steps of the seven-point plan
 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.190
that's two steps of the seven-point plan
making the pledge and then and doing it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
making the pledge and then and doing it
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.350
making the pledge and then and doing it
publicly because I think it's important

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
publicly because I think it's important
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.469
publicly because I think it's important
that people should talk about this

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
that people should talk about this
 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.389
that people should talk about this
should do it publicly so that the idea

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399
should do it publicly so that the idea
 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.609
should do it publicly so that the idea
spreads and more people can see that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
spreads and more people can see that
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.950
spreads and more people can see that
other people are giving because then you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
other people are giving because then you
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960
other people are giving because then you
get this virtuous spiral going on you

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970
get this virtuous spiral going on you
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.969
get this virtuous spiral going on you
get more people giving because they can

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
get more people giving because they can
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.410
get more people giving because they can
see that others are doing it and so it's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
see that others are doing it and so it's
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.240
see that others are doing it and so it's
easier for them to give psychologically

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
easier for them to give psychologically
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.639
easier for them to give psychologically
and so then you get still more giving

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
and so then you get still more giving
 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.830
and so then you get still more giving
and then it gets still easier for others

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
and then it gets still easier for others
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.499
and then it gets still easier for others
to give so those are a couple of the the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
to give so those are a couple of the the
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.719
to give so those are a couple of the the
steps and I also suggest that people

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
steps and I also suggest that people
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.940
steps and I also suggest that people
become politically active citizens and

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
become politically active citizens and
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.920
become politically active citizens and
contact their elected representatives

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
contact their elected representatives
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.789
contact their elected representatives
about such things as trade policies that

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
about such things as trade policies that
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.609
about such things as trade policies that
are harmful to the poor and developing

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
are harmful to the poor and developing
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.120
are harmful to the poor and developing
nations so there's there's I think a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
nations so there's there's I think a
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.270
nations so there's there's I think a
whole lot of things that active citizens

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280
whole lot of things that active citizens
 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.660
whole lot of things that active citizens
should be doing to try to get some sense

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
should be doing to try to get some sense
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.330
should be doing to try to get some sense
of urgency about the fact that there are

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340
of urgency about the fact that there are
 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.190
of urgency about the fact that there are
10 million children dying every year

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
10 million children dying every year
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.300
10 million children dying every year
from poverty related causes and that we

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310
from poverty related causes and that we
 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.940
from poverty related causes and that we
could prevent that
