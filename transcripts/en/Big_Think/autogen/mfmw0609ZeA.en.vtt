what are they doing now we think of
 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.729
what are they doing now we think of
copying we think of the kind of

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739
copying we think of the kind of
 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.490
copying we think of the kind of
mechanical process but actually they're

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500
mechanical process but actually they're
 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.920
mechanical process but actually they're
trying to internalize the greatness of

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930

it's not of mechanical process an
organic process you know they're taking

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
organic process you know they're taking
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.869
organic process you know they're taking
in this influence ultimately they want

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879
in this influence ultimately they want
 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.300

well that is really very strange right

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799
well that is really very strange right
 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.830
well that is really very strange right
so I think that when we look at these

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840
so I think that when we look at these
 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.500
so I think that when we look at these
ideas we see a very big foundational

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510
ideas we see a very big foundational
 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.159
ideas we see a very big foundational
split between the two cultures and if

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169
split between the two cultures and if
 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.009
split between the two cultures and if
you know I really copying is only one of

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019
you know I really copying is only one of
 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.520
you know I really copying is only one of
the many areas where you see very

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530
the many areas where you see very
 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.220
the many areas where you see very
divergent ideas

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230
 
 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.470
