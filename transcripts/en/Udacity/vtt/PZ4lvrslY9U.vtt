00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.020
Then mention new content.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.650
And you've learned how
to publish your apps.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.570
But you may be wondering,
what should I learn next?

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.550
At this point, you're prepared to
take most of our Android courses.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.540
But I want to draw your
attention to two in particular.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.270
Our Gradle course, Gradle for Android
and Java, is a great look at the build

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.380
system we've been using
alongside Android Studio.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.430
In that class, you learn the magic
behind the Android build process.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.110
And customize your build by creating
multiple app flavors, incorporating

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.660
external libraries and tools, and
adding units and integration tests.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.530
The other course you're now ready for,
is our performance course,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.590
featuring a lot more cult.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.640
Performance is vital if you want to make
that move smoothly on older devices.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.330
And get a more global audience for
your app.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.260
I've added links to each class in
the instructor notes below the video.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.220
Take some time to build the final
project for this class first.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.720
And then choose a direction.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.130
We can't wait to see what you'll build.
