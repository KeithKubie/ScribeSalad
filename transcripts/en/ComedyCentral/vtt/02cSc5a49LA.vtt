Here's your coffee.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.444 align:start position:0%
Hey, man, I just have
to say, I am a huge fan.

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.613 align:start position:0%
Outkast, like,
changed my life.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:14.847
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks, man.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.719 align:start position:0%
So are you gonna collaborate
with André 3000 again?

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.220
Nah.

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:23.356 align:start position:0%
How come?

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:25.458 align:start size:56% position:44%
People grow apart.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.534
Greetings.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.703
May I have a half-caff
decaf mint mocha latte,

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.572
foam on the bottom,
served in a flower vase,

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.007
and if y'all got
some green food coloring

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.708
back there, throw it in.

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:43.976 align:start position:0%
André 3000!

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.977
In the flesh.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.412 size:88% position:44%
Big Boi is right over there.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.915 align:start position:0%
- [gasping dramatically]
- Big Boi!

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.516 align:end position:100%
Bitch, I'm trying
to read a book.

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:52.852
Big Boi!

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:56.355 align:start position:0%
What's up, my brother
from another mother, man?

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:58.458
Hey, when I say mother, you know
I'm talking about art, right,

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.560 align:end position:100%
'cause we got cut out of
her womb linked together.

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:03.329
What's up, man?
What's up, André?

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:05.798 align:start size:31% position:69%
André who?

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.366 size:81% position:41%
I ain't gonna say it, man.

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.370 align:start size:47% position:53%
It's not 2,999.

00:01:11.403 --> 00:01:13.673
It's not 3,001.
- André 3000.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.575 align:end position:100%
Hey, man, what happened
to you after the show?

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:17.577
Yeah, um.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.379
I just--I must have, like, snuck
out or something like that.

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:24.317 align:end position:100%
[in English accent]
I thought perchance
you went missing.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.818 size:78% position:39%
Don't do the voices, man.

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:27.086 size:84% position:58%
Do what voice, my dear boy?

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.855 align:start position:0%
Why do you--why do you
got to do the voices, man?

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.857 size:78% position:39%
Why you doing the voices?
Why you doing that, man?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.826 size:75% position:38%
One green half-caff half
decaf mint mocha latte,

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.628 align:start position:0%
foam on the bottom,
in a vase?

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:37.630 align:end position:100%
I got a new idea
for a album, man.

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:40.333 align:end position:100%
It's gonna be just the sound
of screeching metal,

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.136 align:end position:100%
and then only one
spoken word per track.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.137
- Cool, cool.
- Yeah.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.609 align:start size:69% position:31%
[high pitched squeals]

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.210 align:end position:100%
That's my new screeching
metal sounds

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.345 align:end position:100%
I was talking about
earlier, man.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:55.047
One green half-caff half
decaf mint mocha latte,

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.217
foam on the bottom,
in a vase or "vahz."

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.452
You ain't hear?

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:00.653
That--that's your--
nig--that's--

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.655
you the only nigga
that ever order that drink.

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:04.590 align:end position:100%
Yeah, okay, so what
is going on with me?

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:05.591 align:start size:81% position:19%
What is happening with me?

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:09.328 align:start position:0%
Man, what the fuck
happened, man?

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:11.898
- What are you talking about?
- We used to be somebody, man.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:12.999
We used to be a team.

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:14.700
We was on top.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:18.138 align:start position:0%
Then you went
and lost your fucking mind.

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:26.679 size:84% position:42%
Can we just lose this, man?

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:30.249 align:start position:0%
Can we just lose the 3000
and just have you talk as André?

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
Tell me--tell me straight up,
man, what happened?

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:38.958 align:end position:100%
You know what be even
better, though, man?

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:41.027 align:end position:100%
Is if you looked into the
pinwheel with your third eye.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.895 size:84% position:42%
I thought you was gonna say
some stupid shit like that.

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:44.363 align:end position:100%
And everything
will be revealed.

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:45.965 align:start position:0%
All right, man.
It's been good, man, thank you.

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:47.767
- Thanks for coming by, man.
- Okay, yeah.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.435 align:end position:100%
Matter of fact, I got
an appointment right now

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:50.670 size:88% position:56%
to go get fitted for a toga.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:53.239
- You got--you got to go.
- Mm-hmm.

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:56.109 align:end position:100%
You leaving me.
That's a...

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:03.282 align:start size:38% position:63%
Don't do it.

00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:09.322 align:start position:0%
May Eros, Artemis,
and Apollo

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.691 align:start position:0%
guide you through
your musical journey.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:16.028 align:start size:38% position:63%
Nigga, what?

00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:20.533 align:end position:100%
Why does your breath smell
like birdseed?

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:26.639
- Au revoir.
- All right.

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:28.908
Thank you, café craftsman.

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:30.309 align:start position:0%
