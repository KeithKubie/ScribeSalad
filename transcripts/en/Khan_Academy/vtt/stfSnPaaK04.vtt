00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.340
It's a common misconception
that price levels

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.412
are dictated purely by the
quantity of money out there.

00:00:06.412 --> 00:00:07.870
And to see why this
isn't the case,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.060
let's imagine an island
that has two players in it.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.460
So it has a farmer, who
obviously will produce food,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.730
and it also has a-- let's call
him a landlord-- landlord slash

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.830
builder, who will either
rent out buildings

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.740
or can build you more
buildings or build themselves

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.560
more buildings to rent out.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.640
And we're living in a
reality where all you need

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.570
is food and shelter.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.520
And let's imagine
one reality where

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.610
this island, this country,
whatever you want to call it,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.470
they haven't discovered
a lot of currency.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.640
So they only have a
little bit of gold.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.010
So maybe the farmer only
has a couple of gold coins

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.170
to start off with, and
the landlord slash builder

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.390
also only has a couple of
gold coins to start off with.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.320
They're very currency poor,
only a little bit of gold.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.669
But they're very optimistic.

00:00:57.669 --> 00:01:00.210
The farmer says, hey, you know
what, things are looking good,

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.010
landlord.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.790
I want to rent a nice building
from you for my family,

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.830
and for you to build
more buildings.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.890
So here, take both
of these coins

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.220
and build me or rent
me out something nice.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.830
And he gets both
coins over here.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.240
And then the landlord
says, wow, things are good.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.280
The farmer seems
pretty optimistic.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.270
Farmer, I want you to grow
me a ton of really good food,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.270
because things are good.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.900
So here, take four coins from
me and really grow me a ton

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.970
of really nice food, the stuff
that's really hard to grow.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.990
So grow a ton of food for me.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.780
So he gets those four coins now.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.810
These are now gone.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.970
The farmer doesn't
have those anymore.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.027
Now the farmer's feeling really
great, really optimistic.

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:52.860
And then, of course,
these are now gone now.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.810
The landlord has given
them to the farmer.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.435
The farmer's feeling
really optimistic.

00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:57.990
He says, landlord,
you know what,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.310
I'm feel even better
than I did before.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.710
Why don't you build me
even a few more buildings.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.955
I want to expand
my house even more.

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:06.330
But now the
landlord's like, man,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.039
you've already given
me a lot of money,

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.800
and I already have
a lot of work to do.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.300
You've got to pay me more if
you want me to work overtime,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.883
because that's going
to take time away

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:15.620
from my family and all the rest.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.370
And the farmer says, sure.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.070
Last time I paid you two gold
coins for some buildings.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.860
I'll now pay you
three gold coins

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.150
for the same number
of buildings.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.502
And so he gives
three gold coins.

00:02:29.502 --> 00:02:30.960
And all he's going
to get in return

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.870
is what he used to get
for two gold coins.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.328
So if you think
about it, the price

00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:38.080
has gone up for whatever
service or product the builder

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.900
is providing.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.040
And then he gives
those three gold coins

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.090
to the landlord and the builder.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.174
And then the builder says,
things are really good.

00:02:45.174 --> 00:02:47.090
I'm getting a lot of
business from the farmer.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.814
I can get even more
food from the farmer.

00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:50.480
And he goes to the
farmer and says, hey,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.430
give me what you just gave
me that last time for two

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.020
gold coins.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.560
The farmer says,
no, you know what?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.880
I'm really busy now.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.840
I'm almost tapped out.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.267
If you want me to work overtime
or expand my facilities,

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.850
you've got to give me three gold
coins for what I gave before.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.370
And besides that, the
cost of buying houses

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.154
has just gone up to
three gold coins,

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:09.070
so you've got to give
me three gold coins now.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.486
And so the builder
says, oh, sure,

00:03:10.486 --> 00:03:11.940
I'll give you three gold coins.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.100
So the one thing I want
you to notice in this video

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.220
is we only started off with
two gold coins for each

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.134
of these players.

00:03:18.134 --> 00:03:20.300
But because they were really
confident, because they

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.675
kept spending it
with each other,

00:03:21.675 --> 00:03:23.500
because there were a
lot of transactions,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.840
there was a high velocity
of the actual money

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.196
that you actually had
an increase in prices.
