00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.100
We covered the idea of vector
length many, many videos ago.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.780
And I realize that I forgot to
cover an important topic.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.580
This topic's going to be useful
when we do some types

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.010
of transformation -- actually,
the projections that I'll do

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.300
in the next video.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.850
The notion that I forgot
to do is the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.650
notion of a unit vector.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:32.176
And all this is, is a vector
that has a length of 1.

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:35.830
Has length and we've
defined length.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.610
It has a length of 1.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.020
So if something is a unit
vector, let's say that u here

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.040
is a unit vector, and
it's a member of Rn.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.560
Then that means that if we have
u, u looks like this, has

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.920
n components, u2 all
the way to un.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.160
We know what the length
of this is, right?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.070
We know that the length of u,
sometimes called the norm of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.200
u, it's just equal to the square
root of the squared

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.950
sums of all of its components.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.570
And if you think about it, this
is just an extension of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.830
the Pythagorean theorem,
to some degree.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.560
So it's u1 squared plus
u2 squared all

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.250
the way to un squared.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.780
And it's the square
root of that.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.250
If this is a unit vector, if
this is a unit vector, so this

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.780
is a unit vector, that implies
that the length of u will be

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.310
equal to 1.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.430
And that doesn't matter in what
dimension space we are.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.670
This could be R100
this could be R2.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.710
For it to have a unit vector in
any of those spaces, their

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.070
length is 1.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.810
The next obvious question
is, how do you

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.710
construct a unit vector?

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.300
Let's say that I have
some vector, v.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.030
And let's say it's not
a unit vector.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.050
It's v1 v2 all the way to vn.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.360
And I want to turn it into some
vector u that is a unit

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.020
vector, that just goes in
the same direction.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:24.520
So u will go in the same
direction, as v, but the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.130
length of u is going
to be equal to 1.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.710
How do I construct this
vector u here?

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.450
What I could do is, I could
take the length of v.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.680
I could find out what the length
of v is, and we know

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.270
how to do that.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.000
We just apply this definition
of vector length.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.130
And what happens if I figure out
the length of v, and then

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.610
I multiply the vector
v times that?

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.720
What if I make my u, what if I
say u is equal to, 1 over the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.210
length of v times v itself?

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.160
What happens here?

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.350
If I take the length
of this thing right

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.970
here, what do I get?

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.580
The length of u is equal to
the length of this scalar.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.740
Remember this is just
some number, right?

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.070
It's equal to this scalar,
and I'm assuming v

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.210
is a non-zero vector.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.130
The length of whatever this
scalar number is times v.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.870
And we know that we can take
this scalar out of the

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.860
formula, we can show that --
I think I've shown it in a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.730
previous video -- that the
length of c times v is equal

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.300
to c times the length of v.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.630
Let me write that down.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.520
And that's essentially what
I'm assuming right here.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.030
That if I take the length of c
times some vector, v, that is

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.990
equal to c times the
length of v.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.970
I think we showed this when we
first were introduced to the

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.940
idea of length.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.390
So we know that this is going
to be equal to 1 over the

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.360
length of vector v -- that's my
c -- times, so this thing

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.270
right here is that thing right
there, times this thing, times

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.710
the length of vector v.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.000
Well what's this going
to be equal to?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.800
1 over something times
that something.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.360
Well this is just going
to be equal to 1.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.790
So that's all a unit
vector is.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.180
If you want to find a unit
vector -- or sometimes it's

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:32.150
called a normalized vector
-- that goes in the same

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.600
direction as some vector v, you
just figure out the length

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.600
of v using the definition
of vector length in Rn.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.370
And then multiply 1 over that
length times the vector v --

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.220
and this is just a scalar
-- and then you

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.800
get your vector u.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.860
Let me to do an example, just to
make sure you get the idea.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.970
Let's say I have some vector
v and it's in R3.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.380
Let's say it's 1, 2, minus 1.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.900
What is the length of v?

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.000
The length of v is equal to the
square root of 1 squared

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.490
plus 2 squared plus minus 1
squared, and that is equal to

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.070
the square root of 1 plus 1 plus
4 -- square root of 6.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.540
So that is the length of v.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.800
If I want to construct a
normalized vector u that goes

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.130
in the same direction as v, I
can just define my vector u as

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.160
being equal to 1 over the length
of v -- 1 over the

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.130
square root of 6 -- times v.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.460
So times 1, 2, minus 1.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.020
Which is equal to 1 over square
root of 6, 2 over

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.620
square root of 6, and minus 1
over the square root of 6.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.970
And I'll leave it for you to
verify that the length of u is

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.570
going to be equal to 1.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.420
I'll just throw out one
other idea here that

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.620
you'll often see.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.270
When something is a unit vector,
instead of using this

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.280
little arrow on top of the
vector, they'll often write a

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.210
unit vector with a little hat
on top of it, like that.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.010
That signifies that we're
dealing with a unit vector.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.990
And for those of you've taken
your vector calculus, or have

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.490
done a little bit of
engineering, you're probably

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:28.100
familiar with the vectors
i, j, and k.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.450
And the reason why they have
this little hat here is

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.060
because these are all
unit vectors in R3.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.480
They're members of R3 and
they're all unit vectors.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.720
These are actually the
basis vectors in R3.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.410
And for those of you who
have been watching my

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.940
transformation videos, these are
equivalent to the vectors

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.850
e1 -- which I could write
with a hat on it,

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.320
really -- e2, and e3.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.570
Which are the standard
basis vectors in R3.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.930
Now that you've been exposed to
it, now I can start to use

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.150
the idea of a unit vector
in future videos.
