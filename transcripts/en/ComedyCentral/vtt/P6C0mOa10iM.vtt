00:00:03.068 --> 00:00:05.004
(angry crowd shouting)

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.374
(jazz music)

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:10.243
(intense music)

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.578
- Help, help me.

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:13.546
- Do you have an appointment?

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.180
- No, it's an emergency.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.717
Okay, I just returned from space

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:21.888
and some alien, some thing,
put this monster inside me!

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.089
(man grunting)

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.557
And it's clawing out of my body.

00:00:25.557 --> 00:00:27.193
I need you to get it out of me!

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.628
(intense music stops)

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.596 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Here's a pamphlet which
reviews your options.

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:32.365
- Fuck options, okay?

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.066
Here, I have insurance.

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.435 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm sorry, the state
does not allow us

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.969
to accept insurance.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.038
We wouldn't want to infringe
on anyone's religious freedom.

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.473
(grunts)

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:41.908 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'll pay in cash, I'll
sign whatever you want, okay?

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:44.077
Just tear this out of me!

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.078
(screams)

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:46.746
(intense music)

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.414 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Brad, studies
show that the life

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.449
growing inside you
now, at 20 weeks,

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.451
has the ability to feel pain.

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.753
Have you considered adoption?

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:56.589 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Listen, this thing
was put inside me

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.823
against my will.

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:59.158 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well, the law
treats you the same.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.960
Have you considered
the life choices

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.763
that you made that put
you in this position?

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.064
- Ah.

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:05.899
- Brad?

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.304 align:start size:97% position:3%
(heart rate monitor beeping)
(dramatic music)

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:12.805
- Alright.

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:13.640
We got it.

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:16.109
- Ah, oh my.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:18.811
Thank God.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.746
(laughs)

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:22.615
- We got the sonogram.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:23.616
Take a look.

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:27.519
See the state law requires
us to make you stare at that,

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:28.954 align:start size:84% position:16%
before we can conduct
the procedure.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.624
- No, it's still inside me!

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:33.792 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Wow, listen to that
heartbeat go, it's a miracle.

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:36.696 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Fine, fine, I
want the procedure!

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:38.164
- Huh.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:40.666 align:start position:0%
72 hour waiting period, not
including weekends and holidays,

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.802
just to give ya some
time to think it over.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:43.802
- Oh!

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:46.305
Fuck man, why can't you let me

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:49.976
make my own decisions
about my fucking body?

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:52.512
- Sorry.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.479
State law.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.481
I'm gonna see you next Tuesday.

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:57.450 align:start size:84% position:16%
Hey Tammy, we still
on for drinks?

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.986
(crowd shouting)

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:01.321
- Oh, fuck this.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.793
Fuck man.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:08.061
(intense orchestral)

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.729
(Brad screaming)

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.365
(squealing)

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.034
(crowd screams)

00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:18.571
Get this fucking thing outta me!

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.207
(creature squeals)

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:22.174
(woman screams)

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:23.910
(crowd screaming)

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.744
(creature squealing)

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:25.578
(man screams)

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.648
(creature squeals)

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.149
- Once that sucker
hits the ground,

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:31.684
my Second Amendment rights trump

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.152
that whole pro-life thing!

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:35.188
God bless America!

00:02:35.188 --> 00:02:36.021
(gun fire)

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:38.358
(theatrical music)
