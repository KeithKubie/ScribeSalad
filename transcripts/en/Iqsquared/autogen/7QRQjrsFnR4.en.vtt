and we need to figure out how to deal
 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.820
and we need to figure out how to deal
with that properly without becoming

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.940
with that properly without becoming
bitter and cruel and resentful and these

to your question zone progressivism we

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:14.230
and and cultural effects on anything
 

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.960
and and cultural effects on anything
that's complex and that's certainly the

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:15.970
that's complex and that's certainly the
 

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.210
that's complex and that's certainly the
case and differentiating what those are

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:18.220
case and differentiating what those are
 

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.370
case and differentiating what those are
is a very difficult thing to do but the

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:20.380
is a very difficult thing to do but the
 

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.810
is a very difficult thing to do but the
psychometric work on that has already

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:21.820
psychometric work on that has already
 

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.539
psychometric work on that has already
been done and done well and when I what

00:21:24.539 --> 00:21:24.549
been done and done well and when I what
 

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:26.010
been done and done well and when I what
do you mean that a second metric look I

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:26.020
do you mean that a second metric look I
 

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.710
do you mean that a second metric look I
mean psychologists in particular have

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720
mean psychologists in particular have
 

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.980
mean psychologists in particular have
spent 40 years sorting out an

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:31.990
spent 40 years sorting out an
 

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.610
spent 40 years sorting out an
empirically derived model of personality

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:35.620
empirically derived model of personality
 

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.440
empirically derived model of personality
that's the Big Five model which is well

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:37.450
that's the Big Five model which is well
 

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.659
that's the Big Five model which is well
accepted among personality psychologists

00:21:39.659 --> 00:21:39.669
accepted among personality psychologists
 

00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:41.850
accepted among personality psychologists
in the mainstream most of who lean left

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:41.860
in the mainstream most of who lean left
 

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.740
in the mainstream most of who lean left
by the way by an overwhelming majority

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:43.750
by the way by an overwhelming majority
 

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.419
by the way by an overwhelming majority
so there's no right that might be five

00:21:47.419 --> 00:21:47.429
so there's no right that might be five
 

00:21:47.429 --> 00:21:49.919
so there's no right that might be five
yeah but it's but one of the things

00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:49.929
yeah but it's but one of the things
 

00:21:49.929 --> 00:21:51.720
yeah but it's but one of the things
that's interesting about the taxonomy is

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:51.730
that's interesting about the taxonomy is
 

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.700
that's interesting about the taxonomy is
that it was a theoretically derived it's

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:53.710
that it was a theoretically derived it's
 

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.409
that it was a theoretically derived it's
purely a consequence of statistical

00:21:55.409 --> 00:21:55.419
purely a consequence of statistical
 

00:21:55.419 --> 00:21:58.019
purely a consequence of statistical
analysis and so I'm not sure where

00:21:58.019 --> 00:21:58.029
analysis and so I'm not sure where
 

00:21:58.029 --> 00:22:00.659
analysis and so I'm not sure where
that's taking us so well how far gender

00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:00.669
that's taking us so well how far gender
 

00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:04.350
that's taking us so well how far gender
is socially constructed okay so for the

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.360
is socially constructed okay so for the
 

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.299
is socially constructed okay so for the
first thing to do is to figure out what

00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:06.309
first thing to do is to figure out what
 

00:22:06.309 --> 00:22:08.070
first thing to do is to figure out what
the parameters are when you talk about

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080
the parameters are when you talk about
 

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.289
the parameters are when you talk about
something like gender so the parameters

00:22:10.289 --> 00:22:10.299
something like gender so the parameters
 

00:22:10.299 --> 00:22:11.820
something like gender so the parameters
are say parameters of temperament

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:11.830
are say parameters of temperament
 

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.260
are say parameters of temperament
because you said well we're not going to

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:13.270
because you said well we're not going to
 

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.159
because you said well we're not going to
talk about by all

00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:14.169
talk about by all
 

00:22:14.169 --> 00:22:15.509
talk about by all
we're going to talk about what's derived

00:22:15.509 --> 00:22:15.519
we're going to talk about what's derived
 

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:17.249
we're going to talk about what's derived
from that so we might say temperament

00:22:17.249 --> 00:22:17.259
from that so we might say temperament
 

00:22:17.259 --> 00:22:18.840
from that so we might say temperament
okay so we know the temporary mental

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:18.850
okay so we know the temporary mental
 

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:20.460
okay so we know the temporary mental
dimensions we know that they differ

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:20.470
dimensions we know that they differ
 

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:21.989
dimensions we know that they differ
between men and women and they differ

00:22:21.989 --> 00:22:21.999
between men and women and they differ
 

00:22:21.999 --> 00:22:24.210
between men and women and they differ
cross-culturally but more importantly

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:24.220
cross-culturally but more importantly
 

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.190
cross-culturally but more importantly
this is the crucial distinction well we

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200
this is the crucial distinction well we
 

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.269
this is the crucial distinction well we
don't know because I mean I'm just

00:22:27.269 --> 00:22:27.279
don't know because I mean I'm just
 

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:30.749
don't know because I mean I'm just
looking at a piece of recent research on

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:30.759
looking at a piece of recent research on
 

00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:32.279
looking at a piece of recent research on
the brain which concludes the Ranaut's

00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:32.289
the brain which concludes the Ranaut's
 

00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:34.590
the brain which concludes the Ranaut's
two types of brain in there are there

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600
two types of brain in there are there
 

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.139
two types of brain in there are there
are others who did the research it's the

00:22:37.139 --> 00:22:37.149
are others who did the research it's the
 

00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:38.789
are others who did the research it's the
new scientists construe there's no such

00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799
new scientists construe there's no such
 

00:22:38.799 --> 00:22:40.560
new scientists construe there's no such
thing as the male or female brain just

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:40.570
thing as the male or female brain just
 

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.539
thing as the male or female brain just
so you know what you yeah baby no nobody

00:22:42.539 --> 00:22:42.549
so you know what you yeah baby no nobody
 

00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:44.070
so you know what you yeah baby no nobody
who has any sense would ever claim if

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.080
who has any sense would ever claim if
 

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.810
who has any sense would ever claim if
there was a male and female brain ok

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:45.820
there was a male and female brain ok
 

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.849
there was a male and female brain ok
these differences aren't absolute what

00:22:47.849 --> 00:22:47.859
these differences aren't absolute what
 

00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:50.070
these differences aren't absolute what
do you want so should we just take that

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080
do you want so should we just take that
 

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.090
do you want so should we just take that
as a question you want to engage that

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:51.100
as a question you want to engage that
 

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.739
as a question you want to engage that
question on two types of brain and then

00:22:52.739 --> 00:22:52.749
question on two types of brain and then
 

00:22:52.749 --> 00:22:53.759
question on two types of brain and then
we can be a bit clearer well there are

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:53.769
we can be a bit clearer well there are
 

00:22:53.769 --> 00:22:55.470
we can be a bit clearer well there are
nice types of brain and men and women

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480
nice types of brain and men and women
 

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.330
nice types of brain and men and women
are more the same by personality than

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:57.340
are more the same by personality than
 

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.440
are more the same by personality than
they are different by a substantial

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:58.450
they are different by a substantial
 

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.960
they are different by a substantial
margin there's more similarities than

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:00.970
margin there's more similarities than
 

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.669
margin there's more similarities than
differences if there's more similarity

00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679
differences if there's more similarity
 

00:23:02.679 --> 00:23:04.109
differences if there's more similarity
than difference but that doesn't mean

00:23:04.109 --> 00:23:04.119
than difference but that doesn't mean
 

00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:05.879
than difference but that doesn't mean
the differences are irrelevant so let me

00:23:05.879 --> 00:23:05.889
the differences are irrelevant so let me
 

00:23:05.889 --> 00:23:08.669
the differences are irrelevant so let me
give you an example so if you pick two

00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679
give you an example so if you pick two
 

00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:10.169
give you an example so if you pick two
people at random out of the population

00:23:10.169 --> 00:23:10.179
people at random out of the population
 

00:23:10.179 --> 00:23:11.970
people at random out of the population
and had to guess which who is more

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:11.980
and had to guess which who is more
 

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.340
and had to guess which who is more
aggressive and you guessed the man you'd

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:14.350
aggressive and you guessed the man you'd
 

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.649
aggressive and you guessed the man you'd
be right 60 percent of the time that's

00:23:16.649 --> 00:23:16.659
be right 60 percent of the time that's
 

00:23:16.659 --> 00:23:18.060
be right 60 percent of the time that's
about the magnitude of the difference

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:18.070
about the magnitude of the difference
 

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.619
about the magnitude of the difference
between men and women that's six sixty

00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:19.629
between men and women that's six sixty
 

00:23:19.629 --> 00:23:22.680
between men and women that's six sixty
forties and that's exactly right less

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:22.690
forties and that's exactly right less
 

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.529
forties and that's exactly right less
but but but and this is where things get

00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:25.539
but but but and this is where things get
 

00:23:25.539 --> 00:23:27.629
but but but and this is where things get
more sophisticated all right so then

00:23:27.629 --> 00:23:27.639
more sophisticated all right so then
 

00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:30.210
more sophisticated all right so then
imagine that you had to pick the one in

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:30.220
imagine that you had to pick the one in
 

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.479
imagine that you had to pick the one in
a hundred most aggressive person and put

00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:33.489
a hundred most aggressive person and put
 

00:23:33.489 --> 00:23:36.509
a hundred most aggressive person and put
them in jail which is what we do they're

00:23:36.509 --> 00:23:36.519
them in jail which is what we do they're
 

00:23:36.519 --> 00:23:39.450
them in jail which is what we do they're
all men so even though at the midpoint

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:39.460
all men so even though at the midpoint
 

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.399
all men so even though at the midpoint
the difference between men and women

00:23:41.399 --> 00:23:41.409
the difference between men and women
 

00:23:41.409 --> 00:23:43.379
the difference between men and women
isn't that extreme at the extremes the

00:23:43.379 --> 00:23:43.389
isn't that extreme at the extremes the
 

00:23:43.389 --> 00:23:46.109
isn't that extreme at the extremes the
difference is extraordinary and most of

00:23:46.109 --> 00:23:46.119
difference is extraordinary and most of
 

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:47.909
difference is extraordinary and most of
the activity are much of the activity in

00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919
the activity are much of the activity in
 

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:49.529
the activity are much of the activity in
complex situations happens at the

00:23:49.529 --> 00:23:49.539
complex situations happens at the
 

00:23:49.539 --> 00:23:52.859
complex situations happens at the
extremes so men are more interested in

00:23:52.859 --> 00:23:52.869
extremes so men are more interested in
 

00:23:52.869 --> 00:23:55.409
extremes so men are more interested in
things than women are and women are more

00:23:55.409 --> 00:23:55.419
things than women are and women are more
 

00:23:55.419 --> 00:23:57.419
things than women are and women are more
interested in people than men are on

00:23:57.419 --> 00:23:57.429
interested in people than men are on
 

00:23:57.429 --> 00:23:59.279
interested in people than men are on
average and those differences are

00:23:59.279 --> 00:23:59.289
average and those differences are
 

00:23:59.289 --> 00:24:01.830
average and those differences are
largest in Scandinavia by the way so

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:01.840
largest in Scandinavia by the way so
 

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.940
largest in Scandinavia by the way so
there's no evidence that there

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:02.950
there's no evidence that there
 

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.979
there's no evidence that there
socio-culturally constructed and one of

00:24:04.979 --> 00:24:04.989
socio-culturally constructed and one of
 

00:24:04.989 --> 00:24:06.720
socio-culturally constructed and one of
the consequences of that is is that if

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:06.730
the consequences of that is is that if
 

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.369
the consequences of that is is that if
you leave men and women to make free

00:24:08.369 --> 00:24:08.379
you leave men and women to make free
 

00:24:08.379 --> 00:24:09.779
you leave men and women to make free
choices well let's put aside that

00:24:09.779 --> 00:24:09.789
choices well let's put aside that
 

00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:11.639
choices well let's put aside that
Scandinavia is no choice it's not just

00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:11.649
Scandinavia is no choice it's not just
 

00:24:11.649 --> 00:24:12.989
Scandinavia is no choice it's not just
one country that has lots of different

00:24:12.989 --> 00:24:12.999
one country that has lots of different
 

00:24:12.999 --> 00:24:15.840
one country that has lots of different
cultural political differences sure but

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:15.850
cultural political differences sure but
 

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:17.639
cultural political differences sure but
the point is is that and this is the

00:24:17.639 --> 00:24:17.649
the point is is that and this is the
 

00:24:17.649 --> 00:24:19.529
the point is is that and this is the
fundamental point is that the more

00:24:19.529 --> 00:24:19.539
fundamental point is that the more
 

00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:22.379
fundamental point is that the more
egalitarian the country the bigger the

well you have five dimensions there's

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:37.330
well you have five dimensions there's

absolutely come back to evidence but

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080
absolutely come back to evidence but
 

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.960

difference so what do we then do with
 

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.020

this let's say that we decide that there

00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:58.030
this let's say that we decide that there
 

00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:59.820
this let's say that we decide that there
are differences and we can argue whether

00:25:59.820 --> 00:25:59.830
are differences and we can argue whether

are differences and we can argue whether
that's about the average I mean who is

you say lots of different ways of

approaches to dealing with it the
challenge to you would still be I think

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:25.270

do you think that situation that we have

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:28.180
do you think that situation that we have
 

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.260
do you think that situation that we have
is broadly fair in workplaces and that

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:31.270
is broadly fair in workplaces and that

women is contributing to the pay gap and
 

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.560
women is contributing to the pay gap and
what to what degree other factors are

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:15.570
what to what degree other factors are
 

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:17.540
what to what degree other factors are
contributing so there's other factors

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:17.550
contributing so there's other factors
 

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.370

like I said already men are much more

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:19.380
like I said already men are much more
 

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.590
like I said already men are much more
likely to do dangerous jobs they're also

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600
likely to do dangerous jobs they're also
 

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.410
likely to do dangerous jobs they're also
more likely to do jobs that scale so for

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:24.420
more likely to do jobs that scale so for
 

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.790

example because women are more

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:25.800
example because women are more
 

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.770

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:27.780
interested in people on average than men
 

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.080
interested in people on average than men
are they tend to work in people oriented

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:30.090
are they tend to work in people oriented
 

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.150

one of the things that I really don't

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:14.010
one of the things that I really don't
 

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.730

like about the men women were oppressed

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.740
like about the men women were oppressed
 

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.470

by men throughout history narrative is

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480
by men throughout history narrative is
 

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.210
by men throughout history narrative is
the fact that both men and women were

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:20.220
the fact that both men and women were
 

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.520
the fact that both men and women were
terribly oppressed by nature throughout

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:22.530
terribly oppressed by nature throughout
 

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.260
terribly oppressed by nature throughout
history and that's not being factored

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:24.270
history and that's not being factored
 

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:26.360
history and that's not being factored
into the equation and I think that what

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:26.370
into the equation and I think that what
 

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.800
into the equation and I think that what
men and women did for most of history

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:27.810
men and women did for most of history
 

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.590

the decent ones anyways was team up and

the decent ones anyways was team up and
partner up and try to make life the

least amount of miserable for both and
yet we read this narrative backwards and

yet we read this narrative backwards and
 

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.850
yet we read this narrative backwards and
we say well the reason that men and

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860
we say well the reason that men and
 

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.460
we say well the reason that men and
women weren't operating equally in the

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:40.470
women weren't operating equally in the
 

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.320
women weren't operating equally in the
socio-cultural landscape was because men

that accounts for a tiny fraction of it

that accounts for a tiny fraction of it

that accounts for a tiny fraction of it
or some proportion of it but it had much

or some proportion of it but it had much
 

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.780
or some proportion of it but it had much
more to do with the fact that everyone

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:50.790
more to do with the fact that everyone
 

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.790
more to do with the fact that everyone
was poor and miserable and that women

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:52.800
was poor and miserable and that women
 

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.250
was poor and miserable and that women
were locked into a reproductive cycle

I mean we didn't fix that till the 60s

00:29:59.600 --> 00:29:59.610
I mean we didn't fix that till the 60s

boundaries of what constitutes nicely

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:47.690
boundaries of what constitutes nicely
 

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:50.589
boundaries of what constitutes nicely
dressed because there's look because

00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.970
part of what constitutes nicely dressed
is sexual attractiveness because you

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:57.980
is sexual attractiveness because you
 

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.220
is sexual attractiveness because you
can't separate out human attractiveness

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:00.230

sexual attractiveness from human
attractiveness and so then the question

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:03.890
attractiveness and so then the question
 

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:05.950
attractiveness and so then the question
is exactly where are the boundaries and

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960
is exactly where are the boundaries and
 

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.450
is exactly where are the boundaries and
that's what the discussion is about

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:07.460
that's what the discussion is about
 

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.240
that's what the discussion is about
where are the boundaries the dinner

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:10.250

right because lack of freedom is much
more probable than freedom we have to be

good indication of that

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400
good indication of that
 

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.490
good indication of that

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:51.500
that's a canary in the coalmine scenario
 

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.970
that's a canary in the coalmine scenario
that but let's just stick for a moment

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:54.980
that but let's just stick for a moment

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:32.510
and reprehensible cut this is a
 

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:35.230
and reprehensible cut this is a
consequence of some of the way that your

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240
consequence of some of the way that your
 

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.090

any responsibility there well I feel

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640
any responsibility there well I feel
 

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.760
any responsibility there well I feel
responsibility I suppose the question is

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:42.770
responsibility I suppose the question is
 

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:45.730
responsibility I suppose the question is
what the question is what's that what's

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:45.740
what the question is what's that what's
 

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.710
what the question is what's that what's
the proper level of analysis let's say

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:47.720
the proper level of analysis let's say
 

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:51.700
the proper level of analysis let's say
well okay so first of all people are

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:51.710
well okay so first of all people are
 

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.530
well okay so first of all people are
making four thousand videos out of my

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:53.540
making four thousand videos out of my
 

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:56.440
making four thousand videos out of my
videos a week on YouTube and so we're

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:56.450
videos a week on YouTube and so we're
 

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:57.790
videos a week on YouTube and so we're
going to expect that there's going to be

00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800
going to expect that there's going to be
 

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.320
going to expect that there's going to be
a tremendous amount of variance and how

00:42:59.320 --> 00:42:59.330
a tremendous amount of variance and how
 

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:00.160
a tremendous amount of variance and how
people do that

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:00.170
people do that
 

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:02.860
people do that
and they're competing for views just

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:02.870
and they're competing for views just
 

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:04.780
and they're competing for views just
like the mainstream video media is

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:04.790
like the mainstream video media is
 

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.430
like the mainstream video media is
competing for views and one of the ways

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440
competing for views and one of the ways
 

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.470
competing for views and one of the ways
to compete for views is to become

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480
to compete for views is to become
 

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.450
to compete for views is to become
sensationalistic and to capitalize on

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:10.460
sensationalistic and to capitalize on
 

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.970
sensationalistic and to capitalize on
polarization and I think that's a very

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:12.980
polarization and I think that's a very
 

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.920
polarization and I think that's a very
bad idea and I think a lot of that is

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:14.930
bad idea and I think a lot of that is
 

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:16.510
bad idea and I think a lot of that is
happening do you think you ever fall

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520
happening do you think you ever fall
 

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.170
happening do you think you ever fall
into that trap ever sure I think I fall

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:20.180
into that trap ever sure I think I fall
 

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.960
into that trap ever sure I think I fall
into that trap although I wouldn't say

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:21.970
into that trap although I wouldn't say
 

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:26.070
into that trap although I wouldn't say
video well you know I because of my

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:26.080
video well you know I because of my
 

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.390
video well you know I because of my
distaste for what's happening on the

00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400
distaste for what's happening on the
 

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.460
distaste for what's happening on the
university campuses and my embarrassment

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:30.470
university campuses and my embarrassment
 

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:34.150
university campuses and my embarrassment
at being associated with with with that

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160
at being associated with with with that
 

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.150
at being associated with with with that
because of my my academic standing let's

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160
because of my my academic standing let's
 

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.750
because of my my academic standing let's
say I perhaps become more irritable

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:39.760
say I perhaps become more irritable
 

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:44.500
say I perhaps become more irritable

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:44.510
about the fact of of identity politics
 

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.420
about the fact of of identity politics
that might be optimal although I think

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:46.430
that might be optimal although I think
 

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:50.290
that might be optimal although I think
in the main I'm quite careful and often

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:50.300
in the main I'm quite careful and often
 

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.300
in the main I'm quite careful and often
under extreme duress and I think that

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:52.310
under extreme duress and I think that
 

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.910
under extreme duress and I think that
that's what you have you eat fed and I

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:54.920
that's what you have you eat fed and I
 

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.290
that's what you have you eat fed and I

for like 15 years I'm actually quite an
 

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.510
for like 15 years I'm actually quite an
expert on it and so we know that men are

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520
expert on it and so we know that men are
 

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:38.940
expert on it and so we know that men are
more likely to look look look at it this

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:38.950
more likely to look look look at it this
 

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:40.340

commit suicide and men are much more
likely to kill themselves and the reason

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:47.020
likely to kill themselves and the reason
 

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.480
likely to kill themselves and the reason
for that is that men use lethal force

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:48.490
for that is that men use lethal force
 

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:51.720
for that is that men use lethal force
and women don't now that's a big

the UK was my interview with Kathy
Newman and the reason that that

00:50:44.219 --> 00:50:44.229
Newman and the reason that that
 

00:50:44.229 --> 00:50:46.529
Newman and the reason that that
propelled me to success wasn't because I

00:50:46.529 --> 00:50:46.539
