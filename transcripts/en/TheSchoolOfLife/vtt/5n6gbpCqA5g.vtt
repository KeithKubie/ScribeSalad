00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.700
We're sometimes not too sure how we get into good friendships. It seems to happen rather mysteriously.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.040
We talk of somewhat
randomly clicking with people.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.220
Trying to plan for this sounds like cheating.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.940
but there is something at the heart of many friendships that seemed important to identify and in a way to get good at:

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.620
Vulnerability.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.340
It's too easy to assume
that what makes us likable , are our strengths

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.200
our accomplishments, the things
we're proud of.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:42.400
Certainly this impresses, but it isn't what draws others to us. We get close to someone the more they, and we find ourselves

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.660
able gracefully to
depart from the official story

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.880
of what human beings are like, and can start to show the awkward truths which underlie the cheerful facade.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.580
These are the truths with which we've
been lonely for too long.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.740
How unlike normal sexuality our sex lives actually are;

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.240
how full of envy are our careers are proving;

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.840
how unsatisfactory our family can be;

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.120
how worried we are, all the time.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.360
Revealing any of these things places us
in great danger.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.760
Others could laugh;

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.920
social media would have a field day.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.180
That's the point.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.760
We can only get close by revealing things which would, in the wrong hands,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.440
be capable of inflicting appalling
humiliation on us.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.120
Friendship is the dividend of gratitude, that flows from acknowledgement

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.060
that one has offered something very valuable to someone. Not a fancy present,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.620
but something even more precious: the key to one's self-esteem and dignity.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.440
It's deeply poignant that we should expend so much effort on trying to look strong before the world.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.360
When, all the while, it's really only ever the
revelation of the somewhat embarrassing, sad

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.399
melancholy and anxious bits of us that
are what makes us endearing to others

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.620
and can transform strangers into friends.
