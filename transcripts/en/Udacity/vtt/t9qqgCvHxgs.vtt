00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so let's move on to some live web applications.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So, at the end of your last homework, you should have

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Google App Engine running on your machine, and you should have a basic site online.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We're going to start with basically the simple hello world example

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that Google has on their site, which I have.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is the main hello world Python file from the Google App Engine example page,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and it's got 2 main sections.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We'll start with this section down here at the bottom.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is the URL mapping section, and in this case,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we have 1 URL, slash, and it maps to a handler called MainPage.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
MainPage is defined in this class called MainPage.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It inherits from webapp to RequestHandler, which is the generic

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
request handler from Google.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If you don't know what classes are, you can learn about them offline.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's basically a convenient way for grouping together

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
functions and data that are all related to the same thing.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We're not going to spend a whole lot of time on it here,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but you should be able to keep up just fine.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Our class is a function called get, which takes a parameter called self,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
which is the common first parameter to most Python methods.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, this function does 2 things.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
First, it takes self.response, which is the kind of global response object

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that this framework uses, and it sets a header.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It sets the Content-Type header to equal text/plain.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
By default, the content type is text/html, but in this case it's setting it to text/plain,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and then it's writing the string "Hello, webapp World!"

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If we start up Google App Engine, I'll start Google App Engine in my terminal here,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and then I'll go to my browser and load the page, and this is what we see.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We see that string that our program was writing out in our browser, "Hello, webapp World!"

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Pretty neat.
