00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.520
Chemical rockets have done a lot for humanity.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.240
Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen engines 
powered the Space Age,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.780
but they can only get us so far.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.400
If we want to travel to deep space and beyond 
without waiting for the planets to align,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.680
we're going to have to come up with some new propulsion systems.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.080
The problem with chemical rockets is the fuel is heavy, and for all that weight, it's not very efficient.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.180
The fuel's energy is limited to what's stored 
in the chemical bonds,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.200
and after 90 years of research, chemical rockets 
aren't going to get much better.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.860
Plus, once that candle's lit, it uses all its fuel in one burst

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.480
and then coasts the rest of the way to the destination.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.380
If the kids are yelling in the back, you can't turn this rocket around, you know what I'm saying?

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.140
Well, you could orient it that way with hydrazine engines like the ones satellites use,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.160
but those don't actually have enough
thrust to do much more than orientation.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.820
Whatever way the chemical rocket was pointing, 
that's where you're going.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.920
So to explore deep space, NASA is looking past the energy stored in chemical bonds.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.240
Another propulsion technology that's been around since the 60s is just showing promise in the last 20 years:

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.740
ion engines.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.500
Ion engines work by accelerating charged atoms, 
like xenon ions,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.420
through a magnetic field, and out the back 
of the spacecraft.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.260
The fuel is lightweight and provides a low amount of thrust over a very long period of time,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.040
so in theory, they're great for long-term
deep-space exploration.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.780
Early engines, though, destroyed themselves 
as the ions eroded the walls

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.500
and it's hard to have a long-term mission 
with a short-term engine.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.420
Engineers have finally cracked the puzzle by diverting the magnetic field around the walls,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.460
to stop the ions from bombarding it,
and recent missions

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.880
like the Dawn Space Probe, sent to the asteroid Ceres, used ion engines to power it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.000
once it was out of Earth's orbit.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.920
Another novel idea is getting rid of
onboard fuel altogether,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.120
and letting the Sun push the craft along.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.260
That's the principle harnessed by solar sails, 
and they're exactly what they sound like:

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.880
they're sails as large as a football field, 
and 40-100x thinner

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.800
than a sheet of paper. When fully unfurled, they catch the sun's light, and away they go.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.400
Despite photons having no rest mass,
they do have energy,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.800
which means they do carry a tiny amount 
of momentum.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.700
When they bounce off the craft's surface,
they impart their momentum.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.300
So, an enormous sail out in space can take advantage of the practically endless stream of photons from the Sun,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.440
accelerating for as long enough light keeps hitting it.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.280
The Japanese space agency JAXA
launched the first solar sail IKAROS in 2010,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.780
and one month after it unfurled, JAXA reported the craft was accelerating due to photonic pressure.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.660
(Just don't go too close to the Sun, IKAROS.)

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.100
Solar sails work well 
when they're close enough to the Sun,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.780
but out past Mars, the power of the Sun fades, making solar sails impractical past that point.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.440
If you can't wait for an ion engine or solar sail to pick up speed, there is the nuclear option...

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.640
literally. Some scientists have proposed using fusion or efficient propulsion systems

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.060
to get humans to Mars in one month instead of seven.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.720
Proposals vary, with some using nuclear reactors to generate plasma

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.080
that's then accelerated with a magnetic field -- like an ion engine on steroids.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.340
Others would use hydrogen atoms that are forced together by collapsing lithium rings around them

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.980
to generate pulses of fusion.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.940
This method could provide the same amount of energy as four litres of rocket propellant

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.880
with an amount of fuel as big as a grain of sand.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.200
But these ideas have a lot of hurdles, 
and are still a long way off.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.220
Then again, so are other planets,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.720
and if we're going to send humans to any of them,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.019
we prefer the journey be as fast as possible.

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.958
We'll still need chemical rockets 
to get us out of Earth's orbit.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.160
But once we develop these technologies, who knows where we go from there?

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.660

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.160
is sometimes based on origami.
