00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.320
Iron Man 2,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.920
The sequel to one of the biggest superhero films that ever came out.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.920
At the end of the last Iron Man movie,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.360
We see a superhero do something that I don't think

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.700
I've ever seen a superhero do in a movie:

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.760
He reveals his secret identity to the world.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.900
When does that ever happen?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.940
It's always to a love interest, or a close friend,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.040
or something like that.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.580
Whoever just admits to the world that they're a superhero?

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.360
It's something I've never seen before and got me

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.360
really excited for the sequel, because you would think,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.380
"Wow! This is gonna go places we've never seen

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.260
a superhero movie go before." And, in some respects,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.320
it does!

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.380
We see the life of a superhero if he was a celebrity.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.180
Tony Stark is taking the law into his own hands,

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.320
is flying around the world and stopping evil wherever he sees it.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.860
And the government... in kind of a confusing way, is powerless to stop it.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.200
He's more popular than ever, everybody loves him, and, of course, he has his vengeful haters.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.360
Mickey Rourke is a villain who vows vengeance against Tony Stark, because of some wrongdoing that his father did in the past.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.580
He attaches his electric ropes to his hands and, suddenly, he's one hell of a badass mother.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.440
But that's not the only thing going wrong.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.060
Tony's heart is slowly giving out because of the electronic device that he's using to keep him alive.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.860
As put so eloquently, the device that's keeping him alive is also slowly killing him.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.640
On top of that, he's upgraded Pepper Potts to take over his business,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.400
a new bodyguard named Black Widow, played famously now by Scarlett Johansson, enters the mix,

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.380
and another big corporation wants to take down Stark by teaming up with Rourke and creating even better war machines.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.660
In fact, one of them is even called "War Machine".

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.400
When this film came out, people hated it. All they could do was talk about how godawful it was.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.040
Now don't get me wrong, it still did really good at the box office, but everybody just despised the hell out of it.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.100
Does the film deserve such a bashing?

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.500
Well... kinda, but I don't know if it deserved quite as much as it got.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.460
I guess I'll talk about the good stuff first.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.560
It does show kind of the price of celebrity. Tony, of course, loves the attention, but he realizes that he can't escape himself.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.500
No matter how hard he parties or gets drunk, all his misery is always waiting there for him, except now, it's in public and everybody can see it.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.360
When he gets in a fight with a best friend, suddenly, it makes news, and it makes it even harder for him to figure out how to solve his problems.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.000
Mickey Rourke as well is a great choice for a villain.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.880
He has a wonderful voice, he has the perfect look, he has the strength, he just came off of a huge hit movie, it's an ideal choice.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.440
But this does all build up to the biggest problem with the movie:

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.880
It goes nowhere.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.580
Remember that problem with Tony's heart? You could've cut that out and not miss anything.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.160
You know how Mickey Rourke is spending most of the movie building these incredible weapons?

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.120
It's only around a few minutes at the end.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.980
Hell, you know how Mickey Rourke is supposed to be the villain in this? You barely see him.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.440
In fact, the main bad guy is just some asshole in a suit.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.940
Wait...didn't we already have some asshole in a suit in the last movie?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.700
Yeah, we get it. Big business bad, but, come on. We just dealt with this guy.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.880
When there is fighting in the movie, it doesn't really connect to anything that big or epic.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.660
ron Man fights with his friend. Well, okay, looks cool, but who cares?

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.740
Wouldn't it be cool if that was Mickey Rourke there?

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.200
I mean, they're friends fighting. We know they're gonna make up, we know they're gonna figure things out.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.040
Why are we spending so much time seeing them fight at a party?

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.980
Remember how Stark upgraded Pepper Potts to run the company?

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.640
Eh, she doesn't like it. She turns it down after a while.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.640
Okay, well, what was the point of that, then?

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:44.920
There's a lot of time dedicated to Tony and remembering his father, what a jerk he was, only to figure out he wasn't really that much of a jerk. Okay, what did that add?

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.140
Tony still acts like a jerk, and not the fun kind of jerk, just a jerk-jerk.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.900
He gets drunk and keeps telling everybody that despite what they think,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.260
he knows what he's doing, but he doesn't.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.680
He clearly doesn't know what he's doing, and it's not fun to watch.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.260
In the first film, he did jerky things, but he still came around to using his brilliant mind.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.660
He utilized stuff, he was resourceful.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.600
Here, all the times he reassures people that he knows what he's doing,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.620
it never comes back into play.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.380
Thank God they tackled Black Widow a lot better in the future, because she's kind of a wasted character here.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.360
So, yeah, the film does have a lot of problems,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.360
and in the end, probably doesn't really work.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.240
But the strength of it does still come from the cool stuff that we like to see in an Iron Man movie.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.480
We like to see the technology, we like to see the one-liners,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.700
and again, we like to see Robert Downey Jr. doing the role that redefined him.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.640
Even when he's being such a pain in the ass,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.100
he is still so funny and so enjoyable to watch,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.160
which is why it's such a letdown

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.580
when you find out that he actually doesn't know as much as he's letting on,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.260
and that he is just getting drunk and acting like an ass.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.400
So, I don't know. I guess it's bad,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.680
but I still think there's some really neat things in there that haven't been done yet,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.180
like tackling the celebrity of a superhero who revealed himself,

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.260
the technology is upped a little bit,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.980
and, yeah, you do kind of see Iron Man

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.180
doing the typical Iron Man stuff, there's just not as much as you would like.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.740
In the end, it just kind of feels like a distraction to introduce a few other elements in-between Marvel movies.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.800
I guess I feel a little bad for it,

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.320
because everybody praised what a masterpiece the first movie was and, yeah,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.480
it's good, it's well done, but it had problems, too,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.380
and everyone seems to forget that when they look at this one.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.080
It doesn't work as a whole,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.920
but I don't think it's as bad as everybody else builds it up to be.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.280
And I guess we kind of know that

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.560
there's more Iron Man movies on the way anyway,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.640
so it's not like this is the last one we would ever see.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.340
Now, how would that one fare up?

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.440
Well, we'll get to that when we get to that.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.420
But for this one,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.500
it's probably the perfect definition of

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.700
"close, but no explosion."
