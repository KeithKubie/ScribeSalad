00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.980
Abby and Ben did household
chores last weekend.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.880
Together they earned $50.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.125
That looks like an interesting
statement.

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:08.300
Let me underline that.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.390
Together they earned $50 and
Abby earned $10 more than Ben.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.180
So they also tell us--let me
underline that-- Abby earned

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.740
$10 more than Ben.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.310
How much did each earn?

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.020
So that's the first question
that we have to answer.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.070
Then they say, if you were to
use the graph above, and I put

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.970
it on the side here, which
strategy is most useful in

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.650
helping you find the answer
to the problem?

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.740
So there's kind of a meta-level
question of how do

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.060
we answer that first question.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.000
Find the equation for
the blue line?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.580
Red's y-intercept?

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.490
Find the points of
intersection?

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.320
Fair enough.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.130
So let's just think about that
first question and then we can

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.330
answer this later, depending
on how we

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.950
answered that first question.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.060
So that first statement,
together they earned $50.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.150
What does that tell us?

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.220
Well, if we say that Abby's
earnings are represented by a,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.200
and Ben's earnings are
represented by b, that tells

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200
us that a plus b must be $50.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.630
So a plus b have to
be equal to $50.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.650
Abby's earnings plus Ben's
earnings are $50.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.020
Together they earned $50.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.930
That's all that statement
is telling us.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.860
And if we see how they graphed
things here, on the vertical

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.790
axis, what we normally associate
with the y-axis,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.260
they graphed Abby's earnings.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.750
This is Abby's earnings
right there.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.800
So we could say this
is the a-axis.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.050
And then on the horizontal
axis, what we normally

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.180
associate with the x-axis,
they've charted Ben's

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.840
earnings, so we could say
that this is the b-axis.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.710
So if we were to just map this
into the traditional

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.190
slope-intercept form, we don't
have x's and y's here.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.260
We have b's and a's.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.180
So we just want to express a
in terms of b, the vertical

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.150
variable in terms of the
horizontal variable.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.080
That's just like the y equals
mx plus b form.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.630
And the easiest way to do that
is just subtract b from both

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.690
sides of this equation.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.400
And we get a is equal to
negative b plus 50.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.240
So in this situation, you have
a slope of negative 1.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.010
Let me write this down.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.810
Slope of negative 1, that's
what's multiplying the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.130
independent variable, and then
you have a y-intercept of 50,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.405
or maybe we should say
an a-intercept.

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:13.180
But I'll write y-intercept
because that's what we're

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.790
familiar with.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.660
You can view this as also like
the y or the vertical axis.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.490
y-intercept of 50.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.130
And you can see they
graphed that.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.480
You have an a-intercept or
y-intercept of 50, and the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.010
slope is negative 1.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.700
If we move 20 in the positive
x-direction, we are moving

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.220
down 20, or we're going 20
in the negative vertical

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.580
direction, or in the negative
a-direction.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.660
If we go 50 in the positive-- I
shouldn't say x-direction--

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.900
the positive b-direction, we go
down 50 in the a-direction,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.180
so the slope is negative 1.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.930
So this red line right here is
the graph that depicts this

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.800
first constraint.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.040
It's important to realize that,
look, all this graph

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.880
shows is all the different
possible combinations of

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.360
Abby's and Ben's earnings
given only this first

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.190
constraint.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.340
Maybe Abby made $50
and Ben earned $0.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.940
Maybe Ben earned $50
and Abby earned $0.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.130
Maybe they both earned $25.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.500
Everything on this line would
be a valid combination of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.270
Abby's and Ben's earnings given
the constraint that they

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.430
earned $50 combined.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.980
Now, the second statement.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.750
Abby earned $10 more than Ben.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.650
So if we were to write that,
that's saying that Abby is

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.590
equal to Ben's earnings
plus $10.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.250
Abby earned $10 more than Ben.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.850
And here the slope is 1, you
see that right there.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.470
There's an implicit 1
multiplying times this b.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.450
And then the y-intercept
is 10.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.140
And they graphed that here.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.360
The y-intercept is 10
and the slope is 1.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.310
You move 10 in the positive
b-direction, you move up 10 in

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.870
the positive a-direction.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.890
So this blue line represents
all of the possible

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.970
combinations of Abby and Ben's
earnings if you only had this

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.720
constraint that Abby earned
$10 more than Ben.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.110
If Ben earns $0,
Abby earns $10.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.640
If Ben earns $10,
Abby earns $20.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.560
If Ben earns $60,
Abby earns $70.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.019
Now, we aren't dealing with only
the blue constraint or

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.640
only the red constraint.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.829
We're dealing with
both of them.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.940
We know that both of
them are true.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.040
So whatever earnings Abby and
Ben made, they have to satisfy

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.580
both constraints or they have to
sit on both of these lines.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.740
Now, what is the only point
that is sitting on both of

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.840
these lines?

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.970
Well, the only point that sits
on both lines is the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.460
intersection of those lines.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.380
That point right there is a
valid combination from the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.850
point of view of the blue
constraint that Abby earned

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.460
$10 more than Ben.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.060
And it's also a valid point or
a valid combination from the

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.290
point of view of the red
constraint that Abby and Ben

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.580
earned $50.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.140
So that point represents Abby's
and Ben's earnings that

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.570
satisfy both constraints.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.780
And we can eyeball
it right here.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.460
It looks like Abby earned
$30 and Ben earned $20.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.980
And that makes sense.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.750
Combined, $20 plus $30 or $30
plus $20 is $50, so we meet

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.030
our first constraint.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.010
And we see that Abby, $30, made
$10 more than Ben, who

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.370
only made $20.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.730
So if you look at the point of
intersection, you will have

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.620
solved the problem.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.590
Abby made $30, Ben earned $20.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.580
So answering this second-- so
we know the answer-- so Abby

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.700
earned $30 and Ben earned $20.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.790
Now, answering the second-level,
meta-level

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.950
question, which is the
best strategy?

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.450
We see, well, we had to find the
points of intersection, so

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.700
that is choice C.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.530
We had to find the lines'
point of intersection.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.640
Finding these other things
really wouldn't have helped us

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.440
solve the problem.
