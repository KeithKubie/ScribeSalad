[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:09.650
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.670
I can't believe I am more
popular than Irish sun.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.320
That is bizarre.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.130
That's so weird.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.750
No, really,
genuinely, thank you.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.120
This is [? deadly. ?]
I asked to have a stool

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.150
so I could feel like
a '90s stand up comic.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.570
What's the deal with
airplane food, right?

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.820
So yeah, thanks for having me.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.190
My name's Bella FitzPatrick.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.014
I used the "she"
and "her" pronouns.

00:00:32.014 --> 00:00:33.430
If you don't know
what that means,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.471
that just means that's
how you refer to me later.

00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:38.530
So you'd say, Bella, she
talked to us about ShoutOut.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.260
She was nice.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.524
I hope you say this.

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:42.940
If you used other
pronouns for me,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.040
that would hurt my feelings.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.860
If you're thinking it's very
obvious that we would call

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.770
you she and her, thank you.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.780
I'm trying to look
like a woman, so I'm

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.720
glad that I'm
succeeding, if I am.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.280
But in the LGBT
community, we just

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.480
don't make these
types of assumptions.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.500
You wouldn't know
that I didn't have

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.450
other pronouns such as "they"
and "them" or something

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.950
like that.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.880
So we just take all
the guesswork out,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.631
put it right there, put it in
our email signatures and stuff

00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:07.130
like that.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.420
So that's why that's there,
in case anybody was wondering.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.340
That's our-- oh, no.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.711
I haven't done the thing.

00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:14.210
Oh, yeah.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.800
That would make
more sense there.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.680
Yeah.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.700
So that's our Twitter
handle and our Facebook.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.390
And that's my personal
Twitter handle.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.265
If you have a good time
today, I would really

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:28.940
appreciate if you'd shout out,
as it were, about it online.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.750
And if you don't have a good
time, don't tell anybody.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.050
Don't tweet about it.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.927
Just keep that to yourself if
you don't have a good time.

00:01:37.927 --> 00:01:40.510
So I'm just going to try to talk
to you a bit about what we do

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.530
and how we do it.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.905
And this is, like,
the first time

00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:46.240
I've given this type of talk
at all, so just bear with me.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.100
[GROWLS] That's a gay joke.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.600
Bears.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.070
No?

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.569
OK.

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.301
Never mind.

00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:53.800
Cool.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.540
So this is just some of
our stats from this year.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.350
Our primary activity is
giving workshops in schools

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.410
with students to
tackle LGBT bullying

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.020
in schools in the classroom.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.250
We did a lot this year.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.510
We did 349 workshops.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.260
They were all free for schools.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.320
That means we've reached
about 10,000 students face

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.080
to face, in their
classroom, talking to them,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.150
being queer and talking
to them, or being an ally

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.450
and talking to them.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.810
So that's [? deadly. ?] I'm
really, really appreciative.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.490
I did not do all
of these workshops.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.780
These were done by 61
incredible, amazing volunteers

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.970
that we just wouldn't
operate without-- so just

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.730
appreciate them so much.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.920
This happened across 102
schools in 22 counties, which

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.710
means that there are
still more counties

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.390
to do and still more
schools to get to,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.710
but we're getting there.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.310
We work in Northern
Ireland as well,

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.481
so this includes all of
the counties of the island.

00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:53.980
Yeah.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.470
So this is kind of what
our growth looks like.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.210
I guess if this was your
stock, you'd be pretty pleased.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.600
Yeah, we're pretty pleased.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.806
We started off with doing, like,
10 workshops the pilot year.

00:03:08.806 --> 00:03:10.180
And the workshop
wasn't much more

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.000
of us just going into schools
and being, like, we're LGBT!

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
That's it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
But then we developed
a really specific

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.170
anti-bullying workshop.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.210
Then we did 30, around 40,
90, 150, 171, and at 349.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.530
So yeah, chuffed with that.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.285
I got hired here.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.350
Not to brag, but--

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.550
because before that, we
were entirely voluntary.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.260
Completely.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.010
We had no staff at all.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.420
We were just a bunch of friends.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.780
We were just a
Facebook group just

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.780
getting in touch with schools,
going there whenever we could.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.780
And then we got
one staff member,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.990
and you're looking at her.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.130
So I have pretty wild
staff parties on my own.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.700
Yeah.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.070
It can be lonely, but it's
still like a dream come true

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.790
because I've been working for
free for ShoutOut for so long.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.440
And I always had
a day job, which

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.148
I was always rubbish
at, right, because I

00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:08.360
had this other passion.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.900
I was constantly leaving.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.400
And I was just so lucky that I
had a day job that was really

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.437
like respectful of that.

00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:15.520
They were always like,
where are you going, Bella?

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.750
Something gay, is it?

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.540
And I'd be like, yes.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.301
I won't be in till 12:00, sorry.

00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:23.800
Yeah.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.820
So that growth there, that's
not about me, specifically.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.570
That's just what happens
when you can have staff.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.610
This is a similar story
for tech startups.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.310
You might have an idea
working at the weekends.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.710
And once you commit
your full time to it,

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.320
you just see this growth, and
it's really, really amazing.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.890
I'm also only part time,
so this is 20 hours a week.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.450
Imagine what we would do
with two staff members.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.950
God.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.180
It'd be mad.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.120
So yeah, it's just been a
really incredible journey.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.600
It's important to know
we're doing this in Ireland,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.360
on the island of Ireland, which
is a very interesting place

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.530
to be talking about
LGBTQIAP stuff.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.450
Because we're just a funny
little country, aren't we?

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.164
It's like a funny little
teddy bear-shaped country.

00:05:09.164 --> 00:05:10.330
We have a lot of good stuff.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.930
We have a lot of
good equalities.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.010
But legal equality does
not equal social equality.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.250
So we got a lot of
good legislation.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.810
It's 25 years since
decriminalization

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.820
of homosexuality between men.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.450
So that means before 25 years,
that you could go to jail,

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.450
and people did.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.410
Men did go to jail for
holding hands, for kissing.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.730
And now we have
marriage equality,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.220
and we have gender recognition.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.980
Hands up, who was in Ireland
for the marriage equality

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.590
referendum?

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.370
OK, loads of you.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.490
So you kind of knew
what it was like.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.970
It was tough because begging
people for your rights

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.260
is not an ideal way
to spend a Saturday.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.620
But that's what we did.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.670
It has not done what
people think it has done.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.680
It really, it just hasn't.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.460
People think it is
representative of an expansion

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.130
of tolerance, and it just isn't.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.180
What we put forward in the
marriage equality referendum

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.970
was an extremely limited view
of LGBT people and LGBT culture.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.290
So it was very much just
like, we're were two white,

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.875
able-bodied lads,
and we work in KPMG.

00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:26.250
And we just want to watch "The
Late Late" and have a pint

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.222
and get married, woo!

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:31.680
And I mean, there's nothing
wrong with any of those things.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.900
Working at KPMG, that's fine.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.340
Having a pint is fine.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.810
Watching "The Late Late"--

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.470
well, that's not so fine.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.210
But people have their own thing.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:48.030
So really, people's ideas
didn't really expand.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.440
People's tolerance
didn't expand,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.260
so much as we tricked them into
thinking we were they already

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.150
tolerated.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.920
And that means we haven't
seen the movement in schools

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.520
that you would
think we would see

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.470
in a post-marriage
referendum Ireland.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.730
We have not seen that
much greater acceptance.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.440
I've done workshops in schools
before marriage equality,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.040
and I've done workshops in
schools post-marriage equality.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.770
And it is different.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.780
It is not better.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.809
If you are a charismatic,
macho gay lad--

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:20.600
yeah, you might get on
a little bit better.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.380
If you are a feminine,
charismatic, popular gay girl,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.980
you might get on a
little bit better.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.890
But if you go
against gender norms,

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.060
it's still a very, very
tough place to be in Ireland.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.590
I've actually heard, in schools,
teachers say things like,

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.620
you can't help being gay, but
you can help being a faggot.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.810
And that's kind of where
we're at at the moment.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.550
And you kind of see
that around Pride.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.214
You see that a lot.

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:46.130
Why are they marching?

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.540
They have marriage equality.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.081
Why are they going
out on the streets

00:07:49.081 --> 00:07:50.515
making a show of themselves?

00:07:50.515 --> 00:07:51.890
Why do they have
to be like that?

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.790
Why can't they just be normal?

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.850
There's this whole idea
that the ultimate goal

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.830
of the LGBT community
is to assimilate

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.070
into a cis,
heteronormative mainstream.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.500
And that's just not the case.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.700
We just want to be tolerated,
want to be celebrated,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.730
and we want to be accepted.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.010
So there's a little
bit of complacency

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.670
in post-marriage
referendum Ireland

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.840
about the social equality
and the legal equality piece.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.250
We also have gender
recognition--

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.660
some of the best in the world.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.840
You can change your gender on
your passport and your birth

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.570
cert and all your
gender markers,

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.270
and it doesn't require
any medical intervention.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.700
It is a self-declaration.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.659
It is a declaration
you make yourself

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.143
without any other input.

00:08:34.143 --> 00:08:35.059
And that's incredible.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:35.934
It really, really is.

00:08:35.934 --> 00:08:40.620
But how can that impact
schools when we never talk

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.210
about LGBT people in schools?

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:45.540
It never comes up.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.920
These laws pertain to adults.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.080
So it has not done
what we need it

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.540
to do for our younger people.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.530
So our whole point
of ShoutOut is

00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:00.800
to get cis and
straight young people

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.010
and those who work with young
people to be OK with this.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.530
The classic, you know?

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.230
We hear a lot of, like, they
keep on adding on letters.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.367
I suppose we do, but what of it?

00:09:16.367 --> 00:09:18.200
People want to know,
what is the actual one?

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.866
What's the right one,
as if there's some

00:09:19.866 --> 00:09:22.460
sort of central committee?

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.680
I'll bring it up at
the next big meeting.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.970
This is the one we use
because it's inclusive.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.610
It works.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.810
It's terrible for
a poster, but--

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.930
it doesn't have as much brand
recognition, but look it.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.310
It's all about getting people
to listen to us about this

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:44.150
and not interrupt us with
statements like, I just

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.180
think people are people,
and aren't labels bad?

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.960
These are, like, our two
most hated things to say.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.730
Of course, we put
ourself in the position

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.100
to answer that question.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.820
I'm not saying I'm mad that
you've asked that question.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.861
I'm just saying, when you
hear it loads of times,

00:09:57.861 --> 00:09:59.750
you begin to hate it.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.930
"I just treat
people as people" is

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.630
the ultimate hand-washing
statement anybody

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.170
could ever say that
essentially means,

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.430
I don't have to learn
about this, because I just

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:11.540
treat people like people.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.614
What does that even mean?

00:10:12.614 --> 00:10:14.030
"I just treat
people like people."

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.529
Good.

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:19.281
You don't treat them like
dogs or donkeys or whatever.

00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:20.780
You should treat
people like people.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.340
That doesn't exclude
you from needing

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.480
to know about how you are
part of systematic oppression.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.380
You are, and I am, and we
all are in different ways,

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.060
depending on our
privileges, depending

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.920
on how we conduct ourselves.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.350
And that type of sentiment, "I
just treat people like people,"

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.430
is not pertaining only
to the LGBT community,

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.060
but different cultures and
different religions and women.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.730
And it's just ultimately
said to shake off this idea

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.250
that you have any
responsibility.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:55.060
So yeah-- not a big
fan of that sentiment.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.130
And labels being bad--

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.150
we get this a lot.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.340
Labels are bad.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.587
We're actually a big fan
of labels in the community.

00:11:02.587 --> 00:11:04.420
I don't know if you've
seen all the letters,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.240
but yeah, we like it.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.120
I think labels are bad if
labels have never served you.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.430
If you've never needed
to be defined by a label,

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.190
if you are the majority
person in your community,

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.950
then you've never
realized how labels

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.500
can be good, because you've
only seen labels limiting you.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.650
You've only seen them
ever hindering you,

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.582
who you are, in the sense that--

00:11:25.582 --> 00:11:27.290
men just used to be
men, and now, they're

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.780
cis, straight, white men.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.570
And they don't like that at all.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.820
But we love labels because
when you're a minority,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.260
it helps you find
your community,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.810
helps you find people who've
had similar experiences to you.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.320
And that is really, really,
really a survival tactic.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.000
So if we could do
away with labels,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.570
then we'd do away
with our community.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.540
Is the ultimate goal maybe
to get rid of labels?

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.800
Sure, OK, maybe.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.730
We're not there
yet, not even close.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.930
But maybe we'll create a
critical mass of labels,

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.930
and they'll all, like,
implode in on each other.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:59.846
Maybe that's the goal.

00:11:59.846 --> 00:12:00.790
I don't know.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.300
All right.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.508
Let's see what you guys know.

00:12:02.508 --> 00:12:04.362
All right-- L.

00:12:04.362 --> 00:12:05.760
AUDIENCE: [? Lesbians. ?]

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.260
BELLA FITZPATRICK:
That was pitiful.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:13.040
It's Pride Week--
(whispered) Fuck's sake.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.540
L.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.203
AUDIENCE: Lesbians.

00:12:14.203 --> 00:12:15.494
BELLA FITZPATRICK: There we go.

00:12:15.494 --> 00:12:16.441
OK, much better.

00:12:16.441 --> 00:12:16.940
G.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:17.938
AUDIENCE: Gay.

00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:18.936
BELLA FITZPATRICK: B.

00:12:18.936 --> 00:12:19.934
AUDIENCE: Bisexual.

00:12:19.934 --> 00:12:20.809
BELLA FITZPATRICK: T.

00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:21.930
AUDIENCE: Transgender.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.530
BELLA FITZPATRICK:
[LAUGHS] Oh, ho.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.570
Let's do a little poll,
a little referendum.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.710
God, we love a referendum.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.310
Hands up for transgender?

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:38.530
Hands up for transsexual?

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.430
Do people say other
things as well?

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.279
AUDIENCE: Trans.

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:42.820
BELLA FITZPATRICK:
Trans, yeah, yeah.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.942
Hands up for trans, then?

00:12:44.942 --> 00:12:45.730
OK.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.270
Oh, a very split room.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.600
OK, cool.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.610
It's transgender or trans.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.750
"Trans" is just short
for transgender.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.710
It's not transsexual, OK?

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:57.280
It's not.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.010
And this is good you guys know
because, of course, being woke

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.060
is a hierarchy.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.330
And you all need to level up.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.440
You'll level up
with me now today.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.020
"Transsexual" is fallen out
of favor by the community.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.600
We don't really
use it that much.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:18.310
But there is a golden rule,
numero uno, the first rule

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.940
of queer club is
talk about queer club

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.492
so everyone knows
about it, and we

00:13:23.492 --> 00:13:24.700
can get more people involved.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.200
No.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.610
The first rule of queer
club is that everyone's

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.440
in charge of their
own labels, OK?

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.210
No matter how much
someone else thinks

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.550
you don't fit that
definition, it doesn't matter.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.750
Because this is how
people live and love.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.940
You can't pin it down.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.145
It is all gray area.

00:13:40.145 --> 00:13:41.520
There is nothing
black and white.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.220
This is all a continuum.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.440
There is nothing
specific here other

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.610
than people's lived
experiences, and you just

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.027
don't get to argue
with those, OK?

00:13:50.027 --> 00:13:51.901
So everyone is in charge
of their own labels.

00:13:51.901 --> 00:13:54.070
So some people might
identify as transsexual,

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.360
and that is absolutely fine.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.850
The reason why
people don't like it

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.580
anymore is because
it's quite medically.

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.270
It's such a focus on
the medical aspect

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.100
of being trans, which
doesn't apply to everybody.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:11.230
Not everyone wants to medically
transition or even consider

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.480
that to be an OK term to use.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.520
So yeah, we don't
really use it anymore.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.360
So go forth and
don't use, please.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.720
And it comes from this idea that
your sex is your gender, right?

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.750
So that's not true.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.450
Sex and gender are
very separate things.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.120
Sex is a series of
biological traits,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.080
and gender is [MUMBLES].

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.260
I don't fully know.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.840
That's why there's
college departments called

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.100
gender studies.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.960
I guess they haven't
figured it out.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.650
So I don't know.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.307
Gender is like a
social construct

00:14:46.307 --> 00:14:48.890
that's different from culture
to culture and depending on what

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:49.515
time you're in.

00:14:49.515 --> 00:14:52.480
But seems to be innate in
most people about the gender

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.250
that they are.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.490
This is complex.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.450
I can't cover this
all in this workshop.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.230
But the idea that it's
connected to your sex

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.560
is this concept called
bioessentialism.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.130
And if you're leveling
up, more woke, going up

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.800
the triangle of wokeness,
this is the type of thing

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.270
you can say casually at a party.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.910
You can be like, I'm just
against bioessentialism.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.870
And then leave.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:17.715
Just leave straight away.

00:15:17.715 --> 00:15:20.090
You don't want to stay after
you say that in case someone

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.923
knows more than you.

00:15:20.923 --> 00:15:22.306
Because this has happened to me.

00:15:22.306 --> 00:15:23.680
Someone's there,
like, an expert.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.060
And I'm like, oh, shit.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.030
I just want to sound smart.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.530
So yeah, bioessentialism
is this idea

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.510
that your biology is essential
to your gender, and it is bad.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.700
It's not a cool thing.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.370
Right.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:37.160
Q.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.080
AUDIENCE: Queer.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.690
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Yay.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.090
Does anybody feel like
you can't use the word

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.260
"queer" if you're not LGBT?

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.410
A little nod, little
nod, some people?

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.090
But most of you feel like
it's grand to use it?

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:49.590
Cool.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.680
Well, I speak for
all LGBT people.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.732
And yeah, it is fine.

00:15:54.732 --> 00:15:55.440
It's fine to use.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.176
Absolutely.

00:15:58.176 --> 00:15:59.800
Not everyone would
agree with me there.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.460
Not everyone is going to agree
with everything I say here.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.340
The reason why it's fine to use
is because it's a descriptor.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.780
It describes things.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.369
Yes, it's a pejorative term
reclaimed by a minority group.

00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:11.910
And like other pejorative terms
reclaimed by minority groups,

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.510
you've no business using those.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:17.929
But this one, you do, because it
is a way to be more inclusive.

00:16:17.929 --> 00:16:20.220
So rather than saying "gay"
as a collective term, which

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.950
is not OK, you say "queer"
as a collective term.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:24.750
So I'm bisexual.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.910
And therefore, if you
were to say later,

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.520
I had a talk by a gay
woman about gay issues,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.555
that would not be true.

00:16:30.555 --> 00:16:31.680
None of that would be true.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.322
It wouldn't make
any sense to say.

00:16:33.322 --> 00:16:35.280
But you could say I had
a talk by a queer woman

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.470
about queer issues.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.890
Queerness is what connects
everybody in the community.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.320
Not everyone identifies that
way, because rule number one,

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.028
everyone's in charge
of their own labels.

00:16:45.028 --> 00:16:48.240
But most people do of
the younger generation,

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.970
and most people we talk to in
schools do identify that way.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:55.262
So say I'm a bisexual
woman, Julian's a gay man,

00:16:55.262 --> 00:16:56.970
but what connects us
is we're both queer.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:57.470
Yeah.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.850
That's like, the
multiple Venn diagram

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:02.470
of all these identities,
the very middle bit--

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:03.600
that's queer.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.970
So yeah, go forth
and use if you want.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:08.068
I?

00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:08.859
AUDIENCE: Intersex.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:09.520
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Intersex.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.450
Very good, yeah.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.288
So this is where we don't
love exact definitions.

00:17:14.288 --> 00:17:16.329
But I guess with intersex,
it can be quite handy.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.430
So it's having sexual
characteristics

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:22.280
not typically associated with
being either male or female.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.510
So this is where lots
of people think of sex

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.190
as being a binary concept--

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.070
men over here, women over here--

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.610
penises, vaginas--
nothing in the middle.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.050
All penises in one
box, and all vaginas--

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.610
oh, sorry.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:39.742
That was gross, sorry.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.290
Yeah, and there is
space in between.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.710
There is different
ways to have biology.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.370
And they don't fall into a
certain pattern all the time.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.200
And if that's the way you
are, then you're intersex.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.660
And it's not a birth defect.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.077
It's not an abnormality.

00:17:57.077 --> 00:17:58.660
It's the way skin
color and hair color

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.700
vary between individuals, so
do characteristics of sex.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.190
So this would also
be an argument

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.560
against bioessentialism.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.450
So that's really good to know.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.610
Just back on queer for a second.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.410
When I said that
it's more inclusive,

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:15.850
that allows you to sidestep
an issue called gaywashing.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.480
This is where a
gay man washes you.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:17.980
No.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:18.810
It's not that.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.270
It's not that.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.430
This is where you use
gay as a collective term,

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.100
and it's very difficult
and problematic

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.480
for the rest of the community.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.540
I don't know if you noticed, but
G is actually just one letter.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.950
There's a bunch of others.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.530
And this brings us to a
problem with this acronym being

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.840
actually a little limiting.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:39.730
It doesn't really
serve us that well,

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.210
because it's very front-loaded
with the most represented

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.920
identities.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.980
And if people's
attention span is

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.530
kind of front loaded as well,
and then you kind of trail off,

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.980
then you're losing some of the
least represented identities

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.650
as you go down the line.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.530
So it can be a limiting acronym.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.490
Great brand, though.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.031
Everyone recognizes it, so
you have to balance the two.

00:19:03.031 --> 00:19:03.530
OK.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.670
A.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.990
AUDIENCE: Ally?

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.640
BELLA FITZPATRICK: No.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.650
Asexual.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.570
Yeah.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:11.490
Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.310
Asexual.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.800
If you wanted, controversially,
to put in Ally,

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.730
you'd have to put in another A.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.980
AUDIENCE: Two As, [? right? ?]

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.770
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Two As, yeah.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:24.030
We don't, because allies are
a guest in this community, not

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.867
a member of this community.

00:19:25.867 --> 00:19:26.950
And that's very important.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:30.480
That's not to limit the
incredible, amazing things

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.980
that our allies
have done for us.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.710
But yeah, they're not really
part of the community.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.670
So when we do this in schools,
and we say, what's asexual?

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:41.220
Normally, the kids
say, and that's

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.450
when a strawberry
mates by itself

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:45.860
to make another strawberry.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.889
And we're like, yeah.

00:19:46.889 --> 00:19:47.430
I don't know.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:48.804
Made it to the
community somehow.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:53.950
No, of course not.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.400
This is when you don't
experience sexual attraction

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.270
to other people.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.470
So very similar coming
out story to LGB

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:06.090
where you get to a certain age,
people are talking about sex.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.457
Say, if you're a gay
guy in a group of lads,

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:10.290
and everyone's talking
about sex with women.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.245
And you're like,
ooh, no, thank you.

00:20:12.245 --> 00:20:14.370
It's like that, but you're
like, ooh, no, thank you

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.430
for all sex with other people.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.040
That doesn't mean they
won't have sex necessarily,

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.399
but they don't experience
that sexual desire.

00:20:23.399 --> 00:20:24.690
They might want to be romantic.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.460
They might have a
romantic attraction.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.370
So you could be
asexual, but romantic.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.800
And within being asexual, you
could be asexual biromantic,

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.900
panromantic, heteroromantic,
homoromantic--

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.970
so it's a whole thing.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:36.750
Yeah.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.180
Very under-represented,
though-- very under-represented.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.820
Does anybody watch "Riverdale?"

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.140
Yes?

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.380
OK.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.640
I mean, it's just
terrible, isn't it?

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.170
Yes, but it's great.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:49.870
It's awful.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.470
It's brilliant.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.892
So that's based on
a graphic novel.

00:20:55.892 --> 00:20:58.350
And in the graphic novel, one
of the characters is asexual,

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.100
but when they put it
on Netflix, he's not.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.780
Jughead-- and he's
hypersexual, yeah.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.290
Yeah.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.410
So that would be
disappointing, wouldn't it

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.410
be, if you were asexual?

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:10.730
And you were, like, oh,
represent-- oh, never mind.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:11.550
Yeah.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.710
So P.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:13.850
AUDIENCE: Pansexual.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.475
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Pansexual, of
course, an attraction to pans.

00:21:20.817 --> 00:21:23.150
One day, I'm just not going
to clarify after I say that.

00:21:25.801 --> 00:21:26.300
Yeah.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.539
So I mean, I can say that
because I'm bisexual.

00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:29.330
You can't say that.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.530
Don't make that joke.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:34.970
That's not part of your
woke hierarchy thing.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.200
So pansexual is a
brilliant term for people

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.550
who feel it reflects
them better than bisexual

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.305
because there is a common
misconception that bisexuality

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.180
means that you're
attracted to men and women.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.550
I'm sure that's probably
what you thought bisexual

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.450
was on your way in here today.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.160
It's not.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.070
It hasn't meant that
in a long, long time.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.334
So "bisexual" was coined in
1873 or something like that.

00:21:57.334 --> 00:21:59.250
And of course, that's
what it meant back then.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.080
But for a long time,
the bisexual community

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.470
is considered the
binary aspect of it,

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.530
linguistically, to mean your
own gender and other genders.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.830
So I'm attracted to women
and people of other genders.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:15.240
So it's inclusive of the many
genders we have in the world.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.222
But because most
people don't know that,

00:22:18.222 --> 00:22:20.180
you might be uncomfortable
identifying that way

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.640
and having people misconstrue
what you mean by that.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.150
So pansexual is a
great way to reject

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:28.310
gender binaryism-- this
idea that there's only

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.090
men and women.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.580
That's another term
for the party, right?

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.770
I just reject gender
binaryism-- and then leave.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.920
The leaving is important.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.060
And pansexual-- because
"pan" means all, right?

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.340
"Bi" means two, "pan"
means all-- like panorama.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.650
All of the rama.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.330
I just don't know, don't
know what that means.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.630
So it's kind of a newer term.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.089
If you take Google Trends that
kind of came up in around 2007.

00:22:54.089 --> 00:22:56.255
There's a lot of overlap
between the two identities.

00:22:56.255 --> 00:22:57.713
So one way you
could think about it

00:22:57.713 --> 00:23:02.180
is that pan people are gender
blind when it comes to picking

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.700
a sexual or romantic partner.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.450
But there's no animosity
between the two groups.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.240
We're friends.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.991
No dance-offs or
anything like that.

00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:11.490
All right.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:12.160
And plus?

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.660
AUDIENCE: [? Anything ?]
[? else. ?]

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.035
BELLA FITZPATRICK:
Anything else.

00:23:15.035 --> 00:23:15.910
Absolutely, yeah.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.250
Could not possibly cover it all.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.960
Anything else-- a lot
of other identities

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.950
fall under these
umbrella identities here.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.860
So, say, genderfluidity
or nonbinary-- most people

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.660
consider that to
fall under trans.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.880
Because trans simply means that
you were assigned incorrectly

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.380
at birth.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.950
That's what it means.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.836
It's not about being in the
wrong body, nothing like that.

00:23:36.836 --> 00:23:38.710
Try to steer away from
that type of rhetoric.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.880
It means you were assigned
incorrectly at birth.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.110
So what I mean is, you
got born, remember?

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:49.270
And a midwife looks at you
or a doctor looks at you

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:52.060
and decides on your
external genitalia

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.590
whether you're a boy or girl.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.740
And this works out just really
well for a lot of people,

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.440
like 98% of people,
this works out well

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.580
because they also identify
with that same way.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.492
And they feel comfortable within
that role that's in society.

00:24:05.492 --> 00:24:07.450
Or they might not feel
comfortable in the role,

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.260
but they still
identify that way.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:12.169
And this is called
being cisgender, OK?

00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:13.960
So if you were assigned
correctly at birth,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.460
you're cisgender.

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.890
Comes from Latin, means
"on the same side."

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.450
So "cis" means "on
the same side."

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.070
"Trans" means "on
the other side."

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.760
So you know trans fats?

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.260
Yeah.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.320
That's when the hydrogen atom's
on the other side of the carbon

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:27.190
chain.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:30.510
That's the only time I
use my chemistry degree--

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.990
four years for that sentence.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.470
So yeah, if you were
assigned correctly at birth,

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:36.310
you were cisgender.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.570
If you were assigned
incorrectly at birth,

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.010
you were transgender, OK?

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:43.030
So for every word of
something in the community,

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:45.070
there's a word for
everything that's not that.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.790
And that just allows us to
use more appropriate language

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.780
than saying normal or
something like that,

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.659
which would not be as ideal.

00:24:51.659 --> 00:24:53.200
But as I say, it's
very front-loaded.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.640
So there are other options.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.520
So QUILTBAG-- yeah?

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.290
It's another acronym.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:03.290
It's also the name of
my knitting circle.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:03.840
OK.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.810
So I think we've done
all of these letters

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.372
except for U. Anybody
know what U is?

00:25:10.372 --> 00:25:11.330
AUDIENCE: [? Unsure? ?]

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.790
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:12.240
Unsure.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.823
Yeah, exactly.

00:25:12.823 --> 00:25:14.050
Undecided.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.470
Yeah, curious, that type of
thing-- unsure, undecided.

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.470
This just allows us to
think about these letters

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.310
in a different way.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.720
Because linguistics
is really important.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.930
And the fact that we
front-load LGBT all the time

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.221
does actually impact how you
think about the community.

00:25:27.221 --> 00:25:29.190
So if you just mix it
up, that's really great.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.110
There are other ways,
as well, though.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.690
MOGAI.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:33.190
All right.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.398
Let's see what you know here.

00:25:34.398 --> 00:25:35.262
M?

00:25:35.262 --> 00:25:36.890
I'm only joking.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.190
You wouldn't know it.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:41.040
So it stands for
Marginalized Orientations,

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:43.510
Gender Alignments,
and Intersex people.

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:44.010
OK.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.010
Marginalized orientations,
gender alignments,

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:48.750
and intersex people.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.820
So marginalized orientations are
not heterosexual orientations.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.240
Marginalized gender
alignments are

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.810
when you're gender assigned
at birth does not correspond

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:58.980
to who you actually are.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.749
And intersex people
are intersex people.

00:26:00.749 --> 00:26:02.790
So it's kind of is a nice
way to cover everybody.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:04.830
That make sense?

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.750
Another one for
the party, right?

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:07.401
Yes?

00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:08.907
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:08.907 --> 00:26:10.490
BELLA FITZPATRICK:
Beautiful question.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.160
Really good question about--
people say this a lot,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.250
being gay is not the same
thing as being trans.

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:17.030
Yeah, OK.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:20.810
Why we do this is because
all of the LGBT community

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.830
fall under not the
assumption of the norm.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.810
That is what binds us.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.900
So when you're born, you get
assigned a label at birth.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.180
People expect you to
identify that way,

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.260
and people expect you
to behave that way.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.801
And part of that
behavior is that you

00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:37.340
will like the opposite sex, OK?

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.090
So this all falls under a
line of assumed identities,

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:44.180
of all of which the
LGBT community are not.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:46.790
There is unbelievable
similar experiences

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:51.500
between people who are LGB
and people who are TQIAP.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.210
It's also about autonomy, right?

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.080
Right to self-identify, right
to decide your own labels--

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.090
and we all struggle under that.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:02.060
So we are all united
by this otherness,

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.370
this marginalization.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:08.960
And the LGBT rights movement was
started by trans women of color

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.500
who were sex workers.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.230
And that's a really
important point.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.680
At no point was T
tacked on anywhere.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.980
Maybe in the
marketing department,

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.800
who I've yet to meet,
of the LGBT community--

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.390
I need to have a chat with them.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:27.140
But at no point did
it get tacked on.

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.420
It was always the one community.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.150
Because for a long
time, it was so taboo.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.400
And it would just mean
your instant death

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.380
if you came out as trans.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.260
So that's where you have
ideas around drag culture

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.500
where there's a lot of drag
queens were actually trans.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.990
Now we can think about them
as very separate identities.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.880
But at the beginning,
that was always

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.220
in the gay bars, that was
always with the lesbians,

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.590
that was always with the bi
people, the queer people,

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.020
the people who didn't get to
decide how they were assigned

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.670
at birth, because
they had genitalia

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:58.370
that looked like none of
the above options, which

00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:59.580
is male or female.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.700
And they had unnecessary
cosmetic surgery

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.470
done on them as babies.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.540
And that falls under
the line of not

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.760
being allowed to
identify yourself

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.320
and not having the autonomy.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.926
So what connects us
all is this experience.

00:28:12.926 --> 00:28:14.300
We are all connected
in this way.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:14.800
Yes.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.440
We have different experiences.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.821
I have a different experience
from a trans woman.

00:28:18.821 --> 00:28:21.070
I have a different experience
from an intersex person.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.810
I have a different experience
from an asexual person.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:27.230
But I have more similar
experiences with them

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.210
than I do with cis,
straight people.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:32.260
So hopefully that
answers a little bit.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:32.810
OK.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:35.480
So this is what we're trying
to get people to care about.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.240
And there's a few principles.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.220
Learning is easier
than unlearning.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.980
OK, so learning
something from nothing

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.680
is way easier than undoing
social conditioning, which is

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.240
what we have to do in ShoutOut.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.770
You can't be right,
but you can be wrong.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.197
This is the shit,
but this is true.

00:28:53.197 --> 00:28:55.280
Not everything I've said
here today will be right.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.920
It has been updated
since we walked in.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.600
We are constantly evolving.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.290
And again, it's all gray area.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.509
So you can't be right
about your definitions.

00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:06.050
You can't be right about your
understanding of other people's

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:07.260
experiences.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.260
But you can be super wrong.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.870
You could say it in the wrong
way that really excludes

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:15.380
a lot of people, or you can
say it in the most updated way.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.942
But you're never right, OK?

00:29:16.942 --> 00:29:17.900
Just bear that in mind.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.160
I'm not right right now.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.540
No one's right.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.649
You can only be right
about your own experiences.

00:29:22.649 --> 00:29:24.440
And then knowing is
not the same as caring.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.770
And this is key, OK?

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:31.940
Being an ally is not about
knowing your LGBTQIAs

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.420
from your MOGAIs,
your trans demi guys

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.880
from your asexual
heteroromantics.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.390
It's not about that.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.600
It's about not making
assumptions and taking people's

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.480
life experiences at face value.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.640
But we have to come
up with different ways

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.360
to teach our
different audiences.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.860
So we have our
student workshops.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.870
We have our teachers,
parents, guardians, youth

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:54.740
workers workshops.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.404
And we have other adults--

00:29:56.404 --> 00:29:57.320
you are other adults--

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.820
corporates, right?

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:02.270
Other adults-- something
like medical professionals

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:03.860
are other adults--
that type of thing.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.480
And we have a different
tactic for each one.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.650
This is basically manipulation.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.660
Different forms.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.240
So in the student workshop,
we use social norm theorem.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.070
This is where you
present a change

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.070
that you want to see as
having already happened.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.410
It's used in the States
a lot for things like--

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.060
they'll have signs
up in college being

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.040
like, "80% of people
who go out drinking

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.420
have a big meal beforehand."

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.200
And that's just not true, right?

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.700
But then people are like, oh,
that's the normal thing to do.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.700
I'll do that.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.710
So we kind of present
LGBT acceptance

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.770
as being the norm, that
if you want to get on well

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.810
in your workplace,
you should try

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.380
to be accepting and celebratory
of other identities,

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:47.390
be they LGBT or otherwise,
and that this has happened.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:48.230
It is lies.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.200
But look, there you go.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.960
So our workshop with students,
because we go into schools

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.370
and we're not teachers,
we have to, first of all,

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:58.430
authoritize ourselves.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:01.290
I actually don't think
that's a word, but look.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.550
And we do that by creating
a contract just up

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:06.320
on the whiteboard in school.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.530
And we say, can we all
agree that we'll be sound,

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:12.272
that we'll be confidential
if anybody says anything,

00:31:12.272 --> 00:31:13.730
and that we don't
talk out of turn?

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:16.210
And that just kind of puts
you in a authoritative stance.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.420
And then you have
to humanize yourself

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.003
by giving your own
personal coming out

00:31:19.003 --> 00:31:22.670
story or your personal story
on your journey as an ally.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.760
Then we educate them by telling
them the definitions for LGBT.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.682
We get them to practice their
empathy by putting themselves

00:31:28.682 --> 00:31:30.890
in the idea of other people's
shoes or other people's

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:31.490
positions.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:33.512
We put that into practice
in scenario groups.

00:31:33.512 --> 00:31:35.720
So we put them into groups
and decide, what would you

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.590
do if your friend came out?

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:38.480
What would you do if
you witnessed bullying?

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.510
And then we empower them
by letting them come up

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.100
with the next agenda
for how they're

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.300
going to make their school
an LGBT-inclusive place.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.640
And this is key--

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.869
so important.

00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:49.910
This is really important
that kids feel ownership

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.110
over the culture
of their school.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.240
The school is not four
walls that they walk into.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.470
They are the school.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.060
And even if it's
just in their class

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.800
or their group of
friends, they can

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.900
make an LGBT-inclusive bubble.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.791
And they have the
power to do that.

00:32:01.791 --> 00:32:03.290
So this is a really
important point.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:05.577
Any suggestions they make,
we feedback to the school.

00:32:05.577 --> 00:32:07.910
And this is where we find out
a lot of troubling things,

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:09.530
such as kids not
being able to bring

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:12.230
same-sex dates to
the dance, girls

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.727
not being able to have hair
shorter than their shoulder,

00:32:14.727 --> 00:32:17.060
trans kids being forced to
wear the uniform that they're

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:17.819
uncomfortable in.

00:32:17.819 --> 00:32:19.610
And we get to feed that
back to the schools

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:21.780
and hopefully see some change.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.590
Then with teachers, parents,
guardians, and youth workers,

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.570
gently does it, OK?

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.660
They already care a shit ton.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.850
That is the technical term.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.570
They are there because
they care so, so much.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:39.020
I have never really had to
get a teacher on-site caring

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.710
about the well-being
of their students,

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.210
even if they disagree with me,
even if they think everything

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:46.550
I say is liberal hogwash,
they still really care.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:48.400
And if you keep on
bringing it back to,

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.190
oh, our only goal here is
kids not killing themselves,

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.590
then they get on board
with you pretty quickly,

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:58.340
even if they don't agree with
the methods you've suggested.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.200
So we like to reassure them.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.130
This is solvable.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.280
These are solvable problems--
a few steps, you'll be grand.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.230
Educate them, put
it in practice,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.940
and empower them to
go forward-- so kind

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.220
of similar to the student
workshop in a lot of ways.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.870
And then other adults--

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.280
different, right?

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:17.670
We use intellectualization to
make you value the concepts,

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:18.170
OK?

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:19.046
That's the idea here.

00:33:19.046 --> 00:33:21.378
Because most of the time,
when we're doing other adults,

00:33:21.378 --> 00:33:22.550
we're doing corporates.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.680
Most people who work in
corporates go to college.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.980
We have a value system
around higher ideas,

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.867
and we just exploit
that by making

00:33:29.867 --> 00:33:32.450
it seem like a difficult thing
to get your head around so then

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:33.830
you will value it.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.630
The main issue we
have with corporates

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.940
is that people come
to seminars and think,

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.550
I am going to be
patronized by someone

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.620
who's going to tell me
to be nice to gay people.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.360
And I know to be
nice to gay people.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.520
So we need to make sure
that they know that it

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.790
is more in-depth than that.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.690
They are going to
learn something.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:49.940
It is going to be interesting.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:53.430
They are going to be able to
use it at a party and walk away.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.570
So the first thing we need
to do is horrify them, OK?

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.800
This is the first step--

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.294
get them to care.

00:33:59.294 --> 00:34:00.710
And that's where
we bring in stats

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:04.700
like three times more attempted
suicide by LGBT young people

00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.760
compared to their cis,
straight counterparts, twice

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.810
as much self-harm, and four
times the amount of depression,

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.210
stress, and anxiety.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.080
Get them to care.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.150
Get them to realize,
post-marriage equality,

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.777
we have not solved everything.

00:34:18.777 --> 00:34:19.610
Then we soothe them.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:20.159
It's OK.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.810
It's OK, corporates.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:25.010
It'll be all right.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.431
That, there are
things we can do.

00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:27.389
There's an action plan.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:28.310
There's an agenda.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:29.969
It'll be fine.

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:31.760
Then we engaged them
with complex theories.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.350
Bamboozle them.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.540
And then we horrify them
again so they leave,

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:37.790
and they want to do something.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:41.659
That's when we talk about the
unnecessary "normalization"

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:43.909
surgeries done on intersex
young people, which

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:46.909
is the next big thing for the
LGBT community in Ireland,

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:47.750
just to stop these.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:50.460
And they have been stopped
in other countries.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.783
This is very behind
the curtain, guys.

00:34:52.783 --> 00:34:55.199
I feel a little uncomfortable
that you know all my tactics

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:56.989
now, but look.

00:34:56.989 --> 00:35:03.120
So how we go about
intellectualizing it is,

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.570
rather than explaining
each letter in a definition

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.480
in a silo, we consider
them as falling somewhere

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.810
on a series of spectra, OK?

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.190
And this is really important
because everyone's reflected

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.529
in these, not just LGBT people.

00:35:16.529 --> 00:35:18.570
Straight, cis people are
reflected in these, too.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.361
And once you can see
yourself in something,

00:35:20.361 --> 00:35:22.710
suddenly, you care about
it a little bit more.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:25.094
So I'm not going to go
through the full whack of what

00:35:25.094 --> 00:35:26.760
we do, because it
takes about two hours,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.130
and the sun is shining,
so I won't do that.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:32.860
But this is just a general
idea of what it looks like.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.950
So we do this on a flip
chart on a white board.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:35.790
It's very organic.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:37.050
We never really do
it on PowerPoint.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.175
Because I think there's,
like, a Pavlovian response

00:35:39.175 --> 00:35:41.480
to PowerPoint, which
is to fall asleep.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.930
So I'm apologizing if
this is happening now.

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.420
But we consider these
spectras like sexuality,

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.850
sexual orientation, gender
expression, gender identity,

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.190
and biological sex--

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.810
all of them fall on a spectra.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.600
Some of them need to be a
triangle because there's ideas

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.932
outside our binary concepts.

00:35:56.932 --> 00:35:58.890
But we lure them into a
false sense of security

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.598
first by having them
just straight lines,

00:36:00.598 --> 00:36:02.280
and then we add
the triangle later.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.250
And they're like, oh, no.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.660
They'll be OK, though.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.340
The first thing we
do is differentiate

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.987
sexuality from sexual
orientation because, of course,

00:36:10.987 --> 00:36:11.820
these are different.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.754
But people use them
interchangeably a lot.

00:36:13.754 --> 00:36:15.420
The reason we like
to differentiate them

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.600
is that we're not talking
about sexuality in schools.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.391
It doesn't come up.

00:36:18.391 --> 00:36:19.910
It doesn't happen.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.480
And people use it to deny
our access in schools.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:24.790
They say, I don't
just don't think

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:27.320
you should be talking
about sexuality in schools.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.040
What does that possibly
got to do-- this

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.210
is every mother's accent.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.690
What does that possibly
got to do with school?

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.840
And they're there
to learn and blah.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.760
So we say, well,
we're not doing that,

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.051
because sexuality is different
than sexual orientation.

00:36:41.051 --> 00:36:44.580
Sexuality is how much you like
sex, the type of sex you like,

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.360
the frequency of the sex.

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.090
Sexual orientation
is with whom you

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:49.742
might want to have that sex.

00:36:49.742 --> 00:36:51.200
So when we talk to
young people, we

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.366
talk about sexual orientation--
more often than not,

00:36:53.366 --> 00:36:55.010
romantic orientation.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.360
We don't talk about sexuality.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.610
We do in the corporates, if
you ever want to book one,

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.610
talk about sexuality.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.890
But I guess the important
point around sexuality

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.420
is just how much we
moralize sex, right?

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.900
So asexual people--
they get extremely

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.120
discriminated against,
saying, you don't have sex?

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.230
You're weird then.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.019
Or you haven't met
the right person.

00:37:14.019 --> 00:37:15.060
You don't know your body.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.726
Or you're not being
sex positive enough.

00:37:16.726 --> 00:37:19.092
All this really annoying
rhetoric for them,

00:37:19.092 --> 00:37:20.550
which denies them
their right to be

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:25.480
in charge of their own
label, rule number one.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:29.130
So you can consider
sex positivity

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.722
to be a movement
that is about being

00:37:30.722 --> 00:37:32.430
comfortable with any
amount of sex you're

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.102
having because no one is.

00:37:34.102 --> 00:37:36.060
There's too little sex,
and you should feel bad

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.518
about that, because
you're a loser.

00:37:37.518 --> 00:37:38.790
You're not having sex.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:39.850
And there's too much sex.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.280
You should feel bad
about that because you're

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.600
a little slut, right?

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.000
And then there's this
perfect amount of sex

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.250
that you can feel good
about having, and no one

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.420
knows what it is.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.850
So we all just feel
bad all of the time.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.250
Welcome to Ireland.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.110
So we like to talk
about this a little bit

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.330
and get people to realize
that, as long as you're

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.820
comfortable and
consensual and happy,

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.620
and that's all that matters.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.470
And there's a couple of ways
you can talk about these issues.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:08.160
You can build on ideas that
people already have, build it

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.240
up, blocky blocky, or you
can flip the idea on its head

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.350
and go with the most complicated
issue first and build down.

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:20.820
And this is where we have our
pyramid of queer concepts.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:23.520
So at the bottom, love is love.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.960
Isn't love grand?

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.640
Love knows no gender.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.990
Love is love.

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:29.010
Everyone knows this.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:30.300
Most people accept this.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.160
If people don't
accept this, they're

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.285
not really going to get on
board with a lot of what

00:38:34.285 --> 00:38:35.480
I'm saying anyway.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.230
I don't know why they
came to my workshop.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:39.450
So yeah, love is love.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:41.610
Tout it around a lot.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:45.360
I absolutely despise it,
but that's another workshop.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.075
Love is not love.

00:38:46.075 --> 00:38:47.700
People are people,
and love isn't love.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:51.079
That's their takeaway
message from this talk.

00:38:51.079 --> 00:38:52.620
But it's a really
good place to start

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.610
because people, in general,
accept that love is love

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.030
and that love is grand.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:00.657
You do you.

00:39:00.657 --> 00:39:03.240
That is my general way of saying
people can express themselves

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.100
however they like.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.170
Men can wear nail varnish-- ooh.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.340
Women can be butch--

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.490
that type of thing.

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:12.602
A little less people
accept that, but more

00:39:12.602 --> 00:39:14.310
than the next thing,
which is everyone is

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:15.750
in charge of their own label.

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:16.860
People don't like that.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.270
People love gatekeeping.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.960
They love it.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.210
It's their favorite thing.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.340
So if you, say,
had a gay man who

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:27.310
sleeps with multiple genders,
sleeps with women very often,

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.310
people would love to deny
them that they're gay.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:31.140
But they're in charge
of their own label.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.750
Now, are they not using
the label bisexual because

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.740
of the stigma around
being bisexual?

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.240
Maybe.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.110
Probably.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.250
Let's work on that stigma.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.080
Let's not chastise the
person for the label they've

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:40.680
chosen, OK?

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.500
Everyone's in charge
of their own label.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:46.290
We get people to accept that,
then they have less of a

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.480
back and forth about, but
if you're this, and then

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.150
how can you be that if--

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:54.610
and we're like, well, everyone's
in charge of their own label.

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:56.350
Sex isn't the same as gender.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.630
Way less acceptance
around this because we

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.370
like to interchange--

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:01.810
twist it all up a lot.

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:05.080
But when you kind of get into
the concepts and the idea

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.720
that there's always been
third genders in society

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.401
since record in every
anthropological study ever.

00:40:11.401 --> 00:40:13.900
Every society has found third
genders-- that's male, female,

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.702
and third genders.

00:40:15.702 --> 00:40:18.160
In Native American culture,
it's called being two-spirited.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.160
In Southeast Asia, it's
called being hijra.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.794
The Maori have
their own version.

00:40:21.794 --> 00:40:23.710
That's been around for
a very, very long time,

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.630
and that is not
connected to sex--

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.935
sex being a set of
biological traits.

00:40:28.935 --> 00:40:30.310
So when people
don't accept this,

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:31.900
they're being bioessentialist.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.990
But you can get a
lot of people there.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:36.760
Gender isn't binary.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.770
That's a little bit
trickier because we've

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.690
been touting this--
men and women, the men

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:42.170
and women of this country.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:44.390
And all the forms
say male and female.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:45.880
There is no other option.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.510
There might be
options on cool forms,

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:52.990
but not government forms.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:56.240
Eventually, you might get
people to accept down in the

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.490
"you do you."

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.977
You kind of bring that up
and say, well, ultimately,

00:40:59.977 --> 00:41:01.310
what does it take away from you?

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:03.700
And if you have to
go down that route,

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.310
it's not ideal,
because we are trying

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:09.460
to aim a little bit higher
than tolerance-- trying to aim

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.720
for acceptance and celebration.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.720
But sometimes, you have
to settle for tolerance.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.400
You can't do this
and be a purist.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.030
It just wouldn't work.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:22.480
So you have to put all
your woke ideals aside

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.494
because you have
to bridge that gap.

00:41:25.494 --> 00:41:26.660
And that's what we're doing.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.576
We are standing in between
the two communities

00:41:28.576 --> 00:41:30.880
and bridging the
gap as best we can.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.090
And then either is sex--
that's the toughest one.

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:35.740
Sex isn't binary, either.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:38.290
There's all these other
traits you can have.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:40.240
There's different
ways to be a person.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.060
You can have
ambiguous genitalia.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:43.840
That's a terrible
term, but it's what is

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.910
used in the medical industry.

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:49.032
You can have XY chromosomes
normally, typically

00:41:49.032 --> 00:41:51.490
associated with being male,
but you can have XY chromosomes

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:52.687
and have a vagina.

00:41:52.687 --> 00:41:53.395
And this happens.

00:41:53.395 --> 00:41:54.900
It's not something I've made up.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.830
And in that case, is that
person male or female?

00:41:57.830 --> 00:41:58.930
We don't know.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.140
What is being male or female?

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:00.970
We don't know.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:04.780
It's all a series of
spectrums and different ways

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.840
of looking at things.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.830
We like to think about
it as very, very strict.

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.770
And that's because
it's easy to teach kids

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:14.920
about strict ideas that
fall into certain boxes.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.750
That is an easy way
to think about things.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:18.970
But if you study biology
at a higher level,

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:21.070
you realize that most of
biology is people being

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:25.044
like, [MUMBLES], I don't know.

00:42:25.044 --> 00:42:26.360
It's all very weird.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.220
I don't know.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.020
And that's very confronting
for people to not feel

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.780
like they know the truth and
that they've been lied to.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.487
And you haven't
lied to every time

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.320
you've been told there's
only men and women.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.130
You haven't been lied to.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.046
You just haven't been
told the full truth, OK?

00:42:41.046 --> 00:42:41.980
And that's OK.

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.440
So you can either build up, or
you can flip it on its head,

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:47.080
start with the fact the
biological sex is not binary,

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:47.890
and move downwards.

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:50.740
Because if biological sex
isn't binary, what is gender?

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.400
What is sex?

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.930
Who does it care
who you love, yeah?

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:53.916
You can go that way.

00:42:53.916 --> 00:42:55.040
So it's one way or another.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.700
And it's all about the
audience that you're with,

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.310
the type of people they are,
and the tactic you think

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:01.780
is going to work on the day.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.240
So you decide at the time.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:08.230
So I'm very uncomfortable
that you know all my secrets.

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:12.590
Now, I would like to ask
if you have any queries.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.090
Thank you.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.583
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:21.559 --> 00:43:22.350
This is a bad idea.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:22.891
AUDIENCE: Go.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.020
AUDIENCE: Thanks
very much for that.

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.770
I thought it was really
interesting and insightful.

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:34.067
I had a question
about, I guess, what

00:43:34.067 --> 00:43:36.650
you're describing as people are
in charge of their own labels.

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:40.430
And there's a lot of
challenges to that, too.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:44.840
You keep brushing up against the
limits of self-definition from

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.420
parents saying, oh,
it's just a phase to--

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.610
I don't know-- jokes
going around like, oh, you

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.050
can identify as another gender.

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.360
Well, I'll identify as a chair.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.710
Ha-ha.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:54.710
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:57.774
AUDIENCE: And how do
you respond to that?

00:43:57.774 --> 00:43:58.940
What's your tactic for that?

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.315
BELLA FITZPATRICK: The classic
one we get on the internet

00:44:01.315 --> 00:44:04.249
is, I identify as an
attack helicopter.

00:44:04.249 --> 00:44:04.790
I don't know.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:06.590
All the anti-trans
people had a meeting

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.390
and decided that was
the funniest thing

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:09.710
to say you identify as.

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:11.430
So yeah, we get that a lot.

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:14.360
And I guess there's a
lot to unpack there.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.250
I'm bisexual, so I've had a
lot of, that's just a phase.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:18.350
I've had a lot of that.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:21.120
Now, I came out at nine.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.250
I am now 28.

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.810
It is a long phase.

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:26.560
But so what if it was?

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.490
Ultimately, so what?

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.590
Should we be such
gatekeepers, or should we

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:31.799
leave that door open?

00:44:31.799 --> 00:44:34.340
And should we allow people to
explore their gender identities

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.800
and their sexuality and their
sexual orientation and all

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.811
these-- and their gender
expression, as well?

00:44:38.811 --> 00:44:41.060
I think we should be far
more fluid about these things

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.300
because that allows
people to not

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.840
have to be so sure before
they say anything about it.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.202
And that pent-up
anxiety is where

00:44:50.202 --> 00:44:52.160
we have what's called
minority stress, the fact

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.460
that you're in a minority group
being a stressful experience

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.890
even before you experience
any sort of discrimination.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:03.990
So I just think the answer to
this is to not care as much.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.790
But that doesn't mean you
get away with not knowing

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:08.840
how to be respectful.

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.310
Those two things
aren't the same.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:12.830
Just saying I don't care
how people identify,

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:14.720
that's not helpful.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.380
We should all care about what
makes someone comfortable

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.050
and what makes someone's
movement through this world

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:23.270
easier, especially when
what we're asked to do

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:25.500
is so easy on our behalf.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.800
Ask people's
pronouns, not assume

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.640
if they're straight or gay or bi
or whatever, not slagging them

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.450
for what they wear.

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:34.250
These are really
simple things to do.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.950
It's like the way
buildings are accessible.

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:39.514
That's an easy way to make
some people's life-- are they

00:45:39.514 --> 00:45:40.180
in the minority?

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:40.670
Yeah.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:41.750
Does that mean we
shouldn't care about them?

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:42.620
No.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.730
So I don't think there's any
limits to self-identification.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:48.530
The question is, what
does that mean you're

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:49.940
asking other people to do?

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.689
If you're saying, I
identify as nonbinary,

00:45:51.689 --> 00:45:53.990
or genderfluid, what are you
asking other people to do?

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:57.207
You're asking them to
use maybe a name that

00:45:57.207 --> 00:45:58.790
isn't on their birth
cert and pronouns

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:00.140
that you might
have not heard of,

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:02.348
like "they" and "them" or
"ze" and "zem" or something

00:46:02.348 --> 00:46:03.110
like that.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.930
If you identify as
an attack helicopter,

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:08.570
what are you asking
people to do?

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:11.840
Are you asking them to
have a helicopter landing

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.630
pad for their work?

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:15.320
Maybe you are.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.160
I don't know.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.860
But if it's something I can
do, I'll actually do it.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.552
I don't care if that's
how you identify.

00:46:20.552 --> 00:46:22.760
But you're just being
facetious when people say that.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:23.760
Of course they are.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.480
But the way to counteract
that obvious, ridiculous claim

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.530
is to be accepting.

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:33.290
Kill them with kindness, as
my granddad would always say.

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:36.410
What can they come back as you
with if you say, oh, you're

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:37.520
an attack helicopter?

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.290
Right, so what pronouns
do you use, though?

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:41.640
That's the answer.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.840
Thanks for the question.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:43.548
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:46.499 --> 00:46:47.040
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:47.956
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Hi.

00:46:47.956 --> 00:46:50.650
AUDIENCE: Do you have a way
to reach people that are not

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:52.635
in school and not in corporate?

00:46:52.635 --> 00:46:53.635
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:46:53.635 --> 00:46:56.860
So we do a lot of works
with youth groups and scouts

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.020
or early school
leavers, as well.

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.881
But we have now started to talk
about-- this is my colleague

00:47:01.881 --> 00:47:02.380
Clare.

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:05.290
We've started talking about
having open meetings for people

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:06.910
who want this information.

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:09.730
Important to note, though, that
we're not an LGBT organization

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:10.780
for LGBT youths.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.010
We're not youth workers.

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:17.590
So we don't have, like, come to
our cafe and be LGBT with us.

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:19.210
Because there are
other places that

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.940
do and do that really, really
well, such as BeLonG To.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.940
We're there for people who
just want to be educated.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.750
We're a training organization.

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.500
So we are going to have more
open training, say, parents

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.250
bring your kids and
that type of thing.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.790
So yeah, we're going to move
towards more events like that.

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:35.560
Absolutely.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:37.170
Any other questions?

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:37.990
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:39.310
Great talk, first of all.

00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:41.870
I was wondering-- so
in my personal life,

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:44.950
I think I see more
and more of resistance

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:46.900
against trans
inclusivity, especially,

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.810
from within the LGBT community,
paradoxically, like TERFs,

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:50.440
specifically.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.800
And I wanted to ask, have you
run into these people at all?

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.110
Or do you feel you
run into them more?

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:57.550
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Oh, yes.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:00.160
Does everybody know
what TERF means?

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:03.640
Trans Exclusionary
Radical Fuckers.

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.430
The F actually stands
for Feminists, sorry.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:08.140
Trans Exclusionary
Radical Feminists.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.110
It's just a misnomer because
they're not feminist.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:16.000
This is this movement which
is bioessentialist, eh?

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.724
Which is this idea that you
can't just throw on a dress

00:48:20.724 --> 00:48:22.640
and be a woman, because
at the end of the day,

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.690
you have a penis, and
you have XY chromosomes,

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:27.580
and that's all
there is to it, OK?

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:30.650
That's the type of
rhetoric TERFs will use.

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:31.820
It's very troublesome.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:36.160
We don't have as many in Ireland
as there seems to be in the UK.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.430
I don't really know why that is.

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:42.370
Really, feminists you
would have respected

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:44.770
have this stance, such as
Germaine Greer, although, I

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:47.590
don't think anybody's respected
her in a long while, right?

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:49.150
I haven't.

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:51.500
So she's a massive TERF.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.400
Now, it coming from
within the community

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.200
is so hurtful and confusing.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.840
And I think that's got to do
with a certain marginalization

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.720
of our lesbian community
not being as embraced

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.420
by the wider LGBT community,
even though they're

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.170
the first letter.

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.090
They should get all--

00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:08.990
they should be as
front-loaded as possible.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:11.110
And so they kind of
veered off and then

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:17.180
were kind of worried about
their spaces being incringed on.

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.220
It is very worrisome.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.530
And I have large, large
arguments with them on Twitter.

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:24.790
And I would not recommend
this if you enjoy being happy

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.460
or like having any free time.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.620
I actually would not
recommend Twitter at all

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.830
if you enjoy those two things.

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:36.890
The key here is
to really rip off

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:38.810
their mask of what
they are presenting,

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:42.500
which is this terribly
polite, just wanting

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.770
to have a conversation piece.

00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:44.990
That's what they always say.

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:48.380
There's this group in the UK
called Woman's Place UK who

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.790
are an anti-trans organization.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:51.290
They're a hate organization.

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:53.540
They've created a
document that looks

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:55.730
like it's trans-inclusive
for teachers

00:49:55.730 --> 00:50:01.000
that is just hate-filled,
and that is despicable.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.980
They have all this rhetoric
around just being very, very

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:04.480
polite.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.910
And ultimately, when you
are a marginalized group,

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.160
you don't care about politeness.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.930
You don't care about Ps and Qs.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:12.782
You care about
systematic oppression,

00:50:12.782 --> 00:50:13.990
and they are holding that up.

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:16.240
So I don't care if they had tea
and biscuits at their meeting.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.114
They're a hate group.

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:18.800
They're a hate organization.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.700
So if you get them to
reveal that by pushing ever

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.109
so slightly, get
them to take off

00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:25.150
that mask-- because a lot
of times, they're like,

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:26.080
we're just having a meeting.

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.038
It's freedom of speech.

00:50:27.038 --> 00:50:29.350
There was tea and biscuits.

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:31.550
I can't believe all this
outrage that there is.

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:34.640
Can't women meet and have
tea and biscuits anymore?

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:37.634
And you're like,
yeah, cool, you can.

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:39.800
But not when your whole
purpose of your organization

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.340
is to marginalize a
very marginalized group.

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.160
And they conveniently
ignore the statistics

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.070
around how vulnerable
trans people are.

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:51.310
The average life expectancy
of a trans woman of color

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:54.090
in the United States is 35.

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:56.230
35, OK?

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:57.970
You're talking
about 1% of people.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:00.100
They are not a threat to you.

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.500
If you're talking
about bathrooms, right?

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:05.230
People should act
appropriately in bathrooms--

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:06.670
the end, OK?

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:08.770
You should not know about
other people's genitalia

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.329
in a bathroom, because if--

00:51:10.329 --> 00:51:12.370
they're using the bathroom
wrong if you found out

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:13.490
about their genitalia.

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:14.590
That's essentially it.

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:16.937
So I really like
to push them on it.

00:51:16.937 --> 00:51:18.520
So then their mask
slips a little bit.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.978
So then people on
the periphery who

00:51:19.978 --> 00:51:24.907
are sort of seeing their point
are like, oh, you're just hate.

00:51:24.907 --> 00:51:25.990
You're actually just hate.

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:28.239
You have a nice facade, but
you're actually just hate.

00:51:28.239 --> 00:51:31.060
And that allows you to get more
people to realize the bigger

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.592
picture here.

00:51:33.592 --> 00:51:34.560
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.226
BELLA FITZPATRICK:
One at the very back.

00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:39.640
AUDIENCE: I can speak
to that because I

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.760
was a student teacher.

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:45.877
I was at an event last week
where there was a children's

00:51:45.877 --> 00:51:49.210
art competition and was run--

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:50.880
I like what you
said about, I belong

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.400
to the [? ING ?] LGBT group.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.400
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.440
Fantastic group.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.065
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:55.065 --> 00:51:57.430
And I feel confident,
and that gives me courage

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.440
as well, you know?

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:01.940
By removing off the
hating of the trans--

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.970
I heard this dreadful
story at the meeting,

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:08.160
at that awards ceremony,
where-- now, I wonder,

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.714
am I saying this--

00:52:10.714 --> 00:52:13.600
a child, a five-year-old
child with a penis

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:18.599
came to school dressed with
a dress on with its mommy.

00:52:18.599 --> 00:52:20.140
BELLA FITZPATRICK:
Their mommy, yeah.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:23.780
AUDIENCE: And standing by
said, beat that out of him.

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.022
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Aw, Jesus.

00:52:25.022 --> 00:52:27.270
AUDIENCE: And so that
mother was distressed,

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:30.540
and the school principal
was distressed.

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:34.750
And they don't know want
to do about that situation.

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:37.720
So I think, yeah, I just
wanted to-- this is,

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:40.120
on the ground, what happens.

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.635
Now, particularly, [INAUDIBLE]
at schools, more children

00:52:43.635 --> 00:52:45.495
can present as they
want to present.

00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:46.890
BELLA FITZPATRICK: Mm-hmm.

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:50.200
Yeah, that's such a
troubling, but unfortunately,

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.170
common story.

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:56.415
TENI just recently published
a report on gender norms

00:52:56.415 --> 00:52:57.790
in primary schools,
which is very

00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:02.500
troubling about how much we
force kids into gender norms.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:07.750
And this young child who might
be trans or might like dresses,

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:08.440
you know?

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.360
Those aren't necessarily
the same thing,

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:12.610
and both should be accepted.

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:16.570
Ultimately, parents have a
right to raise their kid however

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:18.790
they want, but not
within child abuse.

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:21.070
And forcing your child
to express themselves

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:23.260
in a way that causes them
distress is child abuse.

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:25.840
And we need to recognize
that and be more confident

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:27.850
in our place in the right, OK?

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:31.284
So we deal with schools
where parents have said,

00:53:31.284 --> 00:53:32.950
my kid's going through
a bit of a phase.

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:34.150
They're using
they/them pronouns.

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:36.108
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't indulge.

00:53:36.108 --> 00:53:38.202
And we want teachers to
know they have the right

00:53:38.202 --> 00:53:40.660
to say, well, actually, whatever
you do in your own house--

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:43.480
but in this school, we'll
respect the young person

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:45.370
because young
people have rights.

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:46.740
Young people have autonomy.

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.430
And they are allowed to petition
the school board with regards

00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.930
to this.

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:51.490
And they are allowed to go
to the children's ombudsman

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:52.810
if they are unsatisfied.

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:55.690
Because under the Equal
Status Act of 2015,

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:59.620
continuous purposeful
use of incorrect pronouns

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.880
can be considered harassment.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.260
So we shouldn't allow
what we consider

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.350
to be personal preference
on how you raise

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:09.760
your kids to allow child abuse.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.593
So that's what I would
say in that instance.

00:54:11.593 --> 00:54:13.110
I hope that kid is OK.

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:13.850
Thanks.

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:18.718
So should we stop?

00:54:18.718 --> 00:54:20.770
SPEAKER 1: Clap
her again, please.

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:24.120
[APPLAUSE]
