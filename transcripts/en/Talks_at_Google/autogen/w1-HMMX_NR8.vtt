00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.491
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:06.490
MARIE KONDO: Hello, everybody.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.540
My name is Marie Kondo.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.380
Call me KonMari.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.710
KonMari.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.560
Yes.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.670
I am a Japanese
organizing consultant.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.530
I usually visit client home and
give her one-to-one organizing

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.820
lesson.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.345
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:33.720
INTERPRETER: So
first of all, let

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.905
me start how I usually
work with my clients.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.105
So this is the first example.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.480
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.360
INTERPRETER: So
she is-- the lady

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.280
who lives in this room--
she is in her 20s.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.016
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:04.849
INTERPRETER: You already
see in this picture

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.420
that she has full of
stuff from her bed.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.340
Actually, that's actually her
bed, but you might not see it.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.790
And she also had a lot
of stuff on the floor.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.160
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.670
INTERPRETER: And
she first told me

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.890
that, don't you think the
bedroom is just like a storage?

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.880
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.980
INTERPRETER: So when she comes
home after work, she never,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.640
ever feels relaxed in her room.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.530
MARIE KONDO: But how
about after my lesson?

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.600
Voila.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.700
It looks so neat and clean.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.420
Of course, nothing
is on the floor.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.560
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.360
INTERPRETER: So my job is
to consult how to organize,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.445
and I've been doing this
job for more than 10 years.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.640
MARIE KONDO: Characteristics
of my consultation

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.250
is thus-- my clients
never go back to the mess

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.816
because they have been
transformed to the organized

00:02:35.816 --> 00:02:38.564
person.

00:02:38.564 --> 00:02:46.000
Today, I'm going to
tell you how to make

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.130
your house ordered in a way that
will change your life forever.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:05.860
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.860
INTERPRETER: So before I
start telling you what to do,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.640
let me tell you how
I start my job, how

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.920
I discovered this method.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.194
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:03:21.194 --> 00:03:22.610
INTERPRETER: I was
only five years

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.680
old when I got very interested
in how to organize things.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:40.135
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:03:40.135 --> 00:03:41.760
INTERPRETER: So I
was always picking up

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.100
every single issue of the
magazine that my mother was

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.450
subscribing, and the
magazine was about how

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.820
to organize the house.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.380
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.290
INTERPRETER: So when
I turned 15 years old,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.720
I started a serious consultation
to how to organize things.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.300
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.480
INTERPRETER: There was
a best-selling book

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.720
in Japan titled "Technique
to Get Rid of Things,"

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.910
and I read that book.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.890
And I discovered the method.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:34.610
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.100
INTERPRETER: So
you would probably

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.850
wonder how I started
researching organizing things.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.730
First, I started reading every
single book published in Japan

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.570
on organizing.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.490
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.250
INTERPRETER: And I also
keep organizing things.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.000
I worked every single
day organizing things.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.630
MARIE KONDO: Today, my own room.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.220
Next day, my brother's room.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:11.220
Next next day, my sister's
room followed by the kitchen,

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.600
living room, bathroom, my
friend's room, friend's room,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.210
friend's room, my
classroom, classroom,

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.796
classroom of the school.

00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:23.540
And again, get down
to my own room.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.550
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.680
INTERPRETER: So I spent
most of my teenage years

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.320
organizing things
just like that.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.480
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.950
INTERPRETER: And I started
an organizing consultation

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.540
business when I was 19.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.410
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.570
INTERPRETER: I also picked this
topic in my thesis at college.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.200
MARIE KONDO:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE] So it's

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:13.330
safe to assume that I am
a crazy, tidying fanatic.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.680
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.080
INTERPRETER: So you
are perfect to think

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.126
that I'm a fanatic
organizer at this point.

00:06:23.126 --> 00:06:24.000
MARIE KONDO: Yes.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.050
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.900
INTERPRETER: So
I'd like to present

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.250
KonMari method,
which I discovered,

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.290
to everybody here today.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.210
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.800
INTERPRETER: So let me start.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.590
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.570
INTERPRETER: So number
one of KonMari method.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.100
MARIE KONDO: Tidy in
one shot as quickly

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.640
and completely as possible.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:17.040
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.250
INTERPRETER: If you think
you have to tidy around

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.150
you everyday, gradually,
little by little,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.630
that's completely wrong.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:38.610
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:43.720
INTERPRETER: Because you need
a shock that changes your mind

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.880
into tidying your things.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.500
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.180
INTERPRETER: So you
want to finish it

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.240
in a very short period of time.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.832
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:08:01.832 --> 00:08:03.540
INTERPRETER: So the
first important thing

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.475
is to set the deadline
of organizing.

00:08:06.475 --> 00:08:15.789
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:18.080
INTERPRETER: Of course, you
can set the deadline in one

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.010
week, assuming that you're
going to do that every day,

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.350
or you decide to
do every weekend

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.820
and set the deadline
in three months.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:43.179
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]
Special event nowadays.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:45.230
INTERPRETER: So don't
think about tidying

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.930
is an everyday event.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.100
It's a special event,
just like a festival.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:09:00.020
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.900
INTERPRETER: So the number
two item in KonMari method

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.770
is how you're going to do it.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.680
MARIE KONDO:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE] Sort

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.576
by category, not by location.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:26.370
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.490
INTERPRETER: It's very
common to make this mistake

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:33.530
if you try to organize things
in a specific location.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:46.580
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.550
INTERPRETER: It
never ends if you

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.980
try to tidy up in just
one portion of the closet

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.290
or one portion of
the living room.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:01.500
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.410
INTERPRETER: The right way to
do it is to organize by category

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.410
and do it quickly.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:20.067
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:10:20.067 --> 00:10:21.650
INTERPRETER: Well,
for example, if you

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.930
decide to organize
your clothes first,

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:28.810
take out all the clothes
in your house in one spot.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:33.040
Make a big pile of all the
clothes you have in your house.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:48.559
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:50.100
INTERPRETER: So just
in the same way,

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.750
if you decide to
organize your books,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.770
take out all your books
from your bookcase

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:59.380
and pile them up in one
location in the house.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:04.224
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:11:04.224 --> 00:11:05.640
INTERPRETER: I
know it looks hard.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.220
It's really messy.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.370
I'll tell you why
you need to do this.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:19.970
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.720
INTERPRETER: If you bring out
all your stuff, books, clothes,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.480
in one location,
you visually realize

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.970
how much books, how
many clothes you have.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:40.430
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.550
INTERPRETER: In daily life,
we rarely understand how much

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.140
stuff we have around us.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:12:02.602
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:12:02.602 --> 00:12:04.310
INTERPRETER: So it is
a great opportunity

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.330
if you bring out everything
in one spot, realize

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.130
how much stuff you have,
how many books you have,

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.100
so that you can decide
which one you want to keep,

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.940
which one you
really need to keep,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.640
and which one you
can get rid of.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:36.810
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.200
INTERPRETER: So from this point,
the next step you have to take

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:48.870
is to sort them or separate
them between the things you need

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.140
and the things you don't.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:57.520
And the criteria I
recommend in my method

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.040
is a little bit unique.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.310
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.550
INTERPRETER: That's number
three of KonMari method.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.790
MARIE KONDO: Selection
criterion-- does it spark joy?

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.562
[SPEAKING JAPANESE] spark joy.

00:13:18.562 --> 00:13:19.430
This.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.360
INTERPRETER: So
does it spark joy?

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.130
This is the key word.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.310
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.810
INTERPRETER: I know I definitely
feel weird air in this room

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.560
right now.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.980
MARIE KONDO: Don't worry.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.650
I'm used to this reaction
from the audience.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:40.720
INTERPRETER: So this is a really
common reaction in my seminar.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:14:03.100
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.900
INTERPRETER: So what
I mean by saying,

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:10.080
spark joy-- I can explain
exactly what it is.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.940
So if you look at one thing,
you should question yourself

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.210
if that thing makes you happy.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.470
Does it make you impressed?

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:43.330
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.560
INTERPRETER: Many people
always think first which

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.820
one to get rid of, but
it is much more important

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.350
to think which one
to keep, which one

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:57.830
you want to keep and live
together from now on.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.030
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.470
INTERPRETER: So I will tell
you how to make a decision.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.400
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.090
INTERPRETER: So point number
one, make sure you touch it.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.140
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.830
INTERPRETER: Take
every single item

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.080
you can think of in your hand.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:28.870
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.600
INTERPRETER: And imagine
how your body reacts

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:38.330
to that moment, how you feel
when you touch the item.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:47.970
MARIE KONDO:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE] Spark joy.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.330
INTERPRETER: So spark
joy, this is the reaction

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.760
from your body, the reaction
you feel from your body

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.300
when you touch the
item you should keep.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.850
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.340
INTERPRETER: Just like that.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:09.590
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.710
INTERPRETER: So if you feel
every single part of your body

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:18.100
faces up when you touch the
item, that's the right feeling.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:25.380
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.820
INTERPRETER: So
on the other hand,

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.250
if the item doesn't give
you any inspiration,

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.203
for example, this one.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:37.130
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.440
INTERPRETER: You
started feeling down.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.060
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.170
INTERPRETER: Your whole
body started feeling down.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:17:04.099
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.190
INTERPRETER: I know
you are skeptical,

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.530
but if you really
try to do this,

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.160
you realize how your
body really reacts.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.030
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.530
INTERPRETER: Definitely after
this seminar, when you go home

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.190
tonight, try part of it.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:42.770
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.420
INTERPRETER: So let me go
over my three basic methods--

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:52.320
do it quickly in a short amount
of time, and sort by category,

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:58.560
and find if the item sparks joy.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.110
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]
"Life-Changing Magic of Tidying

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.330
Up." [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.280
INTERPRETER: So this
is my book, and if you

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.900
need to know more
about it, if you'd

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.810
like to know more about it,
please pick up this book.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:20.380
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:23.130
INTERPRETER: So I definitely
want every one of you

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:27.675
to read my book, but I will
give you one more technique.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.280
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.110
INTERPRETER: So this is the
right order of organizing.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:51.540
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.350
INTERPRETER: There is
definitely the right order

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.290
when you organize stuff,
and this is how it goes.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:02.800
Start from clothes, books,
documents, miscellaneous items,

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.040
then mementos.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.760
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.550
INTERPRETER: Make sure
you follow this order.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:27.200
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.770
INTERPRETER: It
often happens when

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.920
you are going through
old photos, or mementos,

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.150
the items you were
given from a mother,

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.950
it always stops you
from organizing.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:47.761
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:49.260
INTERPRETER: That's
why I definitely

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:53.410
recommend you this order
because this order gives you

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.510
the sense of spark joy feeling.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.970
You definitely learn that
feeling with your body.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:13.620
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.700
INTERPRETER: So in this order,
while you start with clothes,

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:23.290
your body and your mind get
trained with spark joy feeling.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.520
And by the time you
reach to mementos,

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.920
you're already good
at how to do it.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.540
You already know how
to go through mementos.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:38.980
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:43.050
INTERPRETER: I'd like you to
try my method with this order,

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.090
hopefully, tonight.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:50.790
MARIE KONDO: This KonMari
method always works.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:55.750
I hope you would really try it.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:09.850
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:14.620
INTERPRETER: So I explain
all my method to you by now,

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:19.620
so I would like to open the
floor for a Q&amp;A session.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.300
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.008
INTERPRETER: Should
we sit in the chairs?

00:21:23.008 --> 00:21:23.820
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.230
So there's two mics.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:28.110
There's one mic over there,
and there's one mic over there

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.230
if you'd like to line up.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.860
I'll get it started just
because I'm right here.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.730
So I wanted to know, how
do you deal with somebody

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.790
who has a child, like
a one-year-old child,

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.490
and there's toys everywhere?

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:52.320
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:21:52.320 --> 00:22:01.182
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:22:01.182 --> 00:22:02.890
INTERPRETER: Well,
this is not difficult.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.460
It depends on the
child's age, but I

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.230
have two different methods
depending on the child's age.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.930
The borderline is
about three years old.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:22.390
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.030
INTERPRETER:
Because if the child

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.190
is younger than three years
old, most of the cases,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.920
parents just
organize their stuff.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:36.280
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.200
INTERPRETER: But if the child
is older than three years old,

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.600
it's time to train them
how to organize things,

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.300
and they're capable of it.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:57.330
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:00.520
INTERPRETER: And the important
thing at this point is

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.080
do not tell them to
organize the toys.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.130
Tell them to
organize the clothes.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:08.840
That's important.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:24.139
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:23:24.139 --> 00:23:25.680
INTERPRETER: Well,
I'll tell you why.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.570
Because clothing is something
you always put on every day,

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:33.730
so if you learn how to fold
the clothes that you always put

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.270
on and put it back into the
clothing at the right spot,

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:41.810
that's the best way that they
learn they need to organize

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:44.910
and the importance
of organizing things.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.940
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.940
INTERPRETER: So number
one key is to teach them

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.516
how to fold the clothes.

00:23:56.516 --> 00:23:57.950
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.130
Next question.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.330
AUDIENCE: So I
understand your method

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.490
in terms of getting yourself
into a mindset where you only

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.170
have to do this once.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:10.960
But I was curious how you deal
with things that we acquire,

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.090
either things that
we acquire ourselves

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.680
or things like gifts
that come into the house.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.890
Do you do an inventory annually?

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.240
Or do you just not let
them come into house?

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:40.460
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.057
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:24:44.057 --> 00:24:45.890
INTERPRETER: In her
case, she doesn't really

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.740
have any rules for that.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:57.830
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.590
INTERPRETER: Because her
method is completely based on

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:05.040
if you were impressed, if
you get inspired by the item.

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:16.085
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:25:16.085 --> 00:25:17.960
INTERPRETER: Because it
depends on the person

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.010
how often you want to
organize or how much stuff you

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.050
need to keep around yourself.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:43.160
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.160
INTERPRETER: Because my
method, again and again,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.090
is based on if you get inspired,
if you get that spark joy

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.620
feeling, that doesn't
really bring you back

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.310
to the crowded situation.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:00.380
It's not really depending on
how often you should acquire

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.456
or how you get the
stuff in your room.

00:26:03.456 --> 00:26:04.420
MARIE KONDO: Yes.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.150
MALE SPEAKER: Next question.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:07.530
MARIE KONDO: Next question.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.130
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.180
Thank you so much for coming.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.370
The question is, I have a
lot of things that I need,

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:18.190
but I don't like or
they don't inspire joy.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.700
How do I find the
balance between keeping

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.210
versus discarding them?

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:31.070
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.160
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.650
INTERPRETER: For example,
what kind of item?

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:40.271
AUDIENCE: GMAT study books and
like very old kitchen utensils

00:26:40.271 --> 00:26:41.270
that I haven't replaced.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:47.550
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:26:47.550 --> 00:27:03.730
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.800
INTERPRETER: If you judge those
items are necessary for you

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.770
right now, that means those
items are making you happy.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:19.530
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.790
INTERPRETER: So even if you're
not inspired by those items,

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.650
but if they are necessary
to you right now,

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:26.560
you should keep them.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.101
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:27.101 --> 00:27:37.920
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.840
INTERPRETER: So
one recommendation

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.190
I can give you is that if
the item doesn't inspire

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:47.190
you, if you don't get
the special feeling,

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:50.350
try to talk it into it.

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:54.390
Try to convince yourself
that this is a good thing,

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:56.230
this is a good thing for you.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:07.844
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:28:07.844 --> 00:28:09.260
INTERPRETER: If
you keep doing it,

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.760
even if the item
doesn't inspire you,

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.710
you start getting a
positive feeling about it.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.712
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:28:17.712 --> 00:28:19.170
INTERPRETER: So in
this way, you'll

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:23.404
probably find all the items you
have in your house inspiring.

00:28:23.404 --> 00:28:24.070
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.520
Thank you.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.520
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.300
MALE SPEAKER: Next question.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.840
AUDIENCE: Have you
ever encountered

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.160
in some of your clients--
my question is basically

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.290
about shared spaces.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:43.030
If you are sharing a living room
or the kitchen with somebody,

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.590
maybe you want to keep it
clean or the things that

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.392
are important for you
are not that many,

00:28:49.392 --> 00:28:51.600
but the things that are
important to the other person

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.590
are the most of them.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.089
And they're just
all over the place.

00:28:54.089 --> 00:28:58.330
So is there like a
way to make it work,

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.330
so you just have your space?

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:01.120
How does this--

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.370
INTERPRETER: Can you speak up?

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:02.870
I'm sorry.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.970
I didn't catch the
whole question.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:11.570
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious
about how to deal with a case

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.670
when most of the stuff actually
does not belong to you,

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.670
so it's not your
decision to keep it.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:28.440
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.510
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.090
INTERPRETER: So
those are belonging

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.120
to someone else, correct?

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:47.034
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:29:47.034 --> 00:29:48.450
INTERPRETER: You
should prioritize

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:52.180
to organize your own
items before you start

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.840
thinking about someone else.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:30:09.010
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.340
INTERPRETER: From my
experience in the past 10 plus

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.510
years of my career,
I've definitely

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.940
seen several clients
who keep saying that,

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.610
oh, I tried to tidy up
my room, but my husband

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:21.360
doesn't cooperate.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.240
My kids don't really corporate.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.350
But if you look at clients
saying something like that,

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:30.615
they are the ones who are
not tidying up correctly.

00:30:30.615 --> 00:30:34.340
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.120
INTERPRETER: So this is true.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:56.527
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:30:56.527 --> 00:30:58.860
INTERPRETER: I know you have
to organize stuff no matter

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.630
what, so the important thing
is you organize your stuff

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:04.060
and put them in your space.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.160
So separate the space
with other people.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.310
So you take care of
your stuff in your space

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:12.860
and leave the other
stuff and other spaces

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.530
to the other people.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:21.401
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:22.900
INTERPRETER: And
you shouldn't worry

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.750
about the space
allocated to other people

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.600
because that's up to them.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.360
That's their own business how to
use them, how to organize them.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:42.260
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:46.710
INTERPRETER: Of course, you can
set a few rules like anything

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.930
shouldn't leak out or
anything should be exposed,

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:50.620
stuff like that.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.827
But that's the best way
to do with other people.

00:31:52.827 --> 00:31:53.660
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.618
MARIE KONDO: Thank you.

00:31:54.618 --> 00:31:55.880
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.838
INTERPRETER: Good luck.

00:31:58.399 --> 00:31:58.940
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.450
Thank you for coming.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:03.285
Since you talk here about
how to initially purge

00:32:03.285 --> 00:32:06.480
the items you have, just sorting
into what to keep and not,

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.440
do you also have
recommendations for then

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.860
how you go about organizing the
items that you decide to keep?

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.420
Or do you leave that up
to the individual person?

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:25.290
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:26.870
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.870
INTERPRETER: Yes,
there is a clear rule.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:38.060
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:42.270
INTERPRETER: So make
sure to organize items

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.820
in the same category
in the same spot.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:33:00.390
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:05.960
INTERPRETER: I often
see at people's houses

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.660
the items in the same
category here and there.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.400
They're kind of
scattered around.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.870
So my point is to put all of
them together in one spot.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:31.470
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:35.380
INTERPRETER: So as I showed you
earlier, organizing by category

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.010
is very important.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.870
And another important thing
I can definitely tell you

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.220
is how to fold the clothes.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.450
That's definitely a big key.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:45.330
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.010
Thank you.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.209
MARIE KONDO: Thank you.

00:33:48.209 --> 00:33:48.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:49.810
Thanks for coming here.

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:52.740
And thanks for taking the
time to write the book.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:58.360
I have a friend who is
a pretty serious hoarder

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.720
with a lot of stuff.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.520
And when you ask him,
do you need this stuff,

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.850
can you throw this stuff away?

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.945
The answer is, oh, I
might need it later

00:34:06.945 --> 00:34:10.610
or I have this grand plan
to use this in such a way.

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:12.929
But of course, that never
happens, and stuff just

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.150
keeps accumulating.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.590
I wonder if you have worked
with clients like that,

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:20.870
and what you say to them,
and what the outcome is.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:37.690
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.695
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:34:40.695 --> 00:34:42.870
INTERPRETER: Probably
you're asking me the advice

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:47.350
to somebody who don't
even bother organizing.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.190
AUDIENCE: No, actually
it's pretty organized.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:51.210
He can find things.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.540
It's just a huge
amount of stuff that--

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.165
INTERPRETER: Oh, so
it's not cluttered,

00:34:55.165 --> 00:34:57.274
but he has a lot of items.

00:34:57.274 --> 00:34:58.940
AUDIENCE: It is a lot
of items, and it's

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.912
kind of creeping into the
corridor space and so on.

00:35:01.912 --> 00:35:03.370
You can't walk
around in the house.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:04.825
You know?

00:35:04.825 --> 00:35:10.570
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:22.320
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.460
INTERPRETER: If
he is my client, I

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.620
don't think it's important for
me if he has too many items

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.400
or not.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:36.429
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:35:36.429 --> 00:35:37.970
INTERPRETER: I think
it is much, much

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.440
more important to figure
out if that person is

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.770
happy with that amount of items.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:51.920
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.710
INTERPRETER: So I would
probably recommend that person

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:59.840
to imagine the ideal
lifestyle for that person.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:31.104
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:36:31.104 --> 00:36:33.270
INTERPRETER: I think your
friend needs to figure out

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:37.780
what kind of lifestyle
he or she wants,

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:43.330
what's the realistic life
your friend wants so that he

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.030
or she can figure out
how much stuff to keep

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.620
or what to keep, what
not to keep, et cetera.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.450
And this is a very efficient
way of mindset for anybody.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.770
If you have somebody like
that in your family members,

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.120
friends around you, this is
really highly recommended.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.590
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.390
Thank you.

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.650
MALE SPEAKER: So we have
time for one more question.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.190
Those of you that were lucky
enough to get here early

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:11.970
and got a book, Marie will sign
them in the back afterwards.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.875
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:37:15.875 --> 00:37:16.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.850
My question is related to
something that as engineers we

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:23.790
think sometimes a bit too
much, how frequently we

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.322
should run a task.

00:37:25.322 --> 00:37:27.030
Like should we run it
in an [? online ?],

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.650
think about it
running all the time.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.120
Or should we run it in a batch?

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.970
So what do you think
about organizing?

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.380
What's the ideal frequency
that you'd advise?

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.700
Like should we think always
be running in our mind?

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.520
Oh, I just picked a pen.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.380
It's probably not
that useful anymore.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.824
So should we always
be thinking about it?

00:37:42.824 --> 00:37:44.740
Or should do it something--
at the extreme end

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.800
would be like once in a year,
which is what I do typically

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.730
at the end of the year
in December, I think,

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.313
all right, this is
a bag for Goodwill.

00:37:51.313 --> 00:37:53.475
This is a bag to throw.

00:37:53.475 --> 00:37:57.366
And that's like the minimum we
do, so when should we do that?

00:37:57.366 --> 00:37:58.990
Should we do it at
the end of the year?

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.932
Should we do this
every end of the day?

00:38:00.932 --> 00:38:02.390
Or should be
constantly be thinking

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:05.590
about every time we encounter
and thinking at the house

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.990
or at workplace?

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:18.640
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:25.060
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:30.530
INTERPRETER: Well, the only
answer is just do it one time.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:37.420
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.980
INTERPRETER: Talking
about when you should do,

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.800
my answer is right now.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.516
It can be any time,
but do it now.

00:38:45.516 --> 00:38:59.840
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.550
INTERPRETER: Well,
the reason is it's not

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:06.660
for tidying up your house,
tidying up your living space.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.710
It's all about how you want
to spend the rest of your life

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.870
from now on.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:17.620
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.730
INTERPRETER: So I
highly recommend you

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:22.470
to do it right now, ASAP.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.700
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.661
INTERPRETER: Good luck.

00:39:26.661 --> 00:39:27.590
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:29.900
Any closing comments?

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.930
Or anything else that
Marie wants to say?

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.340
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:50.940
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.670
INTERPRETER: I know the
topic is kind of puzzling.

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:57.650
It's very unusual,
but as a conclusion,

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:00.680
I would like to tell you why.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:14.390
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.630
INTERPRETER: So I know every
one of us has so many items.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.950
There are so many
items in our life.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:24.430
But figuring out what
items you have right now

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:29.520
is figuring out how you are
going to live your life.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:45.560
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.860
INTERPRETER: So my method
is telling you to examine

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:51.590
every single item in your life.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:54.550
That means you
examine, you assess

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:58.220
your lifestyle and the life
you want to live from now on.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:20.570
MARIE KONDO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:22.850
INTERPRETER: So once you
find out the inspiration

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:27.390
from every item you have, you
probably learn the inspiration

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.500
on how you want to
live, how you want

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.680
