(dramatic music)

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.417
(gasps)

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:19.519
- Where am I?

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.587
Hey man, who are you?

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.687
What's going on?

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:22.856
- You were in a coma, be quiet,

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.391 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm watching the latest
episode of Fargo.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.558
- What, Fargo?

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:28.194
That's not a television show.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.529 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's a movie like Lethal
Weapon or Training Day.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.366
- Shh, those are both TV shows.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.868
- What?

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.101 align:start size:94% position:6%
No, man, I'm talking about
movies in the theater.

00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:37.603
You're talking about
TV shows on television

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:39.405
like Entourage or
Sex in the City.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:40.606
- Shut the fuck up, man.

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.141 align:start size:84% position:16%
Those are both
movies, by the way.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.443
- What?

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:45.778 align:start size:97% position:3%
No, movies are
full-length-cinematic releases

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:49.048
like Teen Wolf, or
Scream, or Catfish.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:52.251
- Those are all currently
television shows on MTV!

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.986
Shut the fuck up!

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.221
- Quit fucking with me, man!

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.722
- I'm trying to watch Fargo!

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.925 align:start size:97% position:3%
- TV shows air episodically,
weekly, on television

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.060 align:start size:88% position:13%
like CHiPs, or Baywatch,
or 21 Jump Street!

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.395
- Movie, movie, movie!

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.396
- You're fucking
killing me, man!

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.230
Movies are different.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.631
Movies are longer.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.801 align:start size:97% position:3%
Movies are things like
Taken, Hannibal, Rush Hour,

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.404
Psycho, Limitless,
Shooter, Westworld!

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.406
- Shut the fuck up, asshole!

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.907
- God damn!

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:16.742
- Those are all TV shows!

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.311
- Fuck you!

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.646
(screams)

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:22.015
- Dammit, that's piss!

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:23.082 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I can't deal
with this anymore.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.317
Shut the fuck up.

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:25.818
I just want to read
my god damn book.

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:27.253
Where's my copy of
Girl on the Train?

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.087
Where is it?

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:28.987
It's always next to me.

00:01:28.987 --> 00:01:31.357
- Are you talking about this?

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.291
- Why is that so shiny?

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:33.760
- Because it's a fucking movie.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.261 align:start size:94% position:6%
- That's not a fucking
movie, man, that's a book.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.130 align:start size:94% position:6%
- It's a movie, and guess
what, they ruined it.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.197
- How dare you?

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:39.465
It's a perfect book!

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:40.366
- They ruined the movie!

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.169 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Oh fuck!
(flatline beeps)

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.171
(sighs)

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.375
And now I missed
the end of Fargo!

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.377
(flatline beeps)

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:55.448
- Hey guys, do you know Three
Musketeers is a candy bar now?

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.282
Guys?

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.785
Fuck.
