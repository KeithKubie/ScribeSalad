00:00:00.491 --> 00:00:02.875
(music)

00:00:03.408 --> 00:00:05.908
- [Anna Umland] I'm here in storage with

00:00:05.908 --> 00:00:09.200
Giorgio deChirico's 1913 painting,

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.783
The Anxious Journey.

00:00:10.783 --> 00:00:15.783
1913 was a breakthrough
year for Giorgio deChirico.

00:00:15.908 --> 00:00:19.950
This work is probably
one that was included

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.325
in a exhibition that
deChirico staged for himself

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:27.158
in his studio in Paris,
and among the people

00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:31.075
who came to see that
show was the great poet

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:34.158
and critic and champion
of Avent Garde art,

00:00:34.158 --> 00:00:36.116
Guillaume Apollinaire.

00:00:36.116 --> 00:00:40.783
In October of 1913,
Apollinaire wrote about

00:00:40.783 --> 00:00:42.908
his experience of deChirico's paintings,

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:47.033
and he remarked on these
painting's absolutely

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:49.616
modern quality and then on their

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:52.700
strangely metaphysical character.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.075
deChirico makes you think
about how painting can be

00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:59.325
not about a reality perceived, but about

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.700
a reality imagined.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.616
What you're looking at is a
series of architectural arcades

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:09.908
arranged in a space that has ways,

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:12.241
that since the Renaissance
artists had used

00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:15.241
to construct a plausible represenation

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.991
of a believable negotiatable space.

00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:19.200
You have the orthogonals.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.700
You have recessive characters,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.825
but combined in a say that
really doesn't add up.

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:26.616
These colonnades lead
nowhere, or you don't

00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:28.366
have the opportunity
to know where they lead

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.575
because the pallet is so somber

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:34.533
and shadows fill almost
very single one of them

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.283
other than this one
little sliver of blue sky

00:01:38.283 --> 00:01:40.866
and brick wall, or that of course,

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:44.242
this looming, puffing locomotive,

00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:47.158
which many people have
described as ominous

00:01:47.158 --> 00:01:50.033
or threatening, akin to a caged beast,

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.116
and there definitely is something of that

00:01:52.116 --> 00:01:54.408
psychological, emotional tension

00:01:54.408 --> 00:01:58.491
by positioning this locomotive
behind this brick wall.

00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:01.492
Following Apollinaire's
lead, a number of the

00:02:01.492 --> 00:02:04.658
surrealist painters and
poets like Andre Breton,

00:02:04.658 --> 00:02:08.533
or Rene Magritte seized
upon deChirico's work

00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:13.533
as a key precursor for what
surrealist painting should be.

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:17.033
Arrested movement, convulsive beauty

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:20.075
of these strange dream
states, and I think that's

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:22.241
one of the things that The Anxious Journey

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.825
so beautifully exemplifies.

00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:29.491
1913 remains as a year
where so many of his

00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:33.208
signature motifs are first seen.
