00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.630
So now that we know that we have four

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.150
mobile constraints, that we can't violate when we're building

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.500
and designing mobile applications our users are going to have

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.550
a really bad time. Let's deep dive into these four.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:12.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll talk about what happens when you actually do get

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.070
them wrong, and what the implications are to your user in your app.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.239
&gt;&gt; So let's get started with a quiz.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.460
&gt;&gt; So we have an application here on the screen. And as you can

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.480
see a user is using this media player application to actually play a video.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.800
So you can see a couple of things, it's on a three g network. The power is about

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.600
half, it's 3:20 pm I guess, the application is in

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.610
landscape mode. And they've played about halfway through the video. We can also

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.140
see that the app has defaulted to 1080p resolution to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.970
play this video. So there is a ux fail happening

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.270
here. I want you to think about which one of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.150
these elements that I've highlighted are contributing to this fail, and

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.020
select it on the screen.
