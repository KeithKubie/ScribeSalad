00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.530
So if we dig around the page with the developer

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.640
tools, we'd see a lot of pixel widths. Including the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.290
main content of the page, which is inside this page

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.020
element. And you'll notice it has a width set in

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.290
pixels. If I turn it off, well, the page is

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.250
still not working properly. But at least we've started. Instead

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.270
of this fixed code let's use a different technique, Fluid

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.760
Layout. Fluid Layout means I should stop fixing all those

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.010
widths in absolute terms like pixels or points

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.330
and start thinking in terms of areas of screen

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.840
real estate. Percentages of the widths, for example, and

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.240
sizes based on the initial font or Em units.
