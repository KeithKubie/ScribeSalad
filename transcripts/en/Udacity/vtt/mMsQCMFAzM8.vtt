00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Verification, calibration, validation--to which of these three aspects

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
do these three problems belong.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The first one--our actual car has a braking time of more than 6 seconds. Think about Unit 5.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The second one--the orbit of the spacecraft around earth is not closed. Think about Unit 2.

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And the third on--without harvesting the amount of fish reaches 10‚Å∑ tons. Think about Unit 4.
