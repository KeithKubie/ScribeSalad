00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Should you fix a bug as soon as you spot the problem?

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.000
Always be sure to keep all details in your head

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
because writing them down takes too much time?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.800
Explaining the problem--maybe to a teddy bear,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800
to a colleague, or a friend--can be helpful.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.000
And finally, up to 50% to 70% of software development effort

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
is spent on validation and debugging.
