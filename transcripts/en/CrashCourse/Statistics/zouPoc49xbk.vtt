00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.070
Hi everybody!

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.070
I’m Adriene Hill.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.889
Welcome to Crash Course Statistics!

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:04.889
And by everybody.

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:06.700
I don’t mean that literally.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.639
There are give or take 7.6 Billion people
in the world.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.610
When we hit a million views...that’s still
only point-zero-one (0.01%) percent of the

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.140
population.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.200
So maybe Hi Almost Nobody!

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.860
Statistics are everywhere.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.789
Some are explicitly part of our lives….like
...batting averages in baseball...expected

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.670
goals in soccer...or the percent chance the
meteorologist gives that it’ll snow...They’re

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.940
in the stone-faced warning from your doctor: “this procedure has a 2 percent chance of failure."

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.380
Statistics make a very good case for NOT buying
lottery tickets.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.560
Other times statistics are less obvious--but
still with us.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.500
Insurers use them to set their rates.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.680
Researchers use them to try to figure out
if a drug can actually help regrow the hair

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.250
on the top of your head.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.019
Or if there’s a correlation between dog
ownership and stress reduction.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.039
Big retailers hire statisticians...to figure
out how to market to us better.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.390
Apparently Target can pinpoint when a pregnant
woman might be due to give birth--based on

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.019
a change in what she buys.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.070
Stores also use statistics to figure out how
to stock their shelves.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.270
Turns out a whole lot of people rush to buy
strawberry pop-tarts before a hurricane hits.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.640
So in advance of storms, Wal-Mart stocks up. For real.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.660
And statistics is central to some of the cool technology we use everyday, like Siri and Alexa.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.220
Mark Twain popularized the quote...“There
are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.420
and statistics.”

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.659
And...yes statistics can be used to lie.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.860
But they can also be used to help find the
truth.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.380
The purpose of statistics is to to find the
truth.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.860
Statistics allow us to uncover simplicity...inside
complexity.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.220
To make sense of our world.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.409
And part of what we’ll do in this series--is
figure out how to tell the difference between

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.229
statistics used for good.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.229
Understanding.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.229
Truth-telling.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.750
And the statistics that we should question.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.150
That are being used to mischaracterize the
world.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.130
Understanding how statistics works, even if
you aren’t running regressions for fun….on

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.979
the weekends...can help you ask good questions
about other people’s studies and discoveries.

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.120
I’m Adriene Hill.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.329
More than likely….I’ll be your host for
the series.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.610
There is a one-in-74.8 million chance I will
be killed this year by an asteroid or other

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.480
near earth object collision.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.800
When I’m not hanging out here.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.170
Or researching the odds of death by freak
accident….I work in public radio.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.180
I also co-hosted Crash Course Economics.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.300
Where a statistically significant number of
you who commented didn’t like how...and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.270
how much ...I moved my hands.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.750
So I’ll work on it.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.460
I’m excited for this series.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.780
Some of these things I’ve thought about.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.860
Some, I’ll be learning along with you.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.860
It’s gonna be fun.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.690
Cause at the end of the day statistics are
about us.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.460
People.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.480
And our world.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.640
And how we relate to each other.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.760
I’ll see you next week!
