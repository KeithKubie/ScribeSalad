00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.150
Voiceover: Let's think about
the market for real estate

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.428
in a given city.

00:00:04.428 --> 00:00:05.957
Here on the vertical axis

00:00:05.957 --> 00:00:07.471
I have plotted rent in terms of dollars

00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:09.042
per square foot per month.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.615
Here on the horizontal axis,

00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:13.693
is essentially the quantity of square foot

00:00:13.693 --> 00:00:16.157
square foot per month
available in millions.

00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:18.256
This is 1 million, 2 million, 3 million,

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:20.224
4 million, 5 million.

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:23.199
Here in blue we have the demand curve.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.536
You see as the price is high,

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:30.694
one way to view it is that the demand

00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:33.199
for square footage is low and as the price

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.741
is low the demand for
square footage is higher.

00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:37.678
But what I really want to
focus on in this video,

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:39.364
is viewing the demand curve as the

00:00:39.364 --> 00:00:41.203
marginal benefit curve.

00:00:41.203 --> 00:00:43.401
Marginal benefit curve.

00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:47.203
When that first incremental square foot

00:00:47.203 --> 00:00:49.437
that is added to the market,

00:00:49.437 --> 00:00:51.701
that has a huge marginal benefit

00:00:51.701 --> 00:00:54.647
where people are desperate
to get an apartment.

00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:57.750
To get someplace where they
could rent and they could live.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.004
So it has a huge marginal benefit.

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:01.672
Then the marginal benefit for every

00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:06.168
incremental square foot starts to go down.

00:01:06.168 --> 00:01:08.310
Likewise, we can look at the supply curve.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.801
We're going to look at this as the

00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:11.557
marginal cost curve.

00:01:11.557 --> 00:01:13.860
The marginal cost curve.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.082
The marginal cost of that very first

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:19.287
incremental square foot for the suppliers

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.472
for the landlords in the city is $1

00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:22.643
per square foot.

00:01:22.643 --> 00:01:24.358
One way to think about it,

00:01:24.358 --> 00:01:25.520
that very first square foot,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.540
we don't know what its
price would have been,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.673
but let's say its price
was at $3 if it was.

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:33.126
I'm just making that up.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.475
In that reality,

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:36.884
if that very first square
foot's price was at $3,

00:01:36.884 --> 00:01:39.827
there is definitely an
incentive for someone

00:01:39.827 --> 00:01:42.014
to make that first square foot

00:01:42.014 --> 00:01:43.783
because their marginal cost is only

00:01:43.783 --> 00:01:47.358
a dollar and they could
rent it out at $3 per month.

00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:51.283
There is definitely an incentive
for someone to rent it.

00:01:51.283 --> 00:01:54.933
The marginal benefit is
$4 and they just have

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:56.782
to pay $3 for it.

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:58.470
It could be rented out for anywhere

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.690
or it would exist,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.744
or this kind of transaction would happen

00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:06.267
as long as its price
was between $1 and $4.

00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:08.630
You could imagine, based
on how this is drawn,

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.802
where the actual equilibrium price is.

00:02:10.802 --> 00:02:14.023
The suppliers will keep
adding more and more

00:02:14.023 --> 00:02:17.155
square foot as long as they
can actually rent it out,

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:20.384
all the way until the
point that the marginal

00:02:20.384 --> 00:02:23.517
benefit is equal to the marginal cost.

00:02:23.517 --> 00:02:25.927
Right over here marginal benefit is equal

00:02:25.927 --> 00:02:27.767
to marginal cost.

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:29.462
It wouldn't make sense for suppliers

00:02:29.462 --> 00:02:32.204
to produce an incremental
square foot right over here.

00:02:32.204 --> 00:02:33.922
If they produce an
incremental square foot,

00:02:33.922 --> 00:02:37.167
their marginal cost has gone beyond $3,

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:39.384
while the marginal benefit is below $3,

00:02:39.384 --> 00:02:42.754
no one is going to rent that thing out.

00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:49.279
We reach an equilibrium point at 2 million

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.267
square feet per month on the market.

00:02:51.267 --> 00:02:53.153
Let me make that line a
little bit straighter.

00:02:53.153 --> 00:02:55.887
2 million square foot
per month on the market

00:02:55.887 --> 00:03:03.089
and at a price of $3 per
square foot per month.

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.161
You can look at the total surplus here.

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:07.204
In this equilibrium scenario,

00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:10.403
we can calculate the consumer surplus.

00:03:10.403 --> 00:03:12.141
So all of these folks,

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:15.293
for this first incremental foot,

00:03:15.293 --> 00:03:17.203
someone was willing to
pay $4 per square foot.

00:03:17.203 --> 00:03:18.433
They only have to pay $3.

00:03:18.433 --> 00:03:20.453
The next one a little less than $4.

00:03:20.453 --> 00:03:21.960
Benefit they only have to pay $3.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.816
All the way to this point right over here.

00:03:23.816 --> 00:03:27.140
So the area of this
triangle right over here,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.538
this right over here is
the consumer surplus.

00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:33.618
So that right over here
is consumer surplus.

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:37.998
Consumer surplus.

00:03:37.998 --> 00:03:38.892
We can calculate it.

00:03:38.892 --> 00:03:40.191
This is a triangle.

00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:42.567
I'm assuming actually both the
supply and demand curves are lines.

00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:44.855
So let's see this has a height of 1

00:03:44.855 --> 00:03:48.183
and it has a base of 2 so
its area is going to be

00:03:48.183 --> 00:03:51.133
1 times 2 times one-half.

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:58.320
That is going to be equal
to 1 million dollars.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.073
We are multiplying $1 times 2 million

00:04:02.073 --> 00:04:04.024
times one-half.

00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:07.555
That's going to be 1 million dollars

00:04:07.555 --> 00:04:09.736
of consumer surplus per month.

00:04:09.736 --> 00:04:11.738
Let's think about the producer surplus.

00:04:11.738 --> 00:04:14.275
The producer surplus is
going to be this area.

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:17.565
It's going to be this
area right over here.

00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:19.012
That first incremental foot it only cost

00:04:19.012 --> 00:04:21.888
those producers $1 but they are able

00:04:21.888 --> 00:04:25.323
to rent it out for $3.

00:04:25.323 --> 00:04:27.401
Then they will keep producing,

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:28.841
keep producing all the way until they

00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:30.345
do 2 million square foot.

00:04:30.345 --> 00:04:32.181
For all of their square feet,

00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:34.359
they are able to rent it out for more

00:04:34.359 --> 00:04:35.671
than it was their cost to produce it.

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:40.545
So the area of this triangle
is the producer surplus.

00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:44.623
This is the producer surplus.

00:04:44.623 --> 00:04:49.593
Producer surplus.

00:04:49.593 --> 00:04:51.824
We can calculate that as well.

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:54.665
The height right over here is $2.

00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:59.683
$2 times this width is 2
million square feet per month.

00:04:59.683 --> 00:05:02.767
2 times 2 times one-half is 2.

00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:06.710
This is equal to 2 million dollars.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.681
If we were to talk about
what the total surplus is,

00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:14.550
it is 3 million dollars.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.621
Now, this equilibrium rent,

00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:18.802
$3 per square foot per month
is actually quite a lot

00:05:18.802 --> 00:05:21.081
for 1,000 square foot apartment.

00:05:21.081 --> 00:05:23.200
My last apartment was a two bedroom,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.965
two bath apartment.

00:05:24.965 --> 00:05:26.218
It was about 1,000 square foot.

00:05:26.218 --> 00:05:27.949
So that means you're
going to be paying $3,000

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.106
per month for that.

00:05:29.106 --> 00:05:30.326
That's pretty high rent.

00:05:30.326 --> 00:05:31.991
That's the type of rent you might pay

00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:34.126
in a city like San Francisco.

00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:36.083
Let's say people start
complaining about it.

00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:38.617
So the government says,
"Okay that rent is not fair.

00:05:38.617 --> 00:05:39.951
"It's too high.

00:05:39.951 --> 00:05:43.163
"We want to introduce some
type of price control.

00:05:43.163 --> 00:05:47.948
"We want to introduce rent control."

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:50.820
I'm oversimplifying how this works,

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.767
but just so that we can deal
with this model right over here,

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:56.758
Let's say that the city
just sets a ceiling

00:05:56.758 --> 00:06:00.411
on the price per square foot per month.

00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:02.847
Let's just say they set a price ceiling,

00:06:02.847 --> 00:06:09.745
a price ceiling of $2 per
square foot per month.

00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:12.927
$2 per square foot.

00:06:12.927 --> 00:06:14.231
Let me write it this way.

00:06:14.231 --> 00:06:21.211
$2 per square foot per month.

00:06:21.211 --> 00:06:26.728
So they set a price
ceiling right over here.

00:06:26.728 --> 00:06:29.889
Given that, what is going to happen?

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.168
What is going to happen?

00:06:32.168 --> 00:06:33.718
What I really want to think about is what

00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:35.646
is going to be the new consumer surplus

00:06:35.646 --> 00:06:37.047
or the new producer surplus?

00:06:37.047 --> 00:06:38.370
I encourage you to pause the video

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.916
and try to think about that on your own.

00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:42.879
Well let's think about
what's going to happen.

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.386
From the producers point of view,

00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:46.403
it doesn't make sense for them to produce

00:06:46.403 --> 00:06:48.684
more than 1 million units.

00:06:48.684 --> 00:06:51.273
1 million square feet per month.

00:06:51.273 --> 00:06:53.294
I have to rent out more than a million

00:06:53.294 --> 00:06:54.678
square feet per month

00:06:54.678 --> 00:06:57.345
because that extra square foot above that,

00:06:57.345 --> 00:06:58.957
its marginal cost is going to be more than

00:06:58.957 --> 00:07:00.388
what they're going to get.

00:07:00.388 --> 00:07:01.871
The producers are just
going to stop there.

00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:05.036
The producer surplus
is going to be the area

00:07:05.036 --> 00:07:10.168
of this triangle right over here.

00:07:10.168 --> 00:07:13.833
Let's see, this is $1 times 1 million

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:16.069
times one-half.

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:17.889
This is now a producer surplus.

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:21.227
Producer surplus.

00:07:21.227 --> 00:07:22.940
A new producer surplus
under the rent control

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:30.857
of $500,000, half a million, of $500,000.

00:07:30.857 --> 00:07:31.692
So we see that the rent control

00:07:31.692 --> 00:07:34.316
immediately hit the producers pretty hard.

00:07:34.316 --> 00:07:36.227
The producer surplus has
gone down dramatically.

00:07:36.227 --> 00:07:38.224
Now what about the consumer surplus?

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:40.743
We're talking about a million units,

00:07:40.743 --> 00:07:43.659
or a million square foot
per month I should say.

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:48.737
So now the new consumer
surplus is the area,

00:07:48.737 --> 00:07:52.871
is this entire area.

00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:55.071
So you see that at least for this first

00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:57.198
incremental million square feet,

00:07:57.198 --> 00:08:00.298
the consumers have started
to win out a little bit.

00:08:00.298 --> 00:08:03.002
To figure this out,
what the total area is,

00:08:03.002 --> 00:08:04.872
we just need to figure
out what we could break

00:08:04.872 --> 00:08:06.854
this up into two sections.

00:08:06.854 --> 00:08:09.305
We could break this up into two sections.

00:08:09.305 --> 00:08:10.838
This is the point,

00:08:10.838 --> 00:08:14.801
1 million square feet at $3.50
dollars per square foot per month.

00:08:14.801 --> 00:08:16.903
This is right over here,
the point, the 3.5.

00:08:16.903 --> 00:08:19.608
We could use that to
figure out this new area.

00:08:19.608 --> 00:08:21.675
Actually let me do it
in a different color,

00:08:21.675 --> 00:08:25.212
in this green area right over here.

00:08:25.212 --> 00:08:26.816
What is it going to be?

00:08:26.816 --> 00:08:30.545
Well the area of this
thing right over here

00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:33.124
is one-half high.

00:08:33.124 --> 00:08:38.169
One-half times 1 times one-half.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.458
This right over here is 250K.

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:45.032
We add that to this area right over here,

00:08:45.032 --> 00:08:51.164
which is one and a half times 1.

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:54.553
$1.5 dollars per square foot per month

00:08:54.553 --> 00:08:55.888
times 1 million.

00:08:55.888 --> 00:08:57.485
Did I do that right? Yep.

00:08:57.485 --> 00:09:00.618
So that's going to be plus ... plus this,

00:09:00.618 --> 00:09:03.383
which is 1.5 million.

00:09:03.383 --> 00:09:05.474
You add these two together.

00:09:05.474 --> 00:09:07.277
The total consumer surplus ...

00:09:07.277 --> 00:09:18.462
So the total consumer
surplus is now 1.75 million.

00:09:18.462 --> 00:09:20.546
So the consumer surplus definitely

00:09:20.546 --> 00:09:23.949
did go up in total because it gained

00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:26.205
all of this from the producer,

00:09:26.205 --> 00:09:28.093
but let's think about what has now

00:09:28.093 --> 00:09:30.886
happened in our society or in our city.

00:09:30.886 --> 00:09:33.284
The producers definitely
don't want to put out

00:09:33.284 --> 00:09:35.576
as many square foot per rent anymore.

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.916
It does look like we have lost some

00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:40.945
total surplus for our little city here.

00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:44.746
We have lost out on this entire area.

00:09:44.746 --> 00:09:46.719
We can calculate it by looking at what

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:49.404
the total surplus was
before the rent control

00:09:49.404 --> 00:09:52.337
and what the total surplus
was after the rent control.

00:09:52.337 --> 00:09:54.162
The total surplus before,

00:09:54.162 --> 00:09:59.685
so before the total
surplus was the 2 million

00:09:59.685 --> 00:10:02.669
producer surplus plus the
1 million consumer surplus,

00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:05.984
so it was 3 million.

00:10:05.984 --> 00:10:12.011
After, it is the 1.75
million consumer surplus

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:14.734
plus the $500,000 producer surplus,

00:10:14.734 --> 00:10:19.786
which is 2.25 million.

00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:23.359
What we've lost is the difference here,

00:10:23.359 --> 00:10:28.601
which is $750,000.

00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:30.050
So this area right over here.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.275
This is per month.

00:10:31.275 --> 00:10:35.467
This right over here represents
the lost total surplus.

00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:40.541
This lost total surplus
of $750,000 per month

00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:46.891
is referred to as the dead weight loss.

00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:49.158
You can debate about rent control.

00:10:49.158 --> 00:10:50.655
Is it good? Is it bad?

00:10:50.655 --> 00:10:52.864
Is it good for this kind of dynamic?

00:10:52.864 --> 00:10:55.605
Who gets what share of the surplus?

00:10:55.605 --> 00:10:57.746
This of course is an oversimplification

00:10:57.746 --> 00:10:59.079
of a market and even the way rent

00:10:59.079 --> 00:11:00.384
control would be instituted.

00:11:00.384 --> 00:11:02.547
This is a model for beginning to think

00:11:02.547 --> 00:11:05.931
about what happens to the total surplus

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:09.931
when these types of price
controls are instituted.
