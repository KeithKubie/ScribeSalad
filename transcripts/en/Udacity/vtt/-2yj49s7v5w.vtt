00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.470
As you can see, Dimple.js's API is much closer to

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.060
what the grammar of graphics specifies than d3 itself.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.370
This is because Dimple.js exists at a higher level of abstraction than d3,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.850
and since the grammar of graphics is at a little bit of

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.490
a higher level of abstraction as well.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.510
Dimple happens to fit nicely with the grammar of graphics specification.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.520
The first few lines of code here are simply standard JavaScript,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.500
which set up the variables for the width, height, and margins of the chart.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.410
As well as the d3 code, which append an SVG element on our page.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.640
The declaration here to use strict let's the browser know that you

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.740
want to enforce a restricted subset of JavaScript within this function.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.390
The most important feature of strict mode is that it forces the browser

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.870
to throw explicit errors anytime JavaScript might silently fail.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.840
Similar to what we saw in the first lesson for HTML elements.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.330
These lines of code simply tell the browser to find the body tag,

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.620
append a new SVG element, add appropriate attributes for

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.060
the width and the height and then add a group with class chart.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.950
We haven't seen a group yet.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.010
But all the group does is, groups the SVG and everything within it,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.490
into a single element.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.720
Think of this is as the same way as webpages often use div

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.390
tags to group common elements together, such as, paragraphs or side bars.
