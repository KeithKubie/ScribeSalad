DANA HAN-KLEIN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.060
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.730
Today, it is my pleasure
to introduce Dan Harmon.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.562
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.990
So I think my first question is,
you have so many projects going

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.030
on-- like, do you sleep?

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.490
How do you manage your time?

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.820
DAN HARMON: Yeah, I get a lot
of sleep thinking laziness done.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.240
I think that I do have
a lot of projects going,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.630
and I am busy quite a bit.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.506
But part of workaholism
is you never want

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:39.630
to say you're a workaholic.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.080
Because a true workaholic
thinks the word "workaholic"

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.160
means "productive."

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.320
And then you go, well,
I'm not productive,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.380
so I'm not a workaholic.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.400
I can't say that out loud,
because it sounds like--

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.850
a real workaholic
likes the word.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.270
Like-- It's like I hero word.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.120
Like oh, they're a workaholic.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.800
I mean, from talking
to my therapist,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.230
you can be a workaholic
and get nothing done.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.519
It really just means you
define yourself by what you do,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.800
instead of, like, taking
time to live your life,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.020
and trying to figure
that shit out.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.030
But I have found that
my other problem--

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.030
which is perfectionism--

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.070
when you throw
workaholism at it,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.020
the nice different split is that
if you're working on 20 things,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.970
you never have time
to fuck one up.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.060
You can just-- so
I just work for--

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.720
I just take meetings,
and I help people

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.970
with what I want I can help
them with, and try to keep

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.870
all these balls in the air.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.953
And the answer to your
question is, I sleep, like,

00:01:29.953 --> 00:01:30.920
four hours a night.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.246
But it's not because I
have so many things to do.

00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:36.120
Like, I have a rule--

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.010
I go home as soon as I can.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.030
I don't work at home anymore.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.200
I used to have-- you know,
if the ball's in my court,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.570
I'll just screw it up.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.756
If Dr. Strange says, write these
pages for tomorrow, I'll go,

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:48.380
"I'll do that."

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.260
Then I won't.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.190
I'll screw it up.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.190
Like, if the ball's in my
court, I'll just drop the ball.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.762
If I tell somebody, this is
what you should do, I can get--

00:01:57.762 --> 00:01:59.970
they're like, yeah, I'll
have that done by tomorrow--

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.070
and then they actually do it.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.280
So I'm trying to lean
more towards that.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.780
You know?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.500
So that's why I have 20 projects
going on, is because when you

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.760
work like that, it's--

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.260
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You
enable yourself,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.410
to have 20 projects going on--

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.920
DAN HARMON: Exactly.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.170
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.270
Instead of just sort of throwing
yourself completely into--

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.840
DAN HARMON: Yeah.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.410
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
--something that might--

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.785
DAN HARMON: And your anxiety
becomes like, are they good,

00:02:21.785 --> 00:02:22.652
or not?

00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:24.360
Am I supposed to meddle
with this person?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.480
Is this show supposed to be
their definition of good,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.720
or my definition of good?

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.410
Am I supposed to screw
with them, the way

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.030
that a studio screwed with me?

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.610
Or am I supposed to, like,
do what no studio did--

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.900
which is just let me go.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.540
Or, if they're let
go, will they suck?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.790
Like, you just kind of
chase your tail that way.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.030
But at least that tail-chasing
doesn't slow anybody else down.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.044
You can just do that in
your bedroom at night.

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:48.710
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I
think my next question

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.914
is, how do you disconnect?

00:02:50.914 --> 00:02:52.830
Because it sounds like
you're always thinking.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.082
And, like, always
percolating on something.

00:02:56.082 --> 00:02:57.540
DAN HARMON: I watch
Forensic Files,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.780
and I have fun
with my girlfriend.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.427
And I like to play with my iPad.

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:05.760
I mean, I'm always disconnected.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.926
I'm either always connected,
or always disconnected.

00:03:07.926 --> 00:03:08.970
I don't know.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.220
I only feel anxiety about work.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.440
Like, you go, oh, crap,
that needs to get done,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.120
and that needs to be good.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.940
Like, there's no joy.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.060
So the joy comes from--

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.020
joy is the thing that happens
on accident, because you

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.360
don't have time to think.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.920
Like, so that's another--

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.090
it's like you--

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.890
I think that's why, probably--

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.100
maybe not you guys.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.590
You're millennial Googlers.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.950
But I have a feeling
that's probably

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.900
the same for everybody--
that you procrastinate,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.510
so that you have the excuse
of working in the moment.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.420
Because there's a-- you're
channeling something.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.760
I'm sure it's truly that--

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.611
I mean, I've done
a little coding.

00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:53.110
I did.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.070
I made a web site in PHP once.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.292
And I know it's similar
to the writing process,

00:03:59.292 --> 00:04:00.250
because I've done both.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.630
And in both, you procrastinate.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.610
You work sloppy.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.830
You do these things
that you need to, like--

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.260
and so that, in the
moment, you're just like,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.670
this is what I have to get done.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.880
This is what I need to do.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.810
I'll debug and organize later.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.570
And I'm just going to slop this
together, and see if it works.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.240
And then hand it off, and then--

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.260
so you get that high of somebody
saying, wow, you're a genius,

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.710
considering you waited till the
last minute and then did this.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.340
It's always that important
asterisk, because God forbid

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.370
that you actually budgeted
your time, ate your kale,

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.410
did your push-ups, and then
had someone just appraise

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.860
your work-- as if to suggest
that this is the best

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.229
you could ever do if you
properly aligned yourself

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.270
with your work and stuff.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.320
It's like, no way man.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.160
Like, isn't it much better to
just be irresponsible, and just

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.700
like shoot something together,
and then go, like, I'm good--

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.580
considering.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.514
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It's a little
self-sabotage sometimes.

00:04:59.514 --> 00:05:01.930
DAN HARMON: But it's also a
trick to get you into the zone

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.490
where you are making stuff good.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.550
If there was a way to do both--
if there was a way to schedule

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.280
regular sessions, nine-to-five,
of you just being like Ken

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.510
Kesey, Electric Kool-Aid
Acid Test-- like,

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.720
just like the player pianos--

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.050
you playing the keys, whatever.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.120
That metaphor-- like,
being in the moment.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.430
If you could schedule that,
and get a 401(k) doing that,

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.840
and like, you know--

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.490
if you could do that
without self-sabotage,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.312
it would be an amazing thing.

00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:31.520
You could write a book, and
probably make some money,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.080
I think.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.740
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I
just want to talk

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.030
about Harmon Time for a minute.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.100
Because sitting here, listening
to you speak in person,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.720
is, like, the most surreal
thing for me right now.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.178
Because I've been listening to
the podcast for a long time.

00:05:40.178 --> 00:05:43.311
It's very much about you, and
you seem very brutally honest

00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:43.810
in it.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.060
And it makes you feel like--

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.570
it makes an audience
feel like they know you.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.490
Even though, objectively,
we don't know you.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.000
But--

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.570
DAN HARMON: You do.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.370
You do know me.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.230
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But we do.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.120
We probably-- like, I
feel like sometimes--

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.286
and I could be wrong-- but
I feel like, sometimes, I

00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:56.706
know more about honest you
than I know about people

00:05:56.706 --> 00:05:57.580
I've known for years.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.590
Because you just kind of
put yourself out there.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.290
But what sort of toll or
effect does that take on you,

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.820
when you have all
these people who

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.960
seem to have insight
into what you present?

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.830
DAN HARMON: Oh, it's
the opposite of a toll.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.070
The toll was walking around
with thoughts inside my brain.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.587
I used to--

00:06:13.587 --> 00:06:14.920
I would go to the refrigerator--

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.586
I remember this moment,
before I started

00:06:16.586 --> 00:06:20.200
blogging, when I was like
27, when blogging on MySpace

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.330
became a thing.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.830
There was this thing
called MySpace.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.855
And it was like, blogging
had just become a thing.

00:06:26.855 --> 00:06:29.230
A friend of mine had told me,
yeah, it's just this thing.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.550
I'm like, what is
it, new technology?

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.320
No-- it's just this
cultural thing, now.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.824
People are just
keeping diaries online.

00:06:34.824 --> 00:06:37.240
And, like, there's a guy from
Disney telling you what it's

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.040
like to storyboard for Disney--

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.120
but then also, like, what
he's eating, and stuff.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.230
And it was like a really
crazy concept back then.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.660
Now we have too
much transparency.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.350
Now everyone feels kind
of pornographically--

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.660
a lot of you were born into
a world where it's like,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.680
how do I turn that off?

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.110
How do I keep people
from seeing me showering?

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.670
How do I-- but back
then, it was like, man,

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.500
if only someone cared
about me showering.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.500
It was like a message in
a bottle you threw out.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.780
It was like magic technology.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.590
But back then, when
that started happening,

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.720
I was like, this is a godsend.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.470
Because-- I won't diagnose
myself with anything,

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.670
but I think a big part
of a lot of any disorder

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.531
is there's things rattling
around in your skull

00:07:18.531 --> 00:07:20.530
that you're not communicating
with other people.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.200
And that's why therapy
is so important.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.120
And why talking to
people is so important.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.970
What the hell is
that sound, man?

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.934
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:28.934 --> 00:07:30.350
Are you a self-loathing
therapist?

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.970
Or are you, like--

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.720
he's going to come up
to me after, and go,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.970
I have a breathing disorder.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.020
And I'm going to go home and--

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.270
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Blog about it.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.200
People go home
and blog about it.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.120
DAN HARMON: I will go
home and blog about it.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.000
But no-- it's like, when
you're not talking to anybody.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.710
So let's take
depression, for instance.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.000
You have a depressing thought.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.530
Like, I'm a terrible
piece of shit.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.180
I'm a total-- you
know, oh, my god, I'm

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.810
so gross and disgusting,
and everyone hates me.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.557
I know it seems like
a social faux pas

00:07:58.557 --> 00:08:00.890
to go to a Christmas party
and share that with everyone.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.223
Because then they're like, what?

00:08:02.223 --> 00:08:04.310
You ruined Christmas.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:05.640
Keep it to yourself.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.470
And that's true.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.100
You probably shouldn't
just smear your needs

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.570
on people, or things.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.150
There's a point
where that's toxic.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.767
But then, there's
also a point, way

00:08:15.767 --> 00:08:17.600
before that, where
you're toxifying yourself

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.470
for no good reason.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.420
Because if people
knew that you were

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.230
going through some troubles, to
the extent that it was, like--

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.185
you know, they would
like to know that.

00:08:27.185 --> 00:08:29.930
And I think the nice difference
is, with online technology,

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.289
you can actually just say,
look, I'm a fat piece of shit.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:34.380
I hate myself.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.030
I have these thoughts,
and all this stuff.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.630
And in my experience--

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.620
I realize, if you're
clinically having stuff

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.990
going on biochemically,
the nightmare is,

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.030
there's nothing you can do.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.170
But, in my experience, I would,
like, open my refrigerator,

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.314
see a bottle of mustard,
and for some unknown reason,

00:08:54.314 --> 00:08:55.730
the color of the
bottle of mustard

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.470
would trigger a
memory of me trying

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.570
to be funny on Ben
Stiller's answering machine,

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.320
and him not calling back.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.690
And I would run over the content
of the voice message I left,

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:06.810
and how it's so stupid--

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.730
I tried to be funny
inviting him to a party,

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.450
and of course he didn't show
up, and then we stopped--

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.830
like, what an idiot I am.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.560
And it's like, this is a
bad thing to put on mustard.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.540
You know?

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.670
Like, mustard should
be there for--

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.840
you should associate the
color of a mustard bottle

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.750
with mustard, with sandwiches,
with whether or not

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.340
you want mustard.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.740
And so I went over
to the Myspace blog,

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.820
and just typed in, like, "you
know, one time"-- you know,

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.470
I just typed the memory out.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.510
The thing that was
bouncing around

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.930
in my head, that didn't have
words being attached to it--

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.050
what was that memory?

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.210
What is it that I did
so wrong that day?

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.690
I left a funny voicemail
for Ben Stiller.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.230
I tried to make him like me.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.190
This is what I did.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.870
This is where the
comedy went awry.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.060
This is how the joke fell flat.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.430
You know, from top to bottom--

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:59.772
without putting any type of plea
or fishing for, "no, it's OK,

00:09:59.772 --> 00:10:01.730
that actually does sound
like a funny message."

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.360
Like, trying to stay on the
other side of that line,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.430
where you're not being
unnecessarily self-loathing,

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.780
but just kind of objectively
looking at your pores,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.660
and your wrinkles, and
your fat, and whatever--

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.340
these things about
your psychology.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.360
And just saying--
enumerating it.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.680
And giving it words.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.800
And then I found it was done.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.760
It was finished.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.667
The only time that
story about me

00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:32.750
trying to be funny on Ben
Stiller's voicemail ever

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.210
comes up, is this
example that I give.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.822
It's always a healthy thing.

00:10:36.822 --> 00:10:38.030
It always makes me feel good.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.600
It's like a leaf on a tree, now,
that converts carbon dioxide

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.240
to oxygen, instead of
the other way around.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.800
Before that, it was like--

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.810
it was this festering
thing inside me.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.810
By the way-- of course,
it goes without saying--

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.890
Ben Stiller doesn't give a shit.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.995
Like, he doesn't--

00:10:53.995 --> 00:10:56.370
I think I mentioned it to him,
once, when I ran into him.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:56.870
He's like, what?

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.230
No.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.063
My assistant would've
screened my messages--

00:10:59.063 --> 00:11:00.860
deleted it, I'm sure.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.720
But it's like, there is this
thing about getting it out.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.629
And now more than
ever, of course,

00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:12.170
this current political
climate-- it's

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.370
like we are being asked
to compartmentalize,

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.140
to protect ourselves.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.600
And also, it's hard to--

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.990
well, I'm not going
to get into that, man.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.390
But it is like--

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:30.560
you said what's the toll
of barfing yourself up

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.730
onto the world?

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.200
No-- that is my relief.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.310
That's my analgesic.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.990
That's my methadone.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.680
That's what keeps me from
Spalding Gray-ing, you know?

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.259
Like, it just-- the fact
that you can just say,

00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:44.550
this is where I'm at right now.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.100
I don't feel very
good about myself.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.150
Or, I feel great.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.790
Or, I'm just somewhere
in the middle,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.470
in that, like, eternal haze.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.470
And then people
that come up to you,

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.934
knowing that you don't have
to make small talk anymore.

00:11:57.934 --> 00:11:59.600
They can say, like,
I have fibromyalgia,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.070
and my dad killed
himself, and it feels so

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.361
good to listen to your podcast.

00:12:02.361 --> 00:12:04.040
I'm like, this is great!

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.200
After 500 of those
people, after a show,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.230
you go home and want to
Green Mile the insects up.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.120
But it's way better than
talking about the weather

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.860
with strangers in the street.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.640
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But
I find it interesting

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.040
that that's sort of
your perspective.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.350
I think it's a great
perspective on it.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.990
Just because it
seems like we do live

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.531
in this culture of
essentially, like,

00:12:22.531 --> 00:12:24.950
if you want to be known you
have to essentially open

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.660
your life out to this.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.250
And people do have negative
experiences with it.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.395
So it's interesting-- I
think it's interesting

00:12:31.395 --> 00:12:33.770
that, for me at least, it
seems like Harmon Time came out

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.430
of turning a very
negative experience,

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.520
and it became something
very, very positive.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.130
Because it was something that
could have crippled a career,

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.110
or somebody's ability to
creatively function again.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.250
But you turned your
time from Community

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.874
into this weird thing, that's
gained a life of its own.

00:12:48.874 --> 00:12:50.540
And, like, spawned a
bunch of offshoots.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.905
and this whole
culture around it.

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:54.530
Is that at all what
you were expecting?

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.729
Or did you just, again,
want to just sort of--

00:12:56.729 --> 00:12:57.770
DAN HARMON: I don't know.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.120
Yeah, the expectation--

00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.690
I don't know.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:01.850
It was-- again, it was always--

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.410
Community was a
brief interruption

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.050
in a lifetime of jumping up and
down and saying, "look at me,

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.420
look at me, here's
what's wrong with me."

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.270
Community-- becoming a
showrunner on an NBC show

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.940
had a political component
to it that, on one hand,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.770
was all of a sudden giving me
this thing I thought I wanted--

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.250
which was a bunch of attention.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.227
On the other hand,
it was, ironically,

00:13:21.227 --> 00:13:23.060
coming with this-- you
know, I'd get a phone

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.790
call from Sony going,
that was a fun interview.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.550
People are responding to
your sincerity shtick.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.871
But could you not talk
about the show's budget?

00:13:30.871 --> 00:13:32.120
Could you not use these words?

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:32.960
Could you not say this?

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.160
Could you not express
these thoughts?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.785
Could the point of
view be more "this"?

00:13:35.785 --> 00:13:38.850
And then I would say to
them, like, you can't--

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.820
why don't you have your PR
firm, and I'll have mine.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.280
And, like, it's a conflict
of interest, here.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.270
Like I'm Colonel Sanders, and
you're the FDA, or something.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.470
Like, we should work together
to keep from poisoning people.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.110
But at the same time,
I've got a brand.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:57.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.690
And so, it was--

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.270
to Community-- like, the
big takeaway from that

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.100
was with the Chevy thing.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.230
Like, having a kind of
accidentally-public feud

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.925
with Chevy.

00:14:06.925 --> 00:14:08.300
And I do say
"accidentally," even

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.790
though I played his voicemails
to me into a microphone.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.750
But I was doing that in a
closed environment, I thought.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.657
I was naive, and I thought 150
people would find it funny,

00:14:17.657 --> 00:14:18.740
and then it would be done.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.199
It was, like, an LA thing.

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:22.490
And then someone put it online.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.280
And my takeaway from
that became, OK,

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.640
so first of all, I should
just broadcast everything

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.990
as wide as possible.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:36.800
Because I hadn't been podcasting
before that Chevy feud thing.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.300
But then, more importantly--

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.670
you know, up until
now, that whole

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:45.080
"I wish people could see me
showering" kind of drive--

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.630
it's become de classe now,
in this new millennial world.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.900
Like, we are all
connected to each other,

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.260
and you are committing a crime
when you bring other people

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
into your confessional shtick.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.322
You can't.

00:14:58.322 --> 00:14:59.780
So it's tough,
because your life is

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.029
connected to all these people.

00:15:01.029 --> 00:15:05.030
But you do, in my opinion,
have to go all the deeper,

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.720
and be like, this is what
makes me a piece of shit--

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.930
and without somehow bringing
your girlfriend into it,

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.970
bringing your coworkers into it.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.200
You know, like, that
should be their business.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.970
They want to have their
vortex of transparency,

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.587
and they should be able to
do that on their own terms.

00:15:22.587 --> 00:15:23.920
And that can be tough sometimes.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.600
You're like, well, I'm going
to tell you this story.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.880
But it's like, you know,
you're not an island.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.100
But that was the big
Community takeaway.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:31.700
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But
at the same time,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.080
you found this whole
group of people

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.746
who are willing to
engage on that level.

00:15:34.746 --> 00:15:37.700
And, like, choose to merge
their vortexes with yours.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.370
Because, you know, I feel like
you hear all these people guest

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.650
on your podcast, and then
you guest on their podcast,

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.970
and it's just become this, like,
community in and of itself.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.530
And I know a lot of that
also has to do with you

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.180
and Starburns kind of helping
co-produce these things.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.580
And Starburns has become
this entity unto its own.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.663
I feel like-- are you guys
trying to become, like,

00:15:57.663 --> 00:15:59.090
your own media network?

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.910
DAN HARMON: Well, I'm looking
at podcasting as being,

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.890
number one, a really
unexpected cultural--

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.350
much like blogging,
it wasn't about,

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.800
"oh, my god, we suddenly
have the ability to blog."

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.960
That was the oldest
technology in the world,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.550
and it culturally evolved.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.140
And podcasting was very similar.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.950
It was like, yeah, bandwidth was
needed to be there, and stuff.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.560
But really, podcasting is--

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.790
I think it just filled this
hole that we didn't know we had,

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.870
until that bandwidth peaked out.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.310
And then people
could go, oh, now

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.956
I can listen to this
person for two hours

00:16:33.956 --> 00:16:36.330
while I walk my dog, chop my
carrots, and all this stuff.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.390
And the idea of it being
audio without video

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.380
became very important.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.190
But it also very much
encouraged output.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:46.790
Like, you couldn't manage
your image anymore,

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.360
and compete with people who
were pumping themselves out,

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.400
nonstop, on a weekly schedule.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.110
Because it quickly
became apparent

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.900
that schedule in podcasting
was very important.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.730
That people-- it
was an addiction

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.310
that you were filling to another
person, like a radio show,

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.340
or something.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.530
And so all of that
inadvertently created

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.510
a kind of sincerity movement.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.460
People started-- there
were comics that made

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.420
that transition really nicely.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.290
Marc Maron went from being
like, you know, Mark Maron--

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.810
who was no slouch doing stand
up-- but all of a sudden,

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.700
this untapped, like--

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.829
he hates the phrase, "Barbara
Walters of stand-up."

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:25.310
But then he all of a
sudden, like-- oh, what

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.150
he's really good at is
talking about comedy

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:28.710
with these comedians,
and comedians

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.960
are coming onto his show and
coming out of the closet.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.170
And then all these unknowns--

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.810
it was, like, well, you know,
stand-up would have actually

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:40.140
not been for this person-- but
look how funny they are, just

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.460
as a person.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:47.310
And so all of that is to say
that, like, with Starburns--

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:51.600
the reason I started dumping
Starburns resources into Feral

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.670
Audio, and partnering
with that--

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.030
Dustin Marshall started Feral
on handshakes and smiles

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.390
and warm feelings, and accrued
this, like, amazing family

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.860
of podcasters.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.604
And then, because
he was going to have

00:18:03.604 --> 00:18:05.520
to go get a job at Best
Buy, I was like, well,

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.110
what if you worked
for Starburns?

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.610
And Starburns kind of bought in?

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.300
And then Starburns said, how
about a sales department?

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.600
What if we crunched all these
numbers, go out to Snickers,

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.650
or whoever--

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.350
Orby Parker-- and say, these
are all our total numbers.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.200
You know, what if we
put on ties and make

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.860
this a little corporate--
just enough to keep it going.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.490
In the meantime, it
seems exciting to me--

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.630
almost as a hobby--

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.200
to be able to recognize we're
time travelers right now,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.820
in Hollywood.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.610
Podcasting has clear
one-to-one analogs for radio.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:46.500
And then, it's not all going to
just go predictably the same,

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.990
but it is pretty
predictable to say,

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.060
there's a bandwidth
association here.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.570
As bandwidth
becomes cheaper, you

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.510
know, this audio-only
phenomenon,

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.420
that started with sincerity
and getting to know people,

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.690
and things-- it's going to have
an offshoot that, hopefully,

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.910
keeps the radio part intact.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.230
That that will never go away.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.740
Like, hip-hop sprouts
a million offshoots,

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.720
but you can still, at
the end of the day,

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.254
just listen to
something called "rap."

00:19:16.254 --> 00:19:18.090
That there will
always be podcasting,

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.420
but then there's going to
be this tremendous upcoming

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.290
movement into video podcasting.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.360
And the early days
of television are

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.340
going to start very
lovingly haunting us again.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.030
People are going to have
tiny little studio spaces,

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:41.760
and bring things up from a
cable access kind of vibe,

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.410
to a basic cable,
'80s Late Night Live.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.380
Where it's like, OK,
there's a little bit

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.280
of professional polish
to this, but its roots

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.975
are in non-FCC compliant,
like, humanity.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:00.906
Let's stop there.

00:20:00.906 --> 00:20:02.271
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:02.271 --> 00:20:04.020
DANA HAN-KLEIN: So, I
find it interesting,

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.853
because you have that
whole component to it.

00:20:05.853 --> 00:20:07.380
And then, you also--
at some point,

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.882
like, didn't it start out
as an animation studio?

00:20:09.882 --> 00:20:10.590
DAN HARMON: Yeah.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:11.520
DANA HAN-KLEIN: At what
point were you guys like,

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.103
you know what?

00:20:12.103 --> 00:20:14.322
Let's make an animated
feature in the 2000s,

00:20:14.322 --> 00:20:15.780
when there's, like,
no money in it,

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.240
unless you're Disney
or Dreamworks.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.345
And then get nominated for
an Oscar because of it.

00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:22.140
DAN HARMON: Right.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.280
That's all Dino.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.150
Dino has always loved
stop-motion, in particular.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.220
It starts with his love
of miniaturization.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.980
It's actually not--
he's definitely

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.540
passionate about stop-motion,
but the foundation

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:43.070
is his love of puppets, dolls,
tiny things made to scale.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:49.010
And so he had two stop-motion
shows on Adult Swim,

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.650
and he always wanted to
do a stop-motion studio.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.520
Because he just felt--

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.200
naively, it turns
out-- like, hey

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.490
what are these studios doing?

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.290
Like, we used to be a part of--

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.090
not we-- Dino's shows
that he did, he was--

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.410
his studio, where the guys
that did Robot Chicken--

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.540
so Dino would just have
a corner of the warehouse

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.789
where they made Robot Chicken.

00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:10.320
And from Dino's perception,
it was like, oh, these checks

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.440
come in from the studio--

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.980
from the network-- and then
these Robot Chicken guys--

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.290
it seems like all I have is
a corner of this warehouse,

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.706
and then it's just some money
that gets taken off the top.

00:21:21.706 --> 00:21:24.060
If I had a warehouse, I'd
just put all the money

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.050
into my thing.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.400
So that naive perception,
from the bottom--

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.800
it caused him to say, I want
to start in animation studio.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.500
And then I was like, well, I
don't care about animation.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.080
But if you think it's
the kind of thing that

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.370
could one day do live action,
we should do that together.

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:41.070
Can I join?

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:45.480
You can use my name too,
and we'll do better.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.880
That was-- so Dino's
the animation guy.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.620
Since doing Rick and
Morty, I've become

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.810
pretty passionate about
animation as a medium, myself.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.810
DANA HAN-KLEIN: You have
a new season coming up.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.040
Yes, you finished writing it.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.360
They're drawing it right now.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.020
That's my understanding.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.310
DAN HARMON: Justin and
I had a huge fight.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.534
The show's canceled.

00:22:00.534 --> 00:22:01.836
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:01.836 --> 00:22:03.140
DANA HAN-KLEIN: All right.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:03.470
Well, that's--

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.720
DAN HARMON: I know it's a
roller coaster ride, but I--

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.440
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But
for the third season--

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.965
that is not cancelled,
I'm hoping--

00:22:09.965 --> 00:22:10.590
DAN HARMON: No.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.620
It's very-- it's coming
hot off the griddle.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.840
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Without
spoiling any of it,

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.410
how do you push characters
like that even further?

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:20.270
Like, how do you--

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.770
you know, we're in
the third season.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:25.310
I'm like, I can't imagine what
Rick would do, at this point,

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.830
that we wouldn't expect.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.914
But that's your job to do.

00:22:27.914 --> 00:22:29.288
And I feel like
it's a challenge.

00:22:29.288 --> 00:22:31.340
And there's such a
passionate audience for it.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.506
Like, I thought Community
had a passionate audience.

00:22:33.506 --> 00:22:35.319
Then I met Rick and Morty fans.

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.360
DAN HARMON: Yeah, I know.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:37.380
It is weird.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:42.670
Like, I was explaining
it to my girlfriend.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.870
Yeah, it's weird-- the reach.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.166
My only metric is just wearing,
maybe, a Rick and Morty

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:50.040
t-shirt once in a while--
and just the number

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.040
of waiters,
bartenders, strangers

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.020
in elevators, that just
react to a logo on a t-shirt.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.490
They don't know me.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.580
The Community fans used to
be-- like, they'd see my face.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.620
But I get more--

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.130
the logo I wear for Rick and
Morty gets more recognition

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.870
from people, who have no idea
who I am, than my dumb face

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.515
that was in TMZ gets
from the Community fans.

00:23:14.515 --> 00:23:15.390
You know what I mean?

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.860
But those questions-- what
do you what do you have Rick

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.810
do next?

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:29.430
First of all, it's kind of
the opposite question, almost.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.080
It's the question
of, well, we already

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.689
know Rick can do anything, so--

00:23:32.689 --> 00:23:34.230
maybe it's not the
opposite question.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.787
Why I am I trying
to gaslight you?

00:23:35.787 --> 00:23:36.701
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:36.701 --> 00:23:39.610
Your thoughts turned
backwards, are what I think!

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.985
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:40.985 --> 00:23:42.360
No, it's not really
the opposite.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.320
It's just that Rick is like--
yeah, he's like Doctor Who,

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.574
or Ford Prefect, or any
character that's sort of,

00:23:48.574 --> 00:23:50.490
like, look, this guy's
got bigger fish to fry.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.630
And the audience can get away
with not totally understanding

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.840
what's going on in his cabeza.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.370
And also, we took very careful
steps to make him a kind

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:06.270
of non-shark
jumpable character--

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.720
we want him to be
kind of evergreen.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.670
And we've been
successful in that.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.590
So it's not so much
like, oh, no, we really

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.960
painted ourselves in a corner
with that serialized story

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.660
of the one-armed man.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.080
Or, how are they going to get--

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.990
is this island a Rubik's Cube,
or the dream of a turtle?

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.810
We kind of implied it
was a turtle dream,

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:25.684
and now we're fucked.

00:24:25.684 --> 00:24:27.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.940
We definitely don't have that.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.050
I mean, Rick-- the earth
gets to a certain point.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.620
Rick goes to another earth.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.560
He collapses universal
governments for breakfast,

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.060
and stuff.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.730
And so it's just more like
the show is a religion.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.340
Like, it's that thing
of like, oh, man, we've

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.740
created the perfect fun machine.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.910
And then you go--

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.670
it's just, you can't tell
when you're slipping into,

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.875
like, taking your fun
machine too seriously.

00:24:52.875 --> 00:24:55.000
Because you want to get,
like, Dan Akroyd about it,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.980
and go, like, yeah, but the
cool thing about a fun machine

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.740
is it runs on this.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:02.820
And then you don't
notice that you've

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.350
slipped into over-thought.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.000
And it's not as simple
as, like, oh, guys--

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:09.510
stop.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.430
We're overthinking.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.900
Let's just make it about farts!

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.400
Like--

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:17.550
It's not quite that
simple, all the time.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.880
It's like, well, OK--

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.400
because that will be part
of chasing your tail.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.880
Like, OK, we're just going
to make it about farts.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.440
We had that epiphany
several times.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.990
And then we'd go and be like,
OK, so it's just about farts--

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.030
but I guess in a joyless way.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.580
Because we had that
epiphany, and we forced it.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.980
Because we decided we were
just going to have fun,

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.390
and now it's like this--

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.120
you can tell we're
not having fun.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.370
And then you throw that
away, and you're like, guys,

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:45.510
was it ever about farts?

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.241
What is a fart?

00:25:46.241 --> 00:25:46.740
You know?

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.810
What is television?

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:49.680
What is existence?

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.280
What is god?

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.270
Isn't god a fart?

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.250
If god farted, could he hear it?

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.554
And would he like
the smell of it?

00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:56.970
Do we really like
the smell of it,

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.966
or do we just not mind it
because we had a warning?

00:25:59.966 --> 00:26:02.520
I riffed that--
that's season four.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:05.950
And on, and on, and on.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.360
And I think it's just
overall like, you--

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.900
well, my hope is that--

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.330
that's why season
3 is just like--

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.740
it's a dog chasing its tail.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:18.510
It's just like-- it
ends up taking an hour

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:25.980
to make something as funny,
as entertaining, as elegant,

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.010
as it used to take
20 minutes to do.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.555
And so all of
those hours add up.

00:26:30.555 --> 00:26:33.180
And it ends up taking two years
to do something that's supposed

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.010
to take less than a year.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:39.920
And you look back, and you
go, god, I feel so stupid.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.540
And then only after
you've actually

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:46.370
gotten all the way out of it can
you actually look back and go--

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.780
you see all your footprints
through the portage.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.090
You know, like, look-- we
picked up the canoe there,

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.170
we carried it over there.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:53.253
Look where we turned left.

00:26:53.253 --> 00:26:55.260
We're ridiculous.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.580
You know?

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.800
And going, like, all
of that over-thought--

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.460
did the show get any better?

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:00.960
No.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.710
Did it get any worse?

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:02.250
Nope.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.850
Did it take an extra year?

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:04.350
Yeah.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:05.100
Why?

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.130
I don't know, but let's
not do that ever again.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.970
And that's it.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.679
That was the difficulty
with this season.

00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:15.719
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Do you
have a personal preference

00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:17.520
on writing for a show
like Rick and Morty,

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.840
that has almost no constraints?

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.040
Or a show that has, maybe,
more grounding constraints?

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.750
DAN HARMON: Right
now, I'm really

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.760
jazzed about the lack
of constraint thing.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.740
Because I feel like
it's a great era of TV,

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.180
allowing us to have that.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:39.120
To have a very popular
sitcom, that's breaking rules,

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.070
that just 10 years ago
would have been, like,

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:48.180
absolutely deal-breakers
for studios, and networks,

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.050
and things.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.560
It's a huge opportunity.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:55.380
So that's-- it's like, do you
want to work in stem cells,

00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:01.680
or do you want to work in,
like, in vitro fertilization?

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.510
It's like, well,
I think if we work

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.160
in stem cells for a little bit,
we're going to end up, like--

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.570
so it's like, Rick and Morty
feels like stem cells to me.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.077
That's a good quote for--

00:28:11.077 --> 00:28:12.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:13.980
DANA HAN-KLEIN: The internet?

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.580
Or the internetz?

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.390
Just going to go
back, for a second.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.010
Can we talk about Spencer
Crittenden for a minute?

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:20.790
DAN HARMON: I guess.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.623
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Where
did you find that guy?

00:28:22.623 --> 00:28:23.197
Like--

00:28:23.197 --> 00:28:24.030
DAN HARMON: He was--

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.860
he was just in the audience.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:26.530
Yeah.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.072
He literally wasn't a guy--

00:28:29.072 --> 00:28:31.970
I thought that if I
said, in my podcast,

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.920
"let's play Dungeons
and Dragons"--

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.750
first of all, the
joke was supposed

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.760
to be that Dungeons
and Dragons is,

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.990
while a part of a lot
of our childhoods,

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:44.340
absolutely not
marketable at all.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.380
But that was the joke.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.340
That it was, like,
you know, we can't--

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:52.160
nerd culture has all
kinds of parallels

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.789
to other disenfranchised
cultures.

00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:56.080
There was a time when nerd
culture was disenfranchised.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.650
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I don't think
anyone here remembers it.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.590
DAN HARMON: But it breaks
down in the marketability

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.539
of the primal youth stuff.

00:29:05.539 --> 00:29:07.580
Like, the stuff you were
into when you were a kid

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.420
is, like, complicated
and boring.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.530
And that was going
to be the joke.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.710
Because, when I was a kid, the
idea with Dungeons and Dragons

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:17.180
was that it was satanic.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.550
That was actually kind of,
like, one of the big concerns

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.110
among parents at the time.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:24.500
Like, our kids are playing
these complex games, where they

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.440
have to read a lot and do math.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.702
And it's all for Satan.

00:29:29.702 --> 00:29:31.604
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:31.604 --> 00:29:33.020
And I just want
to go back in time

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:37.156
and show them a portal to
nowadays, and go, like,

00:29:37.156 --> 00:29:38.780
do you really want
to worry about this?

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.480
Like, your kids
are casting spells

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.675
around the kitchen table.

00:29:44.675 --> 00:29:45.470
You fuckers.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:46.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.960
Like, no-- we never
knew how good we had it.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.640
And it was always funny to
me that, if those parents,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.200
or church groups and things,
knew what a real gaming

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.940
session sounded
like-- it was just

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.110
kids going through puberty.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.484
Kind of, like,
fumbling their way

00:30:01.484 --> 00:30:04.670
around early improv
exercises, and, like,

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:05.685
arguing with each other.

00:30:05.685 --> 00:30:08.060
And unable to really immerse
themselves in the narrative,

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:08.840
et cetera.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.140
So the truth is, there's a
kind of a self-hating nerd vibe

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.680
to my early, "let's go
to the D&amp;D well" stuff.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.550
Like, lets laugh at how
our culture is not actually

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:22.220
that cool.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.100
And part of that
was, I thought, let's

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.460
just turn D&amp;D into Project
Runway, or something.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:32.060
Where, I'd say on
the podcast, "we're

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:34.070
going to find the best
dungeon master ever."

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.010
And I figured there'd be five
dungeon masters in my audience

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.880
on any given night.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.660
And the joke would be
how unfair I was being.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:47.060
That guy would play the kind of
British Office, Ricky Gervais

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.020
kind of unreliable curator.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.450
Of, like, oh, I like
this Dungeon Master

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:56.035
because he let us live
longer than this one.

00:30:56.035 --> 00:30:57.410
And that the whole
thing would be

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.210
this ridiculous,
sacrilegious kind

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:02.830
of desecration of the craft.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.640
But what happened--
there were no dungeon

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.630
masters in my audience.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.500
There was one guy with
a nine-foot beard who

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.964
raised his hand and said
he drove from Simi Valley

00:31:11.964 --> 00:31:13.880
that night, for the first
time, because he had

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.338
a weird feeling while he was
smoking a joint that he should

00:31:16.338 --> 00:31:19.300
play Dungeons and
Dragons with Dan Harmon.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.100
Which I had never
mentioned on the podcast.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.020
And people just took
one look at him,

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.470
and they were like, this
is not a stereotype,

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:30.530
but at the same time,
it is like this--

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.524
I know this guy.

00:31:32.524 --> 00:31:34.940
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I was like,
you couldn't have written him.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.750
You couldn't have written him.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.250
Because nobody would believe
it if he didn't actually exist.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:39.470
DAN HARMON: Yeah That's how--

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.697
I mean, to not to derail,
but it's like I do--

00:31:41.697 --> 00:31:44.030
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Are you saying
you don't want a tangent?

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.030
I don't want to derail--

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.870
I want to keep everything
nice, and compartmentalized,

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.220
and orderly.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:50.600
But that was a bit, like--

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.302
Jim rash being
cast on Community--

00:31:52.302 --> 00:31:53.510
that was always my big thing.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:32:00.980
Was like, we were casting a dean
in a screwball college story.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.650
So is he going to have
the little bow tie?

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.690
There's only so many
deans, you know?

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.280
You got your Robert Stacks.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:13.640
And then you got your little,
diminished, like, beta guys,

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.180
with the checkered
shirt, and things.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.380
And maybe, then-- if
you're super progressive

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.049
in the '90s-- oh, it's
a ball-busting lesbian,

00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.590
or something.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:25.060
It's like, how many dean
characters are you--

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.010
like, we need this person to
be like Louie DePalma in Taxi.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.960
It's like, was that an
archetype, you know?

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.200
Like, Danny DeVito's
character in Taxi--

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.420
it was, like, this
crazy thing, where

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.210
he could be a villain one
minute, and a hero the next.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:41.750
Because he was just
an authority figure.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:45.350
And so when Jim Rash
walked in and started

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.000
doing his take on the dean--

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.770
it was the same
thing with Spencer.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:52.370
It's that phenomenon of,
you couldn't write this.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.820
You can't write this persona.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.430
It's a real person.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.230
But at the same time, they
make being a real person

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.440
seem so epic.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.990
Because there's such clean
lines around what they are

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:04.670
and aren't.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:05.690
But-- yeah.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.160
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I just think
it's interesting how, like,

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.368
the introduction of Spencer--

00:33:08.368 --> 00:33:10.847
you know, I could be wrong,
but I feel like the Harmon Time

00:33:10.847 --> 00:33:12.680
documentary wouldn't
have necessarily worked

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.180
unless you had that kind
of, like, narrative arc.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.054
And then you have Harmon
Quest because of it.

00:33:16.054 --> 00:33:18.550
It's like something
you guys kept doing.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.747
You could've easily just stopped
playing D&amp;D, and Shadowrun,

00:33:21.747 --> 00:33:22.580
and stuff like that.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.580
But you have this human
in your life, now,

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:28.310
who's also very much a part
of what you do professionally,

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.430
now, is my understanding.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:30.070
DAN HARMON: And personally.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.950
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And personally.

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.283
DAN HARMON: I've hired a friend.

00:33:32.283 --> 00:33:33.245
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:33:33.245 --> 00:33:34.120
DAN HARMON: It's odd.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.578
I'm conflicted
about it, sometimes.

00:33:35.578 --> 00:33:39.160
Because I have Steve
Levy, and I have Spencer.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.000
Like, I don't want--

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.547
it's like my friends
are my assistants.

00:33:43.547 --> 00:33:45.130
Like, I hired Spencer
as an assistant,

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.120
because it made sense.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.150
But also, Spencer
executive-produced Harmon Quest

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.020
season one and two.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.200
And literally, he did it
himself on season two.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.540
I was there next
to him, pretending

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.990
to keep my hands on the
wheel for season one,

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:00.740
but in reality
was doing nothing,

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.650
while Spencer kind of
stepped into the role

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:05.545
from writing to audio mixing.

00:34:05.545 --> 00:34:07.420
And then, so season two,
I was like, you know

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.530
I wasn't doing anything, right?

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:08.800
Yeah.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.300
OK.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.120
Bye.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:15.550
And he EP'd season
two flawlessly.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.949
And so, on one
hand, he's a peer.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:20.380
He's just a showrunner.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:25.850
But he's half my age-- or
2/3 my age-- and the other--

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:26.802
I don't own a car.

00:34:26.802 --> 00:34:27.885
So he's also my chauffeur.

00:34:27.885 --> 00:34:29.389
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:31.020
And I don't do
anything but work.

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:32.969
And I work a lot with him.

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:36.270
So you have this weird, like,
situation where I wake up

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.429
every morning, and
the person that I

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:42.866
pay to be in my life
picks me up for work.

00:34:42.866 --> 00:34:44.449
But we don't have
to make eye contact,

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:49.110
and we don't have to speak,
because it's not weird

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:52.380
if we don't speak, because
we're not just friends--

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.520
we're coworkers.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.060
And everything is
arranged around function.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.310
Meep meep, moop moop.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.090
Like, just enough that
we're shielded, emotionally.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:02.390
Which allows for a
level of intimacy.

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:03.820
I mean, like, if--

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.510
I mean, it would jump the shark
of the relationship to say it,

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.850
so hopefully he doesn't
watch Google, or anything--

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:12.510
but, you know, he's like
one of my best friends.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:16.402
And it's like an adopted son
and an adopted father, to boot.

00:35:16.402 --> 00:35:17.610
Because he's smarter than me.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.140
But what is that?

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.060
It's simultaneously the
least healthy most healthy

00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.449
relationship in the world.

00:35:26.449 --> 00:35:28.240
And I have that pretty
much with everybody.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.440
Like, I don't talk to
my biological family--

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.867
I just have this weird,
sprawling network

00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:35.700
of employee-friends.

00:35:37.634 --> 00:35:39.300
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But
I think it goes back

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.250
to your very first
point-- about how

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.640
you seem to enjoy kind of
nurturing people, in a sense.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.555
You know?

00:35:45.555 --> 00:35:49.069
Like, being involved in
stuff, but also letting them

00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.860
do their own thing.

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.630
And being like, no,
this is how you actually

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.588
should do it, instead of
you doing it yourself.

00:35:53.588 --> 00:35:56.130
Like, you've empowered
people to kind of become

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.050
entities and creators
in their own rights.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:58.890
And--

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:00.000
DAN HARMON: The
cynical way of putting

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.458
it would be that
I'm trying to take

00:36:01.458 --> 00:36:04.410
an end-run around
emotional connection,

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:08.550
by intellectualizing what
is essentially family.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:10.740
And making it a
construct that has

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.120
to do with
productivity and stuff.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:17.700
And so that I'm
using circuits that

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.620
are built for
non-emotional things

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:24.870
to create a simulation
of emotional connection.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.520
And that's not to
say the circuits that

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.620
run the emotional
stuff aren't working.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.460
It's just that they're
probably terrifying.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.420
And they throw sparks, and
stuff, for whatever reason.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.540
And so it's a crime, that
should be prosecuted.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.776
Which I am doing in therapy.

00:36:42.776 --> 00:36:45.150
Eventually, I'm going to need
to say, "you're my friend."

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:49.660
Not my, whatever-- guy
that delivers licorice.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:50.160
You know?

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.076
It's like, it's just--

00:36:51.076 --> 00:36:56.520
it's got to be an
unhealthy crutch.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.170
Friends, you love
unconditionally.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:00.060
Like, Spencer should be able to
come to my house at this point,

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.685
with blood all over
his hands, and say,

00:37:01.685 --> 00:37:02.910
"I murdered a hitchhiker."

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.535
And I should say,
"let's bury the body."

00:37:06.535 --> 00:37:08.166
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But you drive.

00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:09.624
DAN HARMON: (LAUGHS)
But you drive.

00:37:09.624 --> 00:37:11.885
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:11.885 --> 00:37:13.720
Did you murder
him with your car?

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.220
No, in it.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:14.630
OK.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:15.150
You drive.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.988
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:18.567 --> 00:37:19.650
DANA HAN-KLEIN: All right.

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.660
So, living or dead,
who is someone you'd

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.090
like to collaborate with?

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.830
DAN HARMON: Living or dead.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:28.750
Oh, god damn it.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.121
I-- you know, I really want
to work with Mitch Hurwitz.

00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:38.620
Like, we're always talking about
doing like special projects

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:39.119
together.

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:40.922
So that's a good one.

00:37:40.922 --> 00:37:42.880
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Who was
your favorite childhood

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.770
hero or heroine?

00:37:46.345 --> 00:37:48.405
DAN HARMON: Do fictional
characters count?

00:37:48.405 --> 00:37:49.280
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Yeah.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.240
DAN HARMON: I really obsessed
about agent Dale Cooper,

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.980
from the original Twin Peaks.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.990
Like, I really wanted to be--

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:57.790
not Kyle McLaughlin--

00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:58.480
Dale Cooper.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:04.540
Like, I wanted to be, like, a
smart, spiritual person that

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.549
carried a gun and solved crimes.

00:38:06.549 --> 00:38:08.590
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Are you
watching the current one?

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:09.730
DAN HARMON: I
haven't seen it yet.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.730
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Are you
afraid that it will like

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:13.109
shake your admiration for that?

00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:14.150
DAN HARMON: Well, I'm 44.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.390
So I'm like-- I can handle it.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:19.720
But at the same time
it's like, it's not--

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.190
I can already tell
that it's going

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.470
to be something different.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.120
So I'm in no hurry to watch it.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.440
I figure it'll keep.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.880
DANA HAN-KLEIN: What's a
guilty pleasure of yours,

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.463
that you haven't
talked about already?

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:32.610
DAN HARMON: I mean--

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:35.690
Intervention, the
TV show, I guess.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:38.450
I love-- and Hoarders, too.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.810
Like, my girlfriend doesn't
like Hoarders as much.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.429
Probably because
she's like, dude,

00:38:42.429 --> 00:38:44.595
you'd be a hoarder if you
didn't have a housekeeper.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.540
But I like watching
Intervention and Hoarders,

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:53.950
because I think it is
absolutely, 100% accurate.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:58.492
To say, it makes me feel
like I'm not that fucked up.

00:38:58.492 --> 00:39:00.860
I like just watching people.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.710
And I also like
judging the people.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.340
Not judging them
for their addiction,

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.094
because the addiction
clearly is, like--

00:39:08.094 --> 00:39:09.760
that's what you learn
from Intervention.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.917
It's like, yeah-- it's
just a sickness, that

00:39:11.917 --> 00:39:13.000
could happen to any of us.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.790
But I like judging
them as people,

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:18.550
and deciding which
people deserve

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:19.870
to overcome their addiction.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.350
Based on whether
they're my definition

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.620
of good person or bad person.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:27.190
It's a pretty fun time.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:28.180
DANA HAN-KLEIN: If
people were to stage

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.596
an intervention
in your life, what

00:39:29.596 --> 00:39:31.090
do you think it would be for?

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:35.259
DAN HARMON: I mean, it would
be easy to stage one for--

00:39:35.259 --> 00:39:36.050
well, I don't know.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.440
For the drinking, because that's
a substance, and it's a thing--

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.140
but then again, I'm
such a functional--

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.600
if I'm an alcoholic, I'm such
a functional alcoholic, like,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.910
what are you going to do?

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:47.620
I'd just be, like--

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.900
if I walked into an
intervention for booze,

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.250
I'd be like, all right.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:55.420
So you drink a pot of coffee,
I'll drink a fifth of vodka,

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.054
and let's have a life contest.

00:39:59.054 --> 00:40:00.220
I'm still going to beat you.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:00.730
So what--

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:01.544
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:01.544 --> 00:40:03.460
And it's like-- and then
they'd be like, yeah,

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:04.270
but you're killing yourself.

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:06.350
I'd be like, yeah, but you
can't do anything about it.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:07.558
They'd be like, you're right.

00:40:07.558 --> 00:40:09.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:12.097
And then I'd walk off.

00:40:12.097 --> 00:40:13.930
And also, like-- oh,
yeah, come on you guys.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:14.530
Read your letters.

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:15.610
You're not going to cut
me out of your life.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:16.210
You're right.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:18.070
All right-- gotcha.

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:21.640
But the workaholism
thing, I think, would be--

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:30.600
it would be like, stop feeling
like you have stuff left to do,

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.490
and just hang out.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:33.490
And I'd be like, we are.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:34.467
And they'd say, yeah.

00:40:34.467 --> 00:40:35.800
It's not really an intervention.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.633
We just wanted to get
high and watch movies.

00:40:37.633 --> 00:40:38.202
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:38.202 --> 00:40:39.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well,
I was going to ask,

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.430
what's something you wish
you had more time for.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:44.470
But it sounds like that
might be an answer.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.178
DAN HARMON: Yeah.

00:40:45.178 --> 00:40:47.440
I love watching horrible
movies with my friend

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.940
Rob [? Schrab, ?] that I moved--
you know, is my oldest friend.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.850
I have friends that
I've known longer.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:57.110
But [? Schrab ?] was
in my life the most.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:01.390
Like, I came to LA with
him from Milwaukee.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:03.460
And we have, since
we were in our 20s,

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.820
we've always just loved
sitting down and watching

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:12.620
awful '80s movies about
cyborgs, or just bad movies.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.640
And I wish I had time
to do that all the time.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.600
DANA HAN-KLEIN: How do you
define personal success?

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:24.170
DAN HARMON: The amount
of misery that you

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.910
take in, versus put out.

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:30.400
Like, how much
pain is coming in,

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.594
and how much pleasure is
going out to other people.

00:41:32.594 --> 00:41:33.760
It's like a plant, you know?

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.300
Just CO2 and O2.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:42.190
Like, is your
account in the black.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.380
As far as, like-- so
if somebody hurts you,

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:49.450
if somebody punches you in the
face, and it hurts like hell,

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:53.050
and you're really mad,
you're an unsuccessful life

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:55.450
if you then go punch
five people in the face.

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:59.050
Because you took in pain and
caused five times as much.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:01.570
Even if they're-- but, you know,
look-- if you're John Wick,

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:05.740
and all those guys are,
like, facepunchers--

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.030
there's nuance there, I guess.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.590
That's why we love those movies.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:10.960
Like, the idea that you could
solve the world's problems

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.870
by just punching more people
than you got punched by.

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.200
But in reality, I think
success is defined by,

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.790
can you actually convert--

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:21.160
when somebody punches
you in the face,

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.640
can you actually then go put
on a one-woman show about--

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.125
why did I make it a woman
just for the face punching?

00:42:27.125 --> 00:42:28.750
I was like, why don't
you do that thing

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.970
where you switch pronouns,
like every other time.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:31.850
DANA HAN-KLEIN: And
that's the one you chose?

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:33.320
DAN HARMON: And it was an
unfortunate coincidence.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.910
Like, "if you get punched
in the face, then you--

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:35.420
a woman--"

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.366
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:39.839 --> 00:42:41.897
(LAUGHS) I thought the
phrase "one-man show"

00:42:41.897 --> 00:42:42.855
would be so oppressive.

00:42:42.855 --> 00:42:44.721
Like that's the
patriarchy coming down.

00:42:44.721 --> 00:42:45.220
One man!

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.710
It's a one-man show, in
my hypothetical theatrical

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:49.666
endeavor.

00:42:49.666 --> 00:42:52.040
If you get punched in the
face, and put on a one-man show

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.780
called, "I Got
Punched In The face"--

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.054
And it's like, people
that go into it,

00:42:57.054 --> 00:42:58.970
that are having bad
days-- who didn't even get

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:02.704
punched in the face, or are like
fighting cancer, or something--

00:43:02.704 --> 00:43:04.870
and they come out going,
like, I feel so much better

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:06.161
now that I saw that guy's show.

00:43:06.161 --> 00:43:08.550
Thank god he got
punched in the face.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:09.285
That's success.

00:43:09.285 --> 00:43:10.910
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It
could be a woman who

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:11.750
punched him in the face, too.

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:12.215
DAN HARMON: It could have.

00:43:12.215 --> 00:43:14.840
It definitely was a woman
that punched him in the face.

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.950
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Equal-opportunity face

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:16.450
punching.

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:17.540
DAN HARMON: John Wick-ess.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.440
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Ooh.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.555
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:21.555 --> 00:43:24.250
John can be an
androgynous first name.

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:25.560
DAN HARMON: So high-roaded.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.987
You are correct.

00:43:29.987 --> 00:43:32.570
DANA HAN-KLEIN: What is one of
the most unique fan experiences

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.990
or encounters you've had?

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.970
DAN HARMON: Unusual?

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:38.017
I mean-- yeah.

00:43:38.017 --> 00:43:39.100
They're all very intimate.

00:43:42.816 --> 00:43:44.190
And I don't want
to get punitive.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.540
I don't want to be like,
oh, there was this person,

00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:51.027
and put a log on that fire.

00:43:51.027 --> 00:43:53.360
Like there's a wrong way to--
because so many people are

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.350
awkward, and not having
their best moment.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:57.600
Especially if they're excited.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.141
So I don't want to be like, oh,
there was this creepy person.

00:44:00.141 --> 00:44:02.540
That doesn't happen to me a lot.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.450
So I'm trying to think of a
positive, like, weird one.

00:44:08.119 --> 00:44:08.660
I don't know.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.330
They're just all so great.

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.640
It's just, like, the
funniest stuff will happen

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.770
while you're on the move.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:19.100
Like, somebody is saying we
have to get from one location

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:19.770
to another.

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:21.980
And then people
only have what they

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.240
perceive as a fleeting
window to make their mark.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.759
And so they just-- and how
to phrase those things.

00:44:27.759 --> 00:44:29.300
So they just say
the craziest things.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.380
Like, "Mr. Harmon, can
I give you a joint?"

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:31.880
Like--

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.527
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:33.527 --> 00:44:34.860
Which just sounds like a weird--

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:35.790
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It's
very formal, too.

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:36.873
DAN HARMON: Yeah, exactly.

00:44:36.873 --> 00:44:38.530
It's like she
doesn't want to say--

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.820
like, yes, you may, madam.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.290
Thank you.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:42.980
I grew it in my
garden, and I use it--

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.316
they're trailing off, as you're
being shoved like the Beatles

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:47.250
into a limo.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:52.310
Like, all right-- it sounds like
she worked hard on this joint.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:53.600
I mean, I'm trying to think--

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.523
I know that there's, you know--

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.960
I mean, my unusual fan
relationships include people

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.660
that have made their
lives a part of the show,

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:06.790
and opened them up.

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:07.290
You know?

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.600
There's Jane, who, when
we met her, was Jan.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.390
Who was his pseudonym,
because he was feeling weird

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:18.830
about his upcoming
transition, and things.

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:23.170
And it was like--

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:28.470
getting to know Jane on
stage, in the show, included

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:31.910
the beginnings of
the relationship--

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:37.280
in which it was a
person that had already

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.020
made the commitment
to transition,

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.490
but wasn't sure how they
wanted to present themselves.

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:43.572
And that we got to have
that conversation, too--

00:45:43.572 --> 00:45:45.530
i.e., "well, the first
time I came on the show,

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.540
I introduced myself
as so-and-so.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.210
And that's because
I was nervous.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:53.250
I didn't want to become a
symbol of any kind of movement,

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:53.750
or anything.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.291
But the truth is, this is what
I'm going through in my life."

00:45:56.291 --> 00:45:59.540
And I don't know, those
friendships and people

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:03.980
becoming characters in, like,
your McDonaldland pantheon.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:08.120
Which is this crass, corporate
way to present friendships.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.390
Like, what are you--

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:12.230
there's a fine line between
Howard Stern's Whack Pack

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:16.100
and McDonaldland's,
like, assembly

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.270
of different characters.

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:18.936
This one is the
Hamburglar, but this one

00:46:18.936 --> 00:46:22.581
loves giving hamburgers.

00:46:22.581 --> 00:46:25.205
But then, at the bottom of that,
it's like, well, what is this?

00:46:25.205 --> 00:46:27.320
It's just this is how
we form friendships.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.530
What else are we going to do?

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.100
How long do I ever take
to talk to a stranger?

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.470
And so, you know,
Jane becoming--

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.880
going from being somebody that
can answer all my questions

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.750
about what is this thing
that we keep hearing about,

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:40.310
transgender?

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:41.240
I don't know anything.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.480
Can I ask my dumb, middle age
straight white male questions

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.480
about this stuff, without being
afraid of getting yelled at?

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:50.960
And the answer is
yes, with this person.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.800
And then that
blossoming into, OK.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.740
So, now I got it--

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:57.920
all the information I need,
currently, to actually say,

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.380
I'm an advocate.

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.080
And then also, you're my friend,
so next time you come on,

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.970
can we talk about
something else?

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:08.521
Like the fact that you are a
glassblowing scientist, and all

00:47:08.521 --> 00:47:09.020
that stuff.

00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:12.370
Or your relationship
with your son.

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:17.450
And so, I mean, it's not a
story about a person coming up

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:20.510
with a dead raccoon and
saying, "sign this."

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:24.770
But it is the unusual--

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:27.890
like, it's the fact that there's
a very fine line between fan

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:30.440
and friend, and vice versa--

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.690
for better or for
worse, with me.

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:35.510
Jane, when she comes
into town, you know,

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.790
she knows she can
just stay at my place.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:40.330
But, it's like a hotel.

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:42.920
Like, there's a
code for my door.

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:48.560
And I-- like, she just comes
and uses it like a hotel,

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.970
and I don't talk to her.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:52.340
Like, I go, I'm busy.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.000
That's odd.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.520
And weird, Larry
Sanders creepy, almost.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.090
Like, in terms of my
compartmentalisation.

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.542
But at the same time, it's
like, that's friendship.

00:48:00.542 --> 00:48:02.000
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I
was going to say,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.850
I feel like that's actually,
like, a more intimate level.

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:06.050
Where, like, you're so OK
with somebody just coming

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.570
into your home, and
you know that maybe

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:10.754
they don't want to make
small talk right now.

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:12.170
Because they have
something to do.

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:13.860
They're in town for
their own thing.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:18.980
You know, I feel like that
hosting level is a nice thing

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:19.745
to have.

00:48:19.745 --> 00:48:20.960
DAN HARMON: Yeah.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.760
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well,
speaking of fans,

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.677
we now have time for a
few audience questions.

00:48:24.677 --> 00:48:26.885
DAN HARMON: It's weird that
you guys have questions--

00:48:26.885 --> 00:48:28.061
because you're Google.

00:48:28.061 --> 00:48:29.476
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:29.476 --> 00:48:31.100
DANA HAN-KLEIN: How
do you think we get

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:31.310
all the info for everything?

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:34.160
DAN HARMON: That's got to
be the first Google Q&amp;A

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.692
joke ever made.

00:48:35.692 --> 00:48:36.862
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Absolutely.

00:48:36.862 --> 00:48:38.570
DAN HARMON: You guys
can't just type this

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.544
into Yahoo Answers, and--

00:48:40.544 --> 00:48:42.680
DANA HAN-KLEIN: We Bing it.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.430
AUDIENCE: Hi, Dan.

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:44.270
DAN HARMON: Hello.

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:46.061
AUDIENCE: So my question
is, Rick and Morty

00:48:46.061 --> 00:48:47.430
has a lot of guest actors--

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:49.471
one of my favorites being
Jermaine Clement, who's

00:48:49.471 --> 00:48:51.180
sang "Goodbye Moon Man."

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:53.630
So my question is, what is
the process like for choosing

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:54.414
the guest actors?

00:48:54.414 --> 00:48:56.330
Do you create the character
based on the actor

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:58.974
that you want, or is it
more, like, vice versa?

00:48:58.974 --> 00:49:00.890
DAN HARMON: The character
usually comes first.

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:04.910
I can't think of an
example of writing

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:07.430
a character for an actor--

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:09.380
with the exception
of Brandon Johnson.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:14.540
I think we knew we wanted
him to be the math teacher,

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:18.620
and sort of created Mr.
Goldenfold around Brandon

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:21.200
Johnson's humor.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.290
But yeah-- as far
as-- it's usually

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:26.660
like, we get so caught up in
storytelling that we end up

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:27.380
with these characters.

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.330
And then we'll go, OK,
what about Joel McHale?

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:30.559
Or something like that.

00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:31.100
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.419
Thank you.

00:49:32.419 --> 00:49:32.960
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.630
So you had Community,
which was kept alive

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.150
so many times by the
fanbase, and everything.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:40.530
And then it ended
up going to Yahoo--

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:42.740
which you're able to, like,
beautifully wrap it up,

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:46.409
because you never know the life
of the next streaming service.

00:49:46.409 --> 00:49:48.950
But then, on the other hand,
you had Paul Feig's Other Space,

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.760
which just was getting started.

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:55.340
So now, you're on to Harmon
Quest being on Seeso's network.

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:58.100
How do we help you,
maybe, keep alive

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:01.250
Harmon Quest, when we're not
sure where Seeso may end up?

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:02.489
But we still, you know--

00:50:02.489 --> 00:50:05.030
it's a beautiful thing, that
you don't want to die too early.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.780
You know?

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:07.580
DAN HARMON: Yeah, I
mean, the nice thing

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.860
with a service like
Seeso would be-- well,

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.810
there's one clear answer, which
is just subscribe to Seeso.

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:14.920
But we can't control--

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.420
I mean, we could-- every Harmon
Quest fan in the world could

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:20.930
subscribe to Seeso, and if
Universal appraises Seeso

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:24.200
as being a venture not worth--

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:26.760
or that they want to do
something else-- like,

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:30.770
that's the tough thing
about fandom these days.

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:31.970
I know your feeling.

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:33.070
Because I watched--

00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:35.910
I binged the first season
of Patriot on Amazon.

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:39.890
And I just-- halfway through
it, I had this panic, you know?

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:44.060
Like, is anyone
else watching this?

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.460
And what can I do to help?

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:47.930
And I-- yeah.

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:49.640
I wish I had a
satisfying answer.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.080
I really do.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:51.920
Get a tattoo.

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.420
No.

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:54.753
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:56.120 --> 00:51:05.000
Align yourself with creative
forces that, no matter what

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.070
the outside world
does to us, they

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:12.470
will keep on putting
stuff out because

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:13.475
of some mental disorder.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:17.180
It's OK.

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:20.172
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:20.172 --> 00:51:22.130
AUDIENCE: Of all the
characters you've created,

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:23.629
which one do you
most identify with?

00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:30.545
DAN HARMON: I mean, I
guess for me, it was always

00:51:30.545 --> 00:51:32.650
a straight
down-the-middle split,

00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:37.070
on Community, between
Jeff Winger and Abed.

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:38.270
That was the idea--

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:43.340
that Jeff Winger
was the parts of me

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:47.990
that had adapted to performance,
and manipulation of others,

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:51.950
and getting people to like
them, and materialism,

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:52.950
and all those things.

00:51:52.950 --> 00:52:01.310
And that Abed was, not the
real me, but the parts of me

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:04.910
that would be left over if
you carved all that Jeff

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:06.500
Winger off, and vice versa.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.570
Neither is the real me.

00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:13.550
If you fused those two
characters together

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:18.590
in a perfect 50/50 alloy,
that it would turn into this,

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:26.660
like, slovenly, weird,
stammering, selfish person.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.460
DANA HAN-KLEIN:
Speaking of performance,

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.020
did you ever expect
to do as much--

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:31.640
essentially--
performing as you do?

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:34.460
Because you basically, like,
get up on stage once a week.

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.176
And you perform in
front of large crowds.

00:52:37.176 --> 00:52:39.050
DAN HARMON: I was hanging
it more and more up

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:41.070
as I started doing Community.

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:43.310
But then I started
weaponizing it,

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:46.370
because I felt like I was
at war with a lot of people

00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:50.220
that were politically
facile, behind the scenes.

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:54.740
And then what I noticed is that,
whenever they came toward me,

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:56.120
if I was standing
in a spotlight,

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.920
their skin started to bubble.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.040
And they would say
the wrong things,

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.910
and they would back away.

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:04.880
And I'd be like,
OK, let's increase

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.290
the radius of that spotlight.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.300
Let's intensify it.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:12.830
It was kind of a
crass tactical move--

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:15.650
based on watching
30 Rock, and seeing

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:20.210
that Tina Fey had this enviable
control over her franchise.

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:24.470
Because she was on screen,
and who would question her,

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:26.180
with her resume?

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.180
And then also, just the fact
that she was Paul Newman

00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:30.950
on her own salad dressing.

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:32.810
And so it's like,
well, I'm not an actor,

00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:37.250
but I can at least
do off-screen what

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:39.290
Tina Fey is doing,
and kind of, like,

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:41.630
become the face of my content.

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:48.150
And that will help solidify
my power against my enemies--

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:49.467
who weren't my enemies.

00:53:49.467 --> 00:53:51.300
DANA HAN-KLEIN: But if
you ever had enemies,

00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.100
you'd solidified your power.

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:54.196
AUDIENCE: Hi, Mr. Harmon.

00:53:54.196 --> 00:53:54.946
DAN HARMON: Hello.

00:53:54.946 --> 00:53:56.890
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:58.590
So, I love Rick and
Morty, and I was

00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:02.742
wondering what your favorite
episode to create was?

00:54:02.742 --> 00:54:06.090
Or to watch, I guess.

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:10.290
DAN HARMON: Favorite episode
of Rick and Morty so far--

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:10.860
I don't know.

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:11.190
I get--

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:12.981
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Season
three, episode five.

00:54:12.981 --> 00:54:13.706
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:13.706 --> 00:54:14.610
DAN HARMON: Right.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.980
Well, there is one
coming up shortly,

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:20.010
in season three, that's
one of my favorites.

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:21.660
I think it airs--

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:25.260
I think there's one
coming up, and then I

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:27.297
think it's the one after that.

00:54:27.297 --> 00:54:27.880
I think it's--

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:31.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:33.068
DANA HAN-KLEIN: On the
"hm-hmm" of "mm-hmm."

00:54:33.068 --> 00:54:35.940
DAN HARMON: It's season
three, episode three.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:39.030
You may have seen, like,
promotional stuff, so it's not

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:42.500
a spoiler to say
"Pickle Rick," I think.

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.060
And it was just really fun
to talk about that episode,

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.330
because it was so
simultaneously elegant,

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.377
and then kind of ended up
going so deep, I guess.

00:54:50.377 --> 00:54:51.960
We'll see how you
react to it, though.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.990
Because a part of me is like,
if everybody in this room

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:59.800
says something sucks, then not
only will I, out of cowardice,

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.030
never admit that I disagree--

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:04.680
I will also, like--

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.940
my brain will change.

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.590
Like, if everyone in the
room said an episode sucked,

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:13.070
I'd be like, yeah, that sucked.

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:15.290
Like, I would just believe it.

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:16.604
Because it's TV.

00:55:16.604 --> 00:55:18.270
What are you doing,
If you're not trying

00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:20.110
to make people like something?

00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:20.610
You know?

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:22.740
It's hard to, like--
oh, this episode rules,

00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:25.249
no matter what you pricks say.

00:55:25.249 --> 00:55:26.790
It kind of, like,
defeats the purpose

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:27.873
of television as a medium.

00:55:27.873 --> 00:55:31.290
It would be like if
Shakespeare was like, ah,

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.470
I love sonnets so much,
this one's got 90 syllables

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:35.590
in the first line.

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:36.340
Like, what?

00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:36.840
No.

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.769
Part of the medium is, like,
people going, "that was good."

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:40.560
And then it's good.

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.775
It's TV, not church.

00:55:42.775 --> 00:55:45.377
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:45.377 --> 00:55:47.460
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I think
that's actually debatable.

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.820
Some people look to
TV more than religion.

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.650
DAN HARMON: Well, it's
better than church--

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:53.410
it will fulfill you, in the end.

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:54.965
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:54.965 --> 00:55:55.840
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Wait.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.120
So who do you turn--

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.470
DAN HARMON: You get t-shirts,
and then you wear them.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:00.970
It's not, you know, just
put money in a plate,

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:02.930
and it's like, what--
you have to-- who's--

00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:04.840
DANA HAN-KLEIN: There are plenty
of, like, Jesus paraphernalia

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.450
things.

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:07.520
They've got their
own swag thing going.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.882
But who do you look
to for feedback

00:56:09.882 --> 00:56:11.090
before it gets to that stage?

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:13.250
Like, who do you look to when
you're in the process of it?

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:14.870
DAN HARMON: That's
the tough part.

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:16.010
Well, you're looking
to your colleagues.

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:17.468
You look to the
writers you trust--

00:56:17.468 --> 00:56:19.820
Ryan Ridley, and Mike
McMahan, and Justin Roiland

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:20.450
and everybody.

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:23.780
Like, everybody's all in
a room, sardined together.

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.880
And you're kind of
trying to keep yourselves

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.547
from losing your
minds by checking in

00:56:27.547 --> 00:56:28.880
with each other-- is this funny?

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:29.767
Is that funny?

00:56:29.767 --> 00:56:30.350
But it's hard.

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:32.190
Because, like, you can't--

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:36.620
you'd be a bad TV writer
if Dan Harmon or Justin

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:42.080
Roiland jumped up and said, this
is going to be really funny!

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.140
This is amazing!

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:43.830
This is amazing!

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:49.190
And it's like, well, you're not
a great TV writer for saying,

00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.790
shut up!

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:51.241
Sit down, Harmon.

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:51.740
You know?

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.670
Like, no, it's not funny.

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:57.470
But you're also not, maybe,
doing the show a huge favor

00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:01.381
by constantly only saying, Yep.

00:57:01.381 --> 00:57:01.880
Yep.

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.270
That's true.

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.702
Yep.

00:57:02.702 --> 00:57:03.134
Yep.

00:57:03.134 --> 00:57:03.634
Yep.

00:57:03.634 --> 00:57:04.862
Yep.

00:57:04.862 --> 00:57:06.630
But we're all feeling that way.

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:09.900
So if you're at the
top, then it's like,

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.250
what are you supposed to do?

00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:13.140
So the answer is,
like, you self-loathe,

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:17.230
and you open the door for people
to tell you you're crazy--

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:20.450
but you also get mad if they do.

00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:21.200
Oh, boy.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:21.430
Yeah.

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:23.138
But it's just, you
kind of collectively--

00:57:23.138 --> 00:57:24.470
you hold yourselves hostage.

00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:26.120
You wait for
Stockholm to set in,

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.970
and hope that that
creates a good idea.

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:32.630
But there is no way of knowing.

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:35.940
Also, that's the crazy thing--
is like, we act like we--

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.710
that was my biggest mistake.

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:40.250
Like, that's the big thing
I'm going to fundamentally

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:43.170
change about myself, after
season three of Rick and Morty.

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:46.940
Got to stop thinking that,
just because, technically

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:50.450
speaking, everybody
in the final product

00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:56.180
is saying stuff that was typed,
that that typing is somehow--

00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:58.265
it's not the same
as architecture,

00:57:58.265 --> 00:58:00.320
where it's like,
that's the blueprint.

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:03.110
Therefore, unless
everything is--

00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:04.805
it's a different
kind of process.

00:58:04.805 --> 00:58:07.090
And I have to understand
that and accept that-- that

00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:09.830
so much changes and evolves.

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:13.700
That you have to write a script,
and finish it, and hand it off,

00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.700
so that the process of
it changing 1,000 times

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:19.580
can begin early enough that
changing it 1,000 times

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:21.920
doesn't put you behind schedule.

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.140
And so agonizing
over the wording

00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:27.150
of jokes and monologues and
things is, like, a big mistake.

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:28.864
And I tend to
really over-write--

00:58:28.864 --> 00:58:29.780
what was the question?

00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:30.738
What am I-- where am I?

00:58:30.738 --> 00:58:33.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:35.300
But that's just occurring to me.

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.750
So it's good I came here.

00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:39.824
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Glad
we can be of service.

00:58:39.824 --> 00:58:41.240
AUDIENCE: So, out
of all the shows

00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.540
that are airing right now,
what's your favorite show?

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:45.860
And then, who are your--

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:48.350
outside of your circle-- who
are your favorite writers

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:50.450
or producers that
you look up to?

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:54.740
DAN HARMON: Right now, just
as of an hour before leaving

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.630
the hotel room, I
just started watching

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:57.860
Decker for the first time--

00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:01.070
Tim Heidecker's
thing. (LAUGHS) I'm

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.810
kind of excited to
get caught up on that.

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:12.640
What is it, the thing that we're
watching, comedy-wise, lately?

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.350
You can't help.

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:14.697
You're not a life-saver.

00:59:14.697 --> 00:59:16.280
Because I feel like--
it's just, like,

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:20.044
we always default to true crime.

00:59:20.044 --> 00:59:21.710
Because I want to
just turn my brain off

00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:22.870
of the concept of comedy.

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:25.411
So I'm trying to think, who are
the people that I look up to?

00:59:25.411 --> 00:59:27.660
I mean, almost everybody.

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:29.104
I hate to be corny, but--

00:59:29.104 --> 00:59:30.770
I mean, I haven't
seen The Big Sick yet.

00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:33.110
But I'm really proud to
know Kumail, and watch

00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:37.130
him and Emily take their
story and capture it, and then

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.650
put it out.

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:38.150
You know?

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:45.410
Like, I surround myself with
people that intimidate me,

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:46.900
and that I admire--

00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.630
and then I don't
watch their stuff.

00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:53.450
I don't watch Atlanta,
and I don't watch--

00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:54.920
there's this huge
backlog of stuff

00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.128
I should be watching because
I'm proud of my friends.

00:59:57.128 --> 01:00:00.680
And then something keeps
me from doing that stuff.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.320
I think it has-- it's
not just petty envy.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.060
I don't think that's true.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.590
It's has something
more to do with,

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:09.500
I don't want to ruin
it, or something.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.027
Like, I don't want to--

01:00:12.027 --> 01:00:14.360
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Well, you run
the risk of not liking it.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:14.750
DAN HARMON: Yeah.

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:15.090
There's that.

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:16.200
I think that's what it is.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.690
It's like, I don't want to--

01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:21.560
like, I obsess about act breaks,
and joke landings, and things,

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.420
as if it's, like, some
kind of architecture.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.840
And then you watch
your friend's show,

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.590
and they get away with working
so much less-hard on something

01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:31.580
that you agonized over.

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:34.310
And you just, like, get
filled-- you know, like,

01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:35.690
"that's an act break?

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:36.260
Come on!

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.180
You can't just fart
and go to commercial."

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:39.555
And then you're
like, well, what?

01:00:39.555 --> 01:00:42.650
So you're not enjoying this?

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:43.250
It's hard.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:44.740
It's like you don't
want to create

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.900
that situation for yourself.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.280
But there's got to be something.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:49.940
What is it?

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:50.640
God damn it.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.150
I always-- I swear, I'm
always watching stuff

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:57.267
where I literally say, "you
need to write this down.

01:00:57.267 --> 01:00:58.850
Because you're going
to be at a panel,

01:00:58.850 --> 01:00:59.870
and someone is
going to say, what

01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:00.680
are you watching right now?

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:01.638
What are you thinking?"

01:01:01.638 --> 01:01:04.160
And I don't do it.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.840
My mind draws a complete blank.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.480
All I can think is, I just
watch shows about murder.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.290
And--

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:10.331
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Hoarders.

01:01:10.331 --> 01:01:11.960
DAN HARMON: Yeah.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:12.890
Sorry.

01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:15.637
I'll think of it later, I guess.

01:01:15.637 --> 01:01:16.220
AUDIENCE: Hey.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:19.250
So a lot of my favorite Dungeons
and Dragons experiences are--

01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:20.498
DAN HARMON: Handmaid's Tale!

01:01:20.498 --> 01:01:22.780
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:23.912 --> 01:01:24.870
I really-- I was like--

01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:26.330
DANA HAN-KLEIN: --like Steve
Carrel, The 40-Year-Old--

01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:27.149
Handmaid's Tale!

01:01:27.149 --> 01:01:28.940
DAN HARMON: I was,
like, up and down on it.

01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:31.580
Like, we were--

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:35.117
I was knocking it's use
of those needle drops.

01:01:35.117 --> 01:01:36.950
Like the '80s needle
drops, where it's like,

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:38.630
she's walking-- why is
she doing a Mean Girls

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:39.838
walk, after this weird thing?

01:01:39.838 --> 01:01:41.370
I'm like, just hang back.

01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:45.170
Don't Dansplain this to
yourself, and watch it.

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:47.660
As of that, like, "Heart
of Glass" riot scene,

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.030
where everything starts
falling out-- it was like,

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:52.580
that's such a--

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.950
that's currently what
I'm like addicted to,

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:57.320
that's not nonfiction.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.704
And I'm not--

01:01:59.704 --> 01:02:01.370
I think, at this
point, there's a finale

01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:02.780
that we haven't caught up to.

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:03.280
All right.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.485
Now, what do you want?

01:02:04.485 --> 01:02:06.110
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say, I love it

01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:09.680
when the players of a
Dungeons and Dragons game

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.910
kind of take the game off
the rails with power gaming,

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:16.970
and create this
world-breaking hell hole.

01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:18.680
Do you have any
plans of something

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.890
like that, maybe, for
Harmon Quest in the future?

01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:26.990
DAN HARMON: Do you
mean, like, storytelling

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:30.940
where you transition between
the world we call the real world

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:33.780
and the fantasy world?

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.300
Are you talking about--

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.091
AUDIENCE: I mean, where
they kind of, like,

01:02:37.091 --> 01:02:38.810
take the DM for a
ride, and end up

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:41.780
producing armies of
minion abominations,

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.605
and becoming gods,
and stuff like that.

01:02:44.605 --> 01:02:45.980
DAN HARMON: I
don't think Spencer

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.419
will allow that to happen.

01:02:47.419 --> 01:02:47.960
AUDIENCE: Oh.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.585
DAN HARMON: He keeps
a very tight grip,

01:02:49.585 --> 01:02:51.330
as a dungeon master.

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:51.830
You know?

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:52.480
DANA HAN-KLEIN: That's fair.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.070
DAN HARMON: I don't know
if you've noticed that.

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.910
It's like, its kind
of hard to break-- you

01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:58.120
can't start bullying
him, narratively.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.780
You'll just walk into a
tree that grows in your way.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.290
AUDIENCE: That's fair.

01:03:04.290 --> 01:03:05.373
DANA HAN-KLEIN: All right.

01:03:05.373 --> 01:03:08.090
We have time for our
last two questions.

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:10.340
DAN HARMON: Yes, you
can give me a joint.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:10.890
DANA HAN-KLEIN: --Mr. Harmon.

01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:12.020
AUDIENCE: That's not
what I was going to--

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.010
sign my dead raccoon.

01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:14.670
No.

01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:16.317
So, I saw a
documentary, recently,

01:03:16.317 --> 01:03:18.650
that asked this question to
a bunch of Hollywood people,

01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:21.050
and I'm curious to
hear your side of it,

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:22.700
since you've basically
built a career

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:26.810
on self-doubt and
self-hatred publicly.

01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:31.532
Do you think that you need to
be an asshole to be successful?

01:03:31.532 --> 01:03:33.700
DAN HARMON: (LAUGHS)
No, I don't.

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:34.950
Not at all.

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:40.550
I mean, it almost seems
the opposite, doesn't it?

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:42.920
Successful is one
thing-- good is another.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.610
I don't know.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:49.490
Like, that's the big dichotomy
that we tend to enforce--

01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:52.670
"we" being assholes--
is that, "oh, he's

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:55.400
successful because he's nice.

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.230
But is he really talented?

01:03:57.230 --> 01:04:00.000
Don't you really have to be an
asshole to be super-talented?"

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.441
And I don't believe
that, either.

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:04.940
No.

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.170
I don't think that.

01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:08.390
I used to think that you
had to go to a dark place

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:11.420
in order to create, because
creation is destruction,

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.485
and blah, blah, blah.

01:04:12.485 --> 01:04:13.670
And, like-- no.

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:16.640
Like, that's just something
that sickness tells you,

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.930
because it wants to stay you.

01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:22.710
Like, it's in charge, and it's
like, I don't want to leave.

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:24.680
So what am I going to--

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.090
do I want you to go to therapy?

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:26.840
No, I don't.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.950
I am your sickness.

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:29.360
I'll go away.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:32.060
But I think creativity
is more just, like,

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:36.440
getting over your bullshit, and
letting stuff flow through you.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.220
One way to do that is to
get so drunk and angry,

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:42.890
and fall apart so much,
that you have nothing left

01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:44.270
but what's coming through you.

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:47.510
Another way to do that
is to breathe four times.

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:48.860
Or eat some yogurt.

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:50.090
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.190
Or be in love.

01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:53.420
Or take a vacation.

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.920
Or play with a choo-choo train.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:00.170
Or, like, take a week off
and play some video games.

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:02.810
The end result is just,
like, getting your ego out

01:05:02.810 --> 01:05:04.800
of the way, and letting
it flow through you.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.814
So you definitely don't
have to be an asshole.

01:05:06.814 --> 01:05:08.480
An argument could be
made you shouldn't.

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:15.532
What a dick question, right?

01:05:15.532 --> 01:05:16.490
DANA HAN-KLEIN: I know.

01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:19.731
It's like he wanted you to be
an asshole with the answer.

01:05:19.731 --> 01:05:21.314
DAN HARMON: (LAUGHS)
I'm just kidding.

01:05:24.489 --> 01:05:25.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:27.220
So it sounds like, you
know, you're really busy,

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:29.960
and you've also alluded a few
times to being a workaholic.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.960
So I'm actually
really curious what

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.530
motivated you to kind of take
time, and come out to Google.

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:37.510
You know-- do you
view this as research?

01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:39.410
Has it been productive for you?

01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:42.794
And what's been your
impression so far?

01:05:42.794 --> 01:05:44.710
DAN HARMON: Well, you
get an offer like this--

01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:48.800
and I'm not I'm not trying to
be funny-- and it's an honor.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.300
You know?

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.420
It's like, well, this is--

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:57.910
when I'm 55, there's going to
come a point when I'm like,

01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:01.510
hopefully, off to the
sidelines, and done

01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:02.860
participating in the world.

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:05.860
And do I want to have
spoken at Google?

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:06.360
Yeah.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:06.860
You know?

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.400
It's like, whether you
guys become Skynet, or--

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.510
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:13.780
--or the saviors of the
universe, or something

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:17.720
in between, there's going to
be a historical context to it.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:18.220
You know?

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:24.610
And it would be nice to have
my little swipey paper thing,

01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:27.040
or something, in a little jar.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:27.805
You know?

01:06:27.805 --> 01:06:29.680
DANA HAN-KLEIN: Laminated,
preserved forever.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.180
DAN HARMON: I keep
all my laminates.

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:33.190
It's like, you know,
hung around a door knob.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:36.470
And it's like, the
size of the stack--

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:40.210
it's like, oh, people wanted
to hear you talk all the time.

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:45.920
It's just an irresistible
kind of honor.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.807
It makes you feel good.

01:06:47.807 --> 01:06:49.390
And I heard you have
90 kinds of kale.

01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.740
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.948
DANA HAN-KLEIN: This is true.

01:06:50.948 --> 01:06:52.850
This is absolutely true.

01:06:52.850 --> 01:06:53.600
So--

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.530
DAN HARMON: I've never not
eaten 90 kinds of kale before.

01:06:56.530 --> 01:07:00.446
I want to experience saying
"no" to 90 kinds of kale.

01:07:00.446 --> 01:07:02.350
DANA HAN-KLEIN: It's
all about choices.

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:04.010
I think my very
last question is,

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:06.490
if you could go back 10
years and tell yourself

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:09.160
one piece of advice,
what would it be?

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:11.580
Or would you choose
not to go back?

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:14.520
DAN HARMON: No, I would go back.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:18.040
I mean, yeah-- assuming that I'm
not passing up an opportunity

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:23.170
to use that power
(LAUGHS) in a better way.

01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:29.000
If I could just, like, call
through a little toilet paper

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:40.260
tube to myself at 34, I think
I'd say, you know, relax.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.000
Something like that.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.430
Something like--
I'd figure it out.

01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:46.720
I'd go, OK, where
was I at that time,

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.530
and what do I
really need to hear?

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:53.350
It's like, it's going to be
fine no matter what you do.

01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:56.273
Which sounds like a
horrible, complacent message.

01:07:56.273 --> 01:07:58.480
But it's me speaking to myself.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:02.850
Not saying, you don't have a
responsibility to contribute,

01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:05.280
but to say, you
need to let yourself

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.990
off the hook a little bit.

01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:09.450
You're probably, at
the end of the day,

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:12.310
just going to screw
a bunch of stuff up.

01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:14.850
And then also,
like, accidentally

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.109
make some good stuff.

01:08:16.109 --> 01:08:20.430
And then something-- your
prostate, or something--

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:23.010
