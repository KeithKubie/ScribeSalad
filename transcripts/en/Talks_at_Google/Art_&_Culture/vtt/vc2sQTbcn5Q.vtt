JASON ANDREAS: Welcome
to Talks at Google.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.356
I'm Jason Andreas.

00:00:07.356 --> 00:00:08.189
Most of you know me.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.240
Some folks in from Ann Arbor.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.340
We have a live stream going
out to the other Google office

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.840
as well.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.850
So hello, everyone.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.350
Welcome.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.140
Thanks for coming.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.740
I'm here with the incredibly
talented singer/songwriter

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.325
Shakey Graves.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:18.045
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:20.169
JASON ANDREAS: Let's give
him a big Google welcome.

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.210
SHAKEY GRAVES: Thank you.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.081
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.015
Hello.

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:29.660
[LAUGHS] Ooh, easy crowd.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.790
Hi, how are you doing?

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.710
Hi, I'm Alejandro.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.750
I'm Shakey Graves.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.590
It's my morning.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.500
I'm sure it's your actual
genuine afternoon right now.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.240
So we'll try and meet in
the middle here, cheers.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.150
All right.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.284
I'm going to play some songs
for you guys on this guitar

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:52.710
that I wrote.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.050
And I'm going to sing them too.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.150
This first song is called
"Cops and Robbers."

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.030
It's off a record that I just
put out earlier this month,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.621
and I'm going to play you
the relaxing ballad version

00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:11.620
because it's my morning
and it's your afternoon.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.824
That's going to be the
throughline of this.

00:01:15.824 --> 00:01:18.806
[MUSIC - SHAKEY GRAVES, "COPS
 AND ROBBERS"]

00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:18.531
Thank you.

00:05:18.531 --> 00:05:20.996
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:21.982 --> 00:05:24.460
Thank you.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.367
You guys have a
mighty fine office.

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:28.200
It's very strange to
be in an office for me.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.750
It's kind of thrilling.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:30.750
It's exciting.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.556
I'm like, aw, offices have
slides and video games.

00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:35.555
People are like, mm, no.

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:41.500
I'm sure it's kind of a trap.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.140
I saw that video game section
up there and was like,

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.780
no one's there, because
they're at work.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.325
That's good.

00:05:47.325 --> 00:05:48.700
They're like,
yeah, come up here.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.241
Come up here.

00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:52.134
[MIMICS RADIO] Billy's upstairs
playing video games right now.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.900
All right.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.489
Here's a song about a
fictional character that--

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:01.780
now we started to refer to
all the fictional characters

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.110
in my music that
aren't specifically me,

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.240
which I don't write
a lot about me,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.270
but now we call this
person Garth Nazarth.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.490
That's the name
of the person that

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.510
is the central
protagonist in this song.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.710
So this is a song about Garth
being really down on himself

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.680
and not working at a
cool office like this

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.968
and just be like, who am I?

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:29.960
[MUSIC - SHAKEY GRAVES, "DINING
 ALONE"]

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.410
Poor Garth.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.410
[LAUGHS] Thank you.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.750
JASON ANDREAS: A huge
thank you once again.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.830
That was fantastic.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.030
Another round of applause,
please, for Alejandro.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.117
SHAKEY GRAVES: Thank you.

00:10:33.117 --> 00:10:34.158
JASON ANDREAS: Thank you.

00:10:34.158 --> 00:10:36.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.130
I was telling, in
between, the quick set

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.200
change-- he was spot
on with the video game

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.580
reference, wasn't he?

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.020
No one ever plays video games.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.480
Like, people who come visit,
they play video games.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.850
But it's collecting
dust up there.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:49.590
So--

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.350
SHAKEY GRAVES: I'm on to you.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.380
JASON ANDREAS: --it's
a good recruiting tool.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:51.540
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.040
[LAUGHS]

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.873
JASON ANDREAS: Cool.

00:10:52.873 --> 00:10:54.020
Well, thank you so much.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.320
You've been super busy.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.660
We know you just came in
from Montreal last night,

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.160
trekked all the way
over to Detroit.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.710
You've got the Royal Oak
Music Theater this evening.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.050
You just released your
new album, which you just

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.490
rang two songs off for us.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.230
So thank you again.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.910
This just released
on, what, May 5,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.290
I believe, so just a
couple of weeks ago.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.680
And now you've got this
massive tour lined up.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.292
All the way through November,
you're going over to Europe

00:11:17.292 --> 00:11:19.000
and hitting a lot of
different countries.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.310
You're playing, I think, Bottle
Rock, Sasquatch, Red Rocks,

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:29.237
the Ryman, the legendary
Ryman, Google Detroit.

00:11:29.237 --> 00:11:30.985
SHAKEY GRAVES: Whoo!

00:11:30.985 --> 00:11:31.860
I'm there!

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.390
I made it!

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.250
JASON ANDREAS: The
most iconic venue.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:33.940
Yes.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.190
SHAKEY GRAVES: Google Detroit!

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.160
Google Motor City!

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.701
JASON ANDREAS: You'll be at the
Ryman, like, this is nothing.

00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:42.160
I've been to Google Detroit,
so everything is much worse.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.060
That's a lot.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.726
You're talking about
being in an office.

00:11:44.726 --> 00:11:47.491
How do you find
the energy to push

00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:49.990
through a schedule like that
and perform every single night,

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.790
come in and hang out
with us on your time off?

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.440
Where does all that
energy come from?

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.360
SHAKEY GRAVES: Oh my god.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.000
I wouldn't say I have that
much energy all the time.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.340
But the show and the music
that I've tried to make

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.020
allows me to have a
boring night if I want to.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.610
I would hope that
kind of in general,

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.670
if I was in a full-on jump
up and down punk band and had

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.620
to do this, I have
no idea what--

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.750
it would have to be
like total sobriety

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.445
or like just like rahh!

00:12:18.445 --> 00:12:20.987
Just the opposite side of
the spectrum or something.

00:12:20.987 --> 00:12:22.070
JASON ANDREAS: I hear you.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.830
SHAKEY GRAVES: I have no idea.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.650
But luckily, you know,
there's a storytelling aspect

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.020
to the music I write.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.090
I mean, performing is
thrilling in the first place.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.040
So even if you're
not feeling like it,

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.360
being forced into a room
full of people sometimes

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.020
just throws a snake in
your shoes pretty quickly.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.584
A little colloquialism.

00:12:41.584 --> 00:12:44.000
You know, an old snake in your
shoes-- you guys have that?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.410
No.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.115
JASON ANDREAS: No, we do.

00:12:45.115 --> 00:12:46.690
We use that up here
in Michigan too.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.960
SHAKEY GRAVES: You also drop
snakes in people's shoes?

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.087
JASON ANDREAS: That's a
universal thing for sure,

00:12:51.087 --> 00:12:52.420
the old snake in the shoe trick.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:52.630
SHAKEY GRAVES: Right.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.200
[LAUGHS]

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.930
JASON ANDREAS: I'm sure you play
off the crowd's energy as well

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.554
too, depending on what you come
out and play and how you start.

00:12:57.554 --> 00:13:01.917
Because your music has
changed from this album

00:13:01.917 --> 00:13:04.000
back to some of the first
albums that you put out.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.560
So I guess you
could probably play

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.000
a little bit with the
crowd as well, based

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.405
on the type of energy you bring
and start with and end with

00:13:09.405 --> 00:13:10.060
and things like that.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.434
Do you think about that when
you put together a set list?

00:13:12.434 --> 00:13:14.350
SHAKEY GRAVES: I do, yeah.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.200
This tour kind of more
than any of them--

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.762
because I mean, each one
of these series of shows

00:13:19.762 --> 00:13:20.470
that we've done--

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.950
I've been on the road since--

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.530
it feels like
continuously since 2012.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.600
And that's not like an
accurate description of it.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.160
But every bit of it is kind
of building a new piece

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.010
and realizing what you suffer
from from the last time

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.670
that I tried to, you know,
play six shows a week for three

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:40.670
weeks in a row.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.570
And there's like, you can get
ahead of it with your brain

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.560
and try and be like,
OK, don't do this.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.690
Do do this.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.740
But it's kind of a
day-to-day basis.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.770
And so for this
show specifically,

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.590
because of the new
record and new sounds

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:59.200
and technological
advances in guitar stuff,

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.060
it's a lot of new things
being introduced to a sound

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.480
that maybe some people perceive
as being more rootsy or organic

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.340
or, you know, like using
luggage as instruments.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.530
JASON ANDREAS: Right.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.590
SHAKEY GRAVES: But
so for this, I've

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.387
been reading a book by David
Byrne called "How Music Works"

00:14:17.387 --> 00:14:18.595
that he put out in 2000 and--

00:14:18.595 --> 00:14:19.260
JASON ANDREAS:
It's a great book.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.510
SHAKEY GRAVES: It's
a great book, yeah.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.920
And again, "Stop Making
Sense," the movie,

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.566
was always a big inspiration
for stage show, even years ago.

00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:28.940
And I didn't really
reflect that.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.690
But when I was introducing new
band members, because people

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.550
didn't even know I was
playing with a band,

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.530
I would kind of do
them one at a time.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.630
And we used to do this
thing with my guitar player

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.130
where we'd plant
him in the audience

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.654
and pretend that he was--

00:14:40.654 --> 00:14:42.320
I'd be like, does
anyone know this song?

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.109
He'd be like, me, me, me!

00:14:44.109 --> 00:14:45.150
JASON ANDREAS: I knew it!

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.810
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah, we'd try
and like crowd surf him up,

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.060
and then, you know, he would
know how all the pedals worked.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.850
And it was supposed to be a gag,
but you know, every night there

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.940
was somebody that was like,
wow, that kid was really good.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.220
JASON ANDREAS: Incredible.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.860
SHAKEY GRAVES: And
you know, and then

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.579
some people just could
immediately tell,

00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:01.870
like, there's no way he knows
how all these pedals work

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.650
on this board.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.840
And I've always tried
to play with kind

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.850
of showing the strings.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.770
And specifically
with this record

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.890
is kind of more dream-oriented
and a little more psychedelic.

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:16.000
So the way that we have
our stage show was all--

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.070
like a week before we
went on tour, I was like,

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.890
guys we're going
to change the way

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.410
this stage looks and
tried to work on stuff

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.750
like hiding amplifiers so
you're not paying attention

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.510
to what gear we're
playing out of and using

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.099
manipulatable, practical
lights on stage

00:15:31.099 --> 00:15:32.890
instead of depending
entirely on the house.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.160
So we can control the
rise and fall of the mood

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.550
and sort of where things focus.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.690
And I've been trying to
utilize like flashlights

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.350
and really basic
things that focus you

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.320
where you need to be paying
attention before it turns

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.940
into a massive show.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.470
And so all of that has been
wonderful and way better

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.750
for my brain to focus
on than every day trying

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.780
to worry about, like,
how do I entertain?

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.490
Like, oh no!

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.207
Who am I tonight?

00:15:59.207 --> 00:16:00.040
And it's like, nope.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:02.230
Now I have to make sure
that the flashlights work

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.380
and that this stupid
reel-to-reel tape

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.730
machine that I have that plays
Martin Denny is on and simple,

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.465
like regular problems.

00:16:11.465 --> 00:16:13.840
JASON ANDREAS: We face some
of those challenges here too.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.880
Before you came out, we were
talking about our lighting

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.963
system as well back there.

00:16:16.963 --> 00:16:19.210
And if there was a way for
me to use like a clapper

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.529
to change a color.

00:16:20.529 --> 00:16:22.570
So life, if I asked like
a somber question, maybe

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.069
it would turn blue, if it was
a more upbeat question, green.

00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:26.682
So we face the same challenges.

00:16:26.682 --> 00:16:29.140
SHAKEY GRAVES: Can't you guys
like wire that into the heart

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.800
monitors that go throughout
the office or something?

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.800
And if everyone gets
real awkward, like ooh,

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.570
it will be like
[WHIRRING SOUND]..

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.410
JASON ANDREAS:
Artificial intelligence--

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.580
I just think I want blue
lights, and then they turn blue.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.080
SHAKEY GRAVES: There we go.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.950
JASON ANDREAS: That's coming up.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.270
We're beta testing
that right now.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:41.660
SHAKEY GRAVES: Good.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.530
JASON ANDREAS: So
we'll get that out.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.360
If it works, we'll get it
into your show routine.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:44.740
It'll be great.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:45.230
SHAKEY GRAVES: Let's do that.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.860
That would be great.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.820
JASON ANDREAS: Let's
talk about the new album,

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.736
because you talked about
it just a minute ago.

00:16:48.736 --> 00:16:52.400
So it does have a new vibe for
all of the Shakey Graves fans

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.750
out there.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:57.560
You know, his first four albums
were a little bit more rootsy,

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.720
Americana, folky a little bit.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.980
And this definitely has--

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.935
I wrote down in my notes,
"a dreamlike sound to it."

00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:06.060
Then I put, "Is that the
right way to describe it?"

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:06.660
I was going to ask you.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.451
But you said it, so
hopefully that's right.

00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:09.844
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah.

00:17:09.844 --> 00:17:11.260
JASON ANDREAS:
It's a great album.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.599
Where did the sound come from?

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:13.520
Where did this
progression come from?

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.310
Of course, all artists change
and progress and fine tune.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.710
So why after four
albums did this

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.074
become kind of the inspirational
sound for the album?

00:17:21.074 --> 00:17:22.490
SHAKEY GRAVES: I
mean, I would say

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.910
that this sound, the way
that this record sounds,

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:30.920
if I could have in
2010 made something

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.420
that sounded like this,
I probably would have.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.440
And it's always been a
pleasure to kind of discover

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.500
what I sound like, so to speak.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.560
One of the pleasures
of my life is

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.840
having to fight
with my own brain

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.837
about what I sound
like to myself,

00:17:48.837 --> 00:17:50.170
because I'm like, I sound great.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.290
And people are like, yeah, but
not for the reasons you think.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.180
Like, you're not
killing this part,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.180
but we like watching
you wiggle around.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.770
Like, ah, that's
not what I wanted.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:07.300
But for instance, you know,
this came out of necessity,

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.660
not like I'm going
to be some guy that

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.960
plays an abstract instrument.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.970
It was like really
trying to figure out

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.080
how I could get a guitar
and a drum into my car

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.570
that I didn't have at the
time, so into someone's car

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.390
who would drive me
somewhere without too

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.680
much of a footprint, you know.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.180
And I was like, I
can probably stuff

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.890
an amp inside of this thing.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.170
And it was trying to make
consistent sound wherever

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:32.950
I went.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.349
Because I had recorded a
record like this sort of,

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:39.640
the first one that I put out,
which sounds more rootsy,

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.540
but it also had a lot of voices
layered on it and me playing

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:44.500
multiple things.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.540
And I couldn't do it live with
an acoustic guitar in front

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.040
of people.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.920
So I learned a new way, and
then that became a new sound.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:57.020
And then people were into me
doing this more than recording.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.600
It's like weapons and armor.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.927
You build one thing.

00:18:59.927 --> 00:19:01.510
You know, for instance,
the way that I

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.647
played the songs earlier off
of this is not how they sound.

00:19:04.647 --> 00:19:05.980
JASON ANDREAS: Not at all, yeah.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.200
SHAKEY GRAVES: But
that's the pleasure

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.855
of finding what songs sound like
or how you even perform them.

00:19:11.855 --> 00:19:13.480
JASON ANDREAS: Has
the process changed?

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:18.350
Your first album, which came
out five, six years ago,

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.387
seven years ago?

00:19:19.387 --> 00:19:20.470
SHAKEY GRAVES: 2011, yeah.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:21.580
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah,
seven years ago.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.030
SHAKEY GRAVES: Seven years ago.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.196
JASON ANDREAS: Good at math.

00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:25.840
I didn't even use a
calculator for that.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.431
That, and correct
me if I'm wrong,

00:19:27.431 --> 00:19:28.930
but you recorded
that in your house.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:29.721
SHAKEY GRAVES: Mhm.

00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:32.890
JASON ANDREAS: Now, this
was recorded using--

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.750
if I read the story
correctly, you

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.840
kind of did this homage
tour around the country

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.150
to draw inspiration.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.140
You stopped up in Woodstock,
New York and Levon Helms's bar.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.920
And The Band is my
favorite band of all time.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.330
You were in Austin, of course.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.080
You were all over.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.830
You stopped in Colorado
and different spots.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.930
How did that play
in, from starting

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:59.170
in your house recording all
of the tracks, to this album?

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:00.670
Did it change or
did it not change?

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.650
SHAKEY GRAVES: I mean, the
secret is that I lied to you.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.050
I didn't go anywhere
to do this album.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.250
I did it all in my house.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:06.170
JASON ANDREAS:
It's a great story.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:06.370
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:06.910
Exactly.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.150
No, we did do those trips.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:13.030
But the majority of this
was still made in my house

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.050
and finished in the house
and stuff like that.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.810
But since I have
other band members,

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.030
and instead of
playing it all myself,

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:24.400
I really wanted this
to be a more cohesive,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.080
collaborative effort.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.420
And so instead of flying--

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.180
because my bass player lives in
New York and my guitar player

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.890
lives in LA.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.050
And so instead of
flying them to Austin,

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.720
I realized quickly that
it's a lot more fun

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.520
and it's easier to take
something seriously

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.000
if you make a limited
event out of it.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.120
Because if we're in Austin, it's
like, eh, we've got work to do.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.790
And also at the same time, we
have tons of friends there.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.360
And there's always like--

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.490
it's Margarita Monday
every day for some reason.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:59.590
And it's just too easy
to not work at home.

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.460
And it works fine sometimes,
but to really try and make

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.900
sure we actually
finish something,

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.960
it was much more interesting
to go to Colorado

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.710
and rent a little house
and all live in it

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:10.970
and then wire that up.

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.240
So even when we went on
these recording excursions,

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.830
it wasn't usually to studios.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:18.340
We still made the studio out
of the space we were in, just

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:18.924
like my house.

00:21:18.924 --> 00:21:19.881
JASON ANDREAS: Got you.

00:21:19.881 --> 00:21:21.430
So more inspiration
taken from some

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.620
of those places and then the
recording was done, kind of--

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.286
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah,
and you can sort of

00:21:25.286 --> 00:21:28.510
hear the different qualities
of where songs were written,

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.614
subliminally, I feel like.

00:21:29.614 --> 00:21:30.780
JASON ANDREAS: That's great.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.074
Where's the album
title come from,

00:21:33.074 --> 00:21:34.240
the inspiration behind that?

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.031
SHAKEY GRAVES: Well,
the album title really

00:21:36.031 --> 00:21:38.600
comes from hearing the
songs all together.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.600
The nice part about the
narrative of this record

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.630
is that I wrote the music
first, and then the lyrics,

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.600
and then titled it,
and then sequenced it.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.404
So it's always a wild way
to build narrative out

00:21:50.404 --> 00:21:51.820
of something that
you already have

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.030
and actually listen to the
music that we had started

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.867
to write and ask
yourself, objectively,

00:21:57.867 --> 00:21:59.200
like, what does this sound like?

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.300
You know, sort of
like writing a score,

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.430
writing a verbal
score to music, which

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:08.710
is the inverse of writing
a musical score to a movie

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:09.310
or something.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.137
You know, it's kind
of the opposite.

00:22:11.137 --> 00:22:12.220
JASON ANDREAS: Absolutely.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.570
And I read too that when you
sat down with this album,

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.510
before it even came
to fruition, you

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:23.260
had this idea that you
wanted to roughly follow

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.610
"The Wizard of Oz."

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.220
And that was a lot
of the inspiration

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.194
behind some of the musical
motivation in this album.

00:22:31.194 --> 00:22:32.860
Tell us about that,
because that's wild.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.068
SHAKEY GRAVES: The main
thing with "The Wizard of Oz"

00:22:35.068 --> 00:22:39.670
is that it was the best analogy
I had for basically wanting

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.950
this record to really embrace
going into color, so to speak.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.506
Because the first albums I
have, even the record covers,

00:22:48.506 --> 00:22:49.630
are all in black and white.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.296
And it wasn't like
an intentional thing.

00:22:51.296 --> 00:22:54.440
I just liked the monochrome
covers that I chose.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.190
And then eventually
I was like, well, you

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.560
know, what do I do
for this record cover?

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.326
And I wanted to address
everything as opposed

00:23:03.326 --> 00:23:05.450
to just being like, we got
some new sounding stuff.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.199
This is how it is.

00:23:06.199 --> 00:23:09.040
And like, ah, you know, it's
a song about, blah blah.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.520
I was trying to make sure
that each thing was sort

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.130
of meticulously unpackagedable.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:19.000
So for this, the
initial concept I

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.904
wanted for this was to be
a double-layered record.

00:23:21.904 --> 00:23:23.320
And so this would
be like the top.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.840
And there's a little
me right here in there.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.230
And I wanted the top of
it to be all Technicolor

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.090
and then my image to
be in black and white

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.990
and then it to be
an inverse and it

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.090
to be basically the
same street or whatever,

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.400
but it would be a
really boring monotonous

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.651
road in black and white.

00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:43.150
And then my image
would be in color.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:44.710
And it was like, whoa!

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:48.020
You know, the duality
of fantasy and reality.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:51.220
And then I was like, how
am I going to make that?

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.581
And I didn't.

00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:53.080
So.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.310
But that one thing
led to another,

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.930
and it ended up just
kind of sticking

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.900
with this version of it.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.140
And you can see that there is
like, this is a model that I

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.980
built in my house.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.250
So that's my actual head
to scale, the whole thing.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.050
So it was like a series of--

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:19.720
I used an old Disney
technique of layering cells,

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.270
you know, like animation cells.

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.070
So this is a layer, and
then that's a layer.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.517
And it's all spread back, and
you take a photo through it.

00:24:26.517 --> 00:24:28.850
Some of these are real little
train buildings and stuff.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:33.760
And I built a road out of clay
and had a ball in my house,

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.960
and I was like, yeah!

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.000
Look, it looks good!

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.500
JASON ANDREAS: Do
you still have it?

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.430
Is it still in your house?

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.020
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah,
it's slowly kind

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.610
of falling apart and melting--

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:43.000
JASON ANDREAS: Melting, yes.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.630
SHAKEY GRAVES:
--melting into itself.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.338
And my girlfriend's
like, can we move it?

00:24:46.338 --> 00:24:48.260
I'm like, don't touch it.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:49.360
Don't touch it ever.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.560
JASON ANDREAS: That could
be the follow-up album.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.170
SHAKEY GRAVES: "Don't Touch It"?

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.510
JASON ANDREAS: The melted
version, and it says

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.080
"Don't Touch It."

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.680
SHAKEY GRAVES: Oh, good call.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.337
Yeah.

00:24:54.337 --> 00:24:55.170
That's a great idea.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.680
JASON ANDREAS: Just give me
executive producing credit

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.947
if that does come out.

00:24:57.947 --> 00:24:58.780
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.650
JASON ANDREAS: I
never noticed, too.

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:01.024
I saw an interview
where you were

00:25:01.024 --> 00:25:02.972
talking about the album,
which is incredible.

00:25:02.972 --> 00:25:05.180
You guys-- you might not be
able to see it from here,

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.140
so we can come do a close-up
afterwards, but it's awesome.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:09.830
I can't believe
that you built this.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.540
It's fantastic.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.123
And then I never
noticed that you were

00:25:12.123 --> 00:25:14.222
like peeking in from the top.

00:25:14.222 --> 00:25:15.930
You're like I'm on
the album cover twice.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.350
You're down here,
which is clear,

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.058
and then you're peeking
in from the side.

00:25:19.058 --> 00:25:19.700
So, well done.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.116
SHAKEY GRAVES:
That was also the--

00:25:21.116 --> 00:25:25.500
you know, I guess "The Wizard
of Oz" thing stuck in my brain

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.410
and was a good reference
point to tell the other band

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.990
members too, that
initially I even wanted

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:35.790
the sound of the record to
start thinner and sort of more

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.990
colorless and then it
to really get wild.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.210
And instead of it being so--

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.150
you know, that's a
great thing to go into,

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.850
having a great, stable plan.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:51.400
But once we hit the beach
and started like, ah!

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.650
It was like, what's happening?

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.750
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.630
I read, too, in terms of
like musical inspiration,

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.570
not just artistic but musical
inspiration from the album,

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.580
there's even a couple
songs that have

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.370
a little bit of a Beatles'
"Sergeant Pepper's" feel

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.080
to them.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.010
You mentioned Harry Nelson
as a big motivator in this.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.679
I think Wu-Tang
Clan was mentioned.

00:26:12.679 --> 00:26:14.970
SHAKEY GRAVES: They're always
mentioned, Wu-Tang Clang.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.386
JASON ANDREAS: Wyatt's rocking
the Wu-Tang hat back there,

00:26:17.386 --> 00:26:18.450
which is fantastic.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.460
For you, you talked
about the process

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.870
of how you went from step one
to the album release in terms

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:24.960
of though process.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.460
Where do those
musical inspirations

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.670
come in throughout that?

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.270
Is it during the writing
process, the recording process,

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:30.960
everywhere?

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.430
SHAKEY GRAVES: I mean,
I think it's the same.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:38.072
There's no real direct
influence on the whole record.

00:26:38.072 --> 00:26:40.530
There's some songs that as soon
as you started to write it,

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.500
you're like, what does
this remind me of?

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.320
Then you're like, oh, yeah,
this is just a Kinks song

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.470
that we did ourself.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.200
But instead of trying to
directly reference something,

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.090
it was more if we started
down a road and things started

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.960
to sound a certain way,
it was like a confidence

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.260
in following that, as
opposed to like, are we sure

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.260
that this sounds
like Shakey Graves?

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.219
Because that was a weird
concept to ask myself.

00:27:08.219 --> 00:27:09.301
JASON ANDREAS: Absolutely.

00:27:09.301 --> 00:27:11.970
SHAKEY GRAVES: And then I was
like, what am I talking about?

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:12.840
What is that?

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.050
What does that even mean?

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.580
And is that important?

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.120
And so, you know,
not that it was

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.630
trying to sound like a Nelson
thing or sound like whatever,

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.710
but in certain parts it's
like, oh, let's layer vocals

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.280
and be more comfortable singing
in a certain voice that maybe

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.940
isn't the typical thing but
just to use the same narrative

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.000
quality that that
Nelson gets away with

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.920
and the Beatles, you
know, for that matter.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.570
JASON ANDREAS: Did that
make you nervous at all,

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.370
kind of challenging the
perception-- because you

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.200
mentioned it just a
minute ago, like, what

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.252
does Shakey Graves sound like?

00:27:45.252 --> 00:27:45.960
What's the sound?

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.340
What is the theme?

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.330
Did challenging that
perception for your fans,

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.080
for yourself, was
that ever something

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.830
that made you nervous
through the process?

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.620
SHAKEY GRAVES: Oh,
yeah, absolutely.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:04.110
And then at the same time, it's
like I sort of try and make,

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.170
you know, commandments for
myself every once in a while.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.420
And they revise constantly.

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.970
But it's always nice
to look back at rules,

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.350
maybe, that you write.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.770
And they can be
arbitrary but just

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:21.540
like simple, like there is no
Shakey Graves or something.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.440
And you're like, whoa!

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:28.230
And some days it's important
to remember that the reason--

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.910
to look at the history of why
I put any of this together,

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:34.950
you know, the suitcase,
why I even go by a name

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.290
is that I wanted this
to be a project that

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:38.130
could be malleable.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.930
Like, early Shakey
Graves stuff doesn't

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:41.880
sound like Americana music.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.060
It sounds like 17-year-old
who listened to a few low fi

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.690
and noise records and
was like [MIMICS SINGING]

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:50.527
and playing stupid
loops of things.

00:28:50.527 --> 00:28:51.360
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.200
It works.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:52.530
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.613
And you guys haven't even
heard any of that stuff,

00:28:54.613 --> 00:28:56.490
but you will one day
and be like, oh my god!

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:57.948
JASON ANDREAS: The
unreleased tape.

00:28:57.948 --> 00:28:59.100
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.760
But for me, it's like
this is a project

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:08.940
that I want to make
sure defies or surpasses

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:16.230
kind of genre specificity,
because that's its point.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.810
And I feel like it started
to go maybe a little

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:23.335
too far into the
simply Americana realm.

00:29:23.335 --> 00:29:24.960
And not that that's
a bad thing at all,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.210
but it was important
for me to make

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.640
sure that people understand
not that I'll never

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.280
make stuff that sounds folky
or whatever ever again.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.320
I'm not like, it's over!

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.920
I'm not going to touch
an acoustic guitar

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.378
or sing about the
woods ever again.

00:29:36.378 --> 00:29:37.780
I'm not going to do it.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.290
It's more like, I have
a ton of other things

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.710
that if I didn't express or
get to follow this rabbit hole,

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:48.360
I'm not sure I'll ever see
the other side of creativity

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.817
that I so yearn for.

00:29:50.817 --> 00:29:51.650
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.970
How's the fan reception
been so far at shows?

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.620
I know you've been out playing
for a couple of weeks now.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.940
How's the fan reception
been with the new stuff?

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.970
SHAKEY GRAVES: It's been great.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:58.320
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah?

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.090
That's great.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.120
SHAKEY GRAVES: The show is
disorienting, which is good.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.680
It's kind of the point.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.682
And I've seen a wonderful
response from that too.

00:30:08.682 --> 00:30:10.140
And, you know, I'm
sure some people

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.810
are like, what is he doing?

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.840
But overall, it's like a
shock and awe kind of thing.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.167
And the subtleties that
we're doing onstage,

00:30:19.167 --> 00:30:21.500
I've gotten to talk to people
who've never seen the show

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:26.930
or listened to the music,
and it worked on just

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.390
like a man on the street.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:30.530
And I was like, yes!

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:31.101
We got you.

00:30:31.101 --> 00:30:33.350
They're like, yeah, when you
play with that one light,

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.020
it's like it's weird.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.570
It's like a campfire,
but it's purple.

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.470
Then you do this thing.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:38.030
And then you turn
on part of the set.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.405
And it's like,
whoa, other stuff.

00:30:39.405 --> 00:30:40.580
I'm like, yes, keep talking.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.420
JASON ANDREAS: 'Cause
you're going for it.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.260
SHAKEY GRAVES:
That's exactly right.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.490
JASON ANDREAS: I love it.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.355
I want to talk about
one song on the album.

00:30:45.355 --> 00:30:46.980
We talked about this
just a minute ago.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.172
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah.

00:30:48.172 --> 00:30:49.880
JASON ANDREAS: It's
called "Aibohphobia."

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.180
You've got to look it up.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.017
SHAKEY GRAVES: Check it out.

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:55.100
JASON ANDREAS: I'm not
even going to talk anymore.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.010
Tell us about the song.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.000
SHAKEY GRAVES: No, I want
you to describe this song.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:57.916
JASON ANDREAS: OK, OK.

00:30:57.916 --> 00:30:59.510
SHAKEY GRAVES: [LAUGHS]

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:01.676
JASON ANDREAS: This is one
of the songs when I first

00:31:01.676 --> 00:31:05.774
heard it, I was like, this has
got such a cool sound to it.

00:31:05.774 --> 00:31:07.940
That's when I mentioned
"Sergeant Pepper's" a minute

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.440
ago.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.200
It does have kind of this up
and down beat, very Beatles,

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.880
"Sergeant Pepper's" type vibe.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.170
So it immediately drew me in.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.628
And then I started
listening to it.

00:31:16.628 --> 00:31:21.410
So aibohphobia is actually
a palindrome of itself.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:24.240
So it's spelled the same
way front as it is back.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.157
We all work at Google.

00:31:25.157 --> 00:31:27.740
I can't assume you all know what
a palindrome is, though, so I

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.340
helped you out on that one.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.490
But the song, the lyrics,
if you listen to them,

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:33.240
there's so many
palindromes thrown in.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.990
And the entire last sentence
is a palindrome on itself,

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:41.120
which when I looked at
it, I had to actually like

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.850
sit there for about 30
seconds to figure it out.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.190
And it's incredible
how you've done it.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.590
So it's not only a really
cool sounding song,

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:51.722
but to me, it's mind-blowing in
terms of the way you wrote it.

00:31:51.722 --> 00:31:53.180
And again, I told
you, mind-blowing

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.320
for various reasons.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.820
But you talk about
where that came from.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:02.300
You've got some really
serious songs on the record.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.490
You performed one
for us earlier.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.430
But where does a fun
song like that come in?

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.050
What's the process behind that?

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.674
SHAKEY GRAVES: I
mean, it's funny, too,

00:32:10.674 --> 00:32:18.170
because I don't really
feel like any songs I

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.547
make are too serious.

00:32:21.547 --> 00:32:22.380
And that's not true.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.340
Some of them genuinely
are, but there is always,

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.015
for better or for worse, a
sort of playful sense of,

00:32:29.015 --> 00:32:31.460
like, I don't really know
what I'm talking about.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.810
Because that's kind of how
I see a lot of the world

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.820
in the first place, is
that I think it's all just

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:39.470
sort of like, I got this.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:40.850
It's like, yeah, you got this?

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.200
Yep, totally got this.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:42.850
And everyone's
like, (WHISPERING) I

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:43.640
have no idea what I'm doing.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.480
Like, what is this?

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:44.960
Like, nope, got it.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.620
Don't worry about it.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.390
JASON ANDREAS: We do that
every day here at Google too.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.790
SHAKEY GRAVES: Everybody
worldwide is just like, got it.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.581
(WHISPERING) I have no
idea what I'm doing.

00:32:51.581 --> 00:32:53.990
You know, it's just--

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.960
like falling with style, you
know, in the eternal words

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.140
of Buzz Lightyear.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.190
But the "Aibohphobia,"
specifically, is definitely a--

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.305
it's a song that made us
laugh when we wrote it.

00:33:08.305 --> 00:33:09.680
And it kind of
started as we were

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.690
trying to write a more
serious song indoors,

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.570
and then outside my buddy
Rayland Baxter and my guitar

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:20.730
player Pat were riffing
on "Oh You Pretty Thing"

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.522
by David Bowie.

00:33:22.522 --> 00:33:24.230
JASON ANDREAS: Oh
yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.790
SHAKEY GRAVES: I
think that was it.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.390
Or maybe it was
"Suffragette City."

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.450
And they were just like
messing with the chords.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.250
And then he started-- the
first line of the song

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.620
is, "I met her at
the chocolate shop.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.590
She was shopping for chocolate."

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:36.965
And we were like,
whoo whoo whoo.

00:33:36.965 --> 00:33:37.935
That's so funny.

00:33:37.935 --> 00:33:40.360
Like, why that's
funny, I don't know.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360
JASON ANDREAS: It works.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.193
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah.

00:33:42.193 --> 00:33:45.620
Then we kept like coming out,
and someone would add a lyric.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.720
And then someone
used a palindrome,

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.970
and then I was like,
oh, palindromes!

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:52.610
And we looked up this
giant list of palindromes

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.740
and then started sucking
them into the song

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.380
and then found that giant one.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.880
And we were like, oh, we
can put this to music.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.140
And by the end, we had this
crazy sing-along song where we

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.050
were trying to stuff words
into it that we'd like--

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.210
our bass player was like,
put "scone" in there.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:09.941
We're like "scone"?

00:34:09.941 --> 00:34:11.690
How are we going to
put "scone" in a song?

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:12.249
We did.

00:34:12.249 --> 00:34:13.040
We put it in there.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.750
It's in there.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.250
JASON ANDREAS:
Anything is possible.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.679
SHAKEY GRAVES: Yeah, you
can put scone in stuff.

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:22.610
You know, "kayak," "nurses run."

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:26.960
We tried to get a lot of really
silly palindromes in there.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:30.402
And Aibohphobia is a term for an
irrational fear of palindromes.

00:34:30.402 --> 00:34:31.860
JASON ANDREAS: Oh,
yes, good point.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.464
Yeah.

00:34:32.464 --> 00:34:34.880
Everyone here is going to run
out and listen to that song.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:35.379
Please do.

00:34:35.379 --> 00:34:36.290
Because it's good.

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:38.469
It's got a great quality to it.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:40.739
Let me clarify too, in terms
of the more serious side.

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:43.070
I was referencing just
one song in particular,

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.658
and maybe the
background behind it

00:34:44.658 --> 00:34:45.949
is not as serious as I thought.

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:47.449
But the "My Neighbor" song.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:47.980
SHAKEY GRAVES: Oh, sure.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.909
JASON ANDREAS: You kind
of talk about living--

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:52.699
the way that I read
the lyrics is you're

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:54.448
living so close to
folks every day.

00:34:54.448 --> 00:34:56.239
You've got neighbors
to the left and right.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.100
And you don't
necessarily know them

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.417
or trust them other than
maybe just a casual wave.

00:35:00.417 --> 00:35:02.250
And that's what I was
kind of talking about.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:02.600
SHAKEY GRAVES: Sure.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.500
JASON ANDREAS: In
today's society,

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.790
like, I feel like
that's so true.

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:05.790
For some reason,
that spoke to me.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.700
As I said, I live in a
[INAUDIBLE] community

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.060
and sometimes feel the same way.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.490
So that was a little
more of a serious topic,

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:13.940
is kind of what I was thinking,
but not in a very serious

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.270
depressing way, by any means.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:15.890
SHAKEY GRAVES: No, I'm with you.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.200
I mean, the one through
line on all of this

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:23.310
is that all the songs are
kind of just little snapshots

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:27.190
of modern living for me.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:32.270
And I think there's a lot of
irrational fear and fantasy

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:34.440
in the world and
in my own world.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.920
And that's the kind
of stuff that I

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.330
think was worth me playing with,
you know, like the one song

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:48.890
about a monotonous routine
and then fantasy that also--

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.625
both of those
things seem absurd.

00:35:51.625 --> 00:35:53.750
Spending all day dreaming
about walking on the moon

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.000
while you're spending all
day just hating yourself,

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.670
it's like there's bound to be
something in between that's

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:02.030
both attainable and not
so self-deprecating.

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.741
But it's easy to
get sucked into--

00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:06.990
you know, for instance, "My
Neighbor" can go two ways.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.190
It can be like stressed out
about everyone around you,

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.350
or being like, why
doesn't anyone talk to me

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.610
in my neighborhood?

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:17.792
And both of those are valid
and irrational sometimes

00:36:17.792 --> 00:36:18.500
at the same time.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.791
JASON ANDREAS: Well, that's
the cool thing about songs.

00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:23.295
In most cases, they can be
interpreted in different ways,

00:36:23.295 --> 00:36:25.670
even different than the way
you write them in some cases.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:29.209
SHAKEY GRAVES: I try and
leave them open-ended often

00:36:29.209 --> 00:36:29.750
to make sure.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:30.950
Because I've had
people be like, I

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.540
know what this
song's about, man.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.360
It's about being like
an old man in prison.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.855
And I'm like, what?

00:36:36.855 --> 00:36:39.470
This one's about
my dog, you know?

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:41.220
Maybe he is an
old man in prison.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.560
You know, whatever.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.030
JASON ANDREAS: I'm always
cautious when I ask questions,

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:45.249
because I don't want to--

00:36:45.249 --> 00:36:47.540
the way that I ask questions
is how I interpret things,

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.280
but it's clearly
not always right.

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.130
SHAKEY GRAVES: No, I would
rather you interpret something

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.020
that I make than me try
and force my brain on you.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.270
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.936
Well, thank you.

00:36:56.936 --> 00:36:58.600
Very good stuff.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.420
I skipped over some
general questions.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.800
I'm going to go back to it.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.360
Anyone can easily YouTube
previous interviews

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.540
that Alejandro has done
about where his name Shakey

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.830
Graves comes from.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.380
But I love the way
he tells this story.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.990
So where does Shakey
Graves come from,

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.700
for those of us who
haven't seen it yet?

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.930
SHAKEY GRAVES: This is
where I go off road,

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.070
and I'm like, I don't know.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.081
I read it in a book.

00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:21.580
It's basic-- that's
the whole story.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.470
JASON ANDREAS: Oh, shoot.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.720
SHAKEY GRAVES: I tricked you
with that internet video.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.210
JASON ANDREAS: It's over.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.850
SHAKEY GRAVES: No, my friends
and I were at a music festival

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.690
in Austin, Texas, which
is called Old Settlers.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:37.930
And it's like a weekend,
and people play music.

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.740
You don't have to
go see the music.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.050
The campsites kind of
have their own life.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:46.070
And I had been writing
music and hadn't come up

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:49.880
with an alias name that I had
really found appropriate yet.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.030
And I took my guitar
back to Austin

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:58.430
and went to go test my
mettle at these campsites.

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:01.717
And one of these days,
like maybe mid-afternoon,

00:38:01.717 --> 00:38:03.800
we're sitting around
drinking beer next to a fire.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:08.270
And this heavily
tripping man came up

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.430
and was like just fried.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:14.180
And he had a big
24-ounce beer on him.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.420
And he's like, hey, man.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.400
What's the-- wow, wow.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.190
Look at this.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.120
Try my whiskey, man.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:19.690
My whiskey's so good.

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:22.250
And we had a long, loopy
conversation with him.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.719
And he kind of made us
all try his whiskey, which

00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:26.510
we just kind of like
pretended to drink out

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.500
of this big hot can.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.580
And he was like,
oh, it's so good.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:29.590
It's such good whiskey.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.010
We're like, yep.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.120
And by the end, he
sort of teetered off

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.120
and was like, you guys
are good people, man.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:35.750
Keep it up.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:37.922
You know, watch out
for the spooky wagons.

00:38:37.922 --> 00:38:39.380
And the last thing
we heard him say

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.831
was like a warning
about spooky wagons.

00:38:41.831 --> 00:38:43.580
And we're like, did
you hear him say that?

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.080
And it's like, yeah.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.760
And then we kept
talking about it

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.330
and realized that it would be a
great name for like a Nashville

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.520
guitar picker, sort
of like Speedy West

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.780
or something like that.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:58.250
We're like, Spooky Waggins,
like W-A-G-G-I-N-S.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:00.350
And so my friend
was Spooky Waggins,

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:01.730
and I was Shakey Graves.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:06.170
And then his girlfriend
was Spinster Jones.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.890
And then his other
friend was Solomon Doors.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:12.270
And then his little brother
was asleep at the time,

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:13.880
and so we named
him Droopy Wieners.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:18.470
And he woke up and was
stuck with that name.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.949
And that's the most famous
name out of all those names,

00:39:20.949 --> 00:39:22.740
because I made one
internet video about it.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:27.080
And now at least
three to 170 times

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.920
a year, someone just
goes, Droopy Weiners!

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.390
And like sometimes in public
and other people are like,

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.550
what the-- what's happening?

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.510
How's Droopy Wieners?

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.700
Because I'm always like
hanging around, you know.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.491
JASON ANDREAS: I'll be
at the show tonight.

00:39:39.491 --> 00:39:41.081
So if you hear it,
it's definitely me.

00:39:41.081 --> 00:39:42.080
SHAKEY GRAVES: OK, good.

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.621
JASON ANDREAS: Definitely me.

00:39:43.621 --> 00:39:44.870
I was going to ask a question.

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:47.270
Since we are at
Google, we sometimes

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:50.650
tie a very rough
technology question in.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:52.070
SHAKEY GRAVES: Shoot.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:52.790
JASON ANDREAS:
Today's day and age,

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.230
there's this
pressure, especially

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:57.020
amongst younger kids, to like
maintain this digital presence,

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:57.520
right?

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.800
It's all about getting likes
and clicks and things like that.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.250
You, again, based on
my interpretation,

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:05.870
talk a little bit,
in a very kind

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.640
of light way on the album--

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.926
I think the song's
"Kids These Days"--

00:40:09.926 --> 00:40:11.300
you talk a little
bit about that.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.360
But I feel like, even
just from hanging out

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.110
with you for the past
two hours or so, you

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:17.390
have a very cool
down-to-earth vibe.

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:21.790
Like, how do you maintain
that type of vibe in a world,

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.820
in the music industry, in
the entertainment industry?

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.650
You lived in LA for a long time.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.520
You did some acting early on.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.930
Is it all a show?

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:33.525
Are you really a
pretty chill guy?

00:40:33.525 --> 00:40:34.900
SHAKEY GRAVES:
Oh, good question.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:35.890
JASON ANDREAS: [LAUGHS]

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:37.738
SHAKEY GRAVES: No,
I'm a very mean man.

00:40:37.738 --> 00:40:39.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:39.462 --> 00:40:40.170
No, I don't know.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:49.020
You know, my age is someone
who put me young in a time

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.041
where there wasn't
really internet.

00:40:52.041 --> 00:40:56.280
Like, I can't remember
having dial-up in the house,

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:59.580
and at a point where when
I was in high school,

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.440
it still wasn't
insane if you didn't

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:06.150
have a cell phone at all, let
alone a smartphone, period.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:10.755
And I didn't get a phone
until maybe my junior year

00:41:10.755 --> 00:41:13.240
or senior year in high school.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.980
And then that still,
but I played video games

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:17.910
and stuff as a kid.

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:22.370
And I understood
computers and wasn't--

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:24.990
basically, I grew up kind of
on the cusp of these things,

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:26.700
where I'm not scared
of technology.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.320
It doesn't stress me out.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.700
I feel pretty capable.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.280
And you know, I
use a smartphone,

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.227
and sometimes feel like I'm
really good at the internet

00:41:35.227 --> 00:41:36.060
and stuff like that.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.090
And then at the same
time, all this technology

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:41.640
is growing in such
an exponential way.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.280
And the way that it's
interfaced with changes

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.030
entirely like generation and
just sometimes month-to-month.

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:51.900
And it can be overwhelming for
everybody involved, I think.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:56.970
But it's, again, a
reality and not something

00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:02.280
that is to be ignored
or feared in any way.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.470
You know, it's still part of
even the stuff in this record.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:11.100
Like a lot of my anxiety
comes out of the internet.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.050
Because like maintaining
a social presence

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:15.370
or putting yourself out
there now has direct response

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.320
so quickly someone can
just be like, you suck!

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.500
And you're like, ahh!

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.017
And you just forget about
the like 40 other people

00:42:22.017 --> 00:42:23.850
before that that were
like, changed my life,

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:24.780
having a great time.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.157
One dude's like, your balls!

00:42:26.157 --> 00:42:26.990
And you're like, no!

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.080
And at the same
time, you know, if I

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.220
go see some movie I don't
like, I'm like, your balls!

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.880
I'm like super into it.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.690
So it's like a
glass houses thing.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.090
We're all living in glass
houses at this point,

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.960
and we're just chock
full of stones.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.980
And I don't know where
it's going to lead.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:51.180
And my level of participation
with the internet

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.930
has to, again,
change day-to-day.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:56.280
I've noticed I can
just relax so much

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.660
more if I don't have my phone.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.030
But then sometimes it's
the most necessary thing,

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:04.740
because I'm also a business
person, because I'm technically

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:09.060
the head of the snake that
leads us all on tour and stuff.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.250
So sometimes I have
to answer questions

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.820
in a reasonable amount of
time or I fuck everything up.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.830
So it's like, I don't know.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:18.880
I'm sort of waiting to
see where this goes.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:24.420
And I always am looking for
a simpler, more helpful way

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.100
to do things.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.630
And then at the same time,
it's always necessary for me

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:28.900
to go back to pen and paper.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.441
So I think that's
kind of the problem

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:32.830
that everybody
keeps going back to

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.947
is like, how do you have an
organic, futuristic society?

00:43:35.947 --> 00:43:36.780
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.340
You mentioned earlier
something that

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.100
struck me in terms of
some of the feelings

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.780
on the album, these extremes.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.487
You don't have to be terribly
bored with your life,

00:43:45.487 --> 00:43:47.070
and you don't have
to be an astronaut.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.470
You can be somewhere in between.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.907
And I think the same thing
goes with technology.

00:43:50.907 --> 00:43:52.740
There are some good
things about technology.

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.330
There are some great
things about it.

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:57.420
But there's also some good
things about vinyl record

00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.264
albums and pen and paper.

00:43:59.264 --> 00:44:00.930
If you can find
somewhere in the middle,

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.640
that's, I feel, where
the happy medium lies.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.473
But it's really hard
to find that sometimes,

00:44:04.473 --> 00:44:06.720
because people do tend to
go one way or the other.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.845
SHAKEY GRAVES: Well, I
mean, one of those fantasies

00:44:08.845 --> 00:44:09.540
of technology--

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:13.060
it's also the scary part--

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:17.460
is the dream that it's so
ingrained and so imperceivable

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.047
that it almost just
looks like magic.

00:44:19.047 --> 00:44:20.130
JASON ANDREAS: Absolutely.

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:22.504
SHAKEY GRAVES: And that's
where a lot of stuff is headed,

00:44:22.504 --> 00:44:25.620
and it's also where that like
"Terminator 2" fear of like,

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.780
do I want my body chipped?

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.779
Where it's like, (ROBOT
VOICE) Hello, Alejandro.

00:44:28.779 --> 00:44:30.010
Welcome, your coffee's ready.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:32.010
And it's like, that's awesome.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:33.990
I would love if coffee
was popping out of walls

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:36.877
everywhere I went and my TV
shows were following me around.

00:44:36.877 --> 00:44:38.460
But, like, is that
really what I want?

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.630
Who am I?

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:40.950
It's like, I don't know.

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:42.325
JASON ANDREAS:
Maybe we can start

00:44:42.325 --> 00:44:44.450
with programmable lighting
that talks to our mood,

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:45.582
and we'll go from there.

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:47.290
SHAKEY GRAVES: It's
still the same color,

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:48.790
so everyone must be
happy at this point.

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:49.230
JASON ANDREAS: It's good.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:49.890
Awesome.

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:51.780
Well, listen, Alejandro,
this was fantastic.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.530
Thank you so much.

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:54.337
Again, I know you've
got a busy schedule.

00:44:54.337 --> 00:44:55.920
Thank you for stopping
by, hanging out

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.251
in an office on your day
off or your time off.

00:44:58.251 --> 00:44:59.250

it's like in an office.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:03.220
JASON ANDREAS: Now you know.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.710
SHAKEY GRAVES: This is what
every office in America

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:05.100
is like.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:05.400
Cool.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.320
JASON ANDREAS: Well,
thank you so much.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.520
Another round of

00:45:10.771 --> 00:45:11.270
Thank you.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.936
I appreciate it.

00:45:11.936 --> 00:45:12.920
That was awesome.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.470
SHAKEY GRAVES: Cool.
