like that question proteins are

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630
like that question proteins are
 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.450
like that question proteins are
molecules what are large molecules that

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
molecules what are large molecules that
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.349

you find everywhere in your body they

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359
you find everywhere in your body they
 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.150
you find everywhere in your body they
conduct almost all the processes that go

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160
conduct almost all the processes that go

the proteins we have or other organizers

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
the proteins we have or other organizers
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.830
the proteins we have or other organizers
have are enzymes that speed up chemical

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
have are enzymes that speed up chemical
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.709
have are enzymes that speed up chemical
reactions but there are reactions we

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
reactions but there are reactions we
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.770
reactions but there are reactions we
want to do in chemical synthesis or to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
want to do in chemical synthesis or to
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.979
want to do in chemical synthesis or to
produce fuels that those enzymes can't

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
produce fuels that those enzymes can't
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.119
produce fuels that those enzymes can't
do so we have to improve them this about

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
do so we have to improve them this about
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.810
do so we have to improve them this about
enzymes produced by Francis Arnold this

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
enzymes produced by Francis Arnold this
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.070
enzymes produced by Francis Arnold this
year for the price and that is to make

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
year for the price and that is to make
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.870
year for the price and that is to make
the enzymes conduct new chemical

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
the enzymes conduct new chemical
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.929
the enzymes conduct new chemical
reactions or better the reactions they

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
reactions or better the reactions they
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.570
reactions or better the reactions they
do today and the other half is about

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
do today and the other half is about
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.850
do today and the other half is about
improving binding protein so these are

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
improving binding protein so these are
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.679
improving binding protein so these are
protists that's attached to something

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689
protists that's attached to something
 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.399

and conduct Spira logical processes by

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
and conduct Spira logical processes by
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.160

this means for example antibodies and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
this means for example antibodies and
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.630
this means for example antibodies and
this technique can then be used to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640
this technique can then be used to
 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.630
this technique can then be used to
produce human antibodies against

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640
produce human antibodies against
 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.670
produce human antibodies against
pathogens or other substances and to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680
pathogens or other substances and to
 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.290
pathogens or other substances and to
come back to the main methodist in both

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300
come back to the main methodist in both
 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.170
come back to the main methodist in both
prices so to say use you were talking

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180
prices so to say use you were talking
 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.560
prices so to say use you were talking
about evolution and when we think about

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570
about evolution and when we think about
 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.999
about evolution and when we think about
natural evolution you think it's often

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009
natural evolution you think it's often
 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.950
natural evolution you think it's often
described there's a combination of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960
described there's a combination of
 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.040
described there's a combination of
chance and necessity is this what they

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050
chance and necessity is this what they
 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.130
chance and necessity is this what they
do yes this is I would say a combination

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140
do yes this is I would say a combination
 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.460
do yes this is I would say a combination
of chance and necessity but also quite a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470
of chance and necessity but also quite a
 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.889
of chance and necessity but also quite a
big element of thinking because what

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899
big element of thinking because what
 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.499
big element of thinking because what
they have done is to really speed up the

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509
they have done is to really speed up the
 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.410
they have done is to really speed up the
evolution this nature has had billions

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420
evolution this nature has had billions
 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.470
evolution this nature has had billions
of years but now you want the process to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480
of years but now you want the process to
 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.990
of years but now you want the process to
be possible in maybe a few weeks or a

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000
be possible in maybe a few weeks or a
 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.630
be possible in maybe a few weeks or a
year or something in the laboratory so

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640
year or something in the laboratory so
 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.140
year or something in the laboratory so
it was like random experiments and then

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150
it was like random experiments and then
 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.620
it was like random experiments and then
picking up the right parts of it yes I

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630
picking up the right parts of it yes I
 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.300
picking up the right parts of it yes I
would say in nature is what a random

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310
would say in nature is what a random
 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.490
would say in nature is what a random
process because the mutations happen by

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500
process because the mutations happen by
 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.920
process because the mutations happen by
chance maybe due to UV radiation or

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930
chance maybe due to UV radiation or
 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.650
chance maybe due to UV radiation or
something whereas in the laboratory it

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660
something whereas in the laboratory it
 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.630
something whereas in the laboratory it
was a combination of knowledge based so

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640
was a combination of knowledge based so
 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.400
was a combination of knowledge based so
you have to you have to have some idea

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410
you have to you have to have some idea
 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.400
you have to you have to have some idea
of which positions to bury but then you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410
of which positions to bury but then you
 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.750
of which positions to bury but then you
add a random less on top of that so the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760
add a random less on top of that so the
 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.330
add a random less on top of that so the
biggest difference would be that you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340
biggest difference would be that you
 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.890
biggest difference would be that you
know what goal you have while in nature

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900
know what goal you have while in nature
 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.220
know what goal you have while in nature
actually the risk may be no I would say

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230
actually the risk may be no I would say
 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.410
actually the risk may be no I would say
nature has no goal but what works works

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420
nature has no goal but what works works
 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.970
nature has no goal but what works works
and everything that makes things better

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980
and everything that makes things better
 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.640
and everything that makes things better
or that you can populate a new dish is

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650
or that you can populate a new dish is
 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.890
or that you can populate a new dish is
then kept whereas in the directed

why couldn't she designed them from the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170
why couldn't she designed them from the
 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.830
why couldn't she designed them from the
beginning it's very good question and

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840
beginning it's very good question and

hard to understand what it is but it's a
method to produce antibodies yes so the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810
method to produce antibodies yes so the
 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.870
method to produce antibodies yes so the
