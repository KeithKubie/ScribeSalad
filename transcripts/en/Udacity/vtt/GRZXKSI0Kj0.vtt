00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.070
The goal of the Arden Syntax

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.559
is to provide a standard approach to
describing medical logic so that it can

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:12.360
be shared across EMRs to support
Clinical Decision Support or CDS.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.880
CDS is the idea that computers
can suggest optimal therapy

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.570
based on a patient's electronic record.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.020
Or spot potential mistakes
before they happen.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.590
To do either, they not only
need the electronic record,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.000
they need to understand at least
a limited domain of medicine.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.400
That's where Arden comes in.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.070
Arden consists of medical logic modules,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.150
or MLMs,
each supports one clinical decision.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.920
Here's a group of five MLMs used to
provide clinical decision support for

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.950
the use of Warfarin, a common but
potentially dangerous blood thinner

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.920
often given to patients with strokes or
other potential blood clotting problems.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.750
Too little of the drug
may mean another stroke.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.140
Too much can cause excessive,
or even fatal, bleeding.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.840
Warfarin levels can be effected by many
other drugs and even the patient's diet.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.060
So it's a very tricky drug to manage.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.139
A clinical test called PT/INR is used
to assess the degree of blood thinning.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.180
You can see here that the modules,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.450
once they are fed clinical data about
the patient, such as their PT/INR,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.010
can make Warfarin dosage
recommendations to the physician.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.920
I refer you to the text for
the internal details of the Ardent MLMs.
