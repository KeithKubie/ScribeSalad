Adriene: Welcome to Crash Course Economics
I’m Adriene Hill

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:06.769
Jacob: and I’m Jacob Clifford. Today we
are going to talk about the Economics of Healthcare.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.220
Healthcare is different than some of the other
markets we’ve talked about.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.120
Adriene: If you’re having a heart attack,
you’re not going to shop around for the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.520
hospital with the best prices. And a hospital
emergency room isn’t going to wait for your

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.340
credit card to go through before they treat
you. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.490
Let’s get started.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:30.570
[Theme Music]

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.550
For a lot of reasons, Health care is different
than the other markets we’ve talked about.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.409
First, you never know when you’re going
to need it. It’s kind of hard to plan to

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:42.049
fall off your bike and break your arm. And
after you break your arm, that visit to the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:44.320
emergency room is going to be expensive.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.049
That’s why we have health insurance, whether
it’s private or public. Private insurers

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:54.729
periodically collect money, in the form of
premiums, paid by individuals or their employers.

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.480
Public insurance programs collect money from
taxpayers.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.660
You’ll hear some countries have free
healthcare, but it’s not “free.”

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.920
They’re paying for it: either directly,
through insurers, or through taxes.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.030
Let’s work out all the details in the Thought
Bubble.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.070
Jacob: So, Canada has a public insurance system where the government funds healthcare for everyone through taxation.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.110
Doctor’s offices tend to be private businesses
that get paid directly by the government.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.960
But, hospitals and operating tables
are public property.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.260
And the hospital staff are public
employees, sort of like public schools.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.940
This is often called a single payer system
since the government is doing most of the paying.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.980
Canadians have to pay for prescription
drugs, eyeglasses and dental care themselves

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.030
or get them through supplemental private insurance.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.700
Now, France technically doesn’t have a single
payer system because health care providers

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.260
are paid by several non-profit insurance funds.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.360
All citizens are required to get health insurance
and they’re free to choose their doctor.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.200
Unlike Canada, most French providers,
including hospitals, are private businesses.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.780
The UK is different still. It has a socialized
healthcare system which is funded and controlled

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.240
by the government through taxes. The majority
of doctors, specialists, and hospitals are

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.810
all paid by the government, not insurance
companies.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.360
Today, the US has little of everything! Almost
all providers – hospitals, clinics, doctor’s

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.630
practices – are private firms. Most households
with adults under 65 are covered by private

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.509
insurance, either through their employer or
through individual policies.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.349
But the US has single payer system for those
over 65 and those below the poverty line.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.220
Medicare is a taxpayer-funded public insurer
that pays providers to care for seniors and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.980
Medicaid is a similar program for low-income
households.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.260
Oh, and the US also has a small UK-style system with government-run hospitals and government-employee doctors.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.280
But it’s only for veterans and
it’s called the VA.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.460
Adriene: Thanks Thought Bubble. So let’s
get down to some numbers.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.590
Economists evaluate the effectiveness of a healthcare system on three criteria: Access, Cost, and Quality.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:51.320
According to the Census Bureau in 2014 10.4% of Americans didn’t have health insurance coverage, down from 13.3% in 2013.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.260
Two thirds of Americans had health insurance
through a private Insurer. The vast majority

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.970
got coverage through their employer and
the rest bought individual plans.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.440
About a third of Americans had health insurance
through a taxpayer-funded government insurance plan

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.740
like Medicare, Medicaid, the VA , and healthcare
for active-duty military and their families.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.720
So, two thirds, plus a third, plus 10% uninsured
adds up to more than 100%. That’s because

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.500
somebody who switches from private Insurance
to public Insurance gets counted in BOTH numbers.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.980
That’s just the way the Census
does it.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.120
Let’s talk a little about the uninsured.
Compared with the general population, people

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.660
without insurance tend to be somewhat younger,
earn less, and be more racially diverse.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:40.300
Because Medicaid covers people below or near the poverty line, the uninsured are usually not completely destitute.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.180
They often work a part-time or low-wage job,
which puts them above the Medicaid threshold,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.660
but their employers may not offer insurance
to part-time workers. If an uninsured person

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.720
gets sick or gets hit by a bus, they can easily
get stuck with six figures in medical bills.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.240
And those unpaid medical expenses drive up
costs for everybody.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.380
Jacob: This brings us to the cost of healthcare.
Good news Americans – We’re Number One!!

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.780
Well, actually, it’s not that great. In 2012, the U.S. spent an average of $8,745 per person on healthcare.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.599
Other rich countries like Switzerland and
Norway spent a little over $6,000, and countries

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.220
like Germany, France, the UK, and Japan spent
in the $3-5,000 range.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.800
So the U.S. is spending twice as much, per
person, as most other developed countries.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.490
Put another way, the US spends the same share
of GDP just on Medicare - as most countries

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.580
spend to cover their entire populations.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.330
So why does the US spend so much more than
other countries? Well, some argue that it's

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.740
due to high quantity of care per person. Since
insurance companies, rather than patients

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.219
pay providers, patients might want more care,
like tests, procedures and treatments than necessary.

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.960
It’s like an all-you-can-treat buffet. You
know you shouldn’t go back for that fourth

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.129
General Tso’s X-Ray, but it’s just so
delicious!

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.580
The RAND Health Insurance experiment a few
decades ago found that requiring patients

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.689
to pay for a portion of their health care
cost deters them from overconsuming of healthcare.

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:02.180
That’s one reason that in the US, many insurance
plans have deductibles, a form of costs sharing

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.920
where the the patient is required to pay a
part of the cost before the insurance kicks in.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.809
Many economists say prices are also a problem.
In most other countries, insurers pay between

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:16.819
$200 and $400 for an MRI. In the US, the price
is around $1500. And it’s not like the US

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.800
MRIs are somehow “better.” They’re exactly
the same machines.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.460
And you can go down the list of treatments
and procedures – in nearly every case, US

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.639
providers are being paid 3, 4, or 5 TIMES
more.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.689
This is because the US doesn’t have a unified
system that can aggressively negotiate with

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.759
doctors, pharmaceutical companies, and other
providers. They point out that Medicare and

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.639
Medicaid often get a significant discount
compared to small insurers.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.779
Another reason for the high costs is the blizzard
of paperwork generated by the interaction

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:46.879
between dozens of insurers and thousands of
providers. Both the insurer and the provider

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:51.240
have to employ a team of unhappy people in
cubicles to haggle over the reimbursement

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.330
rate for an appendectomy. These teams add
to the administrative costs of healthcare.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.370
Adriene: So which problem is driving healthcare
costs? Quantity? Price? Administrative costs?

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.040
When you dig into the numbers, the US consumes a pretty high quantity of tests and treatments per person.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.540
But it’s not radically higher than most other countries, and several countries, like Germany, do even more.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.900
Likewise, the US administrative costs are
also higher, since a lot countries drastically

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:21.839
reduce their billing paperwork with a universal
insurer. But that cost explains only about

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:27.959
10-20% of the cost difference. Most of the
difference comes from the fact that US providers

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.779
are paid much higher prices than their counterparts
in other countries.

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:36.099
Okay, let’s talk quickly about quality.
There are a lot of ways to measure the quality

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.659
of a country’s healthcare system. Let’s
look at a few different metrics.

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:44.309
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation,
The US has higher rates of hospital admissions

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:49.999
for preventable conditions, and it has high
rates of medical, medication and lab errors.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.220
The US DOES stack up pretty well in terms of diagnosing and successfully treating conditions like heart disease and some types of cancer.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.879
But remember, spending per capita is much
higher in the US than the rest of world.

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:06.509
Reforming the health care system is difficult,
thanks to something called the Iron Triangle.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.569
The Iron Triangle is a section of the Western
Atlantic ocean where ships and planes are

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:13.759
frequently spirited away by extra terrestrials.

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:17.219
Sorry, I’m terrible at triangles.
That’s the Bermuda Triangle.

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:22.299
The Iron Triangle refers to the mutually beneficial
relationship between members of Congress,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.840
government bureaucrats, and lobbyists.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.599
Bureaucrats want to protect their funding
and jobs, Congressmen want to get re-elected,

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:32.979
and lobbyists want to advance the interests
of their clients. And they all end up working

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:39.099
toward policies that maintain the status quo, and aren’t necessarily in the best interest of the people.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.399
But they’re not worthless. The Iron Triangle
got it together in 2010, and the US Government

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:47.029
passed the Affordable Care Act. Sometimes
called ObamaCare.

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:52.119
This stab at reforming the American healthcare
system has been controversial, to say the least.

00:07:52.119 --> 00:07:55.539
Let’s take a look at what the law does and
doesn’t do.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:01.080
ObamaCare did not set up a UK-style system
where hospitals are public property and doctors

00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:05.929
are public employees. It also didn’t establish
a Universal Public Insurance system,

00:08:05.929 --> 00:08:08.479
like expanding Medicare to everyone.

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:13.069
Instead, the Affordable Care Act tries to
increase health coverage by requiring private

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:18.050
health insurers to insure everyone who applies,
charge the same premiums to people of the

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.419
same age, and cover pre-existing conditions.

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:25.679
To prevent otherwise healthy people from only
buying health insurance when they get sick,

00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:31.689
it requires that everyone obtain health insurance
or pay a fee. The law also subsidizes health

00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:34.450
insurance premiums for those who can’t afford
to pay market rates.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.700
So that’s what ObamaCare is supposed to
do… is it working? Well, it has reduced

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.820
the number of Americans without insurance.
So access seems to have improved.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.960
The Affordable Care Act also has
provisions meant to deal with costs.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.440
And that’s a little more difficult to assess.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.860
The act rewards doctors for cutting costs,
and requires greater price transparency.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.000
It also mandates a move to electronic record-keeping.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.360
As far as improving quality goes, It’s probably
to early to tell.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.840
Jacob: In the end, the economic debate over
healthcare is a lot like the debate over other

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.530
topics we’ve covered in Crash Course Economics,
like price controls, climate change, inequality,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:12.720
and education. The recurring question is:
when, if ever, should the government get involved

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.580
to help markets achieve the most effective,
efficient, and fair outcome.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.710
Obamacare reflects the peoples' attitude towards
government and capitalism: Americans don’t

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.820
fully trust either one of them. Healthcare
reforms have left private insurers and providers

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.380
in place, but at the same time has increased
regulation. Insurers are now required to do

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.600
things they wouldn’t normally do, like cover
people with pre-existing conditions.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.620
Adriene: So, that’s the American healthcare system, which is weird and expensive, and necessary.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.860
That’s also the end of our textbook economics
episodes.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.960
Jacob: And so I’m moving to Canada to write a textbook and enjoy some of that sweet, sweet, subsidized health care.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.630
Adriene: And I’m going to stick around and
talk about the economics of things like immigration

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.780
and social security and happiness.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.260
