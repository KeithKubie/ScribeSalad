00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630
close to a black hole which is an
 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.420
close to a black hole which is an
extreme prediction of general relativity

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430
extreme prediction of general relativity
 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.949
extreme prediction of general relativity
but it doesn't matter

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959
but it doesn't matter
 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.949
but it doesn't matter
the theory was developed it's beautiful

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959
the theory was developed it's beautiful
 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.390
the theory was developed it's beautiful
it excites kids

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400
it excites kids
 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.620
it excites kids
and it even has practical applications

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630
and it even has practical applications
 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.960
and it even has practical applications
so with much of astronomy we don't know

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970
so with much of astronomy we don't know
 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.150
so with much of astronomy we don't know
what the spin-offs will be but we do

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160
what the spin-offs will be but we do
 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.400
what the spin-offs will be but we do
know that as humans we can accomplish

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410
know that as humans we can accomplish
 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.879
know that as humans we can accomplish
these goals and can also excite kids

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889
these goals and can also excite kids
 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.950
these goals and can also excite kids
into pursuing areas of science and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960
into pursuing areas of science and
 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.200
into pursuing areas of science and
technology and that in my opinion is

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210
technology and that in my opinion is
 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.760
technology and that in my opinion is
really good

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770
really good
 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:53.290
really good
