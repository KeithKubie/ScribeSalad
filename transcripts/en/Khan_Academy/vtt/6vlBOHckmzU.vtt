00:00:00.292 --> 00:00:02.046
Voiceover:Ahmed is playing a lottery game

00:00:02.046 --> 00:00:04.204
where he must pick two
numbers from zero to nine

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:07.428
and then one letter out of the
26 letter English alphabet.

00:00:07.428 --> 00:00:09.964
He may choose the same number both times.

00:00:09.964 --> 00:00:12.592
If his ticket matches the two numbers

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:14.265
and one letter drawn in order,

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:19.879
he wins the grand prize
and receives $10,405.

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:24.127
If just his letter matches but one or both

00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:25.563
of his numbers do not match,

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:28.941
he wins the small price of $100.

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:32.973
Under any other outcome, he
loses and receives nothing.

00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:36.975
The game costs him $5 to play.

00:00:36.975 --> 00:00:40.096
Under any other outcome he
loses and receives nothing.

00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:43.758
He has chosen the ticket 04R.

00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:46.428
Assuming he's paying the $5 to play

00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:48.952
and he picks the ticket 04R.

00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:53.121
Let's say we define a random variable X

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:55.379
and let's say that this random variable

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.144
is the net profit from
playing this lottery game.

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:08.156
What is the expected from ...

00:01:08.156 --> 00:01:09.834
I guess we could even say the expected

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:14.941
from the net profit from playing 04R,

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.333
so Ahmed's particular
ticket right over here.

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.808
Let's just say X is the random variable,

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:22.400
is the net profit from
playing this ticket.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.694
What I want to think about in this video

00:01:24.694 --> 00:01:29.525
is what is the expected value of that?

00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:33.527
What is the expected net
profit from playing 04R?

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:35.362
I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:37.037
and think through it on your own.

00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:40.009
Let's think about what expected value is.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.824
It's the probability of
each of those outcomes

00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:45.531
times the net profit from those outcomes.

00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:48.647
There's the probability
of the grand prize.

00:01:48.647 --> 00:01:51.138
I can write that, let me
do that in that red color.

00:01:51.138 --> 00:01:56.060
There is the probability
of getting the grand prize

00:01:56.998 --> 00:02:00.576
and what would times his net
payoff from the grand prize.

00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:01.512
What would that be?

00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:06.560
Well he gets $10,405 but
that's not his net payoff

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.908
or his net profit I should say.

00:02:08.908 --> 00:02:12.391
His net profit is what he gets
minus what he paid to play.

00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:15.944
He paid $5 to play.

00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:22.307
That's that, plus the probability

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:28.655
of getting the small
price times the pay off

00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:32.660
of the small price which
is going to be $100

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.170
or times the net profit I guess
if you get the small price.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.737
You get a payoff of a 100

00:02:36.737 --> 00:02:41.156
minus you have to pay $5 to play

00:02:41.156 --> 00:02:47.354
and then finally you have
the probability of neither.

00:02:47.354 --> 00:02:49.713
You're essentially not winning

00:02:49.713 --> 00:02:54.921
and in that situation,
what is the net profit?

00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:57.471
Well in that situation your
net profit is negative five.

00:02:57.471 --> 00:03:00.033
You paid $5 and you got nothing in return.

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:01.626
To figure out the expected value,

00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:03.372
you just have to figure
out these probabilities.

00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:05.800
What's the probability of the grand prize?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.039
I'll do that over here,
probability of grand prize.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.573
Well the probability that he
gets the first letter right

00:03:12.573 --> 00:03:15.845
is one in 10, there's 10 digits there.

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:18.405
Probability he gets
the second letter right

00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:20.403
is one in 10, these are all independent

00:03:20.403 --> 00:03:22.086
and probability he gets the letter right,

00:03:22.086 --> 00:03:23.670
there's 26 equally likely letters

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.118
that might be in the actual one

00:03:25.118 --> 00:03:27.848
so he has a one in 26
chance of that one as well.

00:03:27.848 --> 00:03:35.133
The probability of the
grand prize is one in 2600.

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:38.110
This is one in 2600.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:49.228
Now what's the probability
of getting the small price?

00:03:49.228 --> 00:03:53.500
Well let's see, he has a one in 26 chance.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.375
The small prize is
getting the letter right

00:03:57.375 --> 00:04:00.391
but not getting both of the numbers right.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.136
He has a one in 26 chance
of getting the letter right

00:04:05.136 --> 00:04:08.567
but we're not done here
just with the one in 26

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:10.428
because this one in 26,

00:04:10.428 --> 00:04:12.363
this includes all the scenarios

00:04:12.363 --> 00:04:13.939
where he gets the letter right,

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.511
including the scenarios where
he wins the grand prize,

00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:19.235
where he gets the letter and
he gets the two numbers right.

00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:22.288
We need to do is we need to
subtract out the situation,

00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:24.788
the probability of
getting the two numbers,

00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:27.931
getting the letter and
the two numbers right

00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:29.487
and we already know what that is,

00:04:29.487 --> 00:04:31.170
it's one in 2600.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.343
It's one and 26 minus one and 2600.

00:04:35.343 --> 00:04:37.850
The reason why I have to
subtract out at this 2600

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.445
is he has one in 26 chance
of getting this letter right.

00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:48.988
That includes the scenario
where he gets everything right

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:52.217
but the small prize is only
where you get the letter

00:04:52.217 --> 00:04:54.710
and one or none of these.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.842
If you get both of these

00:04:55.842 --> 00:04:57.577
then you're at the grand prize case.

00:04:57.577 --> 00:04:59.745
You essentially have to
subtract out the probability

00:04:59.745 --> 00:05:01.375
that you won the grand prize,

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:02.866
if you got all three of them

00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:05.240
to figure out the probability
of the small prize.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.003
Now what's the probability
of essentially losing?

00:05:09.003 --> 00:05:14.107
The probability of neither.

00:05:14.107 --> 00:05:17.777
Well it's just kind of
that's everything else.

00:05:17.777 --> 00:05:21.097
It would be one minus these probabilities

00:05:21.097 --> 00:05:22.269
right over here.

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:24.779
It would be one minus the probability

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:25.977
of the small prize.

00:05:25.977 --> 00:05:28.397
The probability of the small

00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:32.428
minus the probability of the grand,

00:05:32.428 --> 00:05:33.835
these are the possible outcomes

00:05:33.835 --> 00:05:36.335
so they have to add up to one or a 100%.

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:38.971
This is one less probability small

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:45.872
minus probability of large

00:05:45.872 --> 00:05:50.644
or I'll say grand prize.

00:05:50.644 --> 00:05:51.591
Let's fill this in.

00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:54.345
The probability of the small
one, this right over ...

00:05:54.345 --> 00:05:56.010
I'm using that red too much.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.553
This right over here is one in 26

00:05:59.553 --> 00:06:04.248
minus one in 2600

00:06:04.248 --> 00:06:09.905
and then this right over
here is one minus the small

00:06:09.905 --> 00:06:14.833
which is one in 26 minus one in 2600

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:21.616
minus one in 2600.

00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:23.948
This simplifies to let's see,

00:06:23.948 --> 00:06:26.377
this is one minus one over 26

00:06:26.377 --> 00:06:32.928
plus one in 2600 plus
or minus one in 2600.

00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:38.755
These cancel and you're left
with one minus one in 26.

00:06:38.755 --> 00:06:41.028
Why does this make sense?

00:06:41.028 --> 00:06:45.349
The way you get nothing is
if you get the letter wrong.

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:49.479
You have a one in 26 chance
of getting the letter right

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.359
and then you're going to be
in one of these two categories

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:53.762
or you have a one minus one 26

00:06:53.762 --> 00:06:56.493
which is equal to 25 of 26.

00:06:56.493 --> 00:07:00.614
You have a 25 26 chance of
getting the letter wrong

00:07:00.614 --> 00:07:02.018
in which case you get nothing,

00:07:02.018 --> 00:07:04.537
in which case you completely lose.

00:07:04.537 --> 00:07:07.480
Let's just get our calculator
out and calculate this

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.593
and we'll round to the nearest penny here.

00:07:11.593 --> 00:07:17.958
Let's see, it is going to be one 2600.

00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:24.370
One divided by 2600 times let's see,

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.684
10,405 minus five is going to be 10,400,

00:07:27.684 --> 00:07:30.977
times 10,400, that's your net profit

00:07:30.977 --> 00:07:33.076
when you win the grand prize

00:07:33.076 --> 00:07:40.004
and then you're going to
have plus one divided by 26

00:07:40.004 --> 00:07:46.059
minus one divided by 2600

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.943
times your net profit for the small price

00:07:51.943 --> 00:07:53.806
is a 100 minus five which is 95,

00:07:53.806 --> 00:08:00.285
and then finally plus 25 26.

00:08:00.285 --> 00:08:06.180
25 divided by 26, actually I'll
put parenthesis around here

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.564
just to make it consistent.

00:08:07.564 --> 00:08:13.197
25 divided by 26 times that net payoff.

00:08:13.197 --> 00:08:15.599
When you got nothing, well
you have to pay out $5

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:18.525
and you got nothing in
return, times negative five.

00:08:18.525 --> 00:08:21.241
Actually I don't know if
it's going to recognize that

00:08:21.241 --> 00:08:25.732
as times so I'll just
write times negative five

00:08:25.732 --> 00:08:29.493
and let me delete that and
we deserve a drum roll now.

00:08:29.493 --> 00:08:34.264
We get a expected net profit of playing as

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:41.163
$2.81 if we round up to the nearest penny.

00:08:41.163 --> 00:08:46.481
This is all going to be equal to $2.81.

00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:51.540
This is actually a very
unusual lottery game

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.866
where you have a positive
expected net profit as a player.

00:08:55.866 --> 00:08:57.973
Usually the purpose on
operating the lottery,

00:08:57.973 --> 00:09:00.214
the state, or the casino, whoever it is,

00:09:00.214 --> 00:09:02.437
they're the ones who have
the expected net profit

00:09:02.437 --> 00:09:04.415
and then the player has
the expected net loss

00:09:04.415 --> 00:09:07.024
but this actually would
make rational sense to play

00:09:07.024 --> 00:09:10.651
which is not the case
with most lottery games

00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:16.508
and if by playing you actually
expect a $2.81 net profit.
