00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.560
We've almost come to the end of another lesson, and

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.460
I want to give you a chance to assess your own

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.770
knowledge of non-coding regions of our genome. Now, based on

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.870
what you've learned, see if you can figure out this following

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.600
scenario. A baby is born that shows severe signs of

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.010
lactose intolerance when fed breast milk. Now to determine the cause,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.390
the hospital is interested in the sequence of the lactase

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.600
coding region, the promoter region and the enhancer region, specifically at

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.500
the minus 13,910 base pairs or letters in front of

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.720
transcription start site. They're able to determine that there are

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.010
no mutations in the coding region of the gene. So

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.910
what I want you to figure out, is select whether you

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.485
think a gene mutation is more likely in the promoter

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:46.020
or the enhancer region. Then I want you to justify

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.080
your answer here in this text box. Tell me why,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.810
and do this in your own words. Make it a little

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.390
short answer essay. Include any word you need to answer the question. Use words

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.730
like transcription, allele, consensus, transcription factor, whatever

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.680
you think you need to answer the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.510
question of why, when you justify your answer. And keep this answer in a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.580
safe place, because we're going to use it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.280
in the next video screen to evaluate ourselves.
