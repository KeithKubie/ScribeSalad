My name is Jie Qi. I'm a Berkman Fellow
this year and I'm also the co-founder

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.330
and creative director of Chibitronics,
which is an educational hardware company.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.190
I'm really excited about exploring open
innovation, specifically around patents,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.260
and how we can hack the patent system to
support sharing of inventions, rather

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.519
than closing it off. The reason I
care deeply about this is because as a

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.840
maker, and an entrepreneur, and kind of an
individual that's not a giant company,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm interested in exploring alternative
ways to create and make an impact with

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.500
my inventions. For example, one of
the inventions that I created as part of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.690
my PhD research is this idea of using
stickers that are also electronics and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.719
the idea is we took flexible printed
circuit boards which we find in our cell

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.649
phones or laptops or whatever, and we
added conductive glue to the bottom of

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.550
them, such that when you take the sticker,
which is a circuit board, and stick it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.910
down to like a conductive ink or
conductive tape, you actually build

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.149
circuits, but it feels like you're
playing with stickers and tape and pens,

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.060
and that is kind of a creative, crafty
way to learn electronics. Technology is

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.570
very powerful right, it's a tool which
means it can do wonderful things, it

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.540
can do scary things. It itself is not bad.
However, with the many forces that

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.810
are at play in the world I can see
people or institutions with means

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.710
getting control of these technologies
and using them in a negative way that

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.220
perhaps the original inventors didn't
imagine or perhaps none of us have ever

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.720
imagined. What I'm excited about,
as someone who creates technology and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.650
teaches people electronics and
programming, is that it is extremely

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.640
powerful and it allows you to take the
things that are in your imagination and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.079
make them real. As an educator, when I see
people learn something new and create

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.200
something that they might not have
imagined they could, it's extremely

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.520
empowering and for me technology is a
way to make you see that the impossible

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.470
is possible and you can make with it.
