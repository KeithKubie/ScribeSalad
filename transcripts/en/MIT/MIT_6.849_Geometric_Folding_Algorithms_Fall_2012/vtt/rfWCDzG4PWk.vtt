00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.770
PROFESSOR: All right!

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.170
Welcome back to 6849.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.900
Today, we're going to
move into linkage folding.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.890
And before we get there, I
want to talk about an issue

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.650
that sort of motivates
linkage folding.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.590
And it's about the
definition of folding.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.515
So we've talked
about origami a lot,

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:29.140
and we've talked
about crease patterns,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.098
and we've talked about
the folded state-- which

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:35.130
is the finished product
after you fold something.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.280
But there's another thing
we might care about.

00:00:54.227 --> 00:00:56.060
So whenever we wanted
to prove that we could

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.150
fold a piece of paper
in a particular way,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.360
we described a folded state.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.140
We said what does the
paper look like in 3D,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.510
how are the layers stacked,
all these kinds of issues.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.630
But when you fold a
real piece of paper,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.640
you start from a
flat thing, and you

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.270
want to continuously deform
it into some 3D shape.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.480
And that is another
kind of folding,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.740
which we call a folding
motion, which we haven't really

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.040
worried about up until now.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.060
And it's going to be the central
concept in linkage folding.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.470
The way to define
a folding motion

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.740
is just a continuum
of folded states.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.180
It's a movie.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.080
You start somewhere, usually
we start from the flat folded

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.035
state, and then at all times
we specify a new folded state,

00:01:47.035 --> 00:01:48.920
a new way to fold
a piece of paper.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.130
As long as that's a
continuous process,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.600
then that is a folding motion.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.285
So we've done all
this work proving

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:58.010
that folded states exist.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.080
The question is, what if
I want a folding motion?

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.920
Because really, in
order to fold the paper,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.770
I've got to get there.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.330
And that's we're
going to worry about

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.413
for the first few minutes.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.790
The good news is the reason we
haven't worried about this up

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.620
'till now is there's an
equivalence between the two

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.560
for paper folding.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.290
So if you have-- it's called
a simple polygonal piece

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:44.680
of paper, and that
just means your piece

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.125
of paper some polygon,
but it has no holes in it.

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:51.690
It's sort of solid,
there's nothing like this.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:12.070
Then, it has a folding motion
into any desired folded state.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.290
So you say, I don't know.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.790
I have this folded state
where all the lines of a swan

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.170
are aligned in that
second fold and cut.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.580
How do I actually fold
into that folded state?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.250
It's possible.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.630
Any folded state
we describe, you

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.410
can reach by a folding motion.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.350
So we're going to prove this.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.560
When you look at it the right
way it's almost trivial,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.700
but maybe a little confusing.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.414
So I'll describe the proof to
see what you think about it.

00:03:51.414 --> 00:03:53.830
I'm going to start with the
case of one dimensional paper,

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.740
because it's always
easier to think about.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.880
The idea is the following.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.030
You have a piece of paper, and
you have some folded state.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.890
I'm going to draw
a little letter

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.770
m, what you want
to fold it into.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.540
They should have
the same length.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.000
We're given this map, we're
told how the piece of paper

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.589
folds-- in this case
into two dimensions--

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.130
and if there were
any touching layers

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.329
here it would be described
which is on the top of which.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.380
We're told how to
instantaneously go

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.350
from here to here.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.900
What we're not told is
the steps in between,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.210
and that's what we're
going to fill in over here.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.870
So the idea is rolling creases.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.240
I have my piece of
paper here, and I'm just

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.110
going to curl in the
end a little bit.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.610
So I'm going to fold
this thing into--

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.020
or I just roll up the end,
I can do this continuously.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.740
It's sort of like the
real piece of paper.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.850
If you start folding
and then pull,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.730
I continuously roll that crease.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.560
At all times, in fact, this
is supposed to stay flat.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.540
It's really hard to
get started in reality,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.290
but in theory, you
can get started

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.450
with an infinitesimal
part of the crease.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.430
You just roll it in.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.630
So you make the piece
of paper smaller.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.540
It will be-- geometrically
these are on top of each other,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.210
so it'll be tiny.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.330
So it'll actually be a subset
of the original piece of paper.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.760
You keep doing this,
you end up, let's say,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.064
with a rolled up piece
of paper like that.

00:05:29.064 --> 00:05:29.980
A little hard to draw.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.580
Really, it lies along
the line segment,

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.600
and you're just going around
and around in a line segment.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.210
But it's like a cinnamon bun.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.490
Why do we bother?

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:50.394
Well, if we look at a tiny
piece of this folding--

00:05:50.394 --> 00:05:52.560
so in fact I should have
done this at the beginning,

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.690
let me do that now--
away from the creases.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.130
If I look at a tiny portion,
it's nice and smooth.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.080
I'm not at a crease.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.100
I'm going to highlight which
portion of the paper here ends

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.200
up-- this piece of paper's
roughly in quarters.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.620
This is like the third quarter--
that ends up over here.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.650
What I'd really like to
do is roll up everything

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.370
to lie on top of that,
so I do some rolling.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:27.750
Maybe this is the-- and
I'm going to roll this up.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.130
So I end up with
the thick segment,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.179
and then some stuff
rolled on top of it.

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:38.470
I don't really care too much
what it looks like, I just

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.386
need that there's a
continuous rolling process

00:06:40.386 --> 00:06:43.780
to get everything to lie
on top of that segment.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.930
Now what I do going down--
this is all in one dimension.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.830
All of this lies
in one dimension.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.340
Now we're going to go
into the second dimension.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.790
Exciting.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:01.310
So we imagine that there's this
M, the folded shape that we

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.650
want to build.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.010
And we're going to place it
where the thick part belongs,

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.070
where that highlighted
part belongs.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.680
So it belongs
here, and of course

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.320
everything comes
along for the ride.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.900
So you've got a little roll
here and a bigger roll here.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.949
Something like that.

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:22.490
Just taking that-- or I guess
they were all on the same side,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.820
I'm not drawing
very consistently.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.260
OK, but it's all lying along
this segment of the M. Now

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.520
I just need to unroll.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.870
This is where for
the mathematicians

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.100
this will become obvious
in a little while.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.390
Maybe, I don't know.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.490
It's kind of a common trick.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.320
So we have this motion
that got us here.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.220
We can obviously play
that motion backwards.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:50.010
It's symmetric, I could unroll
just as easily as I rolled.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.660
But now what I want to do is
not unroll in one dimension--

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.700
if I did that, I'd end
up lying along the line

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.806
segment extending this old part.

00:07:57.806 --> 00:07:59.430
Actually, it's not
even quite straight,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.970
but let's pretend
it's kind of straight.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:09.290
But now I want to unroll along
the M. So unrolling here,

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.880
the first thing I would
unroll is this stuff.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.150
It's going to go along the
long direction, the left side.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.470
So it's going to unroll
along, and but instead

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.720
of going straight, I want
it to just move along

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.330
the M. It's like
I'm an ant, and I

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.090
don't realize that I live in
this two dimensional space.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.930
I'm going to pretend that I live
on this one dimensional space,

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.679
even though it's not
physically there yet.

00:08:30.679 --> 00:08:32.470
That's why I drew it dashed.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.720
I just unroll.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.320
So I'll end up by the
end-- at this point

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.620
I will have this half
of the M, the bold part,

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.900
and then this half of the
M hasn't been made yet.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.955
And I'll have a little roll
that's enough to make that.

00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:55.740
I unroll more, and I
end up going there.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.165
So it's kind of crazy.

00:08:57.165 --> 00:08:58.790
Just roll up the
piece of paper so it's

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.160
super tiny so you can put
it on the folded state

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.750
without having any creases,
then undo everything

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:09.810
you did, but living on the
surface instead of in the line.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.420
So you may or may not believe
that works, but it works.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.940
It's kind of cool.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.270
You can generalize that
to two dimensional paper.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.360
It's a little harder
to draw the diagram,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.620
so I bring the textbook.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.440
Here we have a polygon
of paper, but same idea.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.720
We're going to roll
up that piece of paper

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.320
until it's super
tiny-- in this case,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.550
super tiny is a little triangle.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.660
We identify--
actually, ahead of time

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.200
we identify a portion, a little
triangle on the surface here,

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.770
that does not hit any creases.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.630
Here it is.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.324
And so we roll up the paper to
be contained in that triangle.

00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:47.990
Of course, there's
many layers above it,

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.740
which you can't-- it's
hard to draw here.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.710
You just curl that
triangle a little bit.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.981
Now it lives on the crane.

00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:56.480
Here, we're supposing
we want to get

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.854
a continuous motion
of the crane.

00:09:57.854 --> 00:10:00.230
It's multiple layers,
all sorts of fun things.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.550
And then you just
keep on rolling,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.140
just like you did in the
top thing but backwards.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.840
And instead of
living in the plane,

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.630
you now live on
the crane surface.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.657
And the mapping between
them is given to you.

00:10:12.657 --> 00:10:14.490
You're given the folded
state that tells you

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.610
how the piece of paper
lives on the crane,

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.510
and so you just undo
everything on the crane,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.140
instead of in the plane.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.170
On the crane instead
of in the plane--

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.220
should be a Doctor Seuss.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.050
Yeah, question.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.340
How do I pick the region?

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.860
I just-- in general, we
have some crease pattern.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.854
I just take some region
interior to one face

00:10:36.854 --> 00:10:37.770
of the crease pattern.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.170
So just avoiding
creases is all I want.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.920
Yeah.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.270
The level of detail in
describing any region will do.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.610
In reality, we want
it small, so that's

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.450
almost flat by smoothness.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.010
But that's sort of
a technical detail.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.614
Other questions?

00:10:54.614 --> 00:10:56.280
How many people does
this make sense to?

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.880
Just curious.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.540
Yeah, almost everyone
kind of makes sense.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.469
Good.

00:11:02.469 --> 00:11:03.760
You have to see it a few times.

00:11:07.192 --> 00:11:11.450
I remember giving a talk
of this paper in 2001,

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.592
and I sort of understood it, but
it was a very interactive talk.

00:11:15.592 --> 00:11:16.800
People kept asking questions.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.980
I think by the end
everyone understood it.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.714
Now I understand it.

00:11:20.714 --> 00:11:21.380
It's good stuff.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.760
There's some important
open questions, though.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.510
This crucially relies on--
this maybe not so-- well, yeah.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.800
If you had a hole in your piece
of paper, this would not work.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.200
Because you can't reduce--
you can't get rid of the hole

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.870
by folding.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.630
And you can do all sorts
of rolling, folding corners

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.240
over, and making
this thing smaller,

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.770
but you'll never be able
to get rid of that hole.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.540
And so this approach
breaks down.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.300
Also, if your piece
of paper was a cube,

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.470
the surface of the cube--
like, the end the last class

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.370
we talked about
flattening, we had a cube,

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.051
and you want to
collapse it flat.

00:11:54.051 --> 00:11:55.800
There we know that
there's a folded state,

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.080
but we don't know about
the folding motions.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.530
It's kind of disconcerting.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.340
We presume there's
a folding motion,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.210
but again, this
approach doesn't work

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.510
because you can't get a cube
down to a tiny triangle.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.880
You can't get rid of the--
it's kind of like having holes,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.350
but you surround a hole
in the case of the cube,

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.060
and you can't get rid of that
topological feature by folding.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.450
So it's tricky.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.940
We avoid collision
throughout here.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.411
We also crease
basically every point.

00:12:29.411 --> 00:12:31.160
This is rather impractical
if you actually

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.430
want to make something.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.890
It's comforting,
theoretically, but this is not

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.530
how you actually fold
a crane, because you

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.630
have to do all this
continuous crease rolling.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.850
So over time, every
point of paper

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.350
is at some point on a crease.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.120
And a big open problem
is what can you

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.886
do with finitely many creases?

00:12:47.886 --> 00:12:48.760
I'll write that down.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.180
Let's suppose you have no
overlapping layers of paper,

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.615
to make life a
little bit easier.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.720
So the paper doesn't
touch itself, so to speak.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.530
Can you do a finite
number of extra creases?

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.040
I would conjecture
maybe yes, but this

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.260
is a challenging problem.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.370
Here we have sort of
infinitely many creases.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.620
Everything becomes a crease.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.920
The extreme form
of this is what we

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:32.285
call rigid origami, where
you have no extra creases.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:40.260
So you're supposed to
just use the creases that

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.490
are given to you in
the crease pattern,

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:50.240
and the faces of the crease
pattern are rigid polygons.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.060
They have to stay flat
throughout the folding motion.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.830
So rigid origami
is a thing about

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.970
ridge-- about folding motions,
not about folded states.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.110
I have some folded
state I want to get to,

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.730
can I get there
with rigid polygons?

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.110
And the creases now
become hinges, basically.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.660
If you're making
origami out of metal

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.020
with flat sheets,
or plastic polygons,

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.100
whatever, hinging them together.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.450
Can use still fold this thing?

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.120
Or did folding it
require this kind

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.860
of bending the
paper in crazy ways,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.170
putting creases
all over the place?

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:30.370
Sometimes you can do this,
most of the time you can't.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.110
And there's a lot we don't
know about rigid origami.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.460
I have one simple example.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.760
Something we know is bad,
which is kind of fun.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.980
Should have brought an
actual paper shopping bag.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.560
You take a paper shopping
bag, they're mass produced

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.730
in this crease pattern,
so they're produced flat,

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.360
I believe.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:54.860
And can't be folded,
doesn't fold rigidly.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.860
You just have these
creases-- the edges

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.380
of the bag, this
kind of simple thing.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:03.390
It looks like straight skeleton
over here, and a perpendicular.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.330
Looks very nice from a
fold and cut standpoint.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:10.294
And it does have a folded
state, which is flat.

00:15:10.294 --> 00:15:11.460
There's no way to get there.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.980
If you look at all the
possible folded states

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.050
of this pattern with rigid
panels, there are two.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.380
There's the 3D state
you should see here.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.109
There's the flat state.

00:15:23.109 --> 00:15:25.150
There's nothing that could
possibly connect them.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.740
There are no other states,
so there's no folding motion

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.250
from one to the other.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.490
You could
instantaneously be flat,

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.100
and you could
instantaneously be open,

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.110
but you can't do
anything in between

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.460
without curving the paper
or doing something invalid

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.820
according to rigid origami.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.480
So obviously you don't want to
make a paper shopping bag out

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.660
of metal, I guess is the
lesson, without adding

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.715
extra creases at least.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:51.690
Yeah.

00:15:55.164 --> 00:15:57.580
I would love to find more open
questions on rigid origami,

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:02.660
but so far we've just looked
at a few small things.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:09.420
But this turns us
over to linkages,

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.310
which are all about finding
these motions without making

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.985
extra creases.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.100
So I need to introduce a
little bit of terminology.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.010
This is like creases
and all those things

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.050
from the origami world.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.120
But we care about various
levels of linkages.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.770
Let me remind you,
in general a linkage

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.540
is going to be something
like these guys.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.000
This is the Peaucellier
linkage, these guys

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.280
were pinned to the
projector screen,

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.540
these guys were flexible,
these are rigid bars,

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.870
and this guy ended up
tracing a straight line

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.260
as this thing moved.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.694
So that's the thing we want
to map-- model mathematically.

00:16:49.694 --> 00:16:51.360
We're going to have
zero thickness, just

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.740
like with paper folding.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.760
We're going to have vertices,
where things come together.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.068
And we're going to have edges,
which are those rigid bars.

00:17:03.068 --> 00:17:05.109
And I'm going to try to
speak in two languages at

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.340
once-- the fairly
intuitive one, and I'm

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.089
going to use some
notation in parentheses.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:10.950
So if you follow
the math, great.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.420
If not, also fine.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:20.069
The graph is just
combinatorial structure.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.900
It just says, look, I've
got things joined together

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.400
like this.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.329
There's no geometry,
there's just

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:28.590
a sense of what edges are
joined together at vertices.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.830
It's an abstract thing, kind
of like the shadow trees

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.840
we work with.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.570
They're not really
embedded anywhere,

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.740
though here, you don't
even have lengths.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.480
Linkage, you assign lengths
to the edges, and that's it.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:47.940
So I take a graph and then
I add lengths to edges.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.730
Its lengths of edges.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.130
So in math, this
would be a function l

00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:00.470
that maps every edge to a
non-negative real number.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.060
And I might want
a little bit more.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.190
So this is sort of optional.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.720
You might have some
pinned vertices,

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.280
things that are not
allowed to move.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.690
So you might add coordinates
for pinned vertices.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.230
And so in math, this
would be a function p

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.250
that maps some subset
of the vertices E

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.765
prime to wherever
you happen to live.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.420
So here, I'm supposing our
linkage lives in d dimensions,

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.450
because we're going to think
about linkages in 2D today.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.230
We're going to think about
linkages in 3D, linkages in 4D,

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.740
and higher.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.420
Everything is fair game.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.940
We're going to be
pretty general.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.230
And sometimes, I want to
think about the linkage

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.675
as this abstract thing.

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.450
It tells me how
things are connected,

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.700
tells me what the lengths are.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.330
This is again like
a shadow tree.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.710
Maybe I'm also told
some vertices are pinned

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.362
in particular places in the
plane or in 3D or whatever.

00:19:05.362 --> 00:19:07.570
But sometimes I want to
forget about that extra stuff

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.920
and just think about the graph.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.770
We won't do that
'till next lecture,

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:15.390
but I mention it now
because we will need it.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.075
And then where
the real action is

00:19:18.075 --> 00:19:21.150
is in the configuration
of a linkage.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.380
And that's the geometry,
that's how the thing is folded.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.885
This is basically a
folded state for linkages.

00:19:33.257 --> 00:19:35.340
Why is it different
terminology than folded state?

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:41.530
Just because it's a
different sub-field, I guess.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.417
Avoid confusion with
the other notions.

00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:46.250
With folded states,
usually we allow creases

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.030
all over the place.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.863
With the linkage, you're
really only allowed

00:19:48.863 --> 00:19:51.490
to bend at the vertices,
so it's a bit special.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.160
So a configuration
just gives you

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.210
coordinates for every vertex.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:05.900
So we would say configuration
C maps every vertex

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.216
to some point in d
dimensions, and you

00:20:10.216 --> 00:20:11.840
have to satisfy a
bunch of constraints.

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.970
And the constraints are
given by the linkage,

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:30.620
so you've got the lengths
and you've got the pinning.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.540
So you have to have that.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.270
If you look at two vertices
that are connected by an edge,

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.390
that edge has a
length, the distance

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.450
between those two
points should be

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:48.280
equal to the length of that edge
as given by that function l.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:21:00.070
This is for phi w an edge, and
then for the pinned vertices

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.100
the point you choose
better be exactly what's

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.365
given by the pin function.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:15.100
Never mind the details,
it's pretty intuitive.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.830
But link-- whenever
I say linkage,

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.150
I mean the abstract thing.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.260
Configuration, I mean actually
embedded in whatever space

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.130
you're living in.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.603
So let's do a simple example.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.550
Basically, the simplest
linkage that you can think of

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:45.670
is a square, and abstractly just
a bunch of vertices and edges.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.940
This is the graph.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.900
I haven't written down anything.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:56.110
When I add lengths-- let's say
they're all the same length,

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.345
I want to represent a square--
that becomes a linkage.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:06.600
And maybe I also specify this
guy is at coordinates 0, 0;

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.990
and this guy is at
coordinates 1, 0 that's

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.677
one unit away from this point.

00:22:12.677 --> 00:22:14.260
So that would sort
of pin things down,

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.620
and these guys are
still available to move.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.370
This is of course not
a valid drawing, not

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.911
a valid configuration
of the linkage.

00:22:19.911 --> 00:22:21.710
The lengths aren't
all the same, this guy

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:23.690
looks longer than this one.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:26.790
But then a valid configuration
would be an actual square.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.530
I should draw in the plane.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:37.170
Let's say-- so this is
at 0, 0; this is at 0, 1;

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.720
this is 1, 1; 1, 0.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.379
So that's a configuration.

00:22:42.379 --> 00:22:44.420
There are a bunch of
configurations this linkage.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:51.090
For example, that would
be another configuration.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:55.221
And there's a whole
degree of freedom here.

00:22:55.221 --> 00:22:57.720
And we really care about all
those different configurations.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.490
We call that the
configuration space.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.230
Configuration space is the
set of all configurations.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:12.420
So it has one thing
for the square,

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.060
there's one thing for this
particular parallelogram,

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.140
and there's that whole picture.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:24.700
Why don't I show you
graphically what it looks like?

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:30.210
So here we have a
square-- square, move.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.100
There we go.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.430
So yeah, it's flexible.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:36.270
That vertex C is
moving around a circle.

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.770
We can go around, and
around, and around.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.290
All right, you get the idea.

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.748
Are there any other
configurations?

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.910
No or yes.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:49.730
Pick one.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.535
Yes is correct.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.450
Ah, yeah, there.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.630
So when I get to here
and everything's sort

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.820
of overlapping--
little hard to see,

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.840
but you see there's
the yellow and green.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.700
Then I can bend--
and this I can't

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.880
do in the way this
program's set up-- I

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.630
can now move d
without moving AB.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.360
I could move the segment
BD and spin that around.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.890
So in fact, if you think
about it for a while--

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.360
I hope I got this
right, because I

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.070
think every time I've
given this lecture

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.610
I draw a different picture.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.540
The space, the
configuration space,

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:35.775
it looks something like
three kissing circles.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.242
So it's not quite
drawn to scale.

00:24:41.242 --> 00:24:42.950
Each of these points
I want to correspond

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.960
to one configuration.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.040
I should really draw this
with more board room.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.410
All right, so we
started with the square.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:05.840
And let's say these are the
pinned guys on the bottom.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.130
I had this one circle
of motion, which

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.260
just moved this segment
around sort of in a circle.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.780
So at the opposite point would
be where these guys are pinned

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.350
and the square is inside out.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:24.090
And halfway along
would be I don't know,

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:28.120
let's say I'm going left
here, I've got this,

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.670
and then my square is over here.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.040
Draw the right number
of points, yeah.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.060
And over on this side would
be these are the pinned guys,

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.590
and my square is over there.

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.620
From here, I can
do another circle

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.910
of motion, which is I can
never move these points,

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.960
but now I can turn
this guy around.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.610
And when I go halfway
around it will

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.980
be sort of folded on itself.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.680
So these are the
pinned guys, and then

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.950
the polygon's like that,
all on top of itself.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.340
We're only thinking about
where the vertices are,

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.440
we're not thinking about
overlap order here, one

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.360
of the differences
with linkages.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.840
And if I go around
from this guy,

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.110
it turns out-- I'm pretty
sure these circles of things

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:20.530
are different except right here.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:27.390
And so this thing is
equal to this thing.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:31.995
So hence, three circles
that, pairwise, kiss, I

00:26:31.995 --> 00:26:33.519
think is the topology
of this space.

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:34.810
You can walk around this thing.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.360
It was a little hard to
draw, but in this very simple

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.810
example, we can draw effectively
how the configuration

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:44.100
space works, how you
can navigate operations.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.710
In general, I want points
in the configuration space

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.070
to correspond to
configurations of the linkage.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.990
and I want paths in
the configuration space

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.697
to corresponds to motions.

00:27:02.697 --> 00:27:05.280
This is actually the first time
we get a definition of motion.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.670
I haven't specified one
here, although motion is just

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.480
going to be a continuum
of configurations,

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.220
just like we had with paper.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.920
In the configuration
space, a motion

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.100
is just some path
through the space.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.100
You start at some point.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.550
You end at some point.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.346
There may be multiple
ways to get there,

00:27:21.346 --> 00:27:22.970
but if your thing is
connected, there's

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.342
a way to get from
anywhere to anywhere.

00:27:25.342 --> 00:27:26.800
We want to understand
the structure

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.890
of paths in that space.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.150
That's motions.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.450
That's how you can get places.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:36.010
Mathematically, I guess
this is one big parenthesis,

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:47.760
you can think of a conflagration
of an n-vertex linkage

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.710
as a bunch of coordinates.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:56.030
You've got the coordinates
for the first vertex,

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.500
coordinates for v1, so
if we're in d dimensions,

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.560
there's going to be
d of these things.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.750
So you've got, x, y, whatever.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:06.200
Then you could write down
the coordinates for v2.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.700
Let's say we're in
three dimensions.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.050
So we've got three
here, three values here.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.912
I'm not going to write
down what they are,

00:28:12.912 --> 00:28:14.620
because I don't know
what they are-- then

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.120
three values for
the third vertex,

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:24.920
and so on for n vertices.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.430
Why is this useful?

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.370
Because you can think
of a configuration,

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.050
specify all these coordinates.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.155
How many coordinates in total?

00:28:33.155 --> 00:28:37.920
It's d times n numbers.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.130
You can think of a configuration
as just d times n numbers.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.110
So you can think
of a configuration

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:52.990
as a point in d times
n dimensional space.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.080
So this is giant space.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:00.390
Like for our square, I drew it
as a two-dimensional diagram,

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:03.770
but in reality
there's four vertices.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.230
Each has two dimensions.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.000
So it's an eight-dimensional
space-- a little hard

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.590
to imagine.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:14.880
But it's so constrained--
you can't just

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.280
take any set of numbers here.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.440
They have to satisfy the
edge length conditions,

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.530
and they have to satisfy
the pinning constraints.

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.150
And by the end, the space
is locally one-dimensional.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:27.480
It lives in eight
dimensions, but you can only

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:32.070
move along
one-dimensional curves.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.410
So we say this
configuration space

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:37.670
or that these configurations
have one degree of freedom.

00:29:40.462 --> 00:29:41.920
And "degree of
freedom" is probably

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.380
a term you've heard before.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.380
It's used all over the place.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.130
And the formal notion
of degree of freedom

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:51.390
here is just, locally, how
many dimensions do you have

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:54.910
if you look at the paths
going out from where you are?

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:57.380
If, for example, I have
just a free segment,

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.251
it's got a bunch of dimensions--
a bunch of degrees of freedom.

00:30:01.251 --> 00:30:02.750
It can translate,
and it can rotate.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:04.242
I guess, three.

00:30:04.242 --> 00:30:05.950
If I pin one of the
vertices, now it only

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:07.033
has one degree of freedom.

00:30:07.033 --> 00:30:08.620
It can spin around.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.050
Just locally, how many
different ways can you move?

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.669
What is the dimension
of your space?

00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:15.460
And a lot of the time,
we care about things

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.650
that have only one
degree of freedom

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.060
because they're controlled.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.490
We get to say what they do.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:23.720
All right.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.336
Let's move on to something
interesting about all this,

00:30:28.336 --> 00:30:30.470
which is Kempe's
Universality Theorem.

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.900
So this is the result that
you can sign your name, so

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.120
to speak, but I'll
state it more formally.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:16.090
My input is an algebraic
planar curve, and all of this

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.680
can be generalized to
beyond two dimensions,

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.370
but I'll start with
the planar case.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.540
Let me get back to that.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.660
Think of that as
just this blind,

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.990
some kind of polynomial curve.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:57.450
We're going to restrict that
curve to a bounded disk,

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:02.020
then claim that is
exactly the trajectory

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.890
of some vertex in a linkage.

00:32:22.724 --> 00:32:23.240
OK.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.410
So I have a lot of
things to define here.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.040
One of them is trajectory.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.660
So this is pretty intuitive.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.860
So for example, you take some
linkage like this square,

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:39.130
and as it moves, you just
follow one of the vertices.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:43.210
So for example, if we look
at c, the trajectory of c

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:47.840
is this white circle, at
least as we move to here.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.300
I think even here, when
we move d, c doesn't move.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.200
So the trajectory
of c is that circle.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.560
It's just-- you take
all the configurations,

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.619
but then you just
focus on one vertex

00:32:57.619 --> 00:32:59.160
and see where it
can go in the plane.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:06.650
In general, it can be very
complicated, like here, maybe.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:07.830
Yeah.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.879
You may recall it seems
I do this every time.

00:33:11.879 --> 00:33:14.420
If you look at the trajectory,
this is not actually a vertex,

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.850
and that is not a valid color
if you want to see something.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.080
This vertex, for
example, its trajectory

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.140
is some kind of figure
eight curve like that.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.520
In general, it can
be some crazy curve,

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.100
and we want that crazy curve
to match a given planar curve.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:38.200
What is this notation?

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:43.080
All I mean, it's just
something like 3x cubed times

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:52.630
y minus 7y to the
fourth power equals 0.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.180
You can also add 23 to it.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.212
Whatever.

00:33:56.212 --> 00:33:57.340
So you have some equation.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.830
This is an equation on points.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.140
In general, if you
think about it,

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.860
you've got two degrees
of freedom for a point.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.140
It has an x-coordinate
and a y-coordinate.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.170
You add one equation,
one constraint,

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.045
that effectively pins it
down to be one-dimensional.

00:34:11.045 --> 00:34:13.170
So it's going to define
some one-dimensional curve.

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:14.250
It could be very general.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.060
It could even be disconnected.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.590
All sorts of weird stuff.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:21.360
But you can use this to write
down circles and ellipses.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.060
That's the quadratic
polynomials.

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:27.070
But you could also write much
more complicated things here.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:30.510
So this defines some
crazy curve, locally

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.360
one-dimensional thing.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.900
And it may also go off to
infinity if there's hyperbolas,

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.944
or whatever, in there.

00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:39.110
We're not going to try to
capture the infinite curve

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.568
because that's
actually impossible.

00:34:40.568 --> 00:34:43.630
If you have any pin
vertex, then you

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.330
can only get so far away
from that pin vertex.

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.880
If you have no pin
vertices, then you

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.691
can show you can make
any point in the plane.

00:34:50.691 --> 00:34:52.440
So if I want to get a
one-dimensional set,

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.290
it's got to be a bounded
set from a linkage.

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:58.490
So I take some big
disk that captures

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:02.110
the stuff I care about in
that one-dimensional curve,

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:05.390
and then I am going to
trace out everything

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:09.840
of that curve inside that disk
using one vertex of a linkage.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.110
That's my goal.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.720
So it's a pretty
powerful result.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.450
I like to call it Kempe's
Universality Theorem

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:23.850
because Kempe wrote a paper
about it in 1891 or so-- 1876.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.550
Even earlier.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.610
He didn't really prove
the theorem, though.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:34.360
Kempe is quite famous for
two wrong proofs of theorems,

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.890
but the theorems are true.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:38.460
The one he's most famous for
is the four color theorem,

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.626
which you may have heard of.

00:35:39.626 --> 00:35:42.520
Any plane or map can be
colored with four colors

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.250
such that no two
countries share boundary

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.910
if they have the same color.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:49.960
He didn't prove that theorem,
but it was the late 1800s.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.860
It wasn't proved
until 1960 or so.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:59.540
But the technique he used is
called the discharging method,

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:01.150
is the proof that
people use today.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.590
There are now two proofs
to the four color theorem.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.090
They both use discharging.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:08.060
So they both use Kempe's ideas.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.590
He was just ahead of his time.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.887
He also claimed to
prove this theorem.

00:36:13.887 --> 00:36:16.220
And he proved a slightly
weaker version of this theorem.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.400
I'm going to show you his
proof because it's nice,

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.630
and it can be fixed,
actually, relatively easily--

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:24.400
although that was done only in
the context of this class six

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.930
years ago.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.560
So Kempe's proof has been
around for over 100 years.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.060
Other people had
proved this theorem

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.811
but in more complicated ways.

00:36:31.811 --> 00:36:33.560
We can prove it in the
same way Kempe did,

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.685
just a little bit of extra.

00:36:42.747 --> 00:36:45.330
So the rest of the lecture will
be about proving that theorem.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:07.780
All right.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.820
So we've got two things
we need to worry about.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.465
We have to worry
about this curve,

00:37:11.465 --> 00:37:13.790
and we have to worry about
being in a bounded disk.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:15.160
I like being in a bounded disk.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.320
That sounds really easy.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.810
Let's start with that.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.900
So this is this figure.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.090
I have, just for fun, a scan of
the original Kempe paper where

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:25.639
he draws the
corresponding gadgets.

00:37:25.639 --> 00:37:26.930
This is, again, a gadget proof.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:30.450
We're going to have lots of
cool gadgets to do fun things.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.820
A rhombus looks like this.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.200
It has one pin vertex,
a, here, and you

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.104
have a degree of freedom in
how you specify this thing.

00:37:39.104 --> 00:37:41.520
You specify the lengths of the
edges, but all of the edges

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.370
have the same length.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.510
So it's like a square, except
I only pin one of the vertices.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.120
That's really the same thing.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:54.340
And you can see, it can only
go out to twice that distance,

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.604
and then it fails
to exist out here.

00:37:56.604 --> 00:37:59.020
These figures are drawn using
a program called Cinderella,

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.840
which is very, very cool.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.020
It's commercial, but
you can download a demo

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.940
and make your own fun
constructions like this.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.990
These are all on the web,
the ones I drew here.

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.110
So you can see,
basically, that point b

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.320
is constrained to lie in a disk.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.240
That's it.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.980
Very simple.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:23.110
So that's the rhombus gadget.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:31.440
But I want to think
about it a little bit.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.524
So this vertex is pinned,
let's say, at 0,0.

00:38:40.524 --> 00:38:42.690
Well, I guess it's pinned
at the center of the disk.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:45.400
I don't know where that is.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.560
This vertex is going to be
the vertex I care about.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:50.330
It's the one that I want to
force to lie on the curve

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:51.680
and trace out the curve.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.800
This is going to
be my magic vertex.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.770
Let's call it x,y.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.330
Say the point that
it lives on is x,y.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:08.510
I somehow have to evaluate this
multinomial, various powers

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.550
of x and y, multiply
them by some constants,

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:13.080
add them together, and
force that to equal 0

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.134
by some constraint, by
adding-- bars, in general,

00:39:15.134 --> 00:39:15.800
are constraints.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.740
Edges are constraints.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.970
They give me
equality constraints.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.845
I say the distance
between these two vertices

00:39:20.845 --> 00:39:22.360
is equal to something.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.920
Somehow I have to set up the
distance between two vertices

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.450
to be that crazy
function that I'm given.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:28.800
It could be anything.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.510
It could be a mess.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:35.350
So Kempe had this cool idea.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.410
He said, look, you
can write this point

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:45.150
as a sequence of motions,
you can think of them.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:48.270
So you start at the
origin here, and then you

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.020
move along this segment,
and then you move

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.060
along this segment.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.935
So let's just write
down-- what's that angle?

00:39:52.935 --> 00:39:53.700
Call it alpha.

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.170
Let me be consistent
with my notation.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.090
Yes, alpha.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.600
And these are horizontal lines.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.464
And you can think of this
angle-- I'll call it beta.

00:40:05.464 --> 00:40:06.630
So there's some length here.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:08.090
Did I give it a name?

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.190
I do.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:13.710
I call it r/2, because
if these are both r/2

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:17.440
and these are also r/2-- that's
the definition of a rhombus--

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.180
then this point
can get to anywhere

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.640
within a disk of radius
r centered at this point.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.870
So this would be the
center of the disk.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.350
So we're given r, we're
told what the disk is.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:29.200
We set this up.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.450
But now alpha and beta
are in some sense free.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:33.875
They're actually
related to-- no,

00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:35.500
they're not even
related to each other.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.460
This point still has
two degrees of freedom.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.527
Even though it can't
go out to infinity,

00:40:40.527 --> 00:40:42.110
it can move in x and
it can move in y.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.540
We saw because only
one point was pinned,

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.060
it could float around in
a tw-dimensional space.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:53.030
So alpha and beta are actually
both free to some extent.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:55.210
So instead of
coordinatizing by x,y,

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:57.270
you could coordinatize
by alpha and beta.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:01.280
And you can relate those two
coordinatizations by some trig.

00:41:03.765 --> 00:41:05.390
I'm going to cheat
here because I never

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:07.990
remember which is sine or
cosine without thinking

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.730
for 30 seconds.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.310
The way I remember
is always cosine

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:17.000
is alphabetically
smaller than sine,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.880
and so cosine is
the x-coordinate

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.450
and sine is the
y-coordinate, if you

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:24.670
draw the triangle in the
conical orientation, which

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.378
you might forget.

00:41:32.947 --> 00:41:34.530
If you were given
these angles and you

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:35.946
want to construct
this point, it's

00:41:35.946 --> 00:41:38.290
like, well, I go
in this direction.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:41.210
That direction is cosine
alpha, sine alpha.

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.970
And I go that direction
for r/2 distance.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:49.320
So I have r/2 times cosine alpha
in the x-coordinate, r/2 sine

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.445
alpha in the y-coordinates.

00:41:50.445 --> 00:41:52.420
It's nice and alphabetical.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:55.610
Then from there, I
go in this direction,

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:58.030
which is in the beta
direction-- the cosine beta,

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.980
sine beta direction.

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.860
I go that direction by
the same amount, r/2.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:03.677
So there you go.

00:42:03.677 --> 00:42:05.760
That's x and y written in
terms of alpha and beta.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:11.540
For the purpose of this exercise
I prefer cosines over sines.

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.470
So I'm going to
rewrite these sines

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:16.440
in terms of cosines
in the obvious way,

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:27.880
which I will look up, which
is cosine alpha minus pi/2,

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.360
Those r/2 cosine
beta minus pi/2.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:36.566
OK.

00:42:36.566 --> 00:42:39.160
Let's see if I can successfully
draw cosine and sine.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.220
Sine starts here and does that.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.560
Cosine starts here
and does that.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.340
They're just shifts
of each other, which

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.367
I didn't draw so beautifully.

00:42:49.367 --> 00:42:50.200
Something like that.

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:56.090
Cosine and sine,
just a shift by pi/2.

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.830
So if I subtract
pi/2 from the angles,

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:04.660
I can turn it into a
cosine instead of a sine.

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:05.350
Great.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:07.320
So I have x and y
written as cosines

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.710
of things involving
alpha and beta.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:11.470
So what?

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:17.530
Well magically, when I think
about squaring or raising

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:22.160
x to some power like 10, if
you look in angle space what

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.740
happens to alpha
and beta, it's kind

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.710
of like multiplying
the angles by 10.

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.670
In some sense, going into
the trigonometric world

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:31.924
is like taking logarithms
if you're into algebra.

00:43:31.924 --> 00:43:34.340
You have these exponents, and
they're hard to think about.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:36.006
You take logs, it's
just multiplication.

00:43:36.006 --> 00:43:37.510
No biggie.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:40.710
And for those of you who
know complex analysis,

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:42.065
that should be obvious.

00:43:42.065 --> 00:43:45.010
For the rest, just
take it on faith,

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.390
and we'll just find
out that it's true.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.820
Because you have
this good friend.

00:43:53.082 --> 00:43:54.730
You have the product
of two cosines.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:08.071
You can rewrite it in terms of
adding and subtracting angles.

00:44:08.071 --> 00:44:09.820
Now, you may not have
learned it this way.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.980
You probably learned
about rules for cosines

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.270
of sums of things and cosines
of differences of things.

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:19.050
If you take these two
expansions, add them together,

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:21.090
lots of things
cancel, and you end up

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:25.390
just being left with cosine a
times cosine b with a module

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:27.520
a factor of 2.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.770
So in our situation, we
have this crazy thing.

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:35.160
Let me write down another
one-- x to the seventh times y

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:41.110
squared plus whatever,
maybe times 6 here.

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:42.430
Well, I know what x and y are.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:43.500
I just expand them.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.730
I can just plug in
this thing involving

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:48.930
cosine alpha and cosine beta
into x, and plug in this thing

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:53.500
involving cosine of alpha
minus pi/2 and so on into y.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.820
Multiply all that stuff out.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.400
What you end up doing is
multiplying cosines times

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.820
cosines.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:59.960
And here's how we do it.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:03.830
To multiply two cosines, I
absorb things and turn it

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:09.080
into cosines of sums of angles
and differences of angles.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.890
And I brought an
example for you.

00:45:15.172 --> 00:45:17.190
I'm from Waterloo,
so I use Maple.

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:22.060
You could use Mathematica,
whatever you want,

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.440
because doing this
algebra is a pain.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.590
But at the top there, it
says substitute x equal

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:30.000
that crazy thing and y
equal that crazy thing.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.720
Here I didn't bother
rewriting in terms of cosines

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.960
because Maple's smarter than I
am, so I don't need to do that.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.110
And I have some crazy
equation at the top

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.060
there, which is x cubed
times y minus 5 times x times

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:46.900
y squared equals 0, but I'm
ignoring the equals 0 part.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.900
So I just plug that in, and the
first time, the first answer

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.150
there, it doesn't do anything.

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:53.740
It just plugs it in.

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:58.170
Then I say expand that, and
it does all this crazy stuff.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.470
It multiplies all those things
out, uses binomial theorem

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.970
or whatever.

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.761
You get various new
coefficients out there,

00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:06.080
but you get various powers
of cosines and sines

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.430
of alphas and betas.

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:10.690
And then I use the
magic operation

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:12.897
Combine Using Trig Formulas.

00:46:12.897 --> 00:46:15.230
And combine means when you
have a product of two things,

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.750
try to make it one thing.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:21.260
And that's just a way of telling
Maple to apply this formula,

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.800
but it does it for the sine case
also-- both cosines and sines.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:28.980
And then you get this pretty
equation, or pretty left-hand

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.480
side I guess.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.080
You get sines.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.084
It's written it as
sines and cosines.

00:46:34.084 --> 00:46:35.500
In our situation,
we're only going

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:39.240
to get cosines because I
was very reductionist here.

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.100
And it'll always be cosines
of various integer multiples

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:46.500
of alpha plus some
integer multiple of beta.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.155
And then there'll be some
power of r out there.

00:46:49.155 --> 00:46:49.780
It's no biggie.

00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.280
In fact, we're told what r is.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.830
We don't have to
think very hard.

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.610
We can construct r
to the seventh power.

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:57.344
It's not a big deal.

00:46:57.344 --> 00:46:58.760
In fact, all of
these coefficients

00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.640
are not a big deal.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.700
We can just say 15
over 32 times r cubed.

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.160
We can just make an
edge that's that length.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.440
The hard part is making
these things because alpha,

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.760
beta are variables.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.180
They're not a fixed thing.

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:13.920
As this thing moves, we want to
be able to compute twice alpha

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:18.010
plus beta, and then take
the cosine of that thing.

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:19.960
Now taking the cosine
of a thing is easy.

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.400
It's just the x-coordinate.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:28.900
If I have a segment that's
going in direction theta,

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.390
then the x-coordinate
of this thing

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:33.510
with respect to that
thing is cos theta.

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:35.260
This is what I've been
using all the time.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.260
The y-coordinate is sine
theta, but x-coordinate

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.480
is cosine theta.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:41.010
So if we can construct something
at an angle of twice alpha

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:45.300
plus beta, then we just
project onto the x-axis.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.050
This length is cosine theta.

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.280
Done.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.580
So all we need is to be
able to take an angle,

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.940
multiply it by some
integer like 27,

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.382
and we need to be able to
add two angles together.

00:47:59.382 --> 00:48:01.200
And that's what Kempe does.

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:07.840
So he does it with
this crazy thing

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.940
called a contraparallelogram.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.860
A parallelogram looks like this.

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:17.136
You see the parallelogram.

00:48:17.136 --> 00:48:19.010
So it's a little more
general than a rhombus,

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.810
but not much more.

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:23.290
And then the contraparallelogram
is you take this diagonal,

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:26.750
a,y I guess it's called here,
and you reflect one side down.

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:29.350
And so the blue thing is
the contraparallelogram.

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:33.830
How does it work?

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:35.130
What does it do?

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:37.340
Well, I'm assuming the
left point there is pinned.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.930
Actually, I'm assuming
both x and y are pinned.

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:42.920
And it just moves around.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:43.890
It's kind of cool.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:51.185
It has this great
feature that the angle

00:48:51.185 --> 00:48:54.620
at a here between
the two blue segments

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:57.150
is the same as the angle at y.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:01.165
And the angle at x is the
same as the angle at b.

00:49:01.165 --> 00:49:03.420
You can see that
throughout the motion.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.489
So it's basically
an angle copier.

00:49:06.489 --> 00:49:08.030
Angle copier sounds
good because if I

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.550
want to multiply an angle by
2, I'd like two copies of it

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:12.590
and then stick them together.

00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:15.504
So we're just going to take
this contraparallelogram

00:49:15.504 --> 00:49:20.190
and combine a bunch of them.

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:24.280
So if we're going
to multiply by 2--

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.850
it's a little harder
to see right on blue.

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:30.030
So I have one
contraparallelogram here,

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:34.300
and then I make a similar--
you just scale it up--

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.300
contraparallelogram that
lies along that one.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.800
So there's two
contraparallelograms.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.420
And as I said
before, this angle is

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.010
going to be equal to this angle.

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:48.940
That's going to be
our input alpha.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:50.680
And we're trying to
compute twice alpha,

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.840
which will be here.

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.380
And because this
contraparallelogram

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:58.670
is similar to this one,
the angles are the same.

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:00.450
It's just a blowing up of it.

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:03.470
So that means these angles,
which are equal to each other

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:05.190
because it's
contraparallelogram,

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:08.350
will be equal to these
angles because it's

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:10.610
the same contraparallelogram
scaled up.

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:13.762
Therefore, we have two copies
of the angle right there.

00:50:13.762 --> 00:50:16.340
I'll just show
you that it works.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:19.110
A little hard to see on a
digital screen with pixels.

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:19.610
Here.

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.026
When we get 90 degrees, we're
going to get the twice of it

00:50:22.026 --> 00:50:23.810
is exactly 180.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:26.400
Here's 45.

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.930
Here's two 30s
make 60, and so on.

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.010
It works basically all the time.

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:35.330
Wow, cool.

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.990
It's hard to see in some cases.

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:43.760
I guess there, twice 180
is making 360, and so on.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.230
That's how you
multiply an angle by 2.

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:50.620
But then you can extend that and
just repeat this construction.

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.220
I take one contraparallelogram,
I attach it

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.070
to another similar
contraparallelogram,

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:57.577
I attach that to another
similar contraparallelogram,

00:50:57.577 --> 00:50:58.910
I get three copies of the angle.

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:05.520
Amazing.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.090
Here's trisecting
180 degree angle.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:08.885
I get three 60s.

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:13.420
Wow, that looks crazy.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:18.117
But it works.

00:51:18.117 --> 00:51:19.700
This is sort of a
proof that it works.

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.170
It exists in all the states.

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:24.280
Great.

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.730
This is an angle
trisector, which

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:27.870
was a big deal in
the late 1800s.

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:30.260
You could build a linkage
where if-- instead

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:32.070
of thinking of this
as being your input,

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:34.653
or this, whatever-- any one of
these three could be the input,

00:51:34.653 --> 00:51:36.500
and the output is
three times that.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.750
That's what we want.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:40.760
You could turn it around and
say, if I'm given some angle,

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.210
I line up these two bars
to be equal to that,

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:46.700
and then I'll get three
trisections of the angle.

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.417
You can use this to
quintisect an angle.

00:51:48.417 --> 00:51:50.000
You can divide into
any integer number

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.780
parts using this crazy linkage.

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.000
Fun stuff.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.750
And we can use it to multiply
an angle by some constant.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:03.690
I should write, we
do this, we expand,

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:06.160
and we will get
a bunch of terms.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.990
We will get that our
function phi here

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:13.390
is a sum of a
bunch of terms that

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:16.300
look like some constant,
which we can compute ahead

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:23.760
of time nothing's changing,
times cosine of some integer,

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:32.380
what do I call it, it's
to match minutes here,

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:40.680
r sub i times alpha,
plus s sub i times

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:44.150
beta, plus some
magic number delta,

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:49.479
and delta is 0, or plus
or minus pi over 2.

00:52:49.479 --> 00:52:50.520
So that's not a big deal.

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.370
That's just saying whether
we're using sign or cosine.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.050
What we need is to
construct, and these

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:58.801
are both integers could
be positive or negative,

00:52:58.801 --> 00:53:00.300
negative's not such
a big deal, it's

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:03.640
just you look at the
angle the other way.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.770
So we need some integer times
alpha, some integer times beta,

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.250
we can now do that.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:10.680
Then we need to
add them together.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.370
How do we do that?

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:13.980
We use the Kempe Additor.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.010
There he is drawing it.

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:23.480
we drew a slightly more detailed
diagram, looks like this.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.980
Now, this is a
little more confusing

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:26.690
so I had to label the thing.

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:30.320
We've got the x-axis,
I like that part.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.610
The idea is we have two inputs.

00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:35.960
Here's input one, defining
one angle to the x-axis.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:38.580
Here's input two, another
angle to the x-axis,

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:39.991
here is about 90 degrees.

00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:41.490
I want to add them
together and that

00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:44.920
will be this output over here.

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:49.530
Our idea, I think I should
draw this separately,

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:52.700
not our idea this is
Kempe's idea, here's

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:56.540
0 here's input
one, and input two.

00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:59.960
Both of these are measured
as angles to the x-axis.

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:04.260
All we need to do is sort of
rotate this angle to be here,

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:08.940
and then this guy
will be the sum.

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:12.010
How do we figure that out
when all we know how to do

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:16.770
is multiply angles by two or
divide them in half let's say?

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:18.190
I told you that.

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:20.330
You think about it
for a while, you

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:23.420
realize, oh well
let's instead think

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.279
of it as taking this
angle the smaller one,

00:54:26.279 --> 00:54:27.820
doesn't really matter
but it's easier

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:30.570
to think about copying
that angle over here.

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:32.120
I want to copy that
angle over here,

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:36.040
and I'm an origamist
I think reflection.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.350
I would really like to
reflect along the bisector.

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:42.610
Now what is it a bisector of?

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:46.330
It's a bisector of this angle,
which hasn't been marked here.

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:51.930
But if this a, this is b,
then this would be b minus a.

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:58.515
So I want to bisect that angle.

00:54:58.515 --> 00:54:59.890
Really I want to
bisect the angle

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:03.566
between this edge and this edge.

00:55:03.566 --> 00:55:04.590
How do I do that?

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:08.330
I use a Kempe
multiplicator, value of two,

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:13.000
apply it to this angle, then
I figure out that bisector.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.250
How do I copy this
thing over to here?

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:19.310
Well I take this
angle and I double it,

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:23.160
I'll get that, actually that.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.480
So I just used two
Kempe doublers,

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:29.480
one to have been one to double.

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:32.230
And I can we
possibly see it here?

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:33.980
I have this line marked middle.

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:36.530
That is the bisector between
the input two line and the input

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:37.580
one line.

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:38.950
How is it found?

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:42.750
Well it's here.

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:49.360
That's one part of the Kempe
halfer, doubler, whatever.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.800
And it's attached to one
over there, similar one.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:56.130
So it's attached on one side to
input two and on the other side

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:58.230
to input one.

00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:00.960
And so therefore it
actually takes that angle

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.950
and it cuts it in half there.

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:04.220
That's what it does.

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.750
So now I have that
middle line and I

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:09.760
have another Kempe doubler
which is attached to the output

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:14.230
thing, and the middle, and
it's attached to the x-axis

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:15.080
to ground it.

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:18.380
So now we're taking this
angle and doubling it

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.670
and that gives us the output.

00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:25.080
And you do it, and magically
thanks to Cinderella,

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.250
it does the right thing.

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:29.420
So as I move, here I'm
changing input one,

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.790
and I'm moving the output
and also this middle line,

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:35.680
it's staying a bisector there,
when they both get to 90

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.750
it'll be 180, and so on.

00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:41.400
And I can change
and put two as well.

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.050
And once you build it it's kind
of clear that it will work.

00:56:47.282 --> 00:56:48.740
There's a special
case of doubling,

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.670
but I can add any
two angles I want.

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:53.410
And what's fun is it also
works, I set it up for input one

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:56.140
being smaller input
two, but it works just

00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:57.577
as fine the other way around.

00:56:57.577 --> 00:56:59.410
I don't want to go too
big because I get out

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:02.880
of the screen.

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.350
There's 0 adding 0 to something.

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:07.880
Cool, huh?

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.900
Like magic.

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:10.120
So Kempe was really smart.

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.870
He knew about these linkages.

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:13.960
He wrote that book How
to Draw a Straight Line.

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.534
But he knew a lot
more about then

00:57:15.534 --> 00:57:16.700
how to draw a straight line.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:21.660
He could use, he could
add two angles, man.

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.280
Very cool.

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:26.710
All right, what's left.

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.490
Basically done,
for Kempe's proof.

00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:31.690
I haven't told you what's
wrong with this proof yet.

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:35.285
Maybe you've been
thinking about it.

00:57:35.285 --> 00:57:37.830
Then you just have to put
all these gadgets together.

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:41.800
We have a schematic
of it in the textbook.

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.575
So we started at the
top with our rhombus.

00:57:46.575 --> 00:57:49.380
Not really drawn like a
rhombus there, but pretend it's

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.530
a rhombus, this guy.

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:57.302
I guess this is simplified
since we drew this figure.

00:57:57.302 --> 00:57:58.760
So all the edge
links are the same.

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.742
We've got that
point p at the top,

00:58:00.742 --> 00:58:01.950
that's the one we care about.

00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:06.089
We've got the o in the bottom
left, it's pinned to the table.

00:58:06.089 --> 00:58:07.880
And there's one gadget
I didn't talk about,

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.400
translators which is copies,
angles around, not too

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.810
big a deal.

00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:15.150
Then we, in this case
say, we take alpha,

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:19.530
it's right there, we multiply
it by two, get two alpha,

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:22.920
take beta maybe add those two
together, we'll get twice alpha

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.060
plus beta.

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:26.970
And that is some angle
we want to measure

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:32.010
the x-coordinate of the
segment with that angle.

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:36.196
So we just make this thing
have the right length.

00:58:36.196 --> 00:58:37.320
What length should it have?

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.940
Well we have this
cosine of whatever

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:45.680
of our angle in
our formula here.

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.780
And there's some
constant in front of it.

00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:50.300
And for whatever reason
we have this constant 3a

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:53.610
squared times b, something
that we know how to compute.

00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:57.167
So we just make this edge
have that length, that's

00:58:57.167 --> 00:59:00.710
a scale marker, and
measure the projected

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:02.947
x length of that thing.

00:59:02.947 --> 00:59:05.530
Well, in fact in general we have
a whole bunch of these terms.

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:07.820
We need to add them together.

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:11.360
We have a whole bunch of these
things you saw on the maple,

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.120
had I don't know, 20 of those.

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.030
So we just string them together.

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:19.040
That's our thing we start at
some point, which we call 0.

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:22.850
In fact, it will be the
same as that o, let's say.

00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:24.276
It should be the same as that o.

00:59:24.276 --> 00:59:26.650
We're going to measure relative
to the center of the disk

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:31.270
say, wherever 0 0 is.

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:34.632
And then we want to measure
how long this thing gets in x.

00:59:34.632 --> 00:59:36.590
Some of these terms might
actually be negative,

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.080
some are positive.

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.040
But we're effectively adding
up all of these weighted sums

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.160
of cosines of our
angles which we

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:46.830
compute through
these crazy things.

00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:50.500
At the end we want this to be 0.

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:53.850
So our goal is to make the
sum of all these things, which

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:56.770
is the sum of all these
things rewritten, equal to 0

00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:59.640
That was the definition
of our curve.

00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.840
How do we force it to be 0?

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.260
Well the actual value is
the x-coordinate here.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.770
And I'm going to
force this to lie

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.970
on x equals 0 using a
peaucellier linkage,

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:12.529
because it forces
points to line a line.

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:14.070
In the way we drew
it, it would force

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:17.170
it to be on a vertical line.

01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:19.700
So you have to imagine this
picture a little differently,

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.330
because in fact
this should be at x

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:24.070
equals 0, which is
normally right here.

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:25.980
So this thing actually
goes over to the right

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:28.440
and we'll get positive
and negative values

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.160
and it should lie along
the vertical line there.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.510
And that's how you force, now
this point p prime has nothing

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:38.670
to do with them, is
not the same as p.

01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:40.920
But we computed it based
on all these things

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.700
in terms of alpha and beta.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.220
So this is a constraint
on p in the end,

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.120
because p determined
all these things.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.280
And either this thing will
be on the line or not.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.271
And we add this one
equality constraint

01:00:52.271 --> 01:00:53.895
which would be exactly
this constraint.

01:00:53.895 --> 01:00:58.200
It will constrain p
to lie on that curve,

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.375
and that's Kempe's construction.

01:01:01.375 --> 01:01:01.875
Questions?

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:10.810
Three cool, just slightly wrong.

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:12.100
Any ideas what's wrong?

01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:24.680
Has nothing do
with this picture.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.565
It has everything to
do with the gadgets.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.360
And actually it really has
to do with all this business

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.110
about the square.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.340
I've lost my diagram of
the configuration space

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.140
to the square.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.610
We had this thing that
when the square was flat,

01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:45.560
it could fold in a new way.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.782
And you saw I couldn't
even do that in Cinderella.

01:01:47.782 --> 01:01:49.240
Cinderella is
designed to find sort

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.470
of one primary
arc of this thing.

01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:57.150
But there are these
branch points, these guys.

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:59.520
And this construction
is perfect if you always

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.500
stay on your track.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.140
But in a real linkage, you
can diverge at any point

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.922
and go to some other track, and
you can walk around this space.

01:02:06.922 --> 01:02:08.880
When you have these branch
points where there's

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.840
more than two curves coming
together, you have a choice.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.140
So you're not supposed
to have a choice here,

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:19.250
supposed to always
do this thing.

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:26.030
And sadly there's one
gadget, really two gadgets,

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:28.170
the parallelogram and
the contra-parallelogram.

01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:30.540
The parallelogram
we're using here.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.800
It's also used in the copy
gadget which I didn't show you.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:40.230
What don't I tell you, a
copy gadget looks like this.

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:45.360
It's like a lamp, you
know like the Pixar lamp.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.210
So if you have an angle here
it gets copied here, right.

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:52.809
These are just two
identical parallelograms.

01:02:52.809 --> 01:02:54.600
So if you need multiple
copies of an angle,

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.430
you can make multiple
copies that way.

01:02:56.430 --> 01:03:00.332
I don't think you really
need this, but Kempe used it.

01:03:00.332 --> 01:03:03.460
It feels good to be
able to copy an angel.

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.290
And it's a parallelogram.

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:07.950
And we used a lot, the
contra-parallelogram.

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.550
The trouble is they
are the same linkage.

01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:13.320
If you forget about
the configuration,

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.470
you just look at the linkage
which is who's pinned,

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.330
what are the edge links, what
is the graph connectivity,

01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:22.932
it looks like this, just these
numbers are not all the same,

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:24.640
and only one of these
vertices is pinned.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.580
Other than that it's
exactly this diagram.

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.870
You know, It's a square,
it's a quadrilateral,

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:31.730
has some lengths.

01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:34.650
Opposite pairs are equal.

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:38.780
But you can't really
distinguish from the two

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:39.950
kinds of configurations.

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.990
There's one track which
is the parallelogram.

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:44.323
There's another track which
is the contra-parallelogram.

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:48.580
And you can do this.

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:53.410
Let me show you in animation,
give you some intuition.

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:56.200
So here I drew both, oh sorry,
not supposed to move that.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.770
Here I drew both of them, got
the green contra-parallelogram.

01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:06.130
And there's the, sorry green,
the blue contra-parallelogram.

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:09.150
And then we've got the
black and blue parallelogram

01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:10.270
on the outside.

01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:14.190
And ignore this diagonal, it
should be a different color.

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:18.360
And when we're flat,
that's the same thing.

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.970
And so we've got this one
cycle that goes around

01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:22.880
and that's the blue picture.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.950
Then at this point you can
switch into the black picture

01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:30.420
and follow the parallelogram
around until it's flat.

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:33.880
And that point you could also
switch back to blue or not.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.590
So I think this is two
circles joined to two points.

01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:40.340
If I'm not mistaken,
the configuration space

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:42.420
would look like this.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.874
So one of these tracks, say this
one, is a contra-parallelogram.

01:04:45.874 --> 01:04:47.040
This one is a parallelogram.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.230
They meet at the two
extremes, both flat cases.

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:55.250
And in Kempe's construction
he wants each of the things

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:57.360
that we call the
parallelogram like this one,

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.127
to stay on one, the
parallelogram track.

01:04:59.127 --> 01:05:00.710
And he wants the
contra-parallelograms

01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:03.950
to stay on the
contra-parallelograms track.

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:06.050
But how do you force that?

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:09.120
He didn't force it,
and so technically he

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.550
did not solve this problem.

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:13.492
He solved, that
solved this problem,

01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:14.950
which is that you
would get exactly

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:16.750
the trajectory of a vertex.

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:20.050
He solved the slightly weaker
problem, which is his point

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.930
can travel along that curve.

01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:25.660
It can also travel
on other curves.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.160
But it's going to
be one dimensional

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.380
because it is constrained.

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:30.630
But there are these other
tracks you might conceivably

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:31.940
be able to go on.

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:33.679
In particular, you
can follow this track.

01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:34.845
There might be other things.

01:05:34.845 --> 01:05:37.050
And we'd like to
get rid of that.

01:05:37.050 --> 01:05:39.750
It turns out you can get
rid of that pretty easily.

01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:46.340
This problem was first noticed
by Kapovitch and Millson

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:52.650
in like 2002 I think.

01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:53.970
Yeah.

01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:55.720
Well that's when it
finally got published.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.440
I think it was around for
a few years before that.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.730
And they observed that
for parallelograms you

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:06.050
can fix it pretty easily
like in this picture.

01:06:06.050 --> 01:06:09.230
You have the
parallelogram a-b-c-d.

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:12.040
You construct the
midpoints of a and b

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.940
and the midpoints of d and c.

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:15.910
How do you actually do this?

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:19.490
I want that point x to stay
on the middle of that bar.

01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:21.020
You can do that
by making, if you

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:23.360
want to construct a point
in the middle of a bar,

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.630
you just add a tiny
triangle, where

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:30.380
it's forced to be that
way, where a b equals,

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:34.190
I mean the sum of a
and b equals a plus b.

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:37.977
And if you want,
do we need this?

01:06:37.977 --> 01:06:40.060
I think you could just
construct those three bars.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.300
This makes a little
bit more rigid,

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:47.050
but I don't think we
actually need that here.

01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:49.500
So you can force a vertex
to be along the midpoint

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:54.120
there by making a tiny
triangle, a zero area triangle.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:58.480
And when you do that, I don;t
actually have a picture of it,

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:02.070
we can look at the
countra-parallelogram I guess,

01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:05.052
it forces the thing to work.

01:07:05.052 --> 01:07:07.010
So for example, suppose
we go from the midpoint

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:09.420
here to the midpoint there.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.690
That's going to stay parallel to
this segment and this segment.

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:15.040
It's like two parallelograms
joined together.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.060
Okay, and if you went
here, and then you

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:22.889
tried to go off into the
contra-parallelogram state,

01:07:22.889 --> 01:07:23.680
what would that do?

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.780
Well you'd have like from
the midpoint of this segment

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:29.350
to the midpoint of this segment.

01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:30.320
Holy cow.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.480
It's like they're right
on top of each other.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.355
So that's not going to
have the right length.

01:07:34.355 --> 01:07:37.210
Right now it's supposed to be
this length, same as the length

01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:39.040
a x.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.780
So if you try to jump
tracks you can't.

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:44.560
It's really easy to force
to stay on the parallelogram

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.060
track.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.260
And then six years
ago in this class

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.070
I posed, hey can we
do the same thing

01:07:52.070 --> 01:07:53.642
for the contra-parallelogram.

01:07:53.642 --> 01:07:55.850
Kapovich and Millson gave
some other very complicated

01:07:55.850 --> 01:07:56.980
solution.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:00.340
Turns out there's also
pretty easy way to fix

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:05.320
the contra-parallelogram, which
is you add this pinpoint set up

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.680
to be--- So these midpoints
will all be aligned

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.950
because it's a
contra-parallelogram.

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:11.900
You take the middle
and you bisect,

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:16.060
you put x far away, it would
be very far down there.

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:19.540
And you just make these
lengths be what they should be.

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.399
And it's not so
obvious but you can

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:24.160
prove that as the
contra-parallelogram moves,

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:27.398
these edges will all
have the same length.

01:08:27.398 --> 01:08:29.770
It works.

01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:35.700
Whereas if you try to go
into the parallelogram state,

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.240
and you measure
these links, they're

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.439
going to be really tiny.

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:40.300
Here they're really large.

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.960
Am I doing that right?

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.050
What am I measuring?

01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:45.500
No, the point is it's
not about those links.

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.979
These guys have to be co-linear
in the contra-parallelogram

01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:51.800
case, but they are not collinear
in the parallelogram case,

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.640
and this is essentially
forcing that co-linearity.

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:57.140
So I don't want to go into the
details of how that's proved,

01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.630
it's in the textbook.

01:08:58.630 --> 01:09:02.060
But this bracing will force it
to say contra-parallelogram,

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.580
that bracing will force
it to be a parallelogram,

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:06.529
and then we actually
have proofed

01:09:06.529 --> 01:09:09.030
Kempe's universality theorem,
with just a slight tweak

01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.920
to his proof.

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:15.770
So that's the bug and the fix.

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:18.430
Let me tell you some
generalizations,

01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:20.210
some open problems,
some applications.

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:32.069
Maybe start with
the obvious stuff

01:09:32.069 --> 01:09:37.990
which is something called
Weierstrass approximation

01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:57.750
theorem, which is that if you
have any continuous function,

01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:04.090
I should say let's
think of it as a curve,

01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:10.150
has an epsilon approximation
as a polynomial.

01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:17.530
OK, so in particular
what this tells

01:10:17.530 --> 01:10:19.790
us is if we have some
crazy curve we want

01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:24.830
to make, like signature,
then you can approximate it

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:29.670
by a polynomial of the form that
we analyzed, this [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:34.240
of x y equals 0.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.340
And the polynomial will
actually look like this,

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.040
It's a little bit
ugly, if you've ever

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.980
seen these constructions.

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:44.930
But it will be always within
an epsilon thickness of Eric,

01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:48.770
always Eric, never
any other curve.

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:51.310
All right so you can apply
this to make your signature

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:53.962
or make whatever crazy
curve you have in mind.

01:10:53.962 --> 01:10:54.795
That's kind of nice.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:59.765
So this is why you can sign
your name using polynomials.

01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:03.899
So that's an easy application.

01:11:03.899 --> 01:11:04.773
Some generalizations.

01:11:13.276 --> 01:11:14.260
All right.

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:20.340
You can do curves
in d dimensions.

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:22.520
We talked about two dimensions.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.130
You can generalize that.

01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:28.530
You can also do surfaces
in d dimensions.

01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:31.440
Basically if you want to specify
a curve in three dimensions,

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.820
you need two equations
to constrain it down

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.449
to a one dimensional thing.

01:11:37.449 --> 01:11:38.990
Generally you start
with d dimensions

01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:41.156
and you can remove however
many dimensions you want.

01:11:41.156 --> 01:11:42.710
You'll get some
subsurface in there.

01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:44.860
Just add a bunch of
polynomial constraints.

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.350
You can do that.

01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:49.520
Other fun facts.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.852
The number of edges you
need is about n to the d.

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:58.960
This is being careful
about reusing structure.

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.950
In the plane you can deal
with n squared edges.

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:03.050
And that's optimal.

01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:04.800
You can show you
need n squared edges

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.390
to construct certain
polynomials in the plane.

01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:13.560
In three dimensions you're
going to need more, turns out.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:15.540
Basically, because the
constructions we used

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:18.420
want to work in a plane, and
if you live in d dimensions,

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.040
you have to add lots
of edges to force

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.370
it to live in two dimensions.

01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:28.010
So you can do the computation,
add the numbers, and so on.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.398
What other good things?

01:12:30.398 --> 01:12:33.110
All right, for the
mathematicians,

01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:39.450
you can make any compact
semi algebraic set.

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.900
It's basically a
fancy way to say

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.435
you can add polynomial
constraints,

01:12:48.435 --> 01:12:51.610
but you can also take
unions of solution sets.

01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:53.530
So I could take the
union of five curves

01:12:53.530 --> 01:12:57.525
that I like, or I can take the
intersection of five curves

01:12:57.525 --> 01:12:59.030
that I like.

01:12:59.030 --> 01:13:00.990
Bunch of things
you can do, that's

01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:03.010
the meaning of semi
algebraic set, polynomials

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:04.135
and union and intersection.

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:12.800
These are all proved in paper
with Tim Avit and Reid Barton

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.230
from this class six years ago.

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:19.710
Another fun fact
from that paper is

01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:23.440
that it's coNP-hard
to test rigidity.

01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:30.930
Rigidity is the
topic of next class.

01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:33.460
You're given a linkage,
does it move it all?

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:34.950
And you can use
these constructions

01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:38.160
to mean, to show that something
will move at all if and only

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.440
if all these polynomials
have a solution.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:43.520
And that turns out
to be really hard.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.110
And it's something
called coNP-hard,

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:48.110
which is almost the
same as NP-hard.

01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:51.170
it's just for rigidity,
it's really easy

01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:53.530
to prove that something is
not rigid, you just move it.

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:56.020
It's a little harder to show
that it can't move in any way.

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:59.060
So that's for those who know
coNP, it's coNP, not NP.

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:02.570
Cool.

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:05.550
Those are various
generalizations.

01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:09.290
Big open problem
here is what if you

01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:11.639
forbid the edges from crossing.

01:14:11.639 --> 01:14:13.180
This actually came
up in lecture one.

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:13.950
Someone asked it.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:19.186
It was first posed that I know
from Don Shimamoto in 2004,

01:14:19.186 --> 01:14:20.980
I was giving a talk.

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:22.880
And all these
constructions, especially

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.110
the contra-parallelogram,
need to have

01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:27.247
edges that cross each other.

01:14:27.247 --> 01:14:28.830
Next class will also
be about the case

01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:30.210
where edges cross
each other but soon

01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:31.506
we are going to
enter the case where

01:14:31.506 --> 01:14:32.797
edges are not allowed to cross.

01:14:32.797 --> 01:14:34.650
Can you do any of
this stuff, construct

01:14:34.650 --> 01:14:36.500
any interesting polynomials?

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.820
Even constructing a straight
line, I think is open.

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:41.750
The peaucellier linkage
definitely doesn't work.

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:43.250
Maybe there are
some other linkages,

01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:44.570
we'd have to check them.

01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:47.190
But definitely Kempe's
universality result

01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:51.040
is open for non-crossing edges.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.814
I have some fun
projects like it'd

01:14:52.814 --> 01:14:54.230
be fun to implement
this algorithm

01:14:54.230 --> 01:14:56.277
and see this thing run.

01:14:56.277 --> 01:14:58.360
You could build a sculpture
out of Kempe linkages.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.170
They're a little
bit tedious I would

01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:02.810
say to make interesting curves,
but there's some cool ones.

01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:07.310
Like in the notes I have a
link to the letter C made out

01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:08.300
of a linkage.

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.860
You could do a whole
alphabet, be kind of fun.

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:12.810
Have these things cranking
around and spelling

01:15:12.810 --> 01:15:18.060
all sorts of, actually spelling
names would be the idea.

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:21.760
Another fun application that I
thought I would just throw in.

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.740
If you are, back to origami.

01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:27.660
Origami can in some
sense simulate linkages.

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.431
And the motivation for
this is you've, you

01:15:29.431 --> 01:15:31.930
know you've designed, you just
design all these awesome tree

01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:35.500
maker diagrams for
your problem set.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.660
And you realize, oh
man, there's points

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:39.730
all over the place on
this piece of paper.

01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:41.711
How the heck am I
going to find, if I

01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:43.460
had to make origami
diagrams, first I say,

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.800
oh you do this step, then
this step, then this step.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:50.490
How am I going to tell someone
oh, just fold to root 3 over

01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:54.780
7 comma root 5
plus root 7 over 4,

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.510
Which you could figure
out in some sense

01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:59.420
from those geometries what
all those coordinates are.

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:03.210
How do you tell
someone to fold there?

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:06.540
Well, you could
use a polynomial.

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:10.350
Could say oh, you've
got to construct root 5.

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:11.540
Or what's a tough one?

01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:20.440
Let's say you want to compute
the fifth root of 103.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.420
Is that prime?

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:23.250
I think so.

01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:25.660
So some nasty thing like this.

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:28.510
You say oh well, I
would really like

01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:31.890
x to the fifth to equal 103.

01:16:31.890 --> 01:16:34.330
If I could solve
this polynomial,

01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:36.509
then I could
construct this number.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:37.800
How do I solve that polynomial?

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.860
Well I'm all about solving
polynomials using linkages.

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:43.580
I could build a crazy
linkage device out

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.050
of my piece of paper.

01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:47.030
Don't try this at home, please.

01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:51.120
But in theory, you could come up
with these n really long bars,

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.260
fold them around, and
think of them as linkages.

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:58.740
And you tell people, oh well you
just need to align these dots,

01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:02.990
you may make little pinches on
at the ends of these things,

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:05.330
those simulate the
edges of your linkage.

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:08.350
And then you just tell people
to move these creases around

01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:11.640
until this point
lies on some line.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.250
And then you've solved
your polynomial.

01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:16.140
And this is a natural
generalization

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.790
in some sense to something
called origami axioms, which

01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:20.770
we will probably talk
about at some point.

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:22.850
Usually you think about
doing one fold at a time.

01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:24.985
You want to make one fold
so that this point maps

01:17:24.985 --> 01:17:27.110
onto this line, and this
point maps onto this line.

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:29.110
That's the typical
origami axiom.

01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.850
It's pretty good.

01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:31.980
It can trisect angles
and it can do fun things.

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:34.692
But it can really only
solve degree four equations.

01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:36.400
You want to solve a
degree five equation,

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.550
you need some higher
level techniques.

01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:40.840
And one way to do that is
with Kempe's universality.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.910
It's pretty impractical,
but at least in theory you

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:48.850
can do anything, you can
locate any point you want,

01:17:48.850 --> 01:17:50.820
any algebraic point,
which are the things you'd

01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:57.192
want from tree maker, using
this technique, little crazy.

01:17:57.192 --> 01:17:58.650
There are other
ways to do it, too.

01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:01.685
But this one way to do it,
as mentioned in the textbook.

01:18:01.685 --> 01:18:02.185
Questions.

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.642
All right.

01:18:06.642 --> 01:18:07.850
That's how to sign your name.

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:11.670
Next time we'll talk about
rigidity and other fun linkage

01:18:11.670 --> 01:18:13.220
problems.
