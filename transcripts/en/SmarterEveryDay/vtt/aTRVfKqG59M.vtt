Is it hitting the brick wall?

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.100

(Destin) We're not gonna set your house on fire this time? -no

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.150

We have a class 4 laser. We're in Holland, and this is Johan, and he's a

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.910
laser expert, guru, whatever you want to call it.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:24.680
Alright so,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.840
we're going to do a lesson on colours in Dutch, because I don't know them.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.810
You ready? -I'm ready
Alright, so. We're gonna turn the laser on high power first.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.200
-Ready?
Yep

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.390
-OK there we go.
OK, so

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.540

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.740
-Blauw
Blauw? -blauw

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.910

Rood, which is red? - ahuh

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.100
Did I say it right? [r-rolling attempts]
Rood.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.880
OK. Red balloon vs blue laser.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.480
[pop]

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.480
Easy.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.980
Next colour -Orange, or.. Oranje

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.980

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.840
Easy.
-Yellow, or Geel

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.020
Geel? -Geel
OK like hell? [pop] -Geel

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.210
That's a weird one.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.380
-Green or Groen.
Groen?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.560
OK. [pop] Alright. hm.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.720
-Turquoise was it?
Turquoise, yep.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.850
-Turkoois, in dutch.
OK. [pop]

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.040
Woah. Turquoise balloons are louder.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.220
-We have blue, or Blauw.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.270
-Let's see.
Aaah! [pop]

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.350
-Then we have

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.440
Here's one for you.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.610
What colour is this?
-black, or swart.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.780
[pop] Woo!
-and finally, white,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.970
-or, wit.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.170
OK.. What's going on here? We have a white balloon that's not popping

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.350
in the laser that popped every other colour. 
Would you like to explain laser guru?

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.530
-The white one scatters all the light, so it doesn't absorb the light, and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.730
-doesn't heat, and doesn't pop.
There you go. You're getting

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.910

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.460
-Let's pop the rest of the balloons with the laser, because we can.
Yes

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.570
[popping of balloons]

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.730
huh?!
 -This is a white one! [laugh]

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.910
This is too. I can't see with my laser goggle on.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.270
[music]

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.560
Hope you're getting Smarter Every Day. [pop]
What colour was it?! - [laughs]

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.750
-I squeezed it.
Oh did you? Alright, so

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.930
if you have any good ideas for Smarter Every Day go check out the Facebook page and tell us your idea.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.100
Bing! [laugh] Get it? Light bulb.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.290
Alright. Later. Have a good one.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.470
You've heard of sharks with laser

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.560
beams on their heads, but ah, come on down.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.670
The cool thing about that is the laser beam, not necessarily the shark, and even though there's shark week, we're gonna have laser month,

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.750
because that's way cool. Johan here has built this laser

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.900
It's a 445 nanometer, 3 watt, 3 diode

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.120
laser, and it is capable of burning about anything you put in it's

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.140
way, depending on it's colour. And, we are going to do laser month.
