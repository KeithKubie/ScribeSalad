If Isaac Newton is here today, he would say "Congratulations!"

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is not easy stuff and you're doing great.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, we're about to move into motion where things are actually accelerating.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If your mind is feeling a little exhausted, now is the great time to take a break,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
maybe go and try to push a shopping cart into a brick wall.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That being said, you should still come back soon because what we were about to cover

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
are some of the problems that I think are the most fun to solve in all of Physics.
