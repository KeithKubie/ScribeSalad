&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.960
&gt;&gt; Coming up next to the
stage we have a dynamic duo.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.950
They're already here joining
me on my left and my right.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.120
Travis Foster; give him
a round of applause.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.160 position:56%
[applause] He has been working as an
illustrator for more than 25 years

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.860
and he runs an illustration agency
that helps out other artists.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.410
Ethan Long, [applause]
he's an author

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.850
and an illustrator who's
worked on more than 85 books

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.640
and he's created the Disney Channel
series, "Tasty Time with ZeFronk."

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.930
Together they have teamed
up to create a picture book

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.180
with the title, "Give
Me Back My Book!"

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.810
Now, who here in this
room loves reading?

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.130
[cheering] All right, well then you
have a lot in common with the fun

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.180
and funny characters that are in
this book that they've created.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.350
After their talk you can
get books signed from 11

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.480

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.290 position:56%

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.590
[applause]

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.890
&gt;&gt; Ethan Long: Thank you!

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.640
Can you hear me?

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.940
Can you hear me?

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.240
&gt;&gt; Travis Foster: Can you hear me?

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.540
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.840
&gt;&gt; I can hear you.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.140
&gt;&gt; Barely.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughs]

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.740
&gt;&gt; So we're going to -- we
want to start out first by --

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.040
we're going on a bear hunt!

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.340
We're going --

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.640
&gt;&gt; On a bear hunt!

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.940
&gt;&gt; Oh, that was the
last presentation.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.530
&gt;&gt; Last presentation Ethan.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.470
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having
Travis and I today.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.770
My name is Ethan Long.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.180
I'm a children's book
author and illustrator.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.770
This is my friend.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.650
&gt;&gt; Travis Foster and
I'm Robin, he is Batman.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.950
[laughter]

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.250
&gt;&gt; I'm the quarterback.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.550
He's the writer's hubris.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.870
&gt;&gt; Wide receiver.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.170
&gt;&gt; What we came here to talk

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.640
about today is our funny
book, "Give Me Back My Book!"

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.050
How many of you guys like to read?

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.700
[cheering] How many of you
have read this book already?

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.000
&gt;&gt; Me!

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.300
&gt;&gt; [laughing] Chirp, chirp, chirp.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.600
&gt;&gt; Who said, "me"?

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.370
&gt;&gt; I know we're not Kate DiCamillo

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.850
but at least you can
know what our books are.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.150
[laughter]

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.090
&gt;&gt; I didn't know it
came out already though.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.780
&gt;&gt; It comes out next week but maybe
they were, you know walking around.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.250
&gt;&gt; September seventh.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.530
&gt;&gt; I called Travis -- I was --

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.030
&gt;&gt; He called me a knucklehead.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.330
&gt;&gt; I called you a knucklehead?

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.630
&gt;&gt; Knucklehead.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.930
But I was okay with that.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.230
&gt;&gt; [laughing] I called
Travis one day

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.170
because I was having trouble
coming up with some book concepts

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.010
and I thought I wanted to team
up with somebody to do a fun book

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.420
where one illustrator
would draw one character

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.190
and one illustrator would
draw the other character

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.520
and they would interact.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.820
So I thought that was a good idea.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.330 position:56%
So I called Travis up and he said --

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.630
&gt;&gt; I said, "Ethan is this a joke?

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.450
Because you're so great at drawing.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.750
Why are you calling me for?"

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.500
&gt;&gt; Shucks.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.300
[laughter] Well, this
guy is so talented.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.830
We've known each other
for a long time.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.280
We met in college back
in 19 -- in the 1980s.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.580
&gt;&gt; About the 1800s, yeah.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.930
&gt;&gt; Back in the 1880s.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 1880.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.040
&gt;&gt; And he got to be -- we've
gotten to be pretty good friends

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.780
over the years, good colleagues.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.080
So I thought he'd be a perfect fit.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.380
He's professional.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.680
He's fast.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.980
He's funny.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.280
&gt;&gt; And I'm good looking.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.580
[laughter]

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.880
&gt;&gt; I was going to say,
"He's funny -- looking."

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.180
&gt;&gt; Funny looking.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.480
Exactly.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.120
&gt;&gt; But how we wanted
to start today is sort

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.750
of starting a little different
than how it's actually playing out,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.410 position:56%
but what we want to do is we would
like to draw the characters for you.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.420
Travis is going to start
first and tell us a little bit

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.910
about his character, Redd.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.070
And then I'm going to
draw a little bit about --

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.440
and talk a little bit
about my character, Bloo.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.570
And then we are going
to read the book.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.720
And then we have a special
surprise at the end,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.330
if you're ready for that.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.160
Everybody ready for this?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.470
[cheering] Take it away Travis!

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.990
&gt;&gt; Okay, so man I've been
drawing ever since I was like this

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.360
and I would get in trouble
in class when I was supposed

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.310
to be doing my math or
history or geography.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.800
I was drawing in the book.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.870 position:56%
So getting to make a living drawing
pictures is absolutely my dream job.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.890
So they asked you before,
"Who likes to read?"

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.420
Is there anybody out
here that likes to draw?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.330 position:56%
I like to see those hands because --

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.630
anyway, we'll talk
about that in a minute.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:12.320
So my character is Redd and I'm
going to start with his blue nose.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.570
So I'm going to start
with the blue nose.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.750
&gt;&gt; It's too big.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.530
&gt;&gt; It is too big.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.970
All right, then we're
going to just do the eyes.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.620
&gt;&gt; Those are cute.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah, five teeth
on this character

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.590
and he can chew his food pretty
good with those five teeth.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.890
&gt;&gt; Wow!

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.040
&gt;&gt; Smile, tongue, and
my character happens

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.340
to have a little bit of hair.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.640
So I start --

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.940
&gt;&gt; Hey!

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.390
&gt;&gt; Hey! All right, and he's
fuzzy kind of all over.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.680
So I just put fuzzy all over.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.120
Now, it's interesting because
my character has big arms

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.970
like a gorilla and tiny
legs like a chicken.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.270
So let's start with the arms.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.120
And even on the arms we
have a little bit of hair.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.540
What kind of stuff could
he possibly be holding?

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.840 position:56%
I don't have any idea what he likes.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.140
And so --

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.440
&gt;&gt; That looks a little
like a hedgehog.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.260
&gt;&gt; Well, it -- we know it's
going to be Redd when we're done.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.560
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.860
&gt;&gt; Hedgehog -- Redd.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.700
All right, so then let's go ahead
and add his legs, some socks.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.070
He's got white socks on and a shoe.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.280
We'll do the other leg, sock, shoe.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.460
Let's go ahead and have him holding
-- you know, I tell you what,

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.090
I'm feeling like an ice cream cone.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.390
&gt;&gt; Wow!

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.490
&gt;&gt; All right, and then let's
go ahead and do his big glasses

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.120
because my character has glasses.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.420
Ethan, you have glasses, but --

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, your glasses are
better than my glasses.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.620
&gt;&gt; Big glasses make it
easier to read with.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.990
And then we'll connect the
character and there is Redd.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.290
&gt;&gt; What do you think kids?

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.090
&gt;&gt; That's done.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.040
[ Cheering ]

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.340
Not too bad.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.640
Not too shabby.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.940
&gt;&gt; That is excellent.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.240
That's amazing.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.540
What I forgot to show
you is -- we wanted to --

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.840
when I said we kind of -- you
know you plan these things

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.210
and then you actually get up here

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.370
and you start talking
and you forget stuff.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.570
So what we planned to talk
about was when we were kids,

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.720
how we drew all the time and
how, you know we loved --

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.450
he had friends, I had
bowties, and we just decided,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.140
you know turn it into a business.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.600
&gt;&gt; And he still has
the nice red bowtie.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.060
&gt;&gt; It's not the same
one, but I started young.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.280
This is the original drawing
that Travis sent me originally

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.630
when we first started
about talking --

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.540
when we first started about talking
about this project he sent me this.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.840
And I was like, "Wow!

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.140
That's cool!"

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.460
And then I sent him that
and he said, "Oh, wow!

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.760
That's cool!"

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.120
And then I sent him that.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.260
He said -- well, he said, "What
are we going to have them do?"

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.370
And I said, "Why don't we just
have them, you know arguing

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.300
over a book or something?"

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.460
So I sent him that.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.600
Well, as the process goes you
start working with your editors.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.360
You start working with
your art directors.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.140
You start working with
your publishers.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.440
Things change.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.740
You start streamlining the idea.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.040
It turns into this.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.340
This is what it's turned into.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.810
And when you buy the book
today -- for how much Travis?

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.140
17.99?

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.440
&gt;&gt; 16.99.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.920
&gt;&gt; 16.99? You'll see that the
characters have changed a lot.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.510
Now, as Travis colors his
-- are you about done sir?

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.810
&gt;&gt; I am done.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.800
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'm going to go ahead
and draw my character, Bloo.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.710
&gt;&gt; Now, one of the things you've
got to understand about me

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.280
and Ethan is opposites attract.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.410
And Ethan and I --
he's fast, I'm slow.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.480
So it might have taken me three
or four minutes -- Ethan's quick.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.780
So --

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.080
&gt;&gt; I went to visit
Travis in Nashville

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.380
and he took me out in the car.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.680
We went for lunch.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.980
Oh, my gosh.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.850
I was sitting in the passenger
seat going, "Oh, my God!

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.150
Speed up brother!"

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.450
&gt;&gt; I'm too slow.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.750
Driving too slow.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.050
&gt;&gt; Speed up!

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.410
So, my character, Bloo --

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.260
I draw lots of different
characters over the years.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.110
This one I wanted to stay as simple
as possible and I wanted it to stay

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.790
as -- I wanted it to
be opposite of his.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.130
His was fuzzy with glasses.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.770
He didn't have any ears.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.240
His nose was vertical.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.110
He had this furry body
with footwear and socks.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.370 position:56%
He had this fancy character and I
said, "I just want something simple.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.520
I just want the simplest
possible shape that I can draw."

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.340
And I figured the best
possible shape

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.780
that I could draw was just
like a jellybean shape.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.080
&gt;&gt; Very nice.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.380
&gt;&gt; So, yeah.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.680
It was very clean.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.980
Kind of an egg, kind
of a birth of the --

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.140
this is kind of the
birth of the character.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.110
I then decided that --

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.210
I said, "Well, what kind of
a character could this be?"

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.920 position:56%
And I said, "Well, I have this -- ."

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.850
I said, "I'll just draw some ears."

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:07.100 position:56%
And I just went -- [swooping nose]
[drooping noise] From there I decide

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:11.150
to put a nose on him because
the noses are important.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.780
They're important for smelling.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.080
[sniffing noise] They're important

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.100
for putting it into
someone's business.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.540
[laughter] They're
important for a lot of things.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.390
So I wanted to make
sure that he had a nose.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.490
The correct nose.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.430
What I also did was
I flipped the colors.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.880
I took Travis's red
color, flipped it.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.150
I made the nose red
and the body blue,

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.970
rather than the body
red and the nose blue.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.610
I got a little -- I put a
little highlight on the nose

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.080
to make it look shiny and dewy.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.380
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.680
&gt;&gt; It's all dewy.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:49.100
Then I decided to -- well,
every jellybean needs arms.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.400
So --

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.120
So how fast I did that?

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.920
He could never do that.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.220
&gt;&gt; Slow.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.520
&gt;&gt; He could never do that.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:14.570
Then, for me it's all about
the emotion of the character.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.780
It's all about the
action, the body language.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.910
Travis does ice cream
cones and stuff.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.870
I'm thinking about deeper things.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.170
&gt;&gt; Deeper life.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.470
&gt;&gt; Deeper, Travis.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, deeper.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.070
So where are the eyes?

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.370
&gt;&gt; So I'll get there.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.670
I'll get there.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.040
[laughter] So --

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.580
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.930
&gt;&gt; Oh! He has a tongue.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.990
&gt;&gt; Looking good.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.290
&gt;&gt; Thanks Trav.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.360
And then the eyes.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.020
So the eyes are very
important to me.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.260
Most of the characters that I draw
have a little twinkle in them.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.360
You can see in Bloo on the screen,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.210
he's got a little twinkle
in his eye.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.970
So I try to leave that
same twinkle in their eye.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.500
&gt;&gt; Very nice.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.800
Looking good.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.100
&gt;&gt; How much time Trav?

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.400
How much time?

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.700
&gt;&gt; Looking good.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.000
&gt;&gt; How much time?

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.340
Ten minutes!

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.640
Good.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.940
&gt;&gt; We're 10 minutes in and
we have 10 minutes left.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.240
&gt;&gt; We have plenty of time.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.830
&gt;&gt; Ten minutes in.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.130
&gt;&gt; So that was essentially Bloo.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.430
Oh, and then every rabbit --

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.040
jellybean rabbit --
has to have a tail.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.890
And that was essentially
the beginning

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.110 position:56%
of this beautiful friendship that we
have, this beautiful collaboration.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.630
What we did from there is we turned
these characters into a story.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.680
So my job with our team
is to come up with a story

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.950
and write the storyline,
write the plot.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.620
I did that.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.380
I typed it out, sent it to Travis.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.540
We didn't think too much
in this process did we?

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.840
&gt;&gt; No.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.140
&gt;&gt; No. We didn't sit
and think about stuff.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.650
We just did it and sent it.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:01.880
When I sent it to Travis what he
did is he laid out the whole book.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.820
And as we read it you'll see
what Travis did with the layouts.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.410
&gt;&gt; We're going to read
the book for [inaudible]?

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.710
&gt;&gt; The action.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.520
Yeah, the action, the pacing.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.580
I tweaked it here and there,
but Travis did the layouts.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.010
So maybe we should read now
and show you the layouts.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.440
That would be great.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.830
&gt;&gt; We're actually going to -- ?

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.280
&gt;&gt; We're going to read.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.580
Yeah.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.880
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.220
&gt;&gt; Okay. Just for the record,
I always take off the cover

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.970
because it gets in the way.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.620
&gt;&gt; This one's [inaudible].

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.920
&gt;&gt; Because I'm OCD.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.220
&gt;&gt; Whoa! This one's glued in man.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.820
&gt;&gt; We got another one?

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.210
Look, I can keep my cover on.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.510
&gt;&gt; You can do that?

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can do that.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.110
&gt;&gt; How do you do that?

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.410
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.710
[inaudible] Never mind.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.010
I got it.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.310
&gt;&gt; [sighs] Okay.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.610
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.910
&gt;&gt; Are you ready?

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.210
&gt;&gt; I'm ready.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.510
&gt;&gt; You got it?

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.810
&gt;&gt; I got it.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.110
&gt;&gt; I'm going to try to
read and click the thing.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.410
I know, it's tough.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.710
I live a tough life man.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.010
Okay?

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.630
&gt;&gt; Pat stomach, rub head?

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.930
&gt;&gt; I rub my head too much.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.230
[laughter] Okay.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.950
You start.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.250
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.950
&gt;&gt; No, start with the cover.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.250
Dude!

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.550
&gt;&gt; Oh!

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.850
&gt;&gt; Dude!

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.830
&gt;&gt; "Give Me Back My Book!"

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.240
&gt;&gt; By?

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.540
&gt;&gt; Travis Foster.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.840
&gt;&gt; And Ethan Long.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.100
&gt;&gt; There you go.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.820
All right.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.250
&gt;&gt; Hey, wait a second Redd.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.660
That's my book!

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.880
&gt;&gt; I beg your pardon Bloo,
but this book is mine.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.390
&gt;&gt; No! My book is green
and has lots of pages.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:45.000
I'm 100 percent sure
that is my book!

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.300
&gt;&gt; Well, as you can see,
I have a green book too.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.970
It has many pages, about
as many as yours I suppose.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.480
&gt;&gt; I want my book!

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.190
&gt;&gt; Then go find it.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.970
&gt;&gt; Oh, I found it right there!

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I cannot part with my green book.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:23.630
It has a hard cover, a nice spine,
the pages turn from right to left,

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:29.290
and if you are adventurous,
from left to right.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.820
There are letters on each page
and they are gathered together

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:38.050
to form words that have
meaning when you read them.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.910
&gt;&gt; All books do that!

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.010
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:50.670 position:56%
But my book has a table of contents,
funny little things called chapters,

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:55.310
and every now and again there's
something called an illustration.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.710
&gt;&gt; Mine has all of those things.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.780
&gt;&gt; Wait, does yours
have a bent page?

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:08.440
&gt;&gt; Yes, I bent that page!

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.610
&gt;&gt; Well, you shouldn't have.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.060
&gt;&gt; Aha! It is my book!

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.370
&gt;&gt; It is mine now.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.700
&gt;&gt; No, it's mine!

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.000
&gt;&gt; Give it to me!

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.300
&gt;&gt; Let it go!

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.600
&gt;&gt; I mean it.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.900
Let go!

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.200
&gt;&gt; Get your hands off it!

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.500
&gt;&gt; It is my book!

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.800
&gt;&gt; Give me back my book!

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.100
We probably missed a couple there.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.680
&gt;&gt; That's okay.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.390
Much grace.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.690
&gt;&gt; Ha!

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:32.990
&gt;&gt; Good voice.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.290
&gt;&gt; You like that one?

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.590
&gt;&gt; I like that.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:36.890
&gt;&gt; Ha!

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:38.190
&gt;&gt; That's good.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.490
Get back here bookworm!

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:40.970
&gt;&gt; Bring back that book!

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.270
&gt;&gt; She's fast.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.570
&gt;&gt; Hold on.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:44.870
Hold on. I might have skipped.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.170
&gt;&gt; No.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.590
&gt;&gt; They need to soak that in.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:49.890
&gt;&gt; What did we miss?

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.190
&gt;&gt; I missed it.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:52.560
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.860
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.160
&gt;&gt; Where are we?

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.460
&gt;&gt; We're right there.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.760
&gt;&gt; Oh, look at that picture.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.060
That's nice.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.360
Look at that screen.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.640
&gt;&gt; [laughing] This is my book.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.940
You like that one?

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.420
Want me to do it again?

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.720
This is my book.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.360
&gt;&gt; [whispering noises] Uh oh.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.240
Here, let me see.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.840
I'll connect it.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.830
[laughter] Are you on?

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.130
&gt;&gt; Yes. Am I?

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.430
&gt;&gt; You're on.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.730
&gt;&gt; Okay. Let's do it!

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.030
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:37.710
You got to watch these cords man.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.500
&gt;&gt; I know, I'm going
to put mine up here.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.450
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.080
&gt;&gt; This will make the perfect bait.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.380
&gt;&gt; Wait, you got to move forward.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.680
&gt;&gt; I know.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.980
I'm doing too many
things at once Trav.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.280
&gt;&gt; Come on man.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.580
[inaudible]

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.880
&gt;&gt; I'm good.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.180
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.480
Yes -- why don't you
start over on that one.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.780
&gt;&gt; [disappointed noise] Okay.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.380
&gt;&gt; This will make the perfect bait!

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:02.190
&gt;&gt; Yes. The cover, the spine and
pages will be hard to resist.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:08.180
The letters will be too
beautiful to look away from.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.490
&gt;&gt; The words will blow her mind.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.610
&gt;&gt; She'll adore the
table of contents.

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:18.480
She'll drool over the chapters.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.800
&gt;&gt; The illustrations will
make her eyes explode!

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.280
&gt;&gt; [uncertain noise]
Is that a bit page.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:34.300
Oh my. [laughter] Thank you.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.150
&gt;&gt; Thanks mom.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.510
&gt;&gt; Wow! This is such a great book!

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.810
&gt;&gt; Oh, such suspense.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.110
It may be the best book ever.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.870
That sounds like an amazing book.

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:50.080
I'll trade you this
book for that book.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.690
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't know.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:56.130
This is a pretty great book.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.430
&gt;&gt; Just a little disclaimer;

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:01.380
this shift of voices
might blow my larynx out.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:07.740
So just be prepared for
meds to come -- medical.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.040
&gt;&gt; Medics.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.340

wait to read our book!

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.690
&gt;&gt; Did we say, "Our book?"

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.060
&gt;&gt; Yes, I think we did.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:39.350
&gt;&gt; Our green book with the
cover in letters and words?

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.920
&gt;&gt; And that silly bent page.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.660
&gt;&gt; [laughing] I can't
pick you up Ethan.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.820
I -- [laughing] I can't
-- I don't know.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:52.730
I can't pick you up man.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.280
I love our book.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.080
&gt;&gt; Me too.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:03.130
[ Cheering ]

Hey! Those are my glasses.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:07.230
&gt;&gt; You don't wear glasses.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.340
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.720
The end.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.520
&gt;&gt; One more thing.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.040
[ Applause ]

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.980

&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.580
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.880
[cheering] Okay.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.140
[applause] I was just told
that we have five minutes left.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.580
&gt;&gt; Five minutes left?

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.880
&gt;&gt; Five minutes left.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.500
Tell them what we're
going to do Trav.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.800
&gt;&gt; What are we going to do?

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tell them what we're going to do.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.240

draw raise one hand.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:42.510
And if you love to read
raise the other hand.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:47.100
And if you think you might
want to come up on the stage

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.620
and draw your favorite character

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.300
in two minutes then stand
up and raise both hands.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.600
Stand up.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.340
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.070
&gt;&gt; We don't want that pressure.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.770
&gt;&gt; You might want to take your --

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.070

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.820
Hi. Lauren.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.120
Do you want more than one
color or would you just

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.420
like black and blue maybe or -- ?

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.720
&gt;&gt; I'm going to make
the [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; I don't have a red.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.620
I just -- I need a blue.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.370
&gt;&gt; Okay. Do you have the red
marker over there somewhere?

&gt;&gt; Now, any character
you want in two minutes.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.130
All right, so when
are we going to start?

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.670
[yelling] Go ahead and take your

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.110
with the tops off if you want.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.300
So you can have them.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.280
All right, Ethan.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.710

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.020

&gt;&gt; Lauren.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.630
This is Lauren.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:15.930
Everybody give a round of
applause for our brave artists.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.570

&gt;&gt; Brave.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.170
&gt;&gt; Brave. Very courageous.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.740
&gt;&gt; To come up here and
draw -- this is fantastic.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.330
&gt;&gt; What we'd like you to do --

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.890
&gt;&gt; We've got two minutes for
them to draw their favorite --

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.160
&gt;&gt; Yes. Does anyone
have a stopwatch?

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.590
Do you have a stopwatch?

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.940
Everybody's got a phone.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.240
Two minutes.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.540
&gt;&gt; Two minutes.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.980
&gt;&gt; Okay, what we'd like
you to do is you don't have

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.350
to draw our characters, although
it's legally required of you.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.650
No, you can draw whatever
you'd like.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.950
&gt;&gt; Any character you want.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You can draw whatever
character's your favorite character,

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.370
but you have two minutes.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.670
This is how we work.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.280
We work on a time clock.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.100
So we would like you to draw your
favorite character in two minutes.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.400
You think you can do it?

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.700
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.000
&gt;&gt; You think you can do it?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.300
&gt;&gt; Is the timer ready?

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.600
&gt;&gt; Do it. Timer ready.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.900
&gt;&gt; Go.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.200
&gt;&gt; Go!

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.500
&gt;&gt; All right, they've
got two minutes.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.800
Now --

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.100
&gt;&gt; My girl's winning.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.400
[laughter]

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.700
&gt;&gt; My girl is doing fantastic.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.450
If you like to read and you like
to draw and you like people to read

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:16.320 position:56%
to you then it might be someday at
some point, and it doesn't even have

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.030
to be that long, you can
start writing your own books

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.370
and illustrating your own books.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.820
And with today's technology, with
-- you can print one book at a time

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.460
for like 20 bucks and I encourage
anybody that has that desire

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.390
to go ahead and start
and practice and do it.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.690
It's like anything else.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.520
Like if you're good at the
violin you have to practice.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.800
Or piano. Just make books and
share those books with your friends

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.610
and family because you never know.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.700
I mean the next thing you
know Ethan might call you

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:49.500
and ask you to do a book with him.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.800

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.100
&gt;&gt; He might.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.400
It might happen.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.700
I was super surprised
when he called me.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.260

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.560
Less than two minutes.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.160
