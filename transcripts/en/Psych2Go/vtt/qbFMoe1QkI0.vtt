Hey everyone. My name is Melissa,

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.520
and the article I'm going to be discussing today is "Breast Implants: the emotional journey behind them."

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.760
We're surrounded by the idea that woman have to have large breasts, a large booty and a small waist

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.540
in order to be considered beautiful. In a environment like this, does having small breasts

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.040
make someone feel less feminine?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.140
Breast implants are becoming more and more common. In fact, according to

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.740
the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, breast augmentation is top plastic surgery performed today.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.620
A total of three-hundred-thousand (3.000.000) American woman recieved breast implants in 2011 alone.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.460
Now, breast implants has been proven positive for the majority of women who recieve them,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.560
they feel an increase in self-esteem, in positive body image, and in sexual satisfaction.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.780
However, it has also proven to futher deepen more serious psychological problems,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.100
like body dysmorphic disorder and depression. Woman who are planning to have breast augmentation perform

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.140
need to step into the surgery with realistic expectations, and the realization that having breast implants put in

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.100
won't magically make them feel better about themselves. If they have more serious body issues,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.700
they need to sort those out before they get surgery. As David Wellisch, a professor of psycholigy in UCLA says:

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.340
"Many woman I've encountered simply aren't happy with their bodies and wish to improve them.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.500
They have realistic expectations that if this is done, they will look more satisfying to their own eyes and others,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.700
but their self-esteem does not depend on it."

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.220
While breast implants do help woman feel better about their bodies, it's important that a woman's self-esteem

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.900
does not depend on her cup size. A study of 24.600 woman, conducted by researchers from

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.560
Université Laval Faculté de médecine, the Canadian public health agency, and Cancer Care Ontario

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.400
found that the suicide rate among woman women with breast implants

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.360
is 73% higher than in the general population. General consensus seems to be that

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.920
if you are going to have breast implants put in, you need to love yourself before going into the surgery.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.360
If you are unhappy with your body in general, you may want to take a step back and look in the mirror

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.600
before deciding whether or not breast augmentation is really the right option for you.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.000
Now, while the studies that have been conducted are helpful, it's important to know

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.720
that only 24.600 woman were serveid, and considering that over 300.000 recieve breast implants in 2011 alone,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.440
24.600 is a really small number compared to the whole population of woman who recieve breast implants.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.000
So, the results that they got from that study could be slightly screwed

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
just because they had a rather small number. Still, the numbers are something we don't wanna ignore,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.120
and if anything, we need to supportive of woman who are having problems with their body image,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.560
whether or not they recieved breast implants. So, what do you guys think?

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.920
Has anybody you know ever recieved breast implants? Are breast implants positive for our society,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.240
or are they only creating more body issues for woman who have and haven't recieved them?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.320
