00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.490
in Hemispheres from one until two. If you
are using your laptops, just please be mindful

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.090
that you're not typing very loud and please
silence your cell phones everyone. At the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.049
end of the talk, you'll be able to ask questions
at the standing mikes on the side, this is

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.460
for YouTube, so just please make sure that
you speak clearly so she would understand

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.519
your questions. That said, please join me
in welcoming Bethenny Frankel.

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:37.530
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Hi. Okay, first of all, the only
one who looks like she works here is my assistant,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.360
Molly, with like cargo pants and a sweatshirt.
What the hell is up with all that Alice and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.321
Olivia dresses and all the girls. You don't
understand that I'm more scared to be here

00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:48.609
than like when I was talking with Ted Turner
at NYU because I'm like people are standing

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:53.270
in the hall holding computers while they're
standing up. They're not even on a desk, this

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.259
is psychotic. I don't even how to Twatter
or Twitter or whatever, this is fucked up.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.500
I thought, I'm not kidding. And first of all,
you guys like have like M&amp;Ms flowing. You

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.369
guys are all hopped up on chocolate, you can't
have Skinnygirl Margaritas in the middle of

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.060
the day? I mean, it's five o'clock somewhere,
so this is like a very big learning experience

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.810
for me. And who are these three nerds somewhere
else that are watching, look at them. Come

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.750
here. Hi. He's like, oh, my God. Hi. Hi. Hi.
Do they work for Pixar or they just like obsessed

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.900
with Pixar? I'm not even kidding, I am so
excited. And, does everybody Google each other

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.740
at their desks, by the way? Does everybody--let
me find any other information about each while

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.709
you're at your desk like Googleing each other?
Or is like all canceled each other out there

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.189
and there's something else that you do? Like
nerdy spies coming down the hall. All right.

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:52.260
I am at Google and here we are. So, anyway,
who hates Kelly Bensimon just like star--no

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.280
offense, I just like to talk about really
important things. I do happen to have written

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.739
a book, but I know that no one gives a shit
about that even though it has been on the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.709
New York Times bestsellers for 18 weeks but
we can talk about that after; we can gossip

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.070
about the show. I look like a bigger nerd
than anyone here. Look at me in my--yeah,

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.579
whatever. All right, the next time, I'm coming
in a stripper's outfit because I didn't get

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.629
it, I understand. Hi. Hi. He looks like the
perfect customer to be carrying my book. Have

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:28.599
you unleashed your Skinnygirl? You don't,
you're in the process of unleashing your Skinnygirl.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:34.360
Right. All right. So--what are you guys doing
on the computers, are you taking notes? Or,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.280
video--what's happen--seriously, what is happening
with the computers in here? What? You could--oh,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.180
that's why they feed you all day, you can't
leave, you have to work while you're in these

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.379
meetings. Honestly, I didn't know if it was
like some sort of like, like, like what a

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.740
breakfast in bed thing, just leaning things
on it. All right. Okay, and Molly and most

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.069
of the Mac people, so you should happy. All
right. So, who wants to gossip about the show

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.959
first? Questions about the show, that's open
for complete discussion, anybody?

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.040
&gt;&gt; Are you going back for the next season?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: I am coming back for the next

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.420
season. I'll be back in September. I will
not be the single girl anymore, I have a boyfriend

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:22.000
so, finally. [INDISTINCT]. Yes, who is he?
He's name is Jason, Jason 2, we call him Jason

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.180
Sequel. Yes. As, Lori, my publicist likes
to say, the only Jason I haven't slept with

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.300
is the one from Friday the 13th because he's
a little scary but, the night is young. Yeah.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.940
I don't, I literally dated four Jasones since
Jason. If anyone's name is Jason here, pull

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.789
your pants down. I'm just saying because it
could happen at Google. All right. So, that's

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:49.470
that. Any other inappropriate questions--oh,
hopefully, no one has any problem with inappropriate

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.130
that's usually the disclaimer in the beginning
and there's no small children here so that

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.680
I know is fine. So, if anyone has any problem
with inappropriateness, please, there's the

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.410
Google door. Questions? About the show--we
can talk about the book after.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.810
&gt;&gt; If Kelly is crazy, she'd beat you [INDISTINCT]?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Yeah, well, I mean, I've only

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.639
ever spent time with her when you've seen
it on the show. Yeah, I think there's something

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.560
at, very, very wrong with her. I do think
she's missing a part of her brain like I'm

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.360
not even--I think there's something wrong
with her. She's just not playing with a full

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.780
deck. So, and she tries to like, I'm just
like, don't, don't do it. Don't listen, this

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.091
mouth is like fire. Don't, don't, just let's
not talk because if you speak to me and you

00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:34.099
try to be smart and you try to make people
like you, it's not going work, so, she's a

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.210
total, see you next Tuesday.
&gt;&gt; Who are you most in touch with in the show?

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:45.340
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: I'm the most in touch with Jill,
I'd say. Jill and I have had a relationship

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.480
the whole entire time. I'm not that--I think
Kelly is my best friend this season. I'm not

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.080
that in touch with anybody. I mean, I've been
working. I've been on the book tour and the

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.580
truth is--it's very toxic. It's extremely
toxic and stressful because you know me laying

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.590
in my bed, sleeping isn't exactly interesting,
so they want to see like, if you took any

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.080
six girls in any high school, in any town,
anywhere, it would be a cat fighting and I'm

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.630
not really that kind of girly-girl. I do Skinnygirl
Margaritas by myself at home. Not really out

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.030
with like many girl, I'm not that girl. So,
it's been challenging, it's been difficult

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.020
and the first season having a boyfriend who
wanted no part of it and then, you know, subsequently

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.759
getting him fired was a little stressful.
So, you know, maybe Jason 2 will keep his

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.500
job. But the show's, you know, it's been the
best thing I've ever done in my entire life.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.539
I didn't want to do it in the beginning, I
turned it down for two months and they'd already

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.060
been shooting and I kept sort of thinking
about it and it was like a gamble because

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.550
the show then was called Manhattan Moms. I
didn't know what it was going to be. I thought,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.360
you know, everyone be just drunk with like
tassels on their titties, standing, dancing

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.979
and my career would be ruined because I have
just started with a Health Magazine and Pepperidge

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:56.629
Farm, so. And I had already written my book
but not gotten it published; so I was very

00:06:56.629 --> 00:07:00.010
nervous, and now, I mean, it was the best
thing I ever did, it really was. It was like,

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.259
it was like a complete launching pad so, and
got laughs. So, that's that part of it.

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:02.259
&gt;&gt; How much of what we see is influenced by
the producers and writers versus what you

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:13.350
guys want to represent?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Well, it's funny. The--I know

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:19.629
I always make a food analogy, but like people
will say like I don't like greens or I don't

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:21.680
like lettuce and there's a rugula and there's
iceberg, there's a million different types,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.639
that's the same thing with reality shows.
I can see when I'm watching The Hills that

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:30.759
that is completely like there are people with
earpieces telling them what to do. Our show,

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:35.520
as real as it can be with the exception of
where we're shooting like, if I wanted to

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.520
shoot today, I'm going to be at Google, they
might, they probably won't let, well, you

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.139
know, Big Brother around here, you definitely
wouldn't--they definitely wouldn't let me.

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:45.240
But, but, so, I'll be like I want to go, we're
going on a date to Le Cirque and I'll be like

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.229
we can't shoot there so you have to go, you
know, Joaquain's Mexican Restaurant or whatever.

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:53.690
And so, that, but what happens there, they'll
also might be like we want to see, you know,

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.960
we want to hear about what happened with you
and Jason last week. You know, with the domestic

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.520
violence argument, I'm just kidding. So, then
we'll start talking about it, but if whatever

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.789
comes out of our mouths really does come out
of our mouths. I mean, I could see at Atlanta

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:10.870
and these other shows which are different
production companies, they do a lot for the

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:16.220
drama. They do, I mean, I really don't think
that woman would have put that table on Jersey,

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:22.760
had it not been dramatic. But, it all did
really happen, no and said flip the table,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.500
so there are shows really real. Oh, no, she's
a producer, oh, you said, writers?

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.919
&gt;&gt; For both, yeah.
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Oh, no one's writing anything.

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:34.460
No, could you write this stuff, no one's writing
anything. No one's writing anything. Oh, no.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:38.849
They, they just, you know, you find crazy
people, I mean, myself included. You find

00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:44.250
crazy people and you put six crazy people
together and crazy things will happen. And

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:51.560
people get--I'm, you know, hmmm, I act exactly
like myself and I always tell like it is.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:58.040
I mean, would I have loved to have slapped
the shit out of Kelly, I would have. It would

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:08.720
have been fun just to be like, you know what,
don't fuck yourself you self-involved star

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:20.930
fucking bitch. But I didn't say that because
somewhere in the back of my head I know what's

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:40.430
going on and I now building a brand and I
know

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:58.430
I have a New York Time best seller that's
going to come out and so, you know, a little

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:05.780
bit, I would love to rip someone's weave off,
you know. I would, I would, I mean, I really

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:12.670
but I had it in my life but I would like to
do it but I mean there are some resemblance

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:22.260
of order that I feel like I need to maintain,
but that's within life too. I'd love to rip

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:30.399
someone weave off in a book signing when they,
they're like a stalker crazy person but I

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:36.520
don't do that either and the cameras aren't
on so, that's security.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:42.899
&gt;&gt; Two things that you have mentioned, yeah,
finding crazy, the six crazy, you know, or

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:49.370
whatever, how did they find you all?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: And also when I say six... I'm

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.610
sorry.
&gt;&gt; Do you think--is that when you get in,

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:59.769
do you watch other reality shows [INDISTINCT]?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Yes. I love Atlanta more than

00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:04.560
our show. I mean, did anybody see the last
show where they fight [ph]? Round check me,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:12.380
boo. I mean, that was crazy. I mean, I want
to be in their show but I also want to be--listen,

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.740
they'll all be like, you are a racist because
I'll be like, yeah, who, I'm working my weave

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:22.709
even though I don't have a weave but I like
saying it, I think it's funny. Why a white

00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:27.720
woman can't say "working my weave?" but I
do anyway. I want to be in Atlanta. I want

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.210
to be like, I'm going go get pooky and I'm
coming over and whup your ass. I mean, that

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:40.180
is not something a white woman says and I
want to be in that show. So, yes, I watch

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:46.330
them all and I blog and they're all scared
of what I'm going to say because I rip them

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:51.660
new ones, and I love it. I love to blog. They
picked us also by saying six crazy women and

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:58.670
if I took any six of you and mixed you up,
you guys would all kill each other and talk

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:03.079
about each other, everything. It's just like
that movie: "Liar, Liar" with Jim--who is

00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:12.220
it, Jim Carrey? This guy, say what you want,
what would you think, you know? I'm like Ramona,

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:19.410
you are bat shit crazy, I wouldn't say that
if I were a normal friend in normal life and

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:24.310
I was like in her wedding party. That's a
beautiful wedding dress, I love this bridesmaids

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:30.280
dress. But on the show it's like that is disgusting.
So you kind of say a little more, but they

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.970
found--everybody, mostly in the Hamptons,
it's funny, most people I know have met their

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:43.810
husbands in the Hamptons and they found us
in the Hamptons and I was a complete happy

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:50.579
accident to them. They wanted a wife, they
wanted someone who had kids and this is totally

00:12:50.579 --> 00:12:55.170
not kosher when a producer would hang out
with one of the castmates. So they, one of

00:12:55.170 --> 00:13:05.110
them, Jill, they had already found and they
were like we are screwed because this wasn't,

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:12.279
this was called Manhattan Moms. The show wasn't
a success and it had no budget. They were

00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:17.399
going to get pulled, and Bravo wanted to pick
Housewife so the producer, we have to find

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:22.470
a housewife and Jill said, well, that'd [INDISTINCT],
it's going to [INDISTINCT] hands, it's a [INDISTINCT]

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.360
find somebody there and I was there, and I
have a boyfriend, I have no kids, I'm the

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.950
farthest thing from a housewife which is what
they wanted and Jill saw me, she's like, "Oh,

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:42.300
my God, you skinny bitch. I'm doing a show;
you have to meet the producers." And, I met

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:50.680
the producers and it was like they just asked
me if they could take me which they did and

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.740
then I said, no, and then two months later,
they still hadn't found the person. So, for

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.980
me, I wasn't even supposed to be at [INDISTINCT]
that day, it was completely really meant to

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:06.270
be for me. So they found everybody, now, they
make it like a nationwide casting call like

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:13.970
when I was in the Apprentice, it's not like
that. With us, it wasn't like that. With us,

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:20.360
we're just lucky that they picked because
they would have picked anybody off the tray

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:28.389
at that point. So, that was that--that was
the whole question, right? Okay. Cool. Anyone

00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:30.970
else?
&gt;&gt; Is your favorite restaurant, you are really

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:31.970
Felipe [ph] [INDISTINCT]?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: No. My favorite--I like Felipe

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:39.081
[ph], I like Felipe [ph] because they put
Skinnygirl Margarita on the menu and that

00:14:39.081 --> 00:14:41.959
was where it was born. People always me my
favorite restaurant and I can never really

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:46.931
think. I like [INDISTINCT] a lot because it's
like that's ala carte, I like steakhouses,

00:14:46.931 --> 00:14:51.100
I like the Strip House, I think it's a sexy
steakhouse. I like Anjo's [ph] in Mulberry.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:58.460
I'm not like a fancy food person. I like sort
of down home food. Am I going to be invited

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:10.839
back to Google ever again? I'm just curious
because sorry, man, I didn't take my meds

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:24.649
this morning and I'm just saying shit.
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]?

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:38.579
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: No, got it. Okay. Yeah, and they
do, they YouTube themselves. Yeah, so. They

00:15:38.579 --> 00:15:44.980
like--oh, no, Google everybody. All right.
So, anyone has read the book that I happen

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.769
to have written?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:15:46.769 --> 00:15:50.800
&gt;&gt; Can you help us about Ramona first before
you...?

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.290
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Oh, Ramona, sure. What do you
want to know?

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:57.500
&gt;&gt; If she really is [INDISTINCT] crazy as?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Ramona. Ramona. Ramona has like

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.710
that switch that just, just she'd be like,
"Hey, oh, my God. Hi, it's nice to see you."

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:09.171
And you'd be like, "Why are we doing that?
I don't understand why we're doing that. We

00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:20.700
don't want to do that, I didn't sign up for
that." Ramona, this switch just goes off but,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:28.200
I would say just add Ramona. She was like
red pepper flakes. You just, if you put it

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.589
in a recipe sometimes, it just makes it just
spicy enough like Penne Arrabiata but sometimes

00:16:32.589 --> 00:16:41.780
it's like, you know, she's, Ramona is nuts,
we're all sort of nuts when [INDISTINCT] not

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:47.410
particularly crazy when she is like a low
grade...? What?

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:56.810
&gt;&gt; What about
the [INDISTINCT]?

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:07.490
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: The countess is very cool. I think
the countess got caught up a lot in her countess

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:14.160
mess. The first two seasons and like was sitting
behind that whole thing but, she, I've been

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:22.400
out with countess and she's pretty, she's
pretty cool when it comes down to it. "Darling,

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:29.410
you better lean into a man and be a damsel
in distress." Yeah, I mean, the countess is,

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.900
she's caught up in the countessness. But now
she's, well, she's still the countess. She's

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.130
countless but she a count--yeah, the countess
is no count. So, I like [INDISTINCT] well,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:39.500
we get along really well. Had we both been
single at the same time back in the day, it

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:45.410
would have been ugly, yeah. Alex is very nice--Alex
is very, very--who just asked that? Oh, Alex

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:50.620
is very, Alex is nice, she's harmless, she's
very, you know, you need Simon--it really

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.840
need to be Silex because you need—I'm sorry?
&gt;&gt; No ID picture?

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:09.120
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: It's funny you asked, I don't--there
were doing a sign up for a parenting show.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.180
I'm not kidding like on getting your kids
into school in Manhattan. Oh, all of us are

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:21.690
sort of a happy accident in a way except Jill,
who was like right in the middle of if all.

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:27.470
But, they signed up for like getting your
kids into school, a parenting show, and I

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:40.480
think, yeah, you'd call it a team. I think,
we had her and they need him, I mean not any

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:48.660
other husbands are men are in the show. I
really wouldn't want someone--I don't want,

00:18:48.660 --> 00:19:00.610
you know, a Tori &amp; Dean kind of situation
coming up, you know, but this is just too

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:11.120
weird but, you need both of them, you really,
really do. And they have their own like cult

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.590
following now I think.
&gt;&gt; So there is the last season, you mentioned

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:18.169
[INDISTINCT] running down... Because like
the most difficult thing you've ever...

00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:21.630
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Everything is unbelievable with
her.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.940
&gt;&gt; And, it was just certainly that, just Kelly
saying, "Hey," like [INDISTINCT], let's do

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:31.530
it. You could mean running in the traffic.
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Well, cartwheels are free. So,

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.460
running in front of the course in carriage,
yeah it's kind--that's like what happens if

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:41.520
I would do like "Yehey." Like it's just, it's
so--the thing is it is so--listen to I'm speaking

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.720
to who has, who ever speaks this way to anyone
much less everyone? You know, I don't have--she,

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.520
she has her own thing it's just she's very--I
don't know I think she really--she's a girl

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.410
who is a wealthy girl, lives in a big house
and I think she really wants everyone to like,

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:59.461
I think that she's really like Boheme and
in Birkenstocks with the whole, you know,

00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:07.240
the pick up truck and like I'm just free and
that, you know, like I said cartwheels are

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:17.180
free--we are just so opposite. I can't even--it's
like an--I can't even comment, I don't even

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:24.071
know. We just do not gel. It's not for T.V.
I've been--we just don't, I'm just like I

00:20:24.071 --> 00:20:29.250
don't--I don't get it. I've never seen the
likes of this before…

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:33.070
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: I think she's coming back, I mean

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:41.610
to my--I haven't seen--to my knowledge she'll
be coming back and then everyone's going to

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:46.500
want the whole me and her; I'll do it for
pay per view. For pay per view, I feel like

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:53.060
for a good amount of money which I actually
think people would pay to me see like mud

00:20:53.060 --> 00:21:01.570
wrestle her in pay per view. And I seriously
have thought about it and I think like even

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.661
the people--I've been to Mall of America and
they've heard me someone inappropriate, I

00:21:04.661 --> 00:21:09.230
think people can handle mud wrestling with
Kelly and I think I would win, I would, because

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:13.330
I'm scrappy. So, anyway, this is my little
personal fantasy, but back to reality at Google.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.320
&gt;&gt; Of all the relationships on the show, it's
just like [INDISTINCT] the most authentic

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.390
friendship?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Yeah, that's the most true, that's

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.500
the most authentic friendship, it's true,
it's true.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.110
&gt;&gt; How did you guys met each other and...
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: We met, you know, Jill makes,

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:33.440
makes it her business to meet everybody. And
so we met at a movie premiere--well, actually

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:42.680
we met a couple of times and I really didn't
know her that well until that day at Polo

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:48.950
[ph], like until the show, we did really get
to know each other and to get to know our

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:53.650
family and, and things like that. And she
was sort of my closest person on the show,

00:21:53.650 --> 00:22:01.510
it's just a weird experience to go through,
and so you need someone to--to kind of be

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.310
going through with. But since--excuse me--since
I have a boyfriend, since I've been really

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:12.410
caught up in the book and I just wrote the
second book, I've kind of been--I haven't

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:17.890
been really hanging out with anybody, I've
just been working. So, it will be interesting--it

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:21.310
will be really fresh when we get back to shooting
because I haven't really seen--I didn't even

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.710
seen Jill that much this summer, she's traveling
and I've been traveling so, it will be spicy,

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.800
it will be interesting. I don't think it could
be as interesting as Atlanta or other shows,

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:34.460
I just don't, I don't think any of this would
go with there and it would be sort of fun

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.990
if we did like the un-, you know, the unplugged
version of Real Housewives in New York but

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:41.160
it's just not the same.
&gt;&gt; Who do you think is crazier, [INDISTINCT]?

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:47.370
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: That's a great question. Who do
I think is crazy--or Kelley--or is this funny

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:56.290
that you guys to do work? Would your bosses
just drop dead? Would they just be like this

00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:00.520
is what you're talking about? They don't even
know who Kelly or Danielle are or they might…

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.580
&gt;&gt; They're here.
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: What?

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.970
&gt;&gt; They're probably here.
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: They're probably here? Oh, they're

00:23:03.970 --> 00:23:08.691
here, you mean? Oh, are you--or the bosses--who
are the bigwigs here, raise your hands, they

00:23:08.691 --> 00:23:17.490
wouldn't even admit it. I'll Google, I'll
figure out later. Kelly or Danielle? Danielle

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:22.800
is like—oh, let's see, that's a better match
than me and Kelly. They're equally pathological

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.500
I think, I think they're equally. I think
Danielle is a--is the biggest—no, they're

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.430
the same, they're the same person. Bigger
tits, bigger lips, but same person, I can't

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:36.080
answer that. Best question of the day, thank
you. No, it's some to me, some to me.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.460
&gt;&gt; Okay. It seem like the second season there
is a lot more like the charity work, involvement

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.830
[INDISTINCT] that you guys are put up to not
necessarily you but...?

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:48.880
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: It's a good--it's funny, it's
funny, it's a good question. And it's, in

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:56.290
all the Housewives things, I mean everyone
needs to make themselves feel really important

00:23:56.290 --> 00:24:03.940
or have to like explain to the world why they're
doing a reality show. They make it like we're

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:09.020
all in Malawi on our knees like, you know,
like hugging babies. And, you know, I work

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.880
with different charities and I'm not saying
I'm on my knees in Malawi either. I work with

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.350
the ASPCA or the humane society and donate
my time and donate cooking and things but,

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:21.510
everybody really feels that even in all the
shows to be like "I do so much charity." I

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:28.460
think kind of charity is the kind of thing
you're doing it, you don't really need to

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:33.310
be yelling it out at the top of your lungs.
The one big charity event, they kind of didn't

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:37.410
want us to do something together, and so Jill's
friend had us do that charity, we all get

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.910
back together on it. But that kind of, you
know, at the end, they gave us all of these

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:48.730
awards but I was like I don't need an award.
It just felt a little, it felt a little inauthentic

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:54.560
like we're all getting an award, a glass award
made my Mario from true, you know, religion

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.240
or true faith trophies. So, you know, I just
felt, I felt--everyone was like hawking their

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.840
stuff, myself included but, that was a little
pushing it, so. My cookbook, book. Okay, so

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.780
now where I become a human being for a minute.
So "Naturally Thin" is my book which I wrote

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.620
not because I ever wanted to be an author,
I didn't. I mean, I've always have a knack

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.220
for writing. I've always like to writing articles,
I loved writing assignments but I never wanted

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:21.000
to be a writer or an author. I came from a
very, very toxic household, a very, very toxic

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.680
family with alcoholism and chain smoking and
living in 13 different places, going to 13

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.110
different schools, and there was an obsession
coming from my mother and father just in the

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.990
whole--my whole family background, obsession
with food. And food where I call the book

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:39.900
food noise, and dieting, and you can't be
fat and you have to be thin. And, basically,

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:45.500
I spent my whole life, probably since--no,
my whole entire life, I mean since I could

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.590
probably read or know what even, you mean,
I talk a lot about parents not saying diet

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.670
in front of their kids or not like making
that obsession of their own passing it on

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:59.240
and that's a lot of what the book is about.
But, basically, I've spent most of my life

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.910
completely obsessed with dieting and being
thin and ripping out every single diet in

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:10.670
every single magazine and reading all the
charts and it could be anything from Better

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:16.530
Homes and Gardens to Seventeen and always
being on a diet, the Scarsdale Diet, the Atkins

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:21.180
Diet, the Southbeach Diet, the [INDISTINCT],
the this, the that, the nonsense. And, probably,

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:27.540
for most of my like, you know, from high school
to college, adult life to early 30s, I was

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:36.760
always like 20 -25 pounds heavier than I am
now, and I would have been 90 pounds heavier

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:41.181
had I not been completely obsessed, spinning
and stepping and exercising every day and

00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:45.860
always like I was good because I ate this,
I was bad because I ate that. And, I never

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:52.660
was bulimic, I never was anorexic but, it
definitely was a like a disorder because it

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.750
was a complete obsession and I know so many
people go through this, and, but it was my

00:26:55.750 --> 00:27:00.440
own sort of secret thing. I mean some of my
girlfriends they're like I was so bad today,

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:06.080
I can't believe, but I ate them, I'm going
to be good tomorrow. Monday was always the

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:12.180
big day to diet or the day after the big binge
then you need diet. And it's just was like

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.890
completely, completely shackling. It was like
being in prison, and as an evolution it just

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:22.850
became more and more tiring and you get better,
better at the dieting because you, you know,

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:28.100
you know more so I've been, being a natural
food chef, you know were about like whether

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:33.850
it's tofu or vegetarian or steamed and fasts,
and all these like excuses like the Gwyneth

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:38.510
Paltrow thing. This is, the whole thing about
Gwyneth Paltrow, she like overdetoxing or

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:45.490
over--because a lot of people do the whole
bullshit of pretending it's in the guise of

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:54.480
like being healthy but it's still really obsessive.
So, that was that whole phase of that being

00:27:54.480 --> 00:28:00.190
a natural food chef. And, about, probably,
my early, it was in my early 30s, I was going

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:06.760
on trip to Italy where I'd been several times
before, and Mario Vitali had given a friend

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:13.590
of mine a bunch of different of restaurants
that I had to go visit in Venice and I just--I

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:18.100
was going with a boyfriend, I was like I'm
done. I've had so many trips where I've gone

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:26.090
to Italy and it's been like torture the server
if they can't find the skim milk somewhere

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:40.330
in Italy. Go beat up some Italian at some
Italian market, find me some freakin' skim

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:51.910
milk or Equal or whatever. which is so psycho
because like a teaspoon of sugar is, you know,

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:59.320
whatever some few calories--no one ever got
fat of on a bit of cream or small cappuccino,

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:04.530
but it's just this like this whole food noise
obsession. And I was like this is a trip where

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:09.640
I'm going to just eat the vegetable Antipasto
the whole time because that's what I'm allowed

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:19.800
to eat, and this is a trip where I'm going
to just come back, my jeans are going to be

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:26.630
the same. And all the rules in this book which
I call a toolbox because you could use the

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:32.420
hammer and you could use the screwdriver,
there's no plan, you don't need to know everything.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:37.780
It's the kind of book that you just read and
it just becomes part of you. But all of the

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.240
rules were born in Italy and some of the--one
of the rules--the big overriding rules is

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:46.830
your diet is a bank account. And so, basically,
just like the economy, just like shopping,

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:51.010
just like buying an impractical sequined dress
or something. After you do that, you should

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:56.150
buy nothing or buy a cashmere sweater. When
you have your money, finances--some of us

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:59.210
are in debt, some of us aren't, I've been
there. I've bounced more checks than I even

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:03.940
care to explain. You don't carry your checkbook
around during the day. You know when you've

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:13.740
gone out and you shop and you bought something,
you have a little bit of remorse about it

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:19.340
that you know you went over. And then you
know that if you're not going to buy something

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:24.960
next, that's the whole thing about your diet
and the bank account. And the problem with

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:30.010
most diets is that they are cookie cutter
and people's lives are not cookie cutter.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.270
People are business travelers, people are
at mini-marts, people have no money; they

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:39.190
have to go to McDonalds. The book is about
whatever your own life is and being able to

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.530
be Latin and keep rice and beans in your life.
Or, you know, just be Italian and you want

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:46.920
to eat pasta because we've gone through the
days where pasta was the devil, and avocado,

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.390
and sushi used to be the devil to me and all
these things that we've been forbidden, and

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:56.900
in the book, the book doesn't tell you there's
no, there is no no. There's only yes, it's

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.470
just how? And so, your diet is a bank account
would be the overriding rule, and then there

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:04.380
are other little rules like the hammer and
the screwdriver and you know, the magnet ruler

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:08.460
or whatever, and those are like taste everything,
eat nothing. So, that's the kind of rule that

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.460
you'd bring out if you're at a buffet or at
a Superbowl party or at someone's wedding.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.000
That's when you're like, you know what those
cube neon cheese, cheeses I've seen it a million

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.200
times, I don't need to eat that but you know
what, they have caviar here, they have coconut

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:24.110
shrimp, so I'm going to have a little bit
of it all; the same kind of thing if you're

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:30.070
on a date and you're in a fattening restaurant,
you don't want to be that person that's just

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:36.670
like "Oh, I can't have this or I can't have
that," all the noise. The book makes it into

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:40.510
a voice and it gives you a good relationship
with food, and people often ask me "What's

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:44.940
the most important rule?" and they're all
important and they're all made to be broken

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:51.190
except for the check yourself before you wreck
yourself rule, and that is--I used to be the

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:55.770
girl that'd go out Marquee, I'd be single,
I'd get drunk. I'd come home four in the morning,

00:31:55.770 --> 00:32:00.660
I'd go to that deli that, that fortunately
is now is closed, The Bodega. I swear to God,

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:06.490
the chef from La Bodega was from Le Cirque,
he was so amazing. They just close it, they

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:11.190
couldn't pay the rent, we're all mourning
on this side of the room but it's okay. So,

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:16.860
anyway, I used to go in there and get coffee
cake, and get ice cream, and get chips, and

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.810
like because you're ruining yourself. You're
like it's over, it's going to be good tomorrow

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:26.500
and I'm going to ruin myself. And that's a
binge, that's the only thing that you cannot

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.800
break that rule because that's emotional,
it has nothing to do with actual hunger. You

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:34.300
would never be hungry enough to eat like that.
You wake up swollen with like a food hangover

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:43.420
and you hate yourself and it wreaks havoc
on your body and that is the one only rule

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.940
that you can't break. It doesn't mean you
can't have fried chicken, it doesn't mean

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:53.690
that you cannot have potato chips, it just
mean you can't go off the rail like Ramona

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:58.560
at a dinner party, you can't go off the rail.
You can't lose your mind and do something

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.670
so crazy that people would still be talking
at Google two years later. And so there are

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.770
other things in the book like the point of
diminishing return where, you know, you have

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:07.420
a plate of fried calamari and you have a bite
and it's amazing and you have another bite,

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.930
it's amazing. And then it starts to not get
amazing and it starts to get really like you're

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:22.440
so, have such anxiety about the fact that
you're eating fried calamari or a cheese burger

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.200
that now it goes in the other direction. You
kind of like a little self-loathing. That's

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.240
when you stop because it's never going to
get any better and there will be another fried

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:35.370
calamari, there will be another French fries
and there are all these little things in the

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:40.490
book like that like the differential--for
me Turkey chili is just as good as regular

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:46.790
chili, like it's not worth the extra fat,
for somebody else that might be something

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:52.760
else. But, for me I don't want a piece of
grilled chicken or broiled steam piece of

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:58.231
chicken, I want a fatty New York steak, so
that's where I decide to invest. And the book

00:33:58.231 --> 00:34:04.110
talks about good investments and bad investments,
and but it's individual for every single one

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:09.060
of you, so the book is just something you
read, you don't like flip to some chart and

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:16.541
rip it out. Just read it, it becomes part
of you. You absorb it, you trust it, you know

00:34:16.541 --> 00:34:22.010
hundreds and thousands of people have lost
like 50, 60, 70 pounds now and I don't know,

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:27.260
it's been out since March 10th. And this has
been like the, the baby of my life. I'm excited

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:31.970
about the Skinnygirl Margarita, that's going
to put my kids' kids through college, it's

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:38.030
all good. But the book--it is, we're ripping
off copies, the sign on the back in his yacht

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.300
and we're going, and we're going to have margaritas
flowing out of the faucets and all kinds of

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:51.190
plans for that because that's going to be
major. But, the book, this book is the one

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:56.610
great thing that I've done in life because
it's changing people's lives, like people

00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:01.270
with eating disorders are sending me letters.
Their husbands are saying that their wives

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:05.890
will finally eat foods that their kids could
eat. That their wife will get pregnant again

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:10.800
because she was afraid of getting fat, I mean,
people have fucked up noise about food. So,

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:16.920
they really do because you have to live with
it, it's not like drugs, you can't get rid

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:24.961
of it, or alcohol you can't get rid of it,
not that you'd ever want to. But, food you

00:35:24.961 --> 00:35:31.891
have to keep in your life, and the book is,
you know, is pretty good, so, read the book.

00:35:31.891 --> 00:35:32.891
&gt;&gt; Just the one issue where...
&gt;&gt; Microphone.

00:35:32.891 --> 00:35:36.710
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Are we doing microphone--mam I
on the microphone? Do I need to be on a microphone?

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:41.260
Oh, no, I'm on a microphone.
&gt;&gt; You are. [INDISTINCT] they won't be on

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.480
YouTube because they're not using the microphone.
&gt;&gt; It's true, I mean...

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.970
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Okay, who's the techie who's going
to take off the...?

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:49.520
&gt;&gt; So, one thing that I think people struggle
with is feeling full and a lot of people don't

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:56.340
know what that means anymore. So, you can
say satiated, or whatever, but a lot of thing,

00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.760
people, I think, struggle with understanding
their body and their body's reaction to food

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:07.141
and when are they full, when are they stuffed?
When are they still hungry and things like

00:36:07.141 --> 00:36:15.350
that? So, that's my first question, just how
you've dealt with that over time? And then,

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:19.470
my second question is your decision to call,
sort of your empire, Skinnygirl because that

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.030
is...
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: The word skinny.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:28.070
&gt;&gt; The word skinny is somewhat controversial
in our society and I, I'm just wondering how

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:34.290
that came about for you?
&gt;&gt;FRANKEL: The first question--do you have

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:41.930
any other question? Okay, the first question
is about being full and it's a great question

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:50.190
because for so long, you know, a part of this
whole food noise, you have such anxiety while

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:55.390
you're eating. We just know to finish our
whole plate, and there's a rule, you know,

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:59.180
cancel your membership to the clean plate
club which involves broccoli or even chicken

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:04.450
broth. Like it's not that you should only
leave food on your plate if it's something

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:11.201
really fattening, it's about just starting
to understand what it means to leave it and

00:37:11.201 --> 00:37:18.110
it's okay. You probably know, you've probably
been really busy and you have a whole sandwich

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:23.680
and you eat half and you run off. You're never
missing that other half, you're not starving,

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:30.000
it's just that it was in front of you and
then that's where the anxiety comes from what's

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.080
in front of you and not understanding how
to deal with that. And part of it is, it's

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:41.030
not going to happen in the first day because
you--it's mostly anxiety based. Once you start

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:45.030
to get to know yourself, there are little
side rules, like, chew your food slowly, not

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:48.650
obsessively counting bites so that it'd be
[INDISTINCT], but chew your food slowly. Also

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:51.720
paying attention when, you know, you're driving
or you're walking or something and you're

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:56.480
eating; you don't even know what you're doing,
and then you finish and then you're full.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.590
Or, sometimes if you're not eating slowly
enough, you're actually involved in a conversation,

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:04.160
or making a special moment, you get really
full before you even know it and afterwards

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:09.960
you feel like you're full. But, just to know
when you're comfortable that does take a little

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:16.050
bit of practice, it does take not having anxiety
about what you're eating, because you're,

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:23.400
okay, I did it. And there is that moment,
what I could a little more and I could do

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:30.230
a little more, but you kind of have to have
not noise about it, but that food voice about

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:35.420
it and it's an internal conversation about
it which will involve several other rules.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:42.190
Is it worth it? Is it a good investment? Is
it the point of diminishing return and not

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:51.160
for any of these to be obsessive? I'm saying
it all once, it becomes something you just

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.980
understand. When you read the book, you won't
even ask because you'll just understand because

00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.410
there's so many different situations I explained.
How I feel about when I'm eating something?

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:07.140
How I feel--why I ate something? Why I was
hung over and ate just watermelon or hot chocolate

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:14.090
for breakfast which no book would ever say
to do? Just, the more that you allow yourselves

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:21.590
to have the things that you really want, the
more that you will have anxiety about it.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:29.140
So, what happens if you eat a piece of chocolate
cake, it's Paris Hilton is a perfect example

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.960
of a person, she doesn't give a crap, she
eats half a cheeseburger or French fries and

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:38.260
she walks away because it's not that important,
she can eat another cheeseburger if she wanted

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:42.280
to, but she doesn't want to. Someone called
me up the other day and said, "When I'm 65,

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.760
I'm going to eat whatever I want. I'm going
to eat a whole tray of lasagna and I'm just

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:54.430
going to throw caution to the wind," and I
was like, if you say your allowed to, you'll

00:39:54.430 --> 00:40:00.480
never going to eat a whole tray of lasagna.
So, it's just something that sort of becomes

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:07.630
part of you. Just something instinctive, that
is what the food voice is. And as far as the

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:12.410
word Skinnygirl, it's very specific that it's
one word, skinnygirl, as oppose to, I always

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:16.240
mention Banana Republic because years ago--you
know, even company Apple, you don't think

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.960
of an actual apple, it's just its own word
now. So, Skinnygirl--but it's also, it's not

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.660
skinny bitch and I'm not saying anything about
that book, I'm just saying it's not skinny

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:30.420
bitch, it's that--it's a girl, it's a skinny
girl. A girl usually means somebody a little

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.930
bit youthful, a little bit nice, and the word
Skinnygirl means the girl that you want to

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:38.920
be, that you're comfortable being. And that
could be, you know, Rihanna or Kim Kardashian,

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:45.150
or a role model who has like, you know, who's
a little, who's not some skinny, skinny bone.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:49.860
I'm trying to make Skinnygirl--and I'm succeeding
in making Skinnygirl. The girl that can live

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:55.860
and be flirty and in the kitchen and not stressed
out about it and have some, have a cheeseburger,

00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:01.400
and have some of the French fries, and have
a Skinnygirl Margarita and not have noise

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.460
about it. It's not about some bone, you know
real bone or bone real, or whatever, bone

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:11.110
rail thin, real thin person. It's about the
girl that you felt comfortable being, and

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:17.920
I do think that a lot of these you know, J-Lo
and Beyonce role models are good because they're

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:27.040
hot, and they're a little bigger and they're
healthy and they just own it and they wear

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:33.560
what they want, and it's fitted, and they're
kind of just like, those are girls to me.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:41.940
So, that's what a Skinnygirl is.
&gt;&gt; Hi, just before I ask my question, I wanted

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:49.630
to say I bought your book actually a week
ago, it's ironic because now we're getting

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:57.020
it for free. But, I made your banana oatmeal
cookies and the Vegan Chili which were awesome

00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.790
by the way. You guys should try them, I give
them to my family and we're vegetarians, it

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:02.320
was great.
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Thank you.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:07.520
&gt;&gt; You mentioned in your book that you went
to an obesity camp, or an obesity or doctor...

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.570
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: A clinic, an obesity clinic. Right.
&gt;&gt; Right, because your mom was freaking out...

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:16.130
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Right.
&gt;&gt; And, so I wanted to know how that affected

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:22.010
you because I think like there wasn't much
mentioned about it, but it was kind of like

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:26.150
an important--you could notice in the book
that it's like an important time in your life.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:29.020
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Definitely.
&gt;&gt; And what exactly they said? How that changed

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:34.270
you? I mean did you, you know, like stop having
like whole milk or something after that, like

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.660
what exactly happened?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Yeah, it's funny, yeah, that was

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:42.120
the first, I mean, I think I was eight years
old and that there was something an eight

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.630
year old should know about calories and I
think it's interesting because this book,

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:47.590
you know, even I was, I as shooting something
with Isaac Mizrahi that day, he was like,

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:51.460
Well, you know, well, the, this jelly bean
is like one point, how many points does that

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:56.280
chip have? And you know, this whole point
system, you can't even be enjoying what you're

00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:00.200
doing. And I just think that for a kid at
eight years old already knows what a calorie

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:08.220
is, and so, I don't even know what those diet
pages are, I'm going to ripping them out.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:14.300
Is this completely obsessive, and it just
starts off for this whole--so many people

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:20.080
do it, so many people know it. I started earlier,
but I was in nightclubs at 14, so I started

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.990
everything earlier. But, to be knowing about
things like that, at that age, it's just,

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:30.390
it's just a lot of food noise. If, I have
friends who have heavy kids, you know, I hear

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:35.201
all it all the time. Like, you know, mothers,
you know--well, if you didn't eat that, you

00:43:35.201 --> 00:43:40.330
would fit into this. And it's really, it's
like not the kind of--that's not good tough

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:45.690
love. Food is such a sensitive thing, and
you have to like ease into it, and sometimes

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:49.500
you have to--I don't even have girlfriends
that like, just allow yourself to eat and

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:58.190
be, have a better relationship with food and
then the weight will eventually come off.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:04.660
It doesn't have to be something--it took your
whole life to gain it, it's going to take,

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.870
you know, a little bit to get it off. It's
the kind of thing that you just wanted to

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:11.710
get the sort of mental problem, or mental
noise gone before you start worrying about

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:15.820
it because the obsession will just constantly
go up, go down, that's why people lose weight

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:21.310
on diets. Blame the diet when it comes back,
and then they go to another diet. And, you

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:32.381
just can't be like a counter and so, it definitely
was way too early for a person to even know

00:44:32.381 --> 00:44:38.870
about calories. I don't believe in calories,
I don't believe in weighing yourself which

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:51.970
all that is about. Because then, you know
you drink a glass of water or you eat like

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:59.630
you know, a soy bean and you're swollen. I
mean, I have a weight, I never weight myself.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:03.821
If I'm in some spa away, you know, one out
of six months, I'll weigh myself, but I just

00:45:03.821 --> 00:45:10.390
think, it's a bad way to go, and I hate when
kids said that they're going to fat camp.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:17.060
My friend she wants to send her kid a Skinnygirl
t-shirt because she sent her to the fat camp,

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:24.470
and I'm like, that sounds great, to send a
Skinnygirl t-shirt to a fat camp. So, you

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:30.820
know, it's just, a lot of it and if I again--speaking
about charities, that kind of charity that

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.800
I want to work in, is developing a healthy
relationship with food for younger girls,

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.470
for teens. I think that's a huge, huge area,
a sensitive area. So, I was even--so, you're

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:42.350
right, it was very, it's something I remember,
shouldn't have been there.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:46.730
&gt;&gt; My question is more about being a vegetarian
because a lot of diets and I guess not even

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:51.370
diets, but just eating in general is so much
focused around meat or high protein or any

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:52.740
of those things...
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: yeah.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:58.089
&gt;&gt; Being a vegetarian and trying to be vegan
it's just really hard...

00:45:58.089 --> 00:46:00.990
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: I think that the way that a lot
of people find out if they're allergic to

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:04.900
things is through like the food elimination
diet. Sort of which means either you would

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:11.820
start on a fast, or you start just eating
sort of healthy for a week or so, and then

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.940
adding things back in. I'm getting somewhere,
I know you asked a sort of different question,

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:20.240
but there's a reason I'm saying this. And
you kind of realize that you react on things.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.560
Ironically, I've done raw, I've done vegan,
and I've done everything and I had, I really

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:28.180
don't have any food allergies. But as of late,
I realized that when I have this soy milk

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:32.790
in my Starbucks' coffee that I just start
to feel like kind of congested, and like feel

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:37.860
like I could have more glamorous word slimy.
And so, I realized when I cut that out, that

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:48.210
I'm allergic to that. I think that if people
have food intolerances is like wheat can make

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:56.620
him more bloating, you should start paying
attention to how you feel. And that's how

00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:02.980
you should eliminate and decide whether you're
going to be vegan or raw or vegetarian. But

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:10.040
I don't, you know, I don't believe in the
books that tell you what you should be, you're

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:16.370
supposed to this. And that is an ethical issue
and I completely understand the ethical issue,

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:22.590
I really do. If you see this movie, Food Inc.,
which is coming out, you'll never want to

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:28.410
eat again. And also, I love animals, so I
am conflicted of the fact that I do like to

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:37.020
eat steak, then where do you draw the line
if I will wear a leather purse but I won't

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:42.060
wear fur. And, I am definitely--you can't
do everything, I'm inflicted about organic

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:47.510
and trying to teach people what things to
eat that are organic because not everyone

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:53.490
can afford it. I mean there's a lot of information,
but I think that everyone's body is different.

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:58.740
And I mean my boyfriend would say, "How come
one of you wants a health food store, everybody

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:03.420
who works there is green," you now, because
all of the people always like green. Everyone

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:07.470
just looks, I don't mean like green, yay we're
being environmental, I mean they look green.

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:14.430
And I'm like I don't know, maybe it's because
I'm not eating any meat. I mean I'm not a

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:22.380
doctor, but I think that you know when you
kind of have that like those black circles,

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:28.550
and then when you're missing something. And
girls know when you're getting a period if

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:32.820
you want some red meat that there's like a
reason, you're craving something. I think

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:37.130
you have to get kind of in touch with your
body and know what it needs and know what

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:44.130
it doesn't need, and work it out for yourself.
And some people for digestion reasons do better

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:49.370
with vegetarian; I'm one of those people,
some people, you know, some men if they're

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:55.131
working at, they really need to like, you
know, protein up and all that stuff. But I

00:48:55.131 --> 00:49:01.119
definitely don't believe in that that low
carb stuff, that's like psychotic, I really

00:49:01.119 --> 00:49:07.362
don't, and I hate that kind of like obsessive.
I love what I got to do when the guys like,

00:49:07.362 --> 00:49:19.910
"I don't need carbs," and I'm like, "Great."
That whole like muscle head, the muscle milk

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:30.260
thing, whatever, anyway, so that's the no
carbs. So, that was my ex fiancée from Chicago,

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:36.891
my own personal moment we're having here,
no carbs at all, no carbs, so.

00:49:36.891 --> 00:49:42.880
&gt;&gt; Could you just talk a little bit about
BethennyBakes.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.640
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Oh, okay. Oh, because we're on
health products now. Okay, so, all right.

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:57.369
I have a line of--oh, so you're going to get
some today. Are the cookies going to be out?

00:49:57.369 --> 00:50:04.460
So I have a line of bakes goods called BethennyBakes,
they're wheat, egg and dairy free and low

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:13.400
fat baked which is sort of ironic because
they came a long time ago and my book talks

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:18.650
about, this book but especially "Skinnygirl
Dish" which is coming out in January. I renovate

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:21.300
recipes, just like I'm a fixologist for cocktails.
I take fattening recipes like macaroni and

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.980
cheese, or chicken pot pie or things that
you would normally feel a little bit guilt

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:26.100
eating and make them more healthy, and it's
not that you can't eat regular fattening macaroni

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:28.140
and cheese, it's just that with these healthy
recipes you can have a little bit more of

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:30.390
it, it becomes a better investment, so that's
what BethennyBakes is. There's nothing wrong

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:37.210
with eating a regular chocolate chip cookie
from Mrs. Fields or whoever. But the cookies

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:39.730
happen to be healthy, they have oat flour,
they have apple sauce and bananas, and everything

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:43.140
is like all natural and so, it's actually
a good investment, better than having one

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:45.610
of those bars or something like that and that's
all available on my website. And, the Skinnygirl

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:48.230
Margarita which is coming out, this week we're
launching it and it will be in stores in a

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:51.400
couple of weeks. It's kind of the same thing,
the book talks about you know, I don't want

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:58.570
to say no, every diet I ever went into my
life is like no drinking, and then that would

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:02.550
last like three days. And I always wanted
to have a signature, a drink that I actually

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:08.290
like, but because I was always obsessed of
being on a diet, I would drink clear vodka,

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:15.070
like the flavored raspberry vodka that has
no sugar in it and put a lime in it and pretend

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:17.480
it tasted like raspberries and it really taste
like vodka. And then I would get buzzed and

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:25.350
I wound end up drinking what I wanted which
is a 700 calorie margarita, so I need to create

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:30.470
a margarita that you could trust. So, the
margarita has a hundred calories, it's in

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:34.230
the bottle, the tequila's in the bottle, it's
12.99 a bottle, it's--it's fantastic. It tastes

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:40.369
like you're drinking a margarita from Mexico,
so that's a good thing. And that's kind of

00:51:40.369 --> 00:51:45.620
the whole thing. I just want to be, make people
able to indulge and enjoy but have a little

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.900
bit less guilt about it, a little bit of less
noise and--hi.

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.900
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you so much for being at Google.
It's awesome to have you.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:54.890
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Oh, thank you.
&gt;&gt; I was just thinking since you're here,

00:51:54.890 --> 00:52:01.471
are you--I know a lot of people go online
to get recipes and things like that and I

00:52:01.471 --> 00:52:09.540
know I do it from time to time and like healthy
chicken recipe or whatever I'm searching for.

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:11.730
And I'm just wondering what role you're thinking
about taking there online?

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:15.030
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: As far as what? As far as…
&gt;&gt; Of having a site where people can get your

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:16.620
recipes or maybe…
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: I'm working right now. I'm really

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:21.330
making my site way more informational. I mean,
I have a lot of my recipes but they have to

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:26.790
be--I want to be them to be updated on a day
to day basis. I want to keep adding things.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:29.990
I mean, I don't want to put the things necessarily
that are on my book. I want to put some of

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:32.450
the things in my book. But, I want to make
it much more--I mean, truthfully, all over

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:33.450
the Internet, if you Google, there--all my
recipes end up all over the Internet. And,

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.970
I use Google for every recipe that I've created,
I'll say that, you know, I'll say to the girls

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:37.000
that Google me, you know, a regular fattening
like red velvet cake. And it's all an equation

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.390
and my second, let's not talk about a second
book but the second book, "Skinnygirl Dish"

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:39.390
teaches people to think about their refrigerator
or kitchen like a closet. We have like a black

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:41.490
dress and you have to accessorize it rather
than you have to go out and buy a whole brand

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:42.490
new outfit. Or go and buy a whole shopping
list for recipe, so I'll go on Google and

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:43.490
I'll be like, "All right, oh no, look at my
kitchen" I'm like, "Do we have three brown

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:44.490
bananas. What am I going to make?" I'll look
on Google and I'll be like, "Banana bread."

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:45.490
And I'll start substituting things out and
make a low fat, healthy versions of it and

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:48.590
everything's been like a total chemistry equation
and pretty much like 70% of them end up working

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:53.560
and 30% flop. I mean, the whole second book
is about teaching people how to think for

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:56.490
themselves in the kitchen and not have to
be a slave to recipe. So, I do want to have

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:57.490
my website be more informational, like if
you follow me on Twitter, we do contests every

00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:58.490
week. If whoever comes up with the best recipe
to go with the Skinnygirl Margarita or, you

00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:59.640
know, I ask a lot of different questions because
I want to know what people want in a book,

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.520
so we give out, you know, free case of margaritas
or a Skinnygirl basket of things. So, yeah,

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.901
I do want to have to be more, that more of
informational website with recipes and things

00:53:03.901 --> 00:53:04.901
that that... Oh the website is bethenny.com,
or for the cocktails at skinnygirlcocktails.com

00:53:04.901 --> 00:53:05.901
but truthful themly, thank you guys, Google,
because every single time I go to look up

00:53:05.901 --> 00:53:07.090
a fattening recipe that I want to renovate
or a cocktail because I want--I was doing

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:08.890
triple crown cocktail so I came up with--I
had to do the Black-Eyed Susan and the mint

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:10.340
julep and renovate them. I went to Google
for every single--we live on Google. Who doesn't,

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:15.450
though, I mean it's not like I'm a special.
I lived on Google. I'm not a, you know, I'm

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:16.450
not--totally.
&gt;&gt; Hi Bethenny, thank you so much for coming.

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:17.450
We knew we had to come late so I bought four
copies of your book yesterday.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:18.450
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Oh, thank you.
&gt;&gt; I have two questions. One is less serious.

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:19.450
Do you go on YouTube? And if so, what are
your favorite YouTube videos?

00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:20.450
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: I don't go YouTube. I like--I
don't go unless someone says, sent something

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:22.620
to me. I love that one about them; I love
that new one with them dancing in the wedding.

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:23.620
I love the one, what's the one in the wilderness
with the animals are fighting?

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:24.620
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: What's that?

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.620
&gt;&gt; The battle of Cougar Park.
&gt;&gt; What is that?

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.620
&gt;&gt; The battle of Cougar Park.
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Yes. I love that, I love that

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:27.620
baby. I could listen that baby laughing.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.620
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: The baby laughing forever. But
I don't go that--I'm not that--I really do

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:29.620
go to Google every minute of the day just
getting information. I mean, but I don't really--I

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:30.620
don't like, I don't scour the Internet. I
mean, I Google work to myself when I barely

00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.380
look at them, they look at them but I'm not
that much of the Internet person. I don't

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:33.380
use my computer that much. I'm more of a Blackberry
person, so.

00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:34.380
&gt;&gt; And then a serious question. We talked
a lot about eating. I remember you guys did

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.620
yoga in one of the shows. What do you do for
exercise? And how was that change overtime?

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.620
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: It's funny--that's a big thing
too. I don't know--I just finished the second

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:39.700
book and it's not been completely edited,
so I don't know if it's going to make it in.

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.310
I talk about exercise noise too, how I used
to be obsessed at most times like I would

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:43.810
be in a spinning phase where I'd be spinning
five days a week. And I end up seeing everybody

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:47.570
on the spinning classes and they all end up
looking the same. Nobody ever ends up getting

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:49.470
better, everybody looks the same, and I would
leave them and eat like a wild wolverine because

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:50.470
you're starving, and then you felt guilty
because you ate so much, you have to go back

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:51.470
and spin the next day and it becomes like
a literal, literally you're spinning. And

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:52.470
I'm now much thinner than I've ever been and
I probably work out on the average two to

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:53.470
three, if I'm gone on a weekend vacation,
times a week but I don't have a noise about

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:54.470
it and it's always part of my life. It's like
a friend that you always you know you're going

00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:55.470
to go back and see instead of it being like
having an argument with exercise which I used

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.470
to, where you go five days a week, be obsessed
and then you completely stop. Or you stop

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:57.470
one or two days, you'd have such guilt about
stopping but then you be like, "I screwed

00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:58.470
it up. I'm done, you know, it doesn't matter
anyway," and then you don't go four three

00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:59.470
weeks. Now, what happens is I go on a book
tour and I'm not thrilled about the fact that

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:00.470
I'm not exercising, but the first day I get
back if I'm not completely exhausted, I'll

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:01.470
go to yoga with no noise about it. So, it's
a long answer but it is important, it's an

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:02.470
important thing people get into their head
too that if you buy and remember and if you

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:03.470
just had it in your life on some level where--when
I go away for the weekend with my boyfriend,

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:04.470
we have a thing in the morning, we go take
a beach walk. Or last week, we were near this

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:05.470
basketball court, he plays basketball and
I'm like, "Just show me, let's play basketball."

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:06.470
Just to do things like you like whenever you
can and just have a good relationship with

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:07.470
it, that's what I have now. And because I
used to have a crazy with--it's like an ex-boyfriend.

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:08.470
I had a psychotic relationship with him before
and now, now, we can see each other once in

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:09.470
a while and we get along great and I look
just as good as I did then. [INDISTINCT].

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:10.470
&gt;&gt; So, I have a question concerning the work
you do, cooking for celebrities. Two parts:

00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:11.470
first, for the celebrities that you, that
are in really good shape and that they're

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:12.470
on camera. Are they generally kind of calorie
obsessed and is that a huge concern or do

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:13.470
you cook more lavishly for them? I just kind
of wonder how that works.

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:14.470
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: It's funny. Most--I don't really
cook that much for celebrities anymore because

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:15.470
I mean, I do for a specific event but not
regularly because I don't really have the

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:16.470
time that much. It depends--I have never,
I can't really work because of my own issues

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:17.470
with it. Like when I feel someone who has
like a lot of noise about it and is an obsessive

00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:18.470
and there's a lot of people like that, but
although I haven't had that done many people

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:19.470
like that request me to cook for them. But
the celebrities that I cook for, they're more

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:20.470
extreme, like I pigged out all summer and
I now I need to get it back for this. And--Dennis

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:21.470
Leary was the opposite. He just was in great
shape. He was playing hockey like three hours

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:22.470
a day and he ate like crap and he felt like
crap so I would just make him meals that he

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:23.470
loves because they were healthy and now, he
has more energy and he looks better. But for

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:24.470
the most part, I find--it's a bit 50-50; 50%,
but they're very extreme and I call them "the

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:25.470
unsustainables." Look at like Jessica Simpson.
Now, she's on a whole big diet or Britney.

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:26.470
Like, you know, even Oprah, like they need
my book. They really do. They need to--no,

00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:27.470
they do because they have so--even Oprah,
she has plans to be not be on plans. Like

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:28.470
the new thing with her was I have had too
many plans, you know, I've been in too many

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:29.470
diets, and now, I'm planning to not plan.
I'm going to plan to have more time, not plan

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:30.470
to plan--like it's just, you just need to
just like let it be. And I feel like celebrities

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:31.470
have so much pressure and they feel like,
you know, it's the spotlight is on them and

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:32.470
they're just up and down. So, I've had some
obsessive celebrities and I've had some they

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:33.470
just like to generally eat healthy. It's a
good question because for the most part there,

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:34.470
there's something about it where it's very
up and down and very extreme. And I get it

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:35.470
because that used to be me, and I have not--may
weight hasn't fluctuated and I fought it five

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:36.470
years. I used to fluctuate every five days.
So, I think it's part of being under the spotlight

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:37.470
and having so, so many fads and people throw
things at you and what I've--just like plastic

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:38.470
surgery. This one is doing this, that one
is doing that. So, yeah, I think that's--there's

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:39.470
a huge noisy population of people with celebrities.
&gt;&gt; Cool. Thanks. Who is the coolest celebrity

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:40.470
that you have...?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Dennis Leary is a cool celebrity.

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:41.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Yeah, he is cool. He was fun.

00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:42.470
He's, because he's inappropriate and so am
I so, anything flew in that trailer. Cool?

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:43.470
&gt;&gt; Hi.
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Hi.

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:44.470
&gt;&gt; So, I wanted to ask you, a lot of us in
the room here are in sales. So, that means

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:45.470
that we spend a lot of time in restaurants.
I don't know if you noticed but we're surrounded

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:46.470
by food.
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Yes.

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:47.470
&gt;&gt; In this environment.
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: I know. I just had some of that

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:48.470
strawberry special cake. It was good, I never
had it before.

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:49.470
&gt;&gt; Right, and was that planned?
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: What?

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:50.470
&gt;&gt; I mean, who knew when that was going to
be there, right?

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:51.470
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Right.
&gt;&gt; It's just shows up.

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:52.470
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Right. Yeah, I had a bowl of granola,
I would have shot myself years ago if I ate

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:53.470
a whole bowl of granola. I would have been
in therapy; I would not have been able to

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:54.470
speak now. I mean, I just want to. I mean,
yeah, you guys--

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:55.470
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to know if you had any advice
for those of us who seemed to find ourselves

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:56.470
just surrounded by food like other second.
&gt;&gt; I'm surrounded by food all the time. I'm

00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:57.470
in a restaurant every night, I don't--it doesn't
matter if you're surrounded by food. It doesn't

00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:58.470
matter if you're on a cruise ship. It doesn't
matter if you're on vacation, it doesn't matter

00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:59.470
if you go out to the most fattening restaurant,
Chinese restaurant too, you know, eat fried

00:54:59.470 --> 00:55:00.470
chicken, southern, you know, southern restaurant.
When I'm in Charlotte, North Carolina, and

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:01.470
I want to go to the barbeque place, you just
can't, we will read the book and it will make

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:02.470
sense to you. So what if you're around food?
I mean, no offense to the group, like there

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:03.470
was cereal. Like I haven't seen a cereal some--I
eat can eat cereal anytime like I need to

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:04.470
eat those cereal, I mean, it was good, it
was fine. Tomorrow I wouldn't be like, "Oh,

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:05.470
I need to eat those strawberry special cakes."
I mean, it wasn't like, you know, there was

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:06.470
a carving station and like [INDISTINCT] come
in, you know, and a cotton candy machine,

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:07.470
it wasn't like crazy. It was good. But, you
know, you're an adult. It's your choice, you

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:08.470
decide. If you want to eat five bowls of cereal,
then decide what you're not going to have

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:09.470
tonight when you go out to a great restaurant
to have steak. Like, you're--I'm a grown woman

00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:10.470
and you could be surrounded by food and--no,
I'm just saying like--I didn't mean to beat

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:11.470
you, I'm just saying like it's good. Walk
away and be like I had a bowl of cereal, it

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:12.470
was fine and it was good and I'm done. It
just has to be--what? Well, that's here. She's

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:13.470
just talking about here surrounded by food.
Right, now, I'm going to talk about--thank

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:14.470
you, Larry. So, that's being in a place like
here where it's just always around. But you'll

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:15.470
see, you kind of get sick of it and boredom
too. Do something else but just--but--I don't

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:16.470
want to say to have any rules or anything,
but, you know, portions are good. In my own

00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:17.470
house, I have little ramequins, you know,
I have a cereal bowl, it was a big cereal

00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:18.470
bowl, have your cereal in a cup like, and
don't have to be in some big group thing where

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:19.470
you're grabbing because that's just grounds
for not knowing what you're doing. You want

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:20.470
to kind of be conscious of what you're doing,
so I'd say using the, the little like a espresso

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:21.470
cup you had, for things, just a portion, now
to kind of have an idea, where not obsessing

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:22.470
about it. But what--because you're in sales
and you're probably taking people out, I would

00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:23.470
assume. Restaurants I find are easier than
home because you have portions there and there

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:24.470
is some sort of control. So, I'm a person,
if I go to a restaurant, I don't look at the

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:25.470
main course area. I find it to be--it's going
to be a big giant commitment to this big thing

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:26.470
and this thing, I like the appetizers. So,
I'll pick like a salad or a healthy appetizer

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:27.470
and then a fattening appetizer, something
I would never have allowed myself to eat before.

00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:28.470
Like a fried calamari or like a crab cake
or something, and have two appetizers and

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:29.470
go to the side sections. So, that was always
like appetizers on the side and pick the greens,

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:30.470
you're not going to get creams--it's not you
can't have a bite of it even if someone gets

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:31.470
it. Pick up the sausage and spinach, get some
mushrooms and fill yourself up on the higher

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:32.470
volume foods and make rules for yourself.
Just loose rules like for two drink maximum,

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:33.470
that's clear liquor, but if you decide you
want dessert, it's a bank account. Have one

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:34.470
drink and then have a couple of bites of the
dessert. You just have a constant conversation

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:35.470
about what's going on that's not noisy and
it's not tallying; it's just knowing. You

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:36.470
know, I want that bread. Somebody had a half
a piece of the bread, zip in a oil, you feel

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:37.470
like one of those bread eating people now;
you're not one of the people that's afraid

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:38.470
of bread. So you have a little bit of the
bread and then, you know, maybe a couple of

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:39.470
bites of the dessert--this could be a taste
everything eat nothing moment. But it could

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:40.470
be a good investment thing when you're starving,
so here's where you're having sautéed fish

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:41.470
and brown rice and investing well and not
having all that other stuff. Each moment is

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:42.470
its own moment. It could be me maybe on plane
and being like I'm dying for chocolate, some

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:43.470
of have half a Three Musketeers and a handful
of nuts, to balance it out, and it's all in

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:44.470
the book. And that's what's happening here,
but it shouldn't be something that's general;

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:45.470
every single minute every day. One day you
might eat terribly and just feel like four

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:46.470
o'clock, you've eating more food than you've
eaten in four days. And it happens, but don't

00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:47.470
have noise about it, just--it is what it is.
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:48.470
&gt;&gt; FRANKEL: Thanks. I feel like I abused her.
I was abused, I like abused her. I'm sorry,

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:49.470
you didn't come her to get beaten' up, everybody
loves you. Jesus loves you. She's like, "I

00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:50.470
don't want to come back to the Google meetings,
they were mean to me there." Oh. Oh, do I

00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:51.470
sign downstairs? Oh, okay, we're going to
sign books downstairs--upstairs. Thank you

00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:52.470
guys so much for having me and taking time
out of your day, this was so great, and I'm

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.477
so happy to be here. Thank you.
