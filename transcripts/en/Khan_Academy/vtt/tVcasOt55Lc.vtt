00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.600
I have a circle here whose
circumference is 18 pi.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.270
So if we were to measure all
the way around the circle,

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.560
we would get 18 pi.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.780
And we also have a
central angle here.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.130
So this is the
center of the circle.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.040
And this central angle
that I'm about to draw

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.470
has a measure of 10 degrees.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.090
So this angle right
over here is 10 degrees.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.560
And what I'm curious
about is the length

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.940
of the arc that subtends
that central angle.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.720
So what is the length of
what I just did in magenta?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.280
And one way to think about
it, or actually maybe the way

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.210
to think about it, is
that the ratio of this arc

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.140
length to the entire
circumference--

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:52.030
let me write this
down-- should be

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.130
the same as the ratio
of the central angle

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.220
to the total number
of angles if you were

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.899
to go all the way around the
circle-- so to 360 degrees.

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:09.190
So let's just think about that.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.990
We know the
circumference is 18 pi.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.380
We're looking for
the arc length.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070
I'm just going to call
that a. a for arc length.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.910
That's what we're going
to try to solve for.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.955
We know that the central
angle is 10 degrees.

00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:27.025
So you have 10 degrees
over 360 degrees.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.620
So we could simplify this
by multiplying both sides

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.570
by 18 pi.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.090
And we get that our arc
length is equal to-- well,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.310
10/360 is the same
thing as 1/36.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.690
So it's equal to
1/36 times 18 pi,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:01.830
so it's 18 pi over 36, which
is the same thing as pi/2.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.630
So this arc right
over here is going

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.250
to be pi/2, whatever units
we're talking about, long.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.440
Now let's think about
another scenario.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.010
Let's imagine the same circle.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.880
So it's the same circle here.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.430
Our circumference
is still 18 pi.

00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:21.270
There are people
having a conference

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.228
behind me or something.

00:02:22.228 --> 00:02:24.540
That's why you might hear
those mumbling voices.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.990
But this circumference
is also 18 pi.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.210
But now I'm going to make the
central angle an obtuse angle.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.560
So let's say we were to
start right over here.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.970
This is one side of the angle.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.010
I'm going to go and
make a 350 degree angle.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.060
So I'm going to go all
the way around like that.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.820
So this right over here
is a 350 degree angle.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.850
And now I'm curious
about this arc that

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.920
subtends this really huge angle.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.420
So now I want to figure out this
arc length-- so all of this.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.540
I want to figure out this
arc length, the arc that

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.710
subtends this really obtuse
angle right over here.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.740
Well, same exact logic-- the
ratio between our arc length,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.700
a, and the circumference of
the entire circle, 18 pi,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.720
should be the same as the
ratio between our central angle

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.260
that the arc subtends, so
350, over the total number

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.430
of degrees in a
circle, over 360.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.960
So multiply both sides by 18 pi.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:54.080
We get a is equal to-- this
is 35 times 18 over 36 pi.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.070
350 divided by 360 is 35/36.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:06.050
So this is 35 times
18 times pi over 36.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.750
Well both 36 and 18
are divisible by 18,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.060
so let's divide them both by 18.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.920
And so we are left with 35/2 pi.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.112
Let me just write it
that way-- 35 pi over 2.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.820
Or, if you wanted to
write it as a decimal,

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.490
this would be 17.5 pi.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.640
Now does this makes sense?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.760
This right over here,
this other arc length,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.890
when our central
angle was 10 degrees,

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.565
this had an arc
length of 0.5 pi.

00:04:41.565 --> 00:04:43.690
So when you add these two
together, this arc length

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.930
and this arc length,
0.5 plus 17.5,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.420
you get to 18 pi, which was
the circumference, which

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.880
makes complete sense because
if you add these angles, 10

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.272
degrees and 350 degrees, you
get 360 degrees in a circle.
