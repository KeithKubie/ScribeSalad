00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
So now my question for you is, of course, which would Alice do

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.940
if she want to approximate vertex cover?

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.930
Should she run the take 2 algorithm, should she run the greedy algorithm,

00:00:09.930 --> 99:59:59.000
or should she actually run both algorithms?
