1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,200
I've got a leadership
situation I need help with.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,030
I was promoted to a troop commander
position over a fellow team leader who now

3
00:00:07,031 --> 00:00:11,020
reports to me. He has many years of
experience and a lot of knowledge.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,590
He's very,

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,510
he's very bitter and not getting the
promotion at not getting the promotion and

6
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:20,890
is letting me know when I include him in
decision making for the troop or try to

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,130
tap into his knowledge and
experience. He, he shuts down,

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,930
refuses to give input and says that
I should already have the answers.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,190
Since I'm the troop commander,

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,150
I know the troop would benefit from his
input and team dynamics would be much

11
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,250
improved if it wasn't so negative.

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,050
I've tried to let him know that
I value, I value his experience.

13
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:48,160
I feel that his input would be beneficial
and that his negative attitude and

14
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:51,070
bearing and bearing are not acceptable.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,940
It is making him very
ineffective team leader, I'm,

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,570
I'm failing at getting through
to him and I don't want, fuck,

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,090
I don't want to fire him for his position.

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,220
How can I get him to value
his own position in the
troop and become effective?

19
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:07,054
Again,

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,510
I actually think you're doing the right
thing and you've opened the door for

21
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:13,880
him. So I think that's a
good first initial approach.

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,060
But obviously it doesn't
seem to be working.

23
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,940
Now a couple of different courses
of actions you could take.

24
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:22,310
One of the things you could do is actually
give them some higher responsibility,

25
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,520
right? Getting put his team in charge,
put him in charge of the whole team.

26
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:30,110
Sometimes maybe he will step up and start
to lead and see that he's now able to

27
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:32,360
prove and that you have a lot of
trust in him and all that stuff.

28
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,730
There's also a chance, think about this.

29
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:38,570
There's also a chance that you might
be coming off as condescending to him.

30
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,710
So imagine this, hey, I go, I
value your experience. Oh No.

31
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,280
Right now, you know, the troop would
really benefit from your input. It's,

32
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,240
it's like you're treating him like
he's a kid and he's getting that.

33
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,310
Those can come off as condescending.

34
00:01:52,311 --> 00:01:54,920
So we have to put those a
little bit in check as well.

35
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,210
And I think those are a little
bit, you know, you put the,

36
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:00,110
put the person in charge,

37
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:05,111
you try that you've opened up to try and
get their input and get them involved.

38
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,980
But it's, it might be coming,

39
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,320
it might be coming across as
condescending even if it's,

40
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,150
even if you're doing it, even
if you're just saying, hey man,

41
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,860
could really use your input
on this thing, it'd be great.

42
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,220
Even if you're doing it in like a cool
way in your mind, you might be hearing,

43
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,320
oh, I could really use your help. So even
if you're saying it in a perfect way,

44
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:25,290
it still might be hitting his ears
in a different way. So I don't know.

45
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,820
At this point, I think when I would
do is I would maybe just back off,

46
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,680
I would just go forward, uh,

47
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,320
treating him like one of the leaders
and expect him to perform as you expect

48
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:38,300
your leaders to perform. I
think you've made the effort,

49
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:41,120
it didn't really work and now you have a
job to do and you've got to get on with

50
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:45,530
it. There's also, you know,

51
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:50,531
the world doesn't revolve around his
pouting and his being negative and,

52
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,910
and you, you can't let that
happen. Now on top of that,

53
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,650
this guy's a powder and
he's a negative guy.

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,370
That's probably the reason he
didn't get selected to be promoted.

55
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,270
What we talked about
earlier, that boss saw that,

56
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,160
that he saw something along the way
where things didn't go his way and he,

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,870
and he pounded into his negative and
that's why he didn't get promoted.

58
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,530
Meanwhile, the guy that did get
promoted when things didn't go his way,

59
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,310
he's like, okay, cool.

60
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,040
Well we'll drive on with what the new
plan is and that's why you got promoted.

61
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,950
So I would say, move on, do your job.

62
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,800
Treat him like you would
treat one of your leaders.

63
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:28,450
I be very careful that you don't
over-correct because you hear me say like,

64
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,370
okay, I'm gonna treat him normal.

65
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,410
Now all of a sudden you're treating
them like crap. Don't do that.

66
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,340
But treat him as firmly and as fairly
as you would any one of your subordinate

67
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:41,590
leaders. And we have to see
where it goes from there.

68
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,630
He may end up just not being able
to deal with this fact. I mean,

69
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:50,080
there's, there's a reason why some people
get promoted and some people don't.

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,500
And maybe he's one of these
people that can't humble himself,

71
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,070
which is one of our biggest fears in
somebody that's trying to be a leader is

72
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,830
that they can't humble themselves.
And if that's what's going on,

73
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,870
he's going to have a long, hard road.

74
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,520
And you know whose
fault it is going to be?

75
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,400
Never his never going to be his fault.
It's everyone else's fault. And,

76
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,880
and that's, that'll be problematic.
