00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So here we have the Netherlands. Over here we have the land.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here's the sea and you can see that the sea levels a bit higher than the level of the land.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We have this dike preventing the sea from overtaking the land

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and of course we have this beautiful little wind mill powering this Archimedes' screw.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now seems like this is going to be a very difficult task. We have a lot water to move.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
To get you starting to think about just how difficult this task could be,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I want you to think about this question.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What two factors contribute most to the difficulty of this task?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So this windmill has a lot of work to do, what two factors contribute most?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Maybe the total weight of water or the total amount of water that we have to lift.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Maybe the cleanliness of the water is important.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Maybe it's the distance, which I've labeled here as d, that we have to lift the water

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or maybe the temperature of the water

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is the most important thing or one of the most two most important thing.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I want you to choose the best two answers here and then we can talk about that.
