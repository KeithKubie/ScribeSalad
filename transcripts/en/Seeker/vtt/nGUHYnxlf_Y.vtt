00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.220
Did you not get any sleep last night?

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.220
Neither did I.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.220
But fear not!

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.460
You can still get through your workday without
being a zombie.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.210
Hey everyone!

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.619
Reina filling in for DNews and I’m here
to break down your day so you can function

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.269
optimally without sleep.

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.580
Some sleepless nights are unavoidable and
I’m sure you see that you’re not quite

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.930
on your game the next day.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.910
The cold hard truth is that you absolutely
need, and sleep researchers could not stress

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.860
this enough, at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep
to function like a human being is supposed

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.860
to function.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.469
But there are ways you can structure your
day for when you skip out on a full night’s

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.670
rest so you can still make it through the
day and even be productive.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.230
First off, do NOT hit that snooze button.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.790
You’re just teasing yourself!

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.700
Orfeu Buxton, a professor in the division
of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.890
explains that those ten extra minutes won’t
contribute to restorative sleep nor will it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.070
help you be more alert.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.820
Your best option is to set your alarm to the
latest possible moment and force your way

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.820
up and out of bed.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.920
Next is breakfast.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.760
Research suggests it’s crucial to eat it
within an hour of waking up.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.120
It acts as a mood booster and improves cognitive
performance for the first half of your day.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.090
But that doesn’t mean you should just shove
any breakfast item in your face.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.880
Stay away from sugary things and simple carbs
because the sugar and insulin spike is going

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.340
to cause a crash, which will only worsen your
sleepiness.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.880
Take in some whole grains, fruit, protein,
and some coffee to help clear that sleep inertia

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.880
fog.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.650
Speaking of coffee, your body may take up
to 30 minutes to start feeling the effects

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.520
of caffeine, so you may wanna be taking in
your java earlier in the AM than you think.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.550
And you should also space out your caffeine
intake throughout the day and try not to consume

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.560
more than 4 cups of coffee.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.210
Now, you may want to put off tougher tasks
and creative work to later on in the day in

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.960
hopes that you’ll be more awake then.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.690
Unfortunately, that’s not the case because
if you’re sleep deprived, you’re actually

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.410
the most alert within three hours of waking
up for the day.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.960
I know, that’s a super small time frame
to try to complete your crucial tasks, but

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.350
get it out of the way first or else you’ll
just end up doing mindless busy work all day

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.250
that will make you sleepier and sleepier.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.610
It’s just a vicious cycle.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.320
Don’t forget to have a light lunch, again
try to stick to the healthy options like veggies

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.710
and lean protein.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.170
And this would also be a good time for your
caffeine boost since the afternoon is the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.920
drowsiest time in a workday.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.650
It’ll also help if you take a step outside.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.250
Sean Drummond, a psychiatrist at UC San Diego,
says that sunlight and fresh air will help

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.100
clear up the haze so you can make it through
the final stretch.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.750
Now as you’re approaching the end of your
day, this is the best time to power through

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.510
some work that doesn’t demand too much mental
focus.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.530
It turns out that sleep deprived people have
trouble concentrating for more than ten minutes

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.110
at a time anyway, so space out your busy work
and it’ll be time to go home before you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.110
know it.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.950
So do you think you’ll try these tips the
next time you fall short of a full night’s

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.950
sleep?
