00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.250
This exercise extends the heirarchy of the robot arm by adding the body object

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.000
so that the arm is attached to its top. Instead of adding the arm to the scene

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.525
itself, we create the body and then we attach the arm to the top of it. And

00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:12.213
that's really it.
