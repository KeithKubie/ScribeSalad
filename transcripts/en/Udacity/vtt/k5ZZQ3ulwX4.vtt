00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.480
I have scaffolded an empty function here called update,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.560
which takes as a single argument the year which we elect to update the map with.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.240
In order to update our map for a single year,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.470
we need to perform the following steps.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.090
First, we will be filtering our data for

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.620
the given year that we pass to our update function.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.040
And once we filter our data we need to remove any elements on our

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.320
map which no longer belong there.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.369
And the last piece of our update function is to add any new elements on

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.010
the page that weren't already on their before the update.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.150
In D3 we'll be filtering our data with its built in filter function,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.400
then select the given year we want to plot.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.580
To find any elements to remove, we'll be using the special exit selection

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.770
after the data bind, and to add any new elements for a given year.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.760
We'll use the familiar enter selection and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.260
the last bit that we haven't talked about yet.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.570
But an additional feature I want to add is to only show

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.500
the countries that are participating in the World Cup for the given year.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.090
Now let's see what all of these functions might look like in d3.
