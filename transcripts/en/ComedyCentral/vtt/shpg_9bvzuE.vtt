(Amy)
Whoa, save some for the fish!

00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:05.539
You're watching
"Gym Bummers."

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:08.976
â™ª

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.678
Welcome to Sports Central's
"Gym Bummers,"

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.547
the show about things
people do at the gym

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:15.148
that bum everyone out.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.018
Let's kick off the show with
this week's highlights.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.987
(Amy)
Our first Gym Bummer comes
to us from the Scrunch gym

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.889
in Montclair, New Jersey.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.390
Here comes
supplement-pushing,

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.058
unsolicited advice
guy.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.461
Doing the double tap.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:29.596
Here we go, having him
take out his headphones,

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.131
about to land and...

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:33.634
You're doing it wrong.
(Amy)
Boom!

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:34.968
Avert your eyes, folks.

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:35.969
It's the co-dependent
couple

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:37.104
working out together.

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:38.138
(man)
Hey, why molest
each other

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:39.406
in the comfort
of your own home

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.508
when you can do it in
full view of everyone?

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:42.576
We understand
that shoulder presses

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:43.577
are part of your
foreplay,

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:44.945
but if we
wanted to watch,

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.580
we'd find your YouPorn
channel.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.415
(alarm sounds)
Oh, you know what that
sound means.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.484
It's time for
the lightning round.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:51.919
Code red, code red.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.121
Indian guy working out
in jeans.

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.923
Just gonna take a shot
in the dark here.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.224
I don't think this
gentleman's gonna shower

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.026
after this gym visit.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.861
Woman who dresses
like Mr. Mistoffelees

00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.063
from the musical "Cats."

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.598
Guy who picks the treadmill
right next to you

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:05.966
when there's
plenty available

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.601
and runs sideways
facing you.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:08.936
Man, I don't
think it's true

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.504
that poodles are
the smartest.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:11.538
He's got nothing
to say

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:12.539
but wants
everyone to hear it.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:13.674
That's a rare double
bummer.

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.077
It's the classic
grunt and drop.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:18.412
(roaring)

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:19.446
Yeah!

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.447
Ugh.

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:21.515
Easy, Drago.

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:23.283
No one's invading
your village.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.085
And that's the end
of the lightning round.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.988
Whew, well, now it's time
for Bummer of the Week.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.891
A fully-dressed
couple

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:31.959
who just
checked into a hotel

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.393
are surveying
the gym.

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.595
They didn't even bring
gym clothes.

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:36.096
"Yeah, wow, honey.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.598
There are a lot
of towels in here."

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:40.100
Stop lying to yourselves.
You're never gonna use it.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.202
You're never gonna use it!

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.104
And that's
all the time we have.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:46.440
Tune in next week
for "Gym Bummers:
Locker Room Edition,"

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.976
where a naked old guy
with a hanging scrotum

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.444
blow-dries his hair
for 90 minutes.

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:56.544
