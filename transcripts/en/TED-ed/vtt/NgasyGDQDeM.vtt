00:00:05.726 --> 00:00:07.479
When I look at science education,

00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:09.742
I see a divide.

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.802
I see a divide between

00:00:10.826 --> 00:00:11.810
doing science

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:12.702
and learning science.

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:15.459
And now if you're a kid
in that system of education,

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:17.204
and you want to do science,

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:18.995
you want to do authentic research,

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.251
you may have to wait a long time for that

00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:22.536
because the first moment

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.280
in our system of science education

00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:27.358
where we universally expect
students to do science

00:00:27.382 --> 00:00:29.580
often doesn't come until graduate school.

00:00:29.604 --> 00:00:31.374
And this is what sets up the divide.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:34.459
It sets up a divide
between teachers and scientists,

00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:36.334
and it sets up a divide in general

00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:39.088
between learning science
and doing science.

00:00:39.112 --> 00:00:41.281
But I think we can overcome this divide

00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:43.758
if teachers and scientists work together.

00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:45.878
And I think teachers
are uniquely positioned

00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:47.047
to reach out to scientists

00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:48.558
and make this happen.

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.034
In my own classroom,

00:00:50.058 --> 00:00:52.508
I've had some success with this model.

00:00:52.532 --> 00:00:54.485
And so I'd like to use my own experiences

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:55.620
to kind of illustrate

00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:58.711
how an individual teacher
can reach out to scientists

00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:01.451
and make more science
happen in their classrooms.

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:04.070
I had the opportunity to develop

00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:06.741
my own professional development program

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.527
in the summer through an organization

00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:10.039
called Fund for Teachers.

00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:12.016
The way they work is they're kind of like

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.101
venture capitalists for educators.

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:16.088
You go to them with an idea and you say,

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:18.753
'Hey, this is going to make
me a better teacher.

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:20.432
This is going to help my students learn.'

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:22.552
And if they like your idea
and they're able,

00:01:22.576 --> 00:01:25.131
they fund it, and they make
that idea happen for you.

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:27.618
So, the idea that I pitched to them

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:31.406
was an idea that would get
me doing more science

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.002
because that was important to me.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:34.503
But it was also important to me

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.477
that I do it in such a way

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:39.396
that it would capture
the imagination of my students.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.504
So, the idea that I pitched to them

00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:44.292
was a thousand-mile expedition
on the Mississippi River

00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:46.536
to gather data on nutrient pollution.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.295
And for 27 days that summer,

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.961
I was immersed in the process
of doing science

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:54.455
on one of the mightiest
rivers on the planet.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.882
When we would come ashore,

00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:58.041
after paddling six to ten hours a day,

00:01:58.065 --> 00:01:59.792
we would set up a temporary lab,

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:01.981
and we'd conduct water tests.

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:03.428
In prepping for this,

00:02:03.452 --> 00:02:06.776
I quickly realized
how poorly my own education

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.252
had prepared me to do science

00:02:08.276 --> 00:02:10.309
of this nature and of this scope.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.292
So, what I did was I reached
out to experts.

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:14.935
I just simply looked through journals,

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.817
and I found who was the leading experts

00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:18.853
in nutrient pollution in major rivers,

00:02:18.877 --> 00:02:21.116
and I started firing
off emails with questions.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.227
And I was astounded
at the responses I got.

00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:25.985
Scientists responded thoroughly,

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:27.959
and they were genuinely interested

00:02:27.983 --> 00:02:30.323
in helping me do better science.

00:02:30.347 --> 00:02:32.824
So, I kind of put that information
in my back pocket

00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:34.944
that professional
scientists were a resource

00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:36.135
that I could draw from.

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.508
When I went back
to my classroom in the fall,

00:02:38.532 --> 00:02:41.334
my students were able
to use the same methods

00:02:41.358 --> 00:02:42.882
that I had learned in the summer

00:02:42.906 --> 00:02:45.466
on a river in their own back
yard, the Chicago River,

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.711
to do real science.

00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:49.211
And I could see this
breakdown of the barrier

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:50.897
between doing science
and learning science,

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:52.683
and it was happening in my classroom,

00:02:52.707 --> 00:02:53.930
and I wanted more of it.

00:02:53.954 --> 00:02:57.058
So, the next summer, I reached
out to scientists again.

00:02:57.082 --> 00:02:59.140
And I pretty quickly came across

00:02:59.164 --> 00:03:02.390
an evolutionary ecology lab at Iowa State.

00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:04.732
And they shared my philosophy

00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:06.401
that there should be no separation

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:08.811
between doing science
and learning science.

00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:10.655
They worked on turtle reproduction,

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.523
specifically how climate change

00:03:12.547 --> 00:03:15.809
affects the evolution of turtle
reproductive behavior,

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:18.551
and they worked on an island
in the Mississippi River.

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:20.267
So, I was thrilled again to be out

00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:22.039
on the river for another summer.

00:03:22.063 --> 00:03:24.155
But, because they shared
my believes on education,

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:26.130
we were able to bring high
school students out there

00:03:26.154 --> 00:03:27.423
for two weeks at a time

00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:28.379
and turn them loose

00:03:28.403 --> 00:03:30.308
on their own authentic research projects

00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:31.800
on the biology of turtles,

00:03:31.824 --> 00:03:32.302
snakes,

00:03:32.326 --> 00:03:33.274
lizards.

00:03:33.298 --> 00:03:35.221
And, in that experience,

00:03:35.245 --> 00:03:37.736
working side by side with people

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.046
at all different stages
of their academic career,

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.562
we had the high school students
working beside undergrads,

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:44.158
working beside graduate students,

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:45.618
working beside professionals.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:48.234
I left that experience
absolutely convinced

00:03:48.258 --> 00:03:50.569
that this is the right
way to teach science,

00:03:50.593 --> 00:03:53.118
with no separation between doing science

00:03:53.142 --> 00:03:55.090
and learning science.

00:03:55.114 --> 00:03:57.396
I continued to keep up my relationships

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.916
with these scientists,

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.750
and I got to the point where
I wanted to try something new,

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:03.632
something that hadn't been done before.

00:04:03.656 --> 00:04:06.333
I wanted to bring those kinds
of science experiences

00:04:06.357 --> 00:04:09.572
that we were having
with kids out at the river,

00:04:09.596 --> 00:04:11.796
and I wanted to put those
into our classroom.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:12.800
And it was important to me

00:04:12.824 --> 00:04:15.298
that it wasn't simply a one-off

00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:17.265
or a one-day special field trip.

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.205
I wanted this kind of science

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.924
to be a part of the everyday
science curriculum

00:04:21.948 --> 00:04:24.241
for an entire school year.

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:25.789
So, as we were thinking of this,

00:04:25.813 --> 00:04:29.653
in planning for how we could
make this happen realistically,

00:04:29.677 --> 00:04:32.058
we reached out to the National
Science Foundation,

00:04:32.082 --> 00:04:35.472
and we applied to a Research
Experience for Teachers grant,

00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:36.725
or the RET.

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.925
And now, teachers have to partner

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.980
with a researcher who is already
supported by the NSF

00:04:42.004 --> 00:04:43.633
to apply for this grant,

00:04:43.657 --> 00:04:46.181
but I think that just gives
you one more great excuse

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:47.556
to partner with a scientist.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.821
And what we did is we used our NSF funding

00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:52.112
to travel down to Florida,

00:04:52.136 --> 00:04:54.069
with the permission of the state Florida

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.623
catch a bunch of lizards,

00:04:55.647 --> 00:04:58.375
and FedEx them back
to my classroom in Chicago

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:01.162
where we had set-up
a functioning, live animal lab.

00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:03.043
So, when my students came to school

00:05:03.067 --> 00:05:04.603
for the first day in September,

00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:08.303
they immediately began work
on a scientific experiment

00:05:08.327 --> 00:05:09.944
that would answer a very
specific question.

00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:11.051
Our question was,

00:05:11.075 --> 00:05:13.906
"How do females make choices
when they lay eggs?

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.407
How do they choose a nest site?

00:05:15.431 --> 00:05:18.783
And what effect does that choice
have on their offspring?"

00:05:18.807 --> 00:05:21.262
And, by the end of the year,

00:05:21.286 --> 00:05:23.169
they had generated data

00:05:23.193 --> 00:05:26.069
and performed science
that answered that question.

00:05:26.093 --> 00:05:27.364
And I was extremely happy

00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:29.614
when our work was recently published

00:05:29.638 --> 00:05:32.210
in the January edition
of &lt;em&gt;Behavioral Ecology&lt;/em&gt;.

00:05:32.234 --> 00:05:34.744
And, to my knowledge,
this is the first time

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:36.287
that work conducted as part

00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:37.962
of a normal high school curriculum

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:40.190
resulted in a peer-reviewed paper.

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:42.727
So, I have three pieces of advice

00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:45.458
for teachers who want
to make these connections

00:05:45.482 --> 00:05:47.435
with scientists and want to blur the line

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:49.804
between doing science
and learning science.

00:05:49.828 --> 00:05:51.484
Number 1,

00:05:51.508 --> 00:05:54.080
look out for those great
resources that are out there.

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.616
Apply for an RET grant,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.303
apply for a Fund for Teachers fellowship.

00:05:58.327 --> 00:06:00.661
I know what a difference
those resources can make.

00:06:00.685 --> 00:06:02.785
And there's more resources
available locally,

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:04.429
and you should look for those, too

00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:06.640
because they can influence the amount

00:06:06.664 --> 00:06:09.555
that you are able to accomplish.
I know that.

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:13.836
However, my number 2 piece of advice is

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.626
don't let a lack of resources stop you

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.508
from making those connections
with professional science.

00:06:19.532 --> 00:06:21.337
Reach out to a scientist today,

00:06:21.361 --> 00:06:23.412
no matter what your resource level is.

00:06:23.436 --> 00:06:24.597
You can start small.

00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:26.598
Invite a scientist in for a talk.

00:06:26.622 --> 00:06:29.576
Set up a Skype chat
between a scientist and their lab.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.221
Then, maybe you can move up to

00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:33.472
more large-scale project-based learning.

00:06:33.496 --> 00:06:34.564
But, whatever you do,

00:06:34.588 --> 00:06:36.874
make sure that you're
forming these partnerships

00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:39.303
with people who do science for a living.

00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:41.904
And my third point acknowledges

00:06:41.928 --> 00:06:44.452
some of the realities
that teachers are facing today.

00:06:44.476 --> 00:06:47.037
I know that the pressure
of high-stakes testing

00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:48.410
and the climate that creates

00:06:48.434 --> 00:06:51.225
can make it feel almost
a little bit subversive

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:53.719
to deviate from the standard curriculum.

00:06:53.743 --> 00:06:56.141
So, my final piece of advice is

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.860
be a bit subversive if you have to.

00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:01.252
Make sure, though, that you
are doing science.

00:07:01.276 --> 00:07:04.307
And I don't mean be
confrontational when I say this

00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:05.767
because that's not productive.

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:08.061
But take the steps you need to

00:07:08.085 --> 00:07:09.854
to blur those lines between doing science

00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:11.605
and learning science for your students.

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:13.775
And I think you'll find
that when people see

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:15.859
how engaged in learning your students are,

00:07:15.883 --> 00:07:17.189
and you're getting good results,

00:07:17.213 --> 00:07:18.913
all your opposition
is just going to kind of

00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:20.075
melt away from that,

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:22.950
and you're going to turn
people into supporters.

00:07:22.974 --> 00:07:26.242
So, I think that this
is the right way to teach science

00:07:26.266 --> 00:07:28.266
where we're teaching the doing of science.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.419
And I think it's important to do this also

00:07:30.443 --> 00:07:31.388
because this is the way

00:07:31.412 --> 00:07:33.917
that you would have wanted
to learn science as a kid,

00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:36.084
and, more importantly,
I think this is the way

00:07:36.108 --> 00:07:38.501
that you would want your kids
to be taught science.

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:40.049
And this is the highest standard

00:07:40.073 --> 00:07:42.758
that you can hold yourself
to as a science educator.

00:07:42.782 --> 00:07:44.649
So, good luck making those connections,

00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:46.343
and go do some science!

00:07:46.367 --> 00:07:47.748
Thank you.
