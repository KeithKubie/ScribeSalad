00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.390
‘The Inner Idiot’ is a bracing term used
to describe a substantial, hugely influential

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.349
and strenuously concealed part of everyone.
An Idiot is what we deeply fear being, it

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.539
is what we suspect in our darkest hours that
we might be – and it is what we should simply

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.210
accept, with humour and good grace, that we
often truly are. A decent life isn’t one

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.509
in which we foolishly believe we can slay
or evade The Inner Idiot; it’s one in which

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:38.180
we practice the only art available to us:
sensible cohabitation. The Inner Idiot makes

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.170
itself felt at moments small and large. The
Idiot is clumsy: it forgets names, loses important

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.260
documents, spills food down its front and
gets air kisses wrong. It speaks out of turn,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.199
thrusts itself forward at inopportune moments,
both babbles and blushes. The Idiot is prickly,

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.880
it gets into a rage because it was momentarily
ignored, it sees plots against it where there

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.360
was only accident, it shouts when a drawer
won’t open properly and it is immediately

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.170
self-righteous when faced with the most minor
criticism. It is, for the Idiot, always someone

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.990
else’s fault. The Inner Idiot is a child
on a bad day. We know our own Inner Idiot

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.799
from the inside and might suppose it is unique
to us. In fact, it represents what might be

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.740
called the ‘lower’ self of all of humanity.
It is only residual good manners that has

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.130
made the Inner Idiot of others less obvious
to us – and hence made our own seem like

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.880
a freakish exception. Much of wisdom consists
in accepting that the Inner Idiot isn’t

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.110
ever going to go away and realising that we
must therefore endeavour to form a good working

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.799
relationship with it. Trying to prevent the
emergence of the Inner Idiot otherwise inspires

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.000
a range of unfortunate traits. For example,
we may lose confidence and grow unnecessarily

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.710
meek and cautious in a bid always to appear
dignified in front of others. We may refuse

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.840
ever to ask someone for a date or for a pay
rise, we might never go travelling on our

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.170
own or give a speech in public, all of these
moves that require a calculated risk of being

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.580
hijacked by the Idiot. Or else, by denying
our Idiot, we may grow unfeasibly pompous

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.670
and stiff. Nothing makes us seem absurd faster
than to insist on our own seriousness. We

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.810
are always better off confessing to Idiocy
in good time, rather than letting it emerge

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.910
from behind our carefully-constructed pretensions.
In relationships, there can be no greater

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.020
generosity than to tell a partner, early on,
what our Inner Idiot is like, to give them

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.150
a road map to its antics – and always to
apologise promptly and warmly when it has

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.700
overwhelmed us. None of us should try to find
a partner who lacks an Inner Idiot (it’s

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.450
impossible); we should just find out more
about the particular kind of Idiot they have.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.480
In a wiser world, an entirely standard and
wholly inoffensive question on an early dinner

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.800
date would be: ‘And what is your Inner Idiot
like?’

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.880
The best school for learning
about the Inner Idiot is comedy. The essence

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.390
of comedy is to expose the workings of the
Idiot in way that invites sympathetic laughter

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.820
rather than harsh criticism. The stand-up
artist is a sage who knows how to redescribe

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.620
their Idiot with benevolence – and teaches
us to do the same. Love is another solution

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.820
to the problems of the Inner Idiot. In its
most mature and desired sense, love means

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.080
encountering and eventually, embracing the
Idiot of another and regarding it not with

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.910
horror or as an affront – but with all the
imagination and generosity with which a parent

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.200
might look upon their beloved red-faced two
year old in a tantrum. It’s not very nice

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.330
that we have an Inner Idiot. In fact, it’s
an immense inconvenience. But we cannot wish

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.360
the issue away. A wise society would be very
ambitious about understanding, accommodating

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.980
and forgiving the Inner Idiot in everyone
– and would be devoted to finding ways to

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.920
soothe it and limit its influence.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.040
It is one of the greatest of all human achievement when we can finally

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.880
move from seeing someone as an ‘Idiot’

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.800
to being able to consider them as that far
less offensive and far more morally-hybrid

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.480
creature: a ‘Loveable Idiot.’
