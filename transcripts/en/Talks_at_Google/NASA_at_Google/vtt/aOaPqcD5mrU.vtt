00:00:01.774 --> 00:00:02.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.620
Hi everyone on the live stream.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.840
I am here today to introduce
Yvonne Pendleton, who

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.150
is the director of solar system
exploration research at NASA.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.200
And she began her
career at NASA and 1979,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.620
has a Bachelors
degree in aerospace

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.270
engineering from Georgia
Tech, a Masters from Stanford,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.030
and a PhD in astrophysics
from UC Santa Cruz.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.960
She's also a fellow at the
Cal Academy of Sciences

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.980
and has an asteroid
named after her.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.330
So please join me in
welcoming Yvonne Pendleton.

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.040
YVONNE PENDLETON:
It's my pleasure

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.390
to bring you news from your
next door neighbor at NASA Ames

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.700
Research Center about what we're
doing in the virtual world.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.200
So the exact title
of our institute,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.650
which we call SERVI for
short, is, as you just heard,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.710
Solar System Exploration
Research Virtual institute.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.740
And it's that last
part, virtual Institute,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.820
that really makes us
different from a number

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.060
of other activities and things
that you might hear about.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.420
So I'm going to
go on in a second,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.010
but I'm want to first introduce
to you two of our staff members

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.900
that I brought with me today.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.030
We have a small
central office located

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.080
at NASA Ames that
helps coordinate

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.940
the activities of the
hundreds of researchers

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.440
that we have distributed
across the country.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.270
And with me today, I have our
staff scientist Brad Bailey

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.350
who's here in the
audience, and also

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.130
Brian Day who's our
director of communications

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.630
and public engagement.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.290
So when it comes
time for questions,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.150
if you have any
questions that pertain

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.910
to either the
activities of our teams,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.010
or the outreach that
we do, they will

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.990
be able to help me
answer and go deeper.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.870
OK, so let me just
start by asking,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.640
what is a virtual Institute?

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.490
For some of you, you may not
have heard this term before.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.970
Or for those of
you who have, you

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.530
may have a different
idea from what

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.190
it is that we
actually do at SERVI.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.900
So in our idea, a
virtual Institute

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.820
is a distributed
organization that

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.200
allows you to pick the very
best investigations, teams

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.250
and facilities from
wherever they are.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.100
You don't have to be restricted
by geographical location

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.210
for somebody who has a certain
type of laboratory working

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.890
with another group
that might have

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.160
more expertise in
some other area.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.340
And by sharing the students,
and the facilities,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.100
and the resources that
the various teams bring

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.350
to the organization,
you can actually

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.690
build a stronger
institute, I maintain,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.800
than if you just had a
traditional bricks and mortar

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.850
building.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.600
So I think you get more
bang for your buck.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.030
The small office that we have
that NASA Ames Research Center

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.950
is able to coordinate and
help the collaboration,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.900
both within the teams and
across the team lines.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.120
And we're able to do this
across a very interdisciplinary

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.340
subject area.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.230
And I'll tell you more about our
subject area in just a minute.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.896
But first, I want to
tell you that there

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:18.940
is a history of virtual
institutes at Ames.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.000
NASA has started the NASA
Astrobiology Institute,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.770
which began in 1998 at Ames.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.550
It's still going very strong.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.650
And then in 2008, the NASA Lunar
Science Institute was born.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.770
That is actually the
predecessor for SERVI,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.180
and we have taken our
studies of the Moon

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.110
and expanded them now to include
studies also of near Earth

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.200
asteroids, and
the moons of Mars.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.200
Then, we also have to NASA
Aeronautics Research Institute,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.560
which began in 2012.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.740
And SERVI was just born
last year, well in 2013,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.350
a little over a year ago now.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.480
OK, so this diagram,
this drawing,

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.750
is indicating the orbits of most
of the near Earth asteroids.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.340
I say most because
we think we have

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.400
found most of the large ones.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.390
But there are probably still a
few that we don't know about.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.149
And when you see that
kind of involvement

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.320
of where they are located
relative to the Earth,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.990
I think it becomes obvious
why NASA felt the need

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.100
to expand our purview to go
beyond studies of the Moon.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.980
And that's why we now
include, as it says here,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.830
the near Earth
asteroids, and also

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.560
the moons of Mars,
which we believe

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.250
may have been captured
asteroids themselves.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.580
This institute is funded jointly
by both the Science Mission

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.920
Directorate at NASA
headquarters in Washington, DC,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.330
but also the human exploration
side what NASA does.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.600
And so, this is a
very important bridge

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.220
to join together science
and exploration so that you

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.150
are addressing the
science questions you

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.250
need to know before you go.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.650
So before we take humans
anywhere beyond low Earth orbit

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.480
again, there are certain
questions we want to address.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.350
And our teams are looking at
what those conditions might

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.070
be that will help us get
there, and get there safely.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.000
So in more detail what
does SERVI actually study?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.370
Well, we have a long
list of items here,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.320
but the role of
the Moon is still

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.350
very important to what we do.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.770
We study the origin,
the composition,

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.300
the dynamics of all
of these bodies.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.210
So we'd like to know,
in particular, what kind

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.310
of questions cover
multiple bodies.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.070
In other words, if you
were interested in the dust

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.740
or the regolith that sits
on the Moon's surface,

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.960
you might have some of
the very same questions

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.630
that apply to the moons
of Mars, Phobos and Deimos

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.060
and similarly to asteroids.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.810
And by understanding the
composition of these materials,

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.270
you would better be able
to design both vehicles

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.130
and environments for humans to
live in on any of those bodies,

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.770
or even just to go there
for a short time to work.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.740
Volatiles.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.990
In its broadest sense,
these are materials

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.600
that may be able to be
liberated up from the surface,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.140
or ice from down deep
inside of a crater.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.100
Those are very
important to us as well.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.650
And they cover, again, the
multitude of the bodies

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.120
that we study.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.820
And you can read down this list
a number of the other areas

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.850
that SERVI is concerned with.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.040
So we put out a proposal
a little over a year

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.050
ago for teams to reply to.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.700
And from that, we
selected nine teams.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.360
And here are the
principal investigators

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.520
that make up the current
composition of the SERVI

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.270
Institute teams.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:01.080
And you can see that the
principal investigators, just

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.160
in alphabetical
order here, I've got

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.160
to Bill Bottke who is from the
Southwest Research Institute,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.840
and Dan Britt, who is from the
University of Central Florida.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.170
Ben Bussey from the
Applied Physics Laboratory

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.160
has just recently been
replaced by Andy Rivkin

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.610
because Ben Bussey is now the
chief scientist in the Human

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.400
Exploration and
Mission Operations

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.910
Directorate at
NASA headquarters.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.490
Then we go on to
Bill Farrell who

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.930
is at the Goddard
Space Flight Center.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.660
This is on the East Coast just
outside of Washington, DC.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.660
Tim Glotch who is at Stony
Brook University up in New York.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.560
Jennifer Heldmann from
NASA Ames Research Center.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.150
Mihaly Horanyia at the
University of Colorado,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.900
David Kring who is in Houston
at the Lunar and Planetary

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.390
Institute, and Carle
Pieters at Brown University.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.040
So each one of these
principal investigators

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.960
put together the very
best team they could find.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.760
They're usually somewhere around
30 to 50 people in number.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.260
And they could be located at
the university or facility

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.660
that I just mentioned where
their principal investigator

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.670
is.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.740
Or maybe not.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.110
They themselves would
have a distribution

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.370
across the country.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:23.802
And all of our teams communicate
using the virtual technology

00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:25.990
that I'll tell you a little
bit about in a minute.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.070
And we get together once
in a while in person,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:35.190
but by and large these are
virtual communications.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.260
OK, we also have eight
international partners.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.340
Why would international
partners care

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.160
about joining a domestic
group like NASA's SERVI?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.200
Well it turns out, through a
no exchange of funds basis,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.200
if they become a
partner with us,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.030
it facilitates their
getting the resources

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.030
within their own
country to develop

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.730
whatever kind of
program they wanted

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.370
to develop that's
relevant to what we do.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.450
Perhaps it's
investigating the Moon.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.680
Or in the case of
Korea, they're very

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.240
interested in going to the
Moon with a mission themselves.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.180
Whatever the
country interest is,

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.410
if it relates to what we
do with our domestic teams,

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.330
we are happy to entertain
a proposal from them.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.940
And so far eight
of them have been

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.200
accepted into our
international family.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.340
And then we urge
cross collaboration

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.750
between the domestic teams
and international partners.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.460
And that's going really well.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.110
This is a distribution of where
the principal investigators

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.140
and the co-investigators are
just for the domestic teams.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.830
And again, just to
give you an idea

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.020
that there are a total
of 318 researchers,

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.100
including the students.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.920
There are many students that
are involved with these teams.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.640
And the average team
size is roughly 30.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.160
We have one that's
up to 60 in number.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.160
OK, so getting down to
more details about what

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.630
these teams actually
do, I've selected

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.260
just a few research highlights.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.270
They have many.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.000
I mean each one of
these teams could easily

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.990
take up an entire
hour just to tell you

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.610
the fascinating
work they're doing.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.650
But let me just give
you a few highlights.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.270
So Dan Britt at the
University of Central Florida

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.680
has a team called the Center
for Lunar and Asteroid Surface

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.080
Science.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.190
And they study the
physical properties

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.170
of regoliths, the
dust that we've

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.990
talked about on the surface
of bodies like the Moon,

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.710
but also asteroids
and the moons of Mars.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.150
The geotechnical properties,
the micro gravity effects

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:40.810
that you might encounter, impact
ejecta dynamics, hydration,

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.390
and weathering of the
near Earth asteroids.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.600
Over time, the four-and-a-half
billion years that these bodies

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.010
have been in space, there's
been a lot of weathering

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:49.900
that's happened.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.060
And the charging
and mobilization

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.350
of dust on the surface
of any of these

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.330
is going to affect any machinery
you're going to put there,

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:02.140
and certainly the
astronauts themselves.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.320
So then, the next
one, Andy Rivkin,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.110
the Applied Physics Laboratory
at Johns Hopkins University.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.940
Their team is called
VORTICES, a very long name,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.410
and NASA loves its acronyms.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.617
So you can see how they
developed VORTICES out

00:11:17.617 --> 00:11:18.200
of their name.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.340
But they study
volatiles, regolith,

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.050
and thermal investigations.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.800
They look at the sources,
sinks and processes

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.780
and the interaction
that various materials

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.420
will have with the
regoliths, and the evolution

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.250
of that dust on all
of the target bodies.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.940
OK, the group at the
Goddard Space Flight Center,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.610
led by Bill Farrell, this is
called the Dream Two Team.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.280
And the reason it's
called Dream Two

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.380
is because Dream One was part
of the NASA Lunar Science

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.630
Institute, which I was also the
director of in the last couple

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.370
of years before it
transitioned into SERVI.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.030
So I got to know the teams
from the NASA Lunar Science

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.510
Institute pretty well.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.310
And I was really pleased that
when we had our peer review

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.130
process of the
proposals, it turned out

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.410
several of the principal
investigators who

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.420
had been leading teams under
the Lunar Science Institute

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.820
were selected for SERVI.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.880
So Bill Farrell
was one of those.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.140
And the dynamic
responsive environments

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.040
at asteroids, the Moon,
and the moons of Mars

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.310
is what he calls Dream Two.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.780
They study plasmas,
the plasma interaction

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.140
that comes from the solar wind.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.850
When the solar wind
comes and interacts

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.520
with a body like
the Moon, it does

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.360
a number of interesting things.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.920
And the fact that we now
see OH all over the surface

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.240
of the Moon, and the solar
wind contains hydrogen

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:50.500
as it's traveling and runs
into the regolith on the Moon,

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.360
you can see how the
H and the OH can

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.040
get together and form water.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.000
So the plasma processes, as
they interact with the Moon

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.570
and the other bodies,
are very important.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.590
And you can also
see here that we

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.895
have the solar wind
charging of asteroids.

00:13:07.895 --> 00:13:09.520
This is something
else that they study.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.350
They model this.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.420
We have a lot of
interesting results

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.900
that show the kinds
of things that you

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.120
need to think about when
you're looking at the charging

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.930
from these kinds
of interactions.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.000
Timothy Glotch from
Stony Brook University

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.160
has a team that they
called The Rise Team.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.660
And they do the remote
sensing of airless bodies.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.150
Field operations and metrics
for human exploration,

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.080
they look at the reactivity
and the toxicity of regoliths.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.750
These can be
dangerous to humans.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.140
So you know, when the
astronauts were on the Moon,

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.650
the spacesuits were
just covered with dust.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.130
And getting back
into the vehicle,

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.990
this is a concern, because if
you're breathing in that dust,

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.530
it turned out it was a very
sharp, jagged kind of material.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.420
And it can be really,
really harmful

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.810
over the long period of time.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.580
So they look at that
and try and understand

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.900
what we have to
mitigate against.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.830
They also do synchrotron
analyses of samples.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.780
And they look at volcanics
and impact crater analogue

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.350
research.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.580
Which means you go to places on
the Earth that look like good

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:24.790
analogues for places
you want to go in space,

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.290
and you try out some
your machinery and some

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:32.590
of your techniques to see
how they would best work.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.840
OK, continuing on
Mihaly Horanyia

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.630
from the University of
Colorado, his Institute team,

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.900
called Impact, has developed
the world's fastest dust

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.080
accelerator.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.090
And this is open to the
entire scientific community

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.710
and exploration community, so
that people can take samples

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:53.430
there.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.980
They can try out
new experiments.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.990
And it's really going well.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.960
They're doing a lot
of phenomenal work.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.320
And they have just
built a new ion

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.410
gun that simulates the
solar wind so that they

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.070
can extend this
research even further.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.200
And here you can see the
penetration and the charging

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.610
studies that they do as well.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.860
Carle Pieters from Brown
University, her team

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.645
does a lot of interesting
stuff with the evolution

00:15:26.645 --> 00:15:30.440
and environment of
whatever destination

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.810
we're going to go to.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.600
But I'd like to really
highlight the work that they've

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.380
done on the Moon,
because I think

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.650
one of the most exciting
results that we've learned

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.990
about the Moon is the
fact that it's so wet.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.410
Now, it's wet compared to
what we thought it was.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:50.130
It was so dry a few years ago.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.260
I mean we thought
it was very dry.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.590
And it's maybe about as
wet as the Sahara Desert.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.540
But that's still lot wetter
than that what we thought.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.760
So to put it all in
perspective, but the water

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.850
is in very different locations.

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.030
And that indicates it came
from probably at least

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.020
three sources, three
different sources.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.772
And the one that we
found inside the crater

00:16:15.772 --> 00:16:17.980
when we had the LCROSS
mission-- I'm sure many of you

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.690
would remember that a
few years ago in 2009.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.530
This was a mission
that went to the Moon,

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.570
deliberately crashed
into a crater,

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.920
kicked up, excavated
a bunch of material,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.060
and then studied what
the composition was.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.190
The LCROSS mission, which
was developed at Ames,

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.440
revealed that we have
water ice in the bottom

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.100
of a crater, the Cabeus crater.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.750
Well, that was
great confirmation.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.670
We were all very
excited about it.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.220
But frankly, I wasn't
all that surprised.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:47.963
I kind of thought
there would be ice down

00:16:47.963 --> 00:16:49.560
in the bottom of a crater.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.060
What I didn't expect
was that we have

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:56.740
water in the rocks that came
up from deep inside the Moon

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.260
that the astronauts picked up.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.040
In the Apollo samples, it
turns out some of those samples

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.859
that they brought back contained
glass beads, volcanic glass

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:07.750
beads that could protect
the water inside it.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.079
And now, all these years
later, we have the technology,

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:14.339
we have the instruments to go
back and analyze those samples

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.359
in greater depth
and differently.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:19.780
And that's where we found
quite a bit more water

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.270
than we previously thought.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.010
And then, the third
component of water I

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:28.770
already mentioned to you, which
is the OH that exists literally

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.800
across the Moon in very
different terrains.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.630
And the interesting
thing about that

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.250
is that it seems to be
replenished on a current cycle.

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.610
This isn't just water that
was deposited a long time ago,

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:47.090
like deep in the crater that
happened a long time ago,

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.030
and that's that,
and this is now.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.170
We think we're seeing
actual replenishment

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.835
in these different
scenarios, and not

00:17:54.835 --> 00:17:56.210
the water deep in
the Moon coming

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.710
up, but of the one
on the surface,

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:59.420
and also some of the craters.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:02.660
And that's fascinating
to me, because that just

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.820
changes a lot of
the physics of what

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.890
we thought was
happening on the Moon.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.640
And if we understand how
it's happening on the Moon,

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.265
we then understand
more about how

00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:15.940
it could happen on Phobos
and Deimos, and other bodies,

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.810
and near Earth asteroids
that we might go to.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:23.880
OK, so going on to a couple more
of our teams, Bill Bottke, who

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.940
runs a very interesting team
out of the Southwest Research

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.740
Institute in Boulder,
Colorado, they

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.470
do a lot of theoretical
modeling where

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.430
they look at the dynamics
and the formation

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.110
of the early solar system.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.730
In fact, in just
about a week I'm

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.220
going to be at a conference.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.380
It's all about early
bombardment of the solar system.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.940
And they'll be talking
about what happened when.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.020
What big bodies hit
the Earth and the Moon,

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.280
what they did,
when they hit, how

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.770
they affected the other
terrestrial planets.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.810
And computer models
can really tell us

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.790
a lot about how all
of this happened.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.680
The migration of planets
from the early part

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.350
of the solar system to today has
a lot to do with the dynamics

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.950
that these bodies
found themselves on,

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.460
the trajectories and
that sort of thing.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.920
He also looks at things
like how asteroids

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.570
could be stuck together, or
how easily you could pull them

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:21.320
apart.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.950
One of the concerns we have with
asteroids is that some of them

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.516
seem to be extremely fragile.

00:19:28.516 --> 00:19:30.640
And you don't want to have
a mission to an asteroid

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.560
that you go up to, and
as soon as you touch it,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.640
the whole thing falls apart.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.473
And now, you've got a
whole bunch of little,

00:19:35.473 --> 00:19:37.400
or maybe not so little, pieces.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.240
And the models that
we have are helping us

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.270
understand how that works.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.270
Jennifer Heldmann at
Ames Research Center

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:51.640
is leading a team that she calls
FINESSE, a very nice acronym.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:57.360
And what she's doing is looking
again into the Earth analogues

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.630
that I mentioned just
a little while ago,

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.000
so that you can really
understand what you should do

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.080
when, if you were out exploring,
both with humans and with

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.850
machines.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:12.560
So for instance, their team
went to a couple of places

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.710
in this past year.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.440
And the one that I'd like to
tell you about is in Idaho.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.790
It's called Craters of the Moon.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.610
Maybe some of you have been
to this national monument.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:27.230
And they looked at the way
you would operate machinery

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.710
from a distance, simulating
what it would be like

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.020
if you had a back science
room here on Earth trying

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.840
to run something on the
Moon, or on an asteroid.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:44.140
And so, they did take quite a
bit building in the time delay

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.170
that you'd have
in communications,

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.825
things like that.

00:20:48.825 --> 00:20:52.430
Let's see, and the
last team that I'm want

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:55.280
to mention here, David Kring
from the Lunar and Planetary

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.910
Institute in Houston.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.670
They study the inner solar
system impact processes.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.640
And you'll see a
similarity in themes

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.174
in all the things
I'm saying here.

00:21:05.174 --> 00:21:06.840
It's probably kind
of blending together,

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.050
like which one does what?

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:08.890
Well, you know what?

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.500
That's exactly the purpose.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.310
We want them to blend together.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.150
We want to not see
the lines between what

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.790
these different teams
do, because I believe

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.590
it's by the collaboration
and the crossover,

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.460
what these teams
bring to the table,

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.200
that new science gets developed,
new directions are found.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.140
And this is where the
most creative discoveries

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.040
seem to be happening.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.360
So what David does is
he looks at the impact

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.360
history and processes, the
geochemistry of the regoliths,

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.470
and age dating of
regolith materials.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.660
He looks at the near Earth
asteroid identification

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.160
and characterization.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.510
And he also works a lot with
the next generation training

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:53.000
of both the young people that
will go into these fields,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.150
and also astronauts, the
new classes of astronauts,

00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:01.200
so that they know how to
identify rocks and the geology

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.080
side of what astronauts
need to know,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.820
as well as a few other things.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.130
And some of the things
that his team has just

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:12.740
recently finished, they did
a global lunar landing site

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.500
database that is now
open and available

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.220
for the entire community.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:24.360
So these teams are creating
materials that are available

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.740
not just for the
teams themselves

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.220
but to the entire science
and exploration community.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:35.550
OK, so another thing that we do
it within the virtual Institute

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.610
that I really like a lot is
we build and share facilities.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.590
And this first picture
that we have here

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.150
is about the dust
accelerator that I

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.800
mentioned at the
University of Colorado.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.750
And that was up and
running, actually,

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.850
during the Lunar
Science Institute,

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.140
because, again,
Mihaly Horanyia was

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.720
one of the principal
investigators who

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.630
led a team under the Lunar
Science Institute that is now

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.270
part of SERVI.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.840
And at Brown University
there's something called RELAB.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.750
This is a spectroscopy lab
where they look at samples

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.910
and help people
analyze and understand

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.270
what their field
samples are made of,

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.220
and the new components
that they make as well.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.260
And at Brown
University, they've also

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.210
developed something that is a
3D immersive environment, which

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.620
is something that I think
the Google folks would

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.540
be especially interested in.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.100
So that you feel
like you're there,

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.840
and you look around
in all directions,

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.840
and it's just like
you're really there.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.880
This was modeled
after what we call

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.030
the KeckCAVES, which
are at UC Davis.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.430
Maybe some of you are
familiar with that.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.070
But they have the
same kind of facility

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.398
now at Brown University.

00:23:48.398 --> 00:23:50.394
OK.

00:23:50.394 --> 00:23:51.392
Oh, wait a minute.

00:23:51.392 --> 00:23:52.390
OK.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.720
And at Ames we have a
couple of facilities

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.000
that we share as well.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.640
There's a regolith
test bed where

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.600
we have eight tons of
simulant of lunar material.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.000
And we have little rovers
that run around in this yard.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.970
I use it with students remotely.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.920
They can be across the world,
and they can operate the Rover.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.990
And we've built
in little lessons

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.310
where they can go up
and try and identify

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.750
the difference between
a meteorite and a rock,

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:23.470
and take pictures of
it, that sort of thing.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:27.700
There are scientific uses
for the test bed as well.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.870
And at Stony Brook
University, there

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.880
is a vibrational
spectroscopy lab.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.640
And this is, again,
something where

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.720
people would bring
their samples to it

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.205
and try and understand-- or
something that they built

00:24:41.205 --> 00:24:43.740
or created-- and try to
understand more about how

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.540
it would interact
with or be interacted

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:52.130
on by some sort of process,
and also what it's made out of.

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.377
OK, another part
I wanted to stress

00:24:55.377 --> 00:24:57.700
is the SERVI team
collaborations that we

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.580
have across the team lines.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.270
And so just a
couple of examples.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:07.560
This one, this first one,
came about in the very first

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.190
experience where we brought
the principal investigators

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.320
together to meet
for the first time.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.270
And over this two-day period
where they met face-to-face,

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.700
we were a NASA
Ames, we asked them

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.180
to please come up
with a list of areas

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.932
where they thought their
area could cross over

00:25:23.932 --> 00:25:25.390
and they could find
a collaboration

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.556
with one of the other teams.

00:25:26.556 --> 00:25:29.030
We had each of the teams
give a little synopsis

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.610
of what their proposal was.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.750
Now, keep in mind,
these were teams

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.100
that were competitors
just moments ago.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.890
And now, we're asking
them to share everything.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.060
Share your data,
share your processes,

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.200
tell us what you're
going to do, and look

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.230
for ways-- trust each other and
look for ways to work together.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:47.260
And they did it instantly.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.050
And one of the ideas
that came out of it

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.780
was to have this
sample repository

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:56.090
at the Natural
History Museum, where

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.210
any team that collects
any kind of field sample,

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.810
or had a sample that they
made, could bring it together

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:06.180
and put it in one place,
so that if you wanted

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.500
to do some sort
of process on it,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.700
you could know that you
were using the same rock.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.570
Two different teams doing
two different processes

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:17.640
on the same sample
is a lot better

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.680
than using two entirely
different samples that you just

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.800
happen to think are the same
rock, or the same material.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.550
And this one ran into just
a little bit of a hiccup,

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.360
because it turns out the
Natural History Museum does not

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:34.250
take samples that
are found on Earth.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.980
But they only take
samples that you create.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.080
So we're looking for another
home for the actual field

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.320
samples at this point.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.010
But this was a
great idea, and they

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.490
started putting all their
materials together right away.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:52.820
And I was just really pleased
to do that, to see that happen.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.010
And another one is
the asteroid modeling.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.770
So the dynamics that
we talked about with

00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:59.930
the early solar system
and what happened to it

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:03.230
when you had all this
bombardment in the early days.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.300
When you couple that
to geochemical studies

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.740
of the rocks that
people have found,

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.780
either from meteorite samples
that have come off planet

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:17.340
from someplace else, or the
lunar samples that came back

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.530
from the Moon, you couple that
together with the dynamics,

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:24.090
and you can learn an awful
lot about what happened when.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.490
And what we call the
late heavy bombardment

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:31.870
period that affected both
the Earth and the Moon system

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.560
is one of those times
that we'd really

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.970
like to understand better.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:41.500
Because it looks very, very
likely that the moon formed out

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.120
of a giant Mars-- not
giant, but a Mars-sized body

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.590
hitting the Earth.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:48.920
And when it hit the
Earth, it knocked off

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.510
a great deal of material.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.920
And out of that formed the Moon.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.910
But what didn't make
sense for a long time

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.370
were the isotopic
studies that we

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.360
had in the chemical composition
between the Moon and the Earth.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.950
Those are now coming
into much clearer focus

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:08.970
in terms of how hot the Earth
was, how wet the Earth was,

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.560
how big that body was, what
kind of angle that body had

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.290
to hit the Earth at in
order to make what we end up

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:15.720
seeing on the Moon.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:21.010
So it's just amazing that
dynamicists and geologists

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:24.680
getting together are making
these kind of strides forward.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.130
I mean those people
would not even

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.020
have gone to the
same conferences.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.970
So they wouldn't have met,
they wouldn't have talked,

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.330
they wouldn't have
shared down to this level

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.210
the kind of research
they're doing.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:37.590
And now they are,
and out of that

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.400
grows new science
and new discoveries.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.840
So isn't that cool?

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.510
So let's see, I've
already said this

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.720
about facility sharing
and sample analysis.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.640
So I will skip that.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.200
We also ask that the
international partners

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.200
collaborate with
the domestic teams.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.510
And so, that Crater of the
Moons campaign that I mentioned

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:04.470
that Jennifer
Heldmann was running,

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:07.840
and Timothy Glotch, his team
was part of that as well.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:11.510
That also had our Canadian
partner as part of it.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.590
The dust accelerator
that I mentioned,

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.620
that was built with our
partnership with Germany.

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:24.390
So we can see an awful lot of
the international flavor coming

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:28.400
through as we move forward
with first the Lunar Science

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.887
Institute and now with SERVI.

00:29:31.887 --> 00:29:33.970
So now I'd like to mention
the resource prospector

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.210
mission for just a second.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:43.390
SERVI has several people
in an among our teams

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.400
that are actively
engaged in this.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:49.180
And Terry Fong who's here in
the room today from NASA Ames

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.610
is the deputy manager of
the rover part of this NASA

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:55.110
mission.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.680
This is a mission
in development,

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.120
with the idea of
developing technology

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.870
that's generally applicable
across many different target

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:05.630
bodies.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.740
But ostensibly, it
would go to the Moon.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.020
And the proposed
mission demonstrates

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.730
in situ resource utilization.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.110
In other words you would
collect and use the materials

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.650
that you find on the body.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.810
And various critical
mission aspects

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.830
are being developed
at NASA Ames.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:29.350
It has a lunar rover carrying
the Regolith and Environment

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:34.350
Science and Oxygen and Lunar
Volatile Extraction payload.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:38.980
Oh my gosh, that's a
ridiculous acronym name.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.370
It's called RESOLVE.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.350
OK, and preliminary
testing has been conducted

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.700
on Mauna Kea in Hawaii,
one of my favorite

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:50.660
places, in conjunction with
the Pisces group there.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.610
Anyway, SERVI is facilitating
the site selection and analysis

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:57.410
activities for this mission, and
a number of our investigators

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:58.712
are involved.

00:30:58.712 --> 00:30:59.670
And we're very excited.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:04.150
We hope that this
mission goes forward.

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:06.900
OK, there are a lot
of words on this page.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.430
Main point is I
wanted to tell you

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:12.690
that our central office does a
whole lot more than just send

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.100
out the money.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.460
Our institutes, each
one of the teams,

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:22.070
are funded for five years, which
gives them long term stability.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.170
And that's great for them.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.320
But what we also try
to do is make sure

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.890
that we at the central office
take care of the big problems.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.150
Anything that would slow
them down and take them away

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.350
from their research,
we would like

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:36.120
to handle in the central office.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.380
And then, beyond that,
the actual running

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.200
of the Institute, we do an awful
lot of community engagement.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.470
Our job was to
bring together the

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.350
scientific and the
exploration community.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.520
And again, those are groups
that don't often mingle.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.061
But to show them that
they had a lot in common,

00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:54.560
and they had things
that they needed

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.220
to learn from each other.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:02.610
And so to do that we have a
lot of various activities here.

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.860
MALE SPEAKER: All right, so
we have a number of things

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.717
that we're doing to
keep ourselves busy.

00:32:06.717 --> 00:32:08.300
We have the Exploration
Science Forum.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.091
You're going to be
hearing more about that,

00:32:10.091 --> 00:32:11.985
but that is our
annual conference

00:32:11.985 --> 00:32:14.529
that we have at NASA
Ames where we have people

00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:16.320
from around the world
gathering and talking

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.670
about lunar and planetary
science and exploration

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:20.350
technologies.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.940
We also help coordinate
a European conference,

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.990
the European Lunar
Symposium, with our partners

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:28.240
that we have in Europe.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.410
In terms of citizen
science, we've

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.030
been working successfully.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:34.910
We've been involved with the
LCROSS and LADEE missions,

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:39.300
involving amateur astronomers
and citizen science

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:41.920
in actually making
observations that

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:44.066
contribute to the
science of the mission.

00:32:44.066 --> 00:32:45.440
For instance on
the LADEE mission

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.616
we had a number of amateur
astronomers observing the Moon

00:32:48.616 --> 00:32:50.240
during the course of
the LADEE mission.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.250
As LADEE is flying
around studying

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:53.850
the atmosphere of
the Moon, we were

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.340
looking at meteoroid impacts
on the surface of the Moon,

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.967
seeing how those meteoroid
impacts would correlate

00:33:00.967 --> 00:33:03.300
to changes in the structure
and composition of the lunar

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.310
atmosphere.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.520
We're working on opportunities
for amateur astronomers

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:10.630
to actually be measuring the
orbits, measuring the positions

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:14.410
and changes in the orbits, of
these near Earth asteroids.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.860
That's very important, because
they don't feel constrained

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.920
to be limited just by
Kepler's laws of motion.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.190
That makes them tricky.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.580
We're working with
the SETI Institute

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.100
just down the road
here in a program

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:33.790
where people have very simple
security cameras pointed up

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.000
at the sky.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.510
They're allowing them to
record meteors as they come in.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:43.244
And if you get enough people
from slightly different sites

00:33:43.244 --> 00:33:44.660
recording that
meteor, not only do

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.210
you see it's three-dimensional
path coming down

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.210
through the atmosphere,
you can calculate

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:51.920
what its orbit was before
it encountered the Earth.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.790
And that way were discovering
new meteor streams from comets

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:58.950
as yet undiscovered,
but whose orbits

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:01.040
intersect those of the Earth.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.120
And we're working with the NASA
Tournament Lab and TopCoder

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:11.690
Program to develop improved
algorithms for integration

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:14.469
of data from spacecraft.

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.100
Recently we've been
working with LRO.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.840
We're looking at
some other options,

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.040
but integration of that
data into our lunar mapping

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.639
and modeling portal,
which is now branching out

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:27.590
into other planetary bodies too.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.909
Let's go to the next slide.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.520
A fun event that we have that
I would like to invite you to

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.471
is the International
Observe the Moon Night.

00:34:37.471 --> 00:34:39.929
We've been doing this every
year for a number of years now.

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:43.040
We get people showing up at
locations around the world.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.110
Here you can see Google Maps
is actually showing us right

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:49.969
now where people are
signing up to have events.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:53.940
Our event this year is going
to be on September 19, 2015.

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.680
And people will gather at these
locations all around the world.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.740
We will be streaming out
talks to these locations,

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.860
and people gather with
local amateur astronomers

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.360
to see the Moon.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:11.380
It's really, really an
exciting, exciting thing to do.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.090
We have a lot of classroom
visits, workshops,

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:15.250
public lectures.

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.530
A lot of these are streamed
out to remote locations

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:18.854
around the world.

00:35:18.854 --> 00:35:20.520
We've been working
with Navajo Technical

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.820
University on a
number of projects.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:26.080
They're doing some really
neat work in 3D printing.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.890
Exploration Uplink, Yvonne
talked about our robot

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:33.640
rovers out in our lunar
simulant test bed.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.690
And also in our
simulant test bed,

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:40.340
we're going to be working this
spring with some students who

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:45.430
are working with the swamp works
at KSC, Kennedy Space Center,

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:48.570
on a payload, a
proposed payload,

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.260
for Google Lunar XPRIZE Mission.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.850
So they'll be actually
doing some testing

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.590
in our simulant test bed there.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:57.950
YVONNE PENDLETON: All right.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.030
So the other thing we'd
like to invite you to

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.800
is the NASA Exploration
Science Forum.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.470
This is something we
host every summer,

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.965
and it is in person
as well as virtual.

00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:09.590
But since you're
right down the street,

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.110
please just hop on over.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:13.790
We would like you to register,
but it's free of charge.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:19.050
And it happens in July, the
21st through the 23rd this year.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.700
And it will be three days of
listening to and interacting

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.060
with people who are doing
cutting edge science

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.200
and looking at how that
science informs exploration.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.740
So please come to that.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:34.430
We have hosted a number
of virtual events

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.450
over the last several years.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:39.550
I mean since the NASA's Lunar
Science Institute was formed,

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.970
we've probably done more than
a thousand virtual events.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:44.960
And so, you can always
go to our website

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.660
and see what's coming
up, what's new.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:48.710
We have workshops.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:49.670
We have seminars.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:51.260
We have various
things that might

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.585
attract you and
have some interest.

00:36:53.585 --> 00:36:54.585
So go to servi.nasa.gov.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.450
And if you misspell SERVI,
we tried to capture as many

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:05.150
of those domain names as
possible with the misspellings.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:09.138
Just try to remember SERVI,
it sounds like the disease.

00:37:09.138 --> 00:37:11.651
OK.

00:37:11.651 --> 00:37:12.150
All right.

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:14.220
Partnerships in Silicon Valley.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:17.000
We're very fortunate to
be here in Silicon Valley,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.460
and so we try to learn as much
as we can from those of you

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.700
out there doing
this cutting edge,

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.250
wonderful new development.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.100
And so, we have a picture
there, what's being shown

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.140
is a little robot that we
have from the Double Robotics

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.090
Company.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:38.210
And we have a couple of those,
and we use them for people

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.020
to attend our forum when they
can't be there in person,

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:44.770
or just to come down the hall
and have a conversation with us

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.820
when they're not
physically in the building.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.072
We also do a lot with
next generation support.

00:37:51.072 --> 00:37:52.655
That is, training
the next generation.

00:37:52.655 --> 00:37:54.800
And Brad Bailey, who's
here in the audience,

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:59.020
has done a great deal of
this for the graduates

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.380
and undergraduates
that we work with.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.480
We've probably trained
about 200 graduates

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.211
who are now employed in
academic and other positions.

00:38:06.211 --> 00:38:08.210
And by we, I don't mean
the central office only.

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:11.780
I mean throughout all of the
teams that we've had as well.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.060
We've established new programs
and promoted new faculty

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.300
positions at various
universities,

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.890
and established things
like Lunar Grad Con, which

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:23.560
is a conference that is run
by the graduate students

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.060
themselves.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:28.400
But we support them and
give them the encouragement

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.900
to do that, so that they
can get used to giving talks

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.720
in front of their
peers and get feedback,

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.170
and that sort of thing.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.910
There have been student exchange
programs, NASA Post Doctoral

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:43.310
Program where we try to put
in bed a postdoc with two

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:45.070
teams, at least two
teams, so that they

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.230
can benefit both teams
and be part of that glue.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:49.820
Students are that
unique glue that

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.400
hold teams together in
a way that I just love.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.734
And I've seen them
grow up in one team,

00:38:55.734 --> 00:38:57.400
graduate and go to
another one, and then

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.850
become a postdoc somewhere else.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.320
It's fantastic.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.910
So OK, I think you can
read the rest of that.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:05.950
Let's just go on.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.390
What's our future look like?

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.380
Well, we've got the
Exploration Science Forum,

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.800
as I mentioned, in July at Ames.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:17.310
And the European Lunar
Symposium that we also help,

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:20.590
and that is in Rome,
Italy-- Frascati, which

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.380
is in May of 2015.

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.520
So we're looking
forward to that.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.950
We have our next cooperative
agreement notice.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:28.890
This is the vehicle
by which new teams

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:31.780
will apply to become
part of SERVI.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.180
I told you that
the current teams

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.910
are funded for five years.

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:37.760
Well, every two-and-a-half
years, we'll put out a new CAN,

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.120
cooperative agreement notice,
for teams to apply to.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.314
And that way, we hope
to select the new teams

00:39:44.314 --> 00:39:45.730
before the old
teams have finished

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:47.530
their first five-year stint.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.680
That will give us
cultural continuity,

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.400
and the older teams
and the new teams

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.900
will work together better.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:59.110
We have the potential for
new international partners.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.860
We always hold special
sessions at major meetings

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.050
like the American
Geophysical Union.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:06.660
This past December, we
had an all day session

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.030
devoted to science and
exploration topics.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.550
And we hope to continue
the significant inter-team

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:14.760
collaborations.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.360
In the first year of operation,
first year, these teams

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:22.850
have already published over
195 papers, and probably

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.406
400 conference papers.

00:40:25.406 --> 00:40:26.655
And this is just unbelievable.

00:40:26.655 --> 00:40:29.770
I mean anyone who's gone
through the peer review process

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.360
knows it takes about a
year to get something out

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.740
from start to finish.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.710
And these teams
have already managed

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:39.431
to get 195 papers through
that peer review process.

00:40:39.431 --> 00:40:41.430
So we're very proud of
them, and we look forward

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:44.210
to what they're going
to do in the future.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:46.730
One thing that we thought you
guys might like to hear about,

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.760
lessons learned
from our experience

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.965
with virtual collaborations.

00:40:50.965 --> 00:40:53.090
I haven't talked to you
very much about what we use

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:53.990
or how we do it.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:56.180
I've got the slides if
you want to know more.

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.080
But we use Adobe Connect.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.590
And we found that that
serves our purposes best.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.340
There are many ways
that we could do this,

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.430
but that is one
that works for us.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.340
And so, what we've
learned over the years

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.420
is that it's really
important to conduct

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:16.130
personal one-on-one training
before we have anybody present.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:19.297
It's important to
provide a checklist

00:41:19.297 --> 00:41:21.630
so that even though they think
they're familiar with how

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.580
to turn on their camera
and set things up,

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.580
they've got a little
checklist they can go down.

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.980
That saves a lot of
time and trouble.

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.760
Test, configure, and
optimize the off-site video

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.225
teleconferencing system.

00:41:33.225 --> 00:41:35.130
This is critical.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:39.940
We provide a technical
producer and a host MC speaker

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.820
who's familiar with what
virtual communications are like.

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.410
And that means that when
there's some awkward pause,

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:50.050
or some time, or something isn't
sounding quite right, that MC

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:53.320
knows the right thing to say,
the way to keep everybody

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.212
engaged, and the way to
get us through the problem.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.719
We like to have redundant
systems and backup roles

00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:03.510
so that there isn't a
single point failure.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:06.110
That's something we've learned
from NASA and the Apollo

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.780
Program.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.320
What experience has taught us.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.280
Create an environment
that's inviting and has

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.620
a real natural feel.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:18.010
Designate a facilitator
for each event.

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:22.300
Use social media and
dedicated online discussion

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:26.240
to involve and engage the online
audience and the participants,

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.884
as well as the speaker.

00:42:27.884 --> 00:42:30.050
And that's why we like Adobe
Connect, because you've

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.300
got that little chat box,
that window where people

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.117
can type in their questions.

00:42:34.117 --> 00:42:35.700
And sometimes you
see people answering

00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.930
each other's questions
in the chat box,

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.680
while the speaker just continues
on with their presentation.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.450
Now as a speaker, I find
that really disconcerting.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:45.424
I don't like looking
at that chat box.

00:42:45.424 --> 00:42:46.840
If somebody's
asking a question, I

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.490
want to be the one answering
it, not having somebody else.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:53.550
But it turns out a lot of
other people feel differently.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.120
They love having that chat box.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.990
And so, they really use it,
and they go to town with it.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:01.950
And I have to admit,
it's value added.

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:04.550
And let's see, just
try to accommodate

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:06.140
time zones, that's obvious.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.320
Ninety-minute
sessions work best.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.530
We try and follow those
with a 10-minute break.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:12.340
And have no more than
three sessions a day,

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.200
or you're going to
lose your audience.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.760
And in conclusion, I
think the main takeaways

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.280
for what we've learned from
the virtual institute model

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.380
is that by having longer
periods of funding--

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:29.800
the five-year funding--
that's long for a scientists

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.090
because usually they have to
write proposals for one or two,

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:34.280
maybe three years.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.760
And by giving them a larger
amount of funding-- the teams

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.450
each get roughly
$1.2 million a year.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:44.950
And this enables them to
then support their students.

00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:46.860
You can support a
student for five years

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.300
and get them all the way
through graduate school,

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.430
if they start at the right time.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:54.700
But by doing this we get
unexpected discoveries

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:59.070
from the interdisciplinary
and inter-team collaboration

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.970
that comes about
through this research.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:04.670
So the whole really is more
than the sum of the parts.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.610
And we see incredible
productivity from these teams.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.780
So we know that the taxpayer,
all of you, all of us,

00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.340
are getting a lot of
bang for you buck.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:16.430
The ability to assemble the
best possible team regardless

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:18.570
of where they're
geographically located,

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:21.140
and the cost savings
that you get, obviously,

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.180
by not having to
travel everywhere,

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.300
both in time and
energy, really, I think,

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.430
gets that productivity up.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.430
And the long-term
stability for the students,

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:33.740
our future workforce, this
is so important to all of us.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:36.970
So with that, I think
that's everything I brought.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:40.200
And I'm happy to
answer any questions.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.200
And we've got, of course,
Brian Day and Brad Bailey

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:46.360
here as well that are also
happy to take your questions.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.590
AUDIENCE: Is NASA the
first organization

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:51.090
to try this virtual institute?

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:54.052
I thought it would have
been very popular by now.

00:44:54.052 --> 00:44:56.010
YVONNE PENDLETON: Well,
that's a good question.

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:58.140
The National Science
Foundation actually

00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.780
has tried this as well.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.300
I think their model is
slightly different from ours.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.010
But I do believe
NASA was the first.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.740
And I think with the NASA
Astrobiology Institute,

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:12.640
they have the longest running
history, from 1998 to now.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.140
And they are going strong.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:17.490
So we took a lot of our
cues from what the NAI did.

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:22.970
And I think the NSF, it
probably learned a bit

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:25.640
from what NASA did as well.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.220
But I don't know of
other organizations.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.760
I can tell you that both the
Office of Management and Budget

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.610
and the White House had been
interested in what we're doing.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:36.300
And just about a
month or two ago,

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.452
they asked me to get them
a presentation as well,

00:45:38.452 --> 00:45:40.160
because they're looking
at how this might

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.410
apply to other
government agencies.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:46.470
So you might see more virtual
institutes in the future.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:49.950
AUDIENCE: So what's the
typical collaboration schedule

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.910
for many of these
collaborations.

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:54.720
Do they all get together
like weekly or monthly,

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.550
or is it just like the PIs,
or is it the whole ecosystem?

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:02.050
YVONNE PENDLETON:
That's a great question.

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:06.161
So the question, it could
be answered differently

00:46:06.161 --> 00:46:07.160
for the different teams.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.610
They are allowed to
set their own schedule

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:11.990
and do what works best for them.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:14.470
But I know some
teams that have--

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.844
almost all teams have at
least a monthly meeting,

00:46:16.844 --> 00:46:18.260
in addition to the
monthly meeting

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.780
that they have with us
at the central office.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.860
All the PIs get
together and report

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.970
on what their teams have
been doing once a month.

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:27.590
But within their team, they
do at least once a month,

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.720
some of them on a weekly basis.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.320
And I think it really depends
on whether their people are all

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.180
co-located in one place, or
whether they're spread out

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:39.720
and they need to tag up
with them around there.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.240
But one of the
things that we think

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.320
is very important in running
the virtual institute

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.970
is not to over constrain
what the teams do.

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.860
As a scientist myself,
I know that I really

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.260
appreciate the leadership
getting the obstacles out

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.340
of the way and letting
me get my job done.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:59.110
And that's what we're trying
to do with the teams as well.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.360
So when they have new
directions, new ideas that they

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.220
want to go down, they
don't have to check in

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.360
with us every
minute of every day.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.260
If it's a major
redirect, we'd like

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.550
them to talk to
us about it first.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:12.610
But in general,
if all they do is

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:14.340
what they wrote
in their proposal,

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.780
we would be disappointed.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.250
Because we know that new
science, and new creativity,

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:21.860
and new ideas come
at the intersection

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:22.970
of many disciplines.

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.010
And those clever
ideas that they get

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:29.110
by having these weekly
or monthly discussions,

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:32.640
however often they
want to do it.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.110
AUDIENCE: So I know a
lot of other NASA groups

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:39.120
still insist on
face-to-face meetings.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:43.700
Many of the Cassini, things
like that, all that groups

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.070
meet together.

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:50.530
Do you think you could
give advice face to them as

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.550
to whether such-- everybody
needs to get together

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:55.470
in the same room
is still necessary.

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:58.220
Or do you think those
face-to-face meetings still

00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:58.840
have a place?

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.299
Or do you think
this is the future?

00:48:00.299 --> 00:48:02.340
YVONNE PENDLETON: Sure,
a very important message.

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.840
I'm so glad you
asked that question.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.700
Because a very important
message to take away here also

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.360
is that virtual is
not always the answer.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.320
And there are some
really important reasons

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:15.510
and situations where you want
to have that face-to-face.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:20.010
And I know from the
team activities,

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:22.410
my husband, who is also
a planetary scientist,

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:23.910
has been on several teams.

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.675
And I've watched
what they have to do

00:48:26.675 --> 00:48:28.300
and the way that they
have to interact.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:29.758
And right now
they're getting ready

00:48:29.758 --> 00:48:31.780
for the Pluto
encounter that's going

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.680
to happen in July, July 15th.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.660
They're meeting on a regular
basis in person, every month,

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:41.701
or every three to four weeks,
maybe even more frequent.

00:48:41.701 --> 00:48:42.200
Yeah.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:43.990
See OK, you're
part of that maybe?

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:47.174
OK, and so that's critical.

00:48:47.174 --> 00:48:47.840
That's critical.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.880
And we are not by
any means suggesting

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.590
that this replace
those critical times.

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:54.200
But there are plenty
of other times

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.640
where we find that
virtual does work great.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.860
And people ought to
be open minded to it

00:48:58.860 --> 00:48:59.970
and give it a chance.

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.990
Also, I think the problem is
that when they think virtual,

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:05.800
they might think of some
bad experience they had

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.530
where the audio was
poor, the video was poor,

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:11.490
you wasted a lot of time
trying to get people set up.

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.110
That is not what we do.

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:17.200
Come and watch one of our
video archived sessions,

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.882
or join us for something, and
you'll see the difference.

00:49:19.882 --> 00:49:21.590
And part of that
difference is because we

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:24.820
have a technical staff
in the central office

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:28.860
that provides the bridging among
whatever platform you choose

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.700
to join in by, or the practicing
with the presenters ahead

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.760
of time.

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.070
They try to debug it,
so that to the audience

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:37.300
it really looks flawless.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.930
And the audio quality is high,
and the video quality is high.

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:42.410
And your experience
is much better.

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:44.320
Your frustration
level goes way down.

00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:47.570
So there are some cases where
it works exceedingly well,

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:49.280
and other places
where I wouldn't

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.527
try to replace the
old fashioned way.

00:49:51.527 --> 00:49:52.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:54.550
Well, thank you
very much Yvonne.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:55.716
YVONNE PENDLETON: Thank you.

00:49:55.716 --> 00:49:57.600
It's a pleasure to be here.
