00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.160
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Good evening!

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.120
And welcome to the 2017 National
Book Festival Gala Celebration,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.180
the opening of the festival.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.600
It is my great honor to be part
of the institution that organizes,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.510
and presents this wonderful
public event.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.580
Every year, for 17 years,
the Library of Congress,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.430
has brought the nations greatest
Authors, Poets, and Illustrators,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.460
to the Nation's Capitol, and put
them together with book lovers

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.660
who come from as far away as
North Carolina, and Michigan,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.210
to hear them talk about their work.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.080
Everyone here tonight is part
of that extraordinary effort,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.130
and I thank you for
joining us this year.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.290
I want to say a few words about
a number of people who can't be

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.010
with us here, because of the
devastating floods in Texas.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.100 position:56%
Children's author, Tim Tingle, who's
house was in the hurricanes path.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.220
And our interviewers, Keven
Sullivan, and Mary Jordan,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.890
who are in the very thick
of things, getting the news

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.840
out for the Washington Post.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.910
Our thoughts are with them, and
with all who have been affected.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.570
Now, you would not be here
if you did not love books.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.410
And we wouldn't be here

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.400
if the United States
Congress did not love books.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.190
The members of Congress
are the benefactors,

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.870
and overseers of this Library,
the largest cultural institution

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.510
in the world, and we thank those
members who are with us today.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:16.260
[ Applause ]

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.630
We have a number of
diplomats in the audience,

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.120
who are also book lovers too.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.170
Welcome, to the Ambassadors
of Peru, India, Ladia, Lafia,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.510

Counselor of Mexico.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.550

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.820
who have contributed to
making this event possible.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.510
Mr. David Rubenstein,
the festival's Co-Chair.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.170

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.270
[ Applause ]

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.600
And also, patrons and contributors,

Scholastic Inc., and many others.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.150
Because of their generosity,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.510
the festival remains completely
free, and thank you for that.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.180
[ Applause ]

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.540
And there's more.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.010
There are more than a thousand
volunteers who give of their time.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.300
Library of Congress Staff, the
general public, the Junior League

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.410
of Washington, and our Introducers
from the Washington Post,

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.230
National Public Radio, and
numerous other media organizations.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.640
And speaking of Library staff,
a team of more than a dozen,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.340
have worked on planning
tomorrows event,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.700
which will offer the most
impressive line up of Authors

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.710
in the 17 year history
of the festival.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.870 position:56%
And so I'd like to especially
acknowledge our Festival organizers,

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.440
Director Jared McNeil [assumed
spelling], Literary Director,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.510
Maria Arana [assumed spelling].

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:47.110
[ Applause ]

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.440
And of course, a big thank you
to Sue Seagle [assumed spelling],

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.510
of our Development Office.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.470
[ Applause ]

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.250
Now, the lively image you see
here, is from our Festival poster,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.550
and it was designed

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.110
by the delightfully
talented artist, RosChes.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.620 position:56%
[applause] And she wanted to convey
the idea, one that we all recognize,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.550
and know, that books are fun!

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.420
And they're shared experiences,
personal and communal.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.000
Books ask questions,
and they aspire answers.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.730
They are essential to the human
experience, and they open us

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.410
to possibilities we might
otherwise never see.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.490
Our theme tonight is the
American Story, and I can't think

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.990
of a better subject to relay
the energy and diversity,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.530
that all of the story
tellers here tonight,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.480
and at the festival, will bring.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.310
In fact, I must take a moment
to recognize some of our newest,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.880
and youngest contributors
to the American Story.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.100
We have with us tonight, the
newly pinned, and recognized,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.590
2017 National Student Poets.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.020
Would you please stand up?

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.820
These five young people--

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:38.270
[ Applause ]

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:44.100
These five young people will be
spending the next year bringing

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.710
words and the magic of
words, to young people all

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.080
over throughout the country.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.630
They represent the five
regions of the country.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.440
And they are, I think,
are the embodiment

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.610
of what this festival is about.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.300
One of the great traditions of
the festival has always been

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.040
to bestow the Library
Of Congress prize

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.570
for American Fiction,
on festival day.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.680 position:56%
This years winner, Denis Johnson,
to whom I offered the prize in March

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.300
of this year, died tragically
a few months later, in May.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.020
We are honoring this great figure

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.590
in Contemporary American
Fiction tomorrow

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.700
with a posthumous conferral
of the prize.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.550
It will be presented at the
very top of our Fiction Stage,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.890
and relayed to his Widow, Cindy
Johnson [assumed spelling],

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.400
along with the citations about
Denis we have gathered from more

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.570
than a dozen literary
figures from around the world.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.960
And since we always feature our
winner at this Gala evening,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.830
we offer you now a very
brief video on the life,

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:56.420
and work of Denis Johnson.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.240
&gt;&gt; English words are like
prisons, empty, nothing inside,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.290
and still they make rainbows.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.540
So says a character in "Already
Dead", a Novel by the late,

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.200
great American writer,
Denis Johnson.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.030
Johnson's stories, as legions of
his fans know, are also prisons.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:20.190
They are hard, merciless, flinty,
and yet they too, make rainbows.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.110 position:56%
He's been called a writer's writer's
writer, and for all the indigma

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.880
of that string of words,
they hold a simple truth.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.820 position:56%
Those who bring language to life,
recognize Johnson's gifts instantly.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.200
Louise Erdrich calls his work
profound, and transcendent.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.270 position:56%
Jonathan Franzen finds his sentences
miracles of transparency and tone.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.640
Phillip Roth, calls him daring,
terrifying, and an emissary

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.650
for tortured, broken souls.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:52.700
Marilyn Robinson marvels that
a writer's personal passions,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.440
and energies, can be so
inextricably wedded to his words.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.350
All agree, Denis Johnson has
managed to give us minimalist,

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:07.270
yet distinctly ecstatic, and
hallucinatory rainbow probes.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.620
He is an American original.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.280
He was born in 1949, in Munich,
Germany, and raised in Tokyo,

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.300
and Manila, the child
of American diplomats.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.470
As a teenager, moving
back to Washington D.C.,

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.710
during the tumultuous 60's,
he came to know the country,

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.250 position:56%
and the restless characters he would
capture so vividly in his fiction.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.010 position:56%
He graduated in English
Literature, from University of Iowa,

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.240
and earned a MFA, from
the Iowa Writers Workshop,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.540
where he returned as a teacher.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.530
He has also taught
at Texas University,

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.420
and the University
of Texas, at Austin.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.810
In the course of his favorite
career, he published novels,

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.670
short stories, journalism,
and poetry.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.730
Among with his best works are
those about the Flotsam and Jetsam

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.000
of American Life, The
Laughing Monsters, Nobody Move,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.090
Tree of Smoke, Already Dead, Jesus'
Son, Resuscitation of a Hanged Man,

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.000
The Stars at Noon,
Fiskadora, Angels.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.650
He's received numerous
awards for these,

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.290
including a national book award,
a Lannan Fellowship in fiction,

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.270
a writing writers award,
and in 2008,

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.570
he was named a finalist
for the Pulitzer Prize.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.380
Throughout, he has chronicled an
America that has gone unobserved,

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:28.850
unrecorded, here are our drug
addicts, our war veterans,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.870
our disaffected, our
used up and left behind,

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.850
and yet the most affecting,
and rewarding aspect

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.880
of Denis Johnson's fiction
is that in work, after work,

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.680
he has proved that beauty often
lurks in unexpected places,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.470
that strength can be
found in failure,

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:51.070
that the human spirit is a
fragile, but resilient vessel.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.060
His is a very American Story.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.470
He once described his works as
pressure cookers of language,

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.110
his characters as those who
inhabit life's perilous edge.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:06.290
As time wore on, he found that
he himself was all too vulnerable

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.590
to these human frailties.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.380
When the Librarian of
Congress, Carla Hayden,

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.220 position:56%
offered Denis Johnson the Library of
Congress Prize for American Fiction,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:19.300
in March of 2017, he
wrote in an email message,

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.670
"My head is spinning
from such great news".

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.620
Two months later, tragically,
he was dead.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.220
The Library is very proud
to honor, posthumously,

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.980
this extraordinary human being,
and writer, who's contributions

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.330
to the American can and have
been been lasting and invaluable.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:41.970 position:56%
As the Librarian wrote, when the
prize was announced in June of 2017,

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.400
Denis Johnson was a writer for our
times, in prose that fused grace

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.720
with wit, he spun tale after
tale about our walking wounded,

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.300
the demons that haunt,
the salvation we seek.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:58.400
We emerge from his imagined
world, with profound empathy,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.400
a different perspective,
a little changed.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.400
We're very proud to count Denis
Johnson among the distinguished

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:14.510
winners of the Library of Congress
Prize for American Fiction.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:25.620
[ Applause ]

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.520
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Thank you!

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.080
The National Book Festival is
not only a celebration of books

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.300
and reading, but also
of literacy itself.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.070
Life, in these demanding times,
can be very difficult for those

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.320
who have never learned to
read, and unfortunately,

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.910
there are too many
people in that number,

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.620
in this country, and
around the world.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:53.350
The latest estimate, is that 65
percent of adults in the world,

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.240
are functionally illiterate.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.290
At the Library, it is an
important part of our mission

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:05.570
to comet illiteracy, and
promote a culture of reading,

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.690
and one of the most generous
supporters of American Culture,

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:14.230
History, and the Arts in this
country is Mr. David Rubenstein,

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.830
Co-Chair of the National Book
Festival, and is primary donor.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.890
His patriotic philanthropy can
be seen all across Washington,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.790
at the Kennedy Center, the National
Zoo, the Washington Monument,

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.930
and at the new National Museum

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.410
of African American
History and Culture.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:37.420
But his work can also be seen all
across the country, and the world.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.910
He is a tireless promoter of
literacy, and he believes in books,

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:46.440 position:56%
libraries, and the opportunity, and
success that are [inaudible] linked,

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.750
and I trust they are for
all of us here tonight.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.860
His dedication to increasing
literacy across the world,

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.640
let to his creation and
support of the Library

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.540
of Congress Literacy Awards.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.470
And I now invite you to watch
another video we have prepared,

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:11.690
about the Literacy awards, and
David's involvement in them.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:24.890
[ Music ]

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:29.340
&gt;&gt; People who can read, and
do, are healthier, happier,

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.510
and live longer than
people who can't.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.760
They are more likely to get
preventative health care,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.140
and are less likely to
go to an emergency room.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.830
Women and girls who are
educated, have fewer children,

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.640
and those they do have, are
twice as likely to survive.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.840
Everyone benefits from literacy.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.660
For every one percent increase
in a country's literacy rate,

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.410
there is a permanent
1.5 percent increase

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.730
in it's gross domestic product.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:09.090
But illiteracy is widespread,
worldwide 758 million adults,

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:15.110
most of them women, cannot read
or write a simple sentence.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:19.250
Illiteracy contributes
to poverty, and crime.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:24.860 position:56%
43 percent of adults with the lowest
literacy levels, live in poverty.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.740
70 percent of adult welfare
recipients have trouble reading.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:36.220
75 percent of state prison inmates
did not complete high school.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.910
Illiteracy is expensive,

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:45.500
low literacy cost the U.S.
225 billion dollars each year

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:50.390
in lost work force productivity,
crime, and unemployment.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:57.310
And illiteracy cost the global
economy 1.19 trillion each year.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.740
Launched with the creative
vision, and generosity

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.660
of David M. Rubenstein, the Library

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.340

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:14.110
and promote the achievements of
organizations, who's innovative,

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:20.130
research based practices, are
improving literacy, worldwide.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:25.840
Since 2013, these awards
have provided more

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:35.700
than one million dollars to 77
institutions, in 24 countries.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:44.330
This year, a committee of Literacy
Experts, evaluated 59 nominations,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:50.050
and presented their findings
to the Librarian of Congress

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.300
who selected winners
in three categories.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.650 position:56%
The 50 thousand dollar international
prize, recognizes significant,

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:02.760
and measurable contributions
to increasing literacy levels,

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.490
by an organization based
outside the United States.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:15.340
The 50 thousand dollar American
prize recognizes significant,

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.580
and measurable contributions

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:24.840
to increasing literacy
levels, on a national level.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.060
The 150 thousand dollar
David M. Rubenstein prize,

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.280
recognizes a domestic, or
international organization

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.720
that is demonstrated
exceptional, and sustained depth,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.070
in it's commitment to the
advancement of literacy.

[ Applause ]

00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:09.660
&gt;&gt; Ladies and Gentleman, please
welcome David M. Rubenstein,

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.070
Co-Chairman of the National Book
Festival, and the originator,

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.640
and sponsor of the Library
of Congress Literacy Awards.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.750
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Carla, thank
you very much for your kind words,

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:26.250
and thank you for your dedication
to the National Book Festival,

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.640
and the cause of literacy.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:33.800
We are thrilled that you are
the Librarian of Congress,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.670
I am particular thrilled that
you came here from Baltimore,

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:42.540
my home town, where you headed the
library, for some 20 years there.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.590
It is hard to believe,
you saw that film,

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:53.300
that it's not just a global
problem, it's an American problem.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:58.170 position:56%
45 million Americans are
functionally illiterate, 45 million.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:02.400 position:56%
We have about 330 million Americans,

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.190
45 million are functionally
illiterate,

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.950
which means that they can't
read beyond a fifth grade level.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:15.370
If you can't read beyond a
fifth grade level your chance

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:22.820
of having economic success in
life is reduced dramatically.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:28.680
People who don't have the
ability to read earn, on average,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.320
40 percent less than
people who can read,

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.240 position:56%
and that is a real tragic situation.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.120
In our Country, we talk
about the income gap,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.660
and the growing income gap, but
it's really a growing literacy gap,

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:52.110
and the income gap it's directly
related to the literacy gap.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.360
Unless we can do something
about closing literacy gap,

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.120
we have no chance of
closing the income gap.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.390
We also have no chance of dealing
with some of the side effects

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:07.020
of literacy that were mentioned.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.340 position:56%
For example, if you are
illiterate, functionally illiterate,

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.400
your chance of being a juvenile
delinquent is dramatically

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.190
increased, in fact 85 percent

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.960
of all juvenile delinquents
are functionally illiterate,

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.310 position:56%
and as our statistics showed,
roughly two thirds of people who are

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.350
in our prison system, are
functionally illiterate.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.370
It's a sad situation,
and we have not made

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.900
as much progress as we should.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:36.310
Think about this in your
case, suppose in your case,

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:43.760
every body here, I presume, is
literate, I hope everybody is.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.710
[laughter] But suppose you couldn't
read, think about your life,

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:52.630
how would your life be
different if you couldn't read?

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:58.780
You'd gone through you entire
life, and you couldn't read.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.260
Not only would you, probably
be more likely to be part

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.830
of our criminal justice system,

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.830
not only would you likely have a
much lower income for your family,

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:13.620
but the pleasure that you get
from reading would be gone.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.910
To me, one of the great
pleasures of my life is reading,

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.760
and I just can't imagine my life
without the ability to read.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.480
But think about your own
lives, how would your life be

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.780
so different if you couldn't read?

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.580
That's the problem we have
with some 45 million Americans,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.880
and it's growing.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.810
And let me just mention one other
problem, not just illiteracy,

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.430
as great as that problem is,
but the problem of a-literacy.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:32.730
Their are people who can
read, but don't read.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.030
It's hard to believe.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.330
But 31 percent of American males,
last year, who are literate,

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.630
did not read a single book.

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:37.930 position:56%
In fact, 26 percent of all Americans
who can read, didn't read a book

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.350
at all last year, and 40 percent
of all high school graduates

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:40.670
who can read, did not read
a book at all last year.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:41.970
Now as we all know,
reading is very important,

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.270
but reading books is
a special pleasure.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.570
The National Book Festival
emphasizes, not just literacy,

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.920
but the value of books, and the
importance of reading books.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.220
So, I hope all of you, when
you leave here tonight,

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.520
and when you finish the
Book Festival tomorrow,

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.030 position:56%
for those who are going, think about
how privileged you are to be able

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.530
to read, and how sad your life
would be if you couldn't read.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:52.850
And so all of us should be
thrilled wit our parents,

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.500 position:56%
our teachers who taught us us how
to read, and we should really be sad

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:55.800
that there are so many
people in this country

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.170
who can't get the pleasure out
of reading that all of us have.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.000 position:56%
So, to the extent that you can think
about, one thing you might be able

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.300
to do after you leave the
festival, it is something

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.970
that I hope you might be able
to do, to contribute to somebody

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.270
with your time, your
energy ideas, your money,

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.570
to help support the
effort to eradicate,

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:05.870
and dramatically reduce
illiteracy, and hopefully reduce

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.170
and erratically, and
dramatically produce a-literacy.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.600
It's a tragic situation that we
have to all deal with, and again,

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.900
the income gap in this
country is not going away

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.200
until the literacy gap goes away.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.000
Thank you!

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.090
and the National Book
Festival a success.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:07.450
So, here is a specially
framed facsimile

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.450
of the book lovers map
of the United States.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.190 position:56%
And you'll see that it has portraits

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:16.410
of great American writers
including Ralph Waldo Emerson,

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:21.310
Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Edgar
Allan Poe, Baltimore, [laughter],

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:27.530
Walt Wickman, and Mark Twain,
and all the places they're from.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.830
But thank you David!

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.130
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein:
Thank you very much!

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:31.930
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Really, thank you!

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:41.650
[ Applause ]

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.170
And now, ladies and
gentleman, our terrific lineup

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.680
of Authors will give us their views

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.740
on what the American
Story means to them.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:57.510
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentleman, please
welcome Margot Lee Shetterly.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:09.980
[ Applause ]

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.280
&gt;&gt; Margot Lee Shetterly: Wow!

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.560
It is such an honor for me to be
here in a room full of writers.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.660
So many of my literary
hero's here tonight.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.530
America may be the only country

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:24.100
in the world founded
by a bunch of writers.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:28.850
Jefferson, Hamilton,
Madison, Franklin, their pro's

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.810
and their lucid ideas, about the
nature of humanity, and freedom,

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.770
is some of the most admired,
and influential writing

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.460
in the history of the world.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.830
America's essentially a work of
imagination, so it's no surprise

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:46.570
that we, as citizens,
devote so much our lives

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:52.200
to pursuing an American dream,
and to telling an American Story.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.040
Growing up in Virginia, in
the 1970's 80's however,

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.130
I could never seem to find
my story in American history.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.450
I remember elementary school,
and junior high school,

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.300 position:56%
and dreading those few days when
the Social Studies Curriculum turned

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.250
it's eyes to Black History.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.350
There was slavery, Martin Luther
King, and that was about it.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.140
Black History in the classroom
was always a discussion

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:19.410
of racial violence, and
disenfranchisement, and shame.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.350
The idea that simply by virtue
of the color of their skin,

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:26.610 position:56%
my fore-bearers were considered
legally, socially, and economically,

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.070
less than full citizens of this
country, and less than fully human.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:34.220
The textbooks offered cursory
information about the state

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.810 position:56%
of blacks, in America, but virtually
nothing about Black Americans,

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:42.590
as individuals, who, as I
knew firsthand were as engaged

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.500
in the pursuit of life,
liberty, and happiness,

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.150
as any other citizen in of country.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:52.150
Where were the stories
of the protagonists?

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.230
I grew up in a world
where robust families,

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.780
and members of a dynamic community
dreamed of a better future,

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.740
and they found ways, great and
small, to fight against injustice.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.630
They did all they could to
help people do their best work,

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.470
whether that work was
cleaning other people's houses,

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.700
as my grandmother did, or
calculating orbital trajectories,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.510
as did the women that I write
about, in Hidden Figures.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:18.800
Where in those History books were,
for example, the business people

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.150
who pooled their resources

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.830
to provide mortgages
to black home owners?

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:27.530
Or the teachers, like my mother,
or the scientists, like my father.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:29.970
Well there was the Chemist,
George Washington Carver,

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:34.650
and he was the black scientist that
everybody heard about during class.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:39.810 position:56%
And they had that poor guy working
overtime during Black History month.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.110
[laughter].

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.900
In general however, I could
not square the textbooks narrow

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.280
and degraded presentation
of the past with my present,

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:52.410
and I certainly had problems
attaching that past to my future.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.770
I was an ambitious handful
of a whippersnapper,

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.960
ready to take on the world,
and as far as I was concerned,

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.230
history was simply ballaced, it was
something meant to be off loaded

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.510
if I was going to be able to rise,

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.280
and pursue my version
of the American dream.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.420
So it's no surprise that when
I graduated from the University

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:16.640
of Virginia, I chose a career that
seemed to meet the perfect opposite

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.390
of history, Investment Banking.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:25.790 position:56%
[laughter] but as hard as I tried, I
simply could not outrun the history.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:30.000
After decades of living and working
outside of Virginia, and in fact,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.760
outside of the United
States, I recently moved

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.270
to Charlottesville, Virginia.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:39.570
So today, not only am I working
as a writer, and a historian,

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:44.420
I am living history, in a way that
is terrifying and fascinating,

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.910
and that I never thought
would occur in my lifetime.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.660
The recent White Supremacists
March happened on the grounds

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.520
of the school where I spent
four years of my life.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.030
The counter protests and
the attack took place

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.370
in Downtown Charolettesville,
the confederate statues

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.570
that ignited the firestorm,
are a 20 minute walk

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:04.150
from where I currently live.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.740
Now there's been a lot of
talk around Charolettesville,

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:11.870 position:56%
and around the country, about how
what happened there three weeks ago,

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.500
doesn't represent Charolettesville,
or America,

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.080
as we currently believe it to be.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.570
I love my country passionately,
I love my native state,

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:24.630
and I love my adopted city, but
I also know the painful history,

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.240
and what happened on August 12th,

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.060
that to Charolettesville,
and America.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.900
It's an America that has
battled the betters angels

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.430
of our nature from the beginning.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:38.900
For example, from the 1930's
to the 1950's, my Alma mater,

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.510
and other Virginia Universities,
payed qualified black students

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:46.410
to attend Graduate School out of
state, rather than to allow them

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:50.420
to continue their educations
at home, in Virginia.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.070
Virginia closed schools,
rather than complying

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:56.690
with the Supreme Court's Brown
versus Board of Education decision,

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.660
and allowing the blacks of
the hidden figures generation,

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.890
to learn alongside whites.

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:06.090
And that was nearly a century
after the end of the Civil War.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:08.930
My father is a retired
NASA Scientist.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:12.290
His name is Robert Lee,
and his family roots are

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:15.790
in West Marlin County,
Virginia, which also happens

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:20.170
to be the birthplace of the
confederate, General Robert E. Lee.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:24.220
America is about both the slavery,
and racial terror associated

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.950
with the confederate monument, and
it is also about those beautiful,

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:33.380
revolutionary ideals of progress,
and freedom that were written

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:37.020
into existence by our
founding documents.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.170
But it's also about
so very much more.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:45.410
As James Baldwin said, "American
History is longer, larger,

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.880
more various, more
beautiful, and more terrible

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.670
than anything anyone
has ever said about it.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.710
I believe that one of
the reasons why the push

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:57.270
to remove these statues
is so strong right now,

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:01.280
is because the statues symbolize,
not just the presence of the racial

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.610
that tie that marks our history,
but it also signals an absence,

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.250
the absence of tails
of people who live,

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.660
not just Black lives,
but American lives.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.420
People who pushed our country to
live up to it's founding ideals,

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.430
not in-spite of their
history, but because of it.

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:24.520
That absence has created a powerful
vacuum, one that is urgently trying

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.220
to absorb the stories of people
like Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson,

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.140
Katherine Johnson,
and Christine Darden,

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.380
the woman that I write
about in Hidden Figures.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.390
Hidden figures is a Black story,
and it's a Virginian story,

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.620
it's a Woman's story, and
it's a Mathematician story,

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.550
but most fundamentally
it's an American Story.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:48.710
In the time since my classroom
days, I've come to understand

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:52.360
that learning History isn't just
an encounter with oppression

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.330
or with pain, it's a
necessary condition

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:58.170 position:56%
for progress, and for social change.

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:02.870
And now I know that storytelling,
that most human of activities,

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:06.280
storytelling determines both
the meaning of our past,

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.550
and also the trajectory
of our future.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:13.460
No one knew that better
than our founding writers.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:17.000
They wrote our Country
into existence,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.660
and for those of us who's
history here began with a bill

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.750
of sale, not the bill of rights.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:25.710
It is our job to be the
protagonists of our own stories,

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:30.420
and to write our lives into
the great ethic of America.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.220
Thank you!

00:33:32.220 --> 00:34:00.300
[ Applause ]

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:04.510
&gt;&gt; Ladies and Gentleman,
please welcome Scott Turow!

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:16.790
[ Applause ]

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:19.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Scott Turow: Tough act to follow.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:23.000
I'm going to start off
script for one second,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.850
because I was lucky enough to be at
the first National Book Festival,

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:30.300
I've returned from time to time,

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.520
and it is certainly my
favorite event of it's kind.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.450
And that is for two reasons.

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:42.360
One, is because, to me, writers
remain the true rock-stars,

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:48.210 position:56%
and I love being able to breathe the
same air as so many great writers

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:52.900
as are going to be here this
weekend, and are here tonight.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:56.500 position:56%
And secondly, if you think about it,

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:03.540
this is the only official National
Celebration that we have of books,

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:08.190
and authors, and readers, and it's
a great thing that we do that.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:13.460
So I need to thank the Library
of Congress, Dr. Hayden,

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.650
David Rubenstein, who's
head is shouldered

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.430
to the wheel for several years now.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:22.650
Maria Rana, everybody else who
has labored to bring this weekend

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:26.160
into being, because it
really is a peak moment

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.360 position:56%
for the American Literary Community.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:34.550
Anyway, now, of course,
I will talk about myself.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:39.180
[laughter] As a kid,
I watched too much TV.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:44.480
That, at least, was the opinion of
my aunt and uncle from California,

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.600
which they expressed tirelessly
to my mother whenever they came

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.050
to stay with us in Chicago.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:55.000
The one eyed monster, as my aunt
called it, was going to gnaw

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.890
through my brains,
dull me permanently,

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:00.970
and prevent me from reading.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:05.380
Much to my dismay, my mother
took their warning seriously,

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:12.050
because both my aunt and uncle
were, yes, psychoanalysts,

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:18.020
which to my mother, made them truth
tellers on the level of oracles.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:22.570
I do have to add that that did not
prevent my mother, years later,

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:26.220
when my aunt and uncle finally
had a family of their own,

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.320
didn't prevent my mom, occasionally

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.560
from observing how
much easier it was

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.240
to give other people high minded
advice about their children,

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:39.020
rather than follow
it with their own.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.650
[laughter] More important, my aunt
and uncle, much as I adored each

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:44.620
of them, had somewhat
missed the point.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:49.640
Yes, I weaseled my way in front
of the TV, and spent hours there

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:53.210
in a trans state, but I
read a great deal too.

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:58.330
I was, in fact, one of those kids
recklessly absorbed with fantasies,

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:04.220 position:56%
novels, TV, movies, and above all
the stories running in my own brain.

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:09.940
I was, I guess, accommodating
reality only in very small doses.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:13.960
If I were my own psychoanalyst
required to explain this,

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:18.230
I would highlight the stark
fears, and vulnerability I felt

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:24.100 position:56%
in a house dominated by my father,
a man of harsh and mercurial temper.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:28.250
But whatever the reason, certain
TV shows felt as essentially

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.130
to my well being as food and water.

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:35.080
Like so many others, I
worshiped Superman, Defender,

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.200
to quote the prologue
of the show, of "Truth,

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.700
Justice, and the American Way".

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:45.810
A little less typically, I also
couldn't wait to see Mighty Mouse

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:49.530
on Saturday mornings,
probably on some level,

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:53.870
I equated him with a
child with superpowers.

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:58.410 position:56%
Also, by the time I was nine or ten,
I made sure to save an hour or two

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:01.810
of my limited TV time,
thanks to my aunt and uncle,

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:05.620
for Perry Mason, on Saturday night.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.130
Perry always discovered the truth,

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.210
and made sure that
power was used fairly,

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:15.520
so that the guilty were
punished, and the innocent freed.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.630
As passionately as I gave myself
to these American Stories,

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:25.930
I began to notice a problem as
I got older, they were not true.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:30.930
Meaning, they did not offer the
clues about surviving in the world,

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.880
which I apparently
expected from them.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.050
It is of course, a given
of every childhood,

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:42.270
that there are no Santa Clauses,
or superheros, but in real life,

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:44.880
I realized, there couldn't
even be a Perry Mason.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:50.050
In time, I grew savvy enough to
realize that Hamilton Burger,

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:54.740
the Hapless District Attorney
couldn't possibly have kept his job

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:58.820
if every week he lost
to Perry Mason.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:05.230
This struggle between hope
and reality, child and adult,

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:10.730
led to an internal dialogue that
went on inside me for many years,

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.130
which I ultimately
ended up incorporating

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:15.850
in my second novel,
The Burden of Proof.

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:21.230
My hero, the defense lawyer, Sandy
Stern, my own answer, I suppose,

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:25.610
to Perry Mason, is long past
his child rearing years,

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:30.310
when Stern unexpectedly finds
himself babysitting for Sam,

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.960
a precocious five year old,
who sits down in Stern's lap

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.820
as they study the night sky.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:41.250
"Sandy? Sam said subtly,
" Does good always win?"

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:45.560 position:56%
Stern nearly asked what Sam was
referring to, but restrained himself

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.460
with the thought that
is was unseemly

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.280
to be evasive with a five year old.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.430
"No", Stern said finally,
"not always".

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:55.920
It does on TV, the boy said.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.730
This was offered in
part as refutation.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:03.260 position:56%
Well it should win, Stern said, That
is what television is showing you.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.060
Why doesn't it win?

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.640
It does not always
lose, it wins often,

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.980
but it does not win
every time, why not?

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.990
Sometimes the other
side is stronger,

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:16.600
sometimes both sides
are good in part,

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.370
sometimes neither, Stern thought.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:22.860
How much does good
win, Sam asked, a lot?

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.690
A lot, said Stern.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.650
He had meant to answer,
as many times as it loses,

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:32.010
but he felt this was inappropriate,
and perhaps not even correct.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:35.350
There was no place for
brutal honesty with a child.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.330
The questions, implicit

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:42.950
in this conversation have been
the obsessions of my adult years.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:45.840
Deciding what is good
in the first place,

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:50.230
and defining the circumstances in
which it is entitled to triumph,

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:55.320
how to deal fairly with the bad,
and how to survive as a human,

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.480
when those efforts founder.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.650
They were, I realize now,
the themes I was writing

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:05.380
about when I made my first serious
efforts at fiction in college,

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:08.450
and they remain my core
emotional concerns,

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:14.490
and drove me from academic life,
to law school in my late 20's.

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:18.060
Furthermore, like all of
my beloved fellow writers

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:22.210
at this wonderful festival, I have
had the extraordinary good fortune

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:25.620 position:56%
of finding out that these questions,
and the stories I have written

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:31.020
about them, preoccupy, not only
me, but many other Americans.

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:35.510
No surprise really, [inaudible]
told us, that from the start,

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.550
the law has been the
binding fabric of America.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:43.030
That is because we are
not simply a country,

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.100
a group of people drawn
together by the common places

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.350
of geography, or even language.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:52.600
Our fellowship in the
United States is based

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:57.250
on a larger mutual
adherence to central ideas.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.910
The government must be
subordination to law,

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:05.050
and what I've always regarded as
the greatest American ideal of all,

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:09.990 position:56%
the one that Thomas Jefferson, and
his coworkers borrow from John Lach,

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:14.800
namely, that all persons
are created equal.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.960
Our biggest idea is that
government must treat every citizen

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:24.620
with the same concern, and respect,
and guarantee to each citizen,

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:29.800 position:56%
an equal voice in the governments of
the nation we have formed together.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.720
So my story, as I understand it,
is part of that much larger story,

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.790
the one we tell together everyday,

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:42.410
and the one that we must always
strive to make ever truer.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.210
Thank you!

00:42:44.210 --> 00:43:00.300
[ Applause ]

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:05.510
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentleman,
please welcome Reshma Saujani.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:12.940
[ Applause ]

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.240
&gt;&gt; Reshma Saujani:
Thank you so much!

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.040
It's a huge honor to be here today.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.030
So when I think about
American Story,

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:23.450 position:56%
I think about one word, opportunity.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:27.830
I am, first and foremost,
the daughter of refugees.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:31.970
My parents came here in the
1970's, after being expelled

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:35.980
by the dictator, Idi
Amin, in Uganda.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:40.310
They were lucky for one
reason, and one reason alone,

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.920
both of my parents were engineers.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:50.050
And this country, in the 1970's,
was desperately seeking engineers,

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:53.480
so my parents because two
of a thousand refugees

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:56.280
who got status to come
to this country.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.000 position:56%
And even though they were engineers,
my father worked as a machinist

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.570
in a plant, and my
mother sold cosmetics.

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:07.820
My father would send his resume
out day, after day, after day,

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:11.190
and get rejection, after
rejection, after rejection.

00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:14.370
Til one day, a recruiter
told him, you know what,

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:16.060
why don't you change your name?

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.480
Why don't you change your name from
Mogoon [assumed spelling], to Mike,

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:24.260 position:56%
and my father did, and he got a job.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:30.040 position:56%
Every night, no matter how tired my
dad was, he would sit me on his lap,

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.640
he would read to me
about Dr. Kenning,

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.040
Mahaf Magandy [assumed
spelling], and Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:40.750
And I knew then, that why I
grew up, I wanted to give back

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:47.060 position:56%
to this nation, this nation that
had literally saved my parents life.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:52.990
So at age 33, I decided to do
that, and I ran for Congress,

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:55.970
in a New York City
Democratic Primary,

00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:58.280
against a 18 year incumbent,
because I thought

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.100
that that was a great idea.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:07.590
[laughter] I had like a one
percent chance of winning,

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:08.890
a thousand page policy book.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:11.520
I remember the only thing
my friends and I knew how

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.700
to do was build a website,
and we built one,

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:17.490
and we raised like 50 thousand
dollars from Indian Aunties

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:19.930
that were just so happy the
Indian girl was running.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:24.740
And it was the best
experience of my life.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:30.190
And I lost, miserably,
I was broke, humiliated,

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:34.660
I had pissed off everybody in
the democratic establishment,

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.780
but when I went to bed that
night, and my victory party

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:42.420
that never ended up happening,
the faces that I kept seeing over,

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.460
and over, and over again,
were actually the ones

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:47.430
that I had never met
on the campaign trail.

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:50.860
Because as you see, as the
member of Congress who are

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.580
in this room understand,
when you run for office,

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.230
you end up going into
a lot of schools.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:00.170
And I would go into Computer
Science classes, and Robotics Labs,

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:05.350 position:56%
and I'd see hundreds of boys,
clamoring to be the next Steve Jobs,

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:12.430
or Mark Zuckerberg, and I thought
to myself, where are the girls?

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:16.350
And this question of where are
the girls became my obsession,

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:20.020
because it didn't make sense to me.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.460
At a time where women are
the majority in college,

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:26.250
the majority in the labor force,
where are we in this industry

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:30.560
that is literally shaping
our collective future.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:34.970
And it also didn't make sense to
me, as a daughter of immigrants,

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:38.050
as someone who has benefited
from opportunity, because I knew

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:41.950
that there are 500 thousand
open jobs in Computer MTEC,

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:46.970 position:56%
and that we had only graduated 40
thousand Computer Science graduates,

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:52.210
compared to China, which
graduated 350 thousand Engineers.

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:56.560
And I also knew that our
families are changing.

00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.580
That 45 percent of the breadwinners
in our country, were women,

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:04.630 position:56%
and that it's woman in towns and
perishes that put food on the table,

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:06.700
and pay for the mortgage.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:11.500
So why were they disappearing
from this industry?

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.290
And I realized, well, it
wasn't always this way.

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:20.520
In the 1980's, almost 40 percent of
Computer Science majors were women,

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:24.590
and today that number
is less than 18 percent.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.670
If you were a cynic you would think

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:33.250
that an industry becomes more
powerful, we push women out.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:38.540
So the failed politician, the
non coder, oh yeah, I don't code,

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.660
decided to do something about it.

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:44.570
And I started an organization
called, Girls Who Code.

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:47.690
To offer free programs for girls,
over the summer and after school,

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:52.050
to teach them to get a
shot at the American dream.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:57.350 position:56%
And five years later, we've reached
40 thousand girls, in all 50 states.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:01.410
And as much as I'm a feminist, with
a capital 'F', I do not believe

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:05.180
in gender parody, for the
sake of gender parody,

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.420
I believe that when we teach
girls to code, we give them a shot

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.690
to march up into the middle
class, and we make sure

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:16.340
that there is no innovation that
will ever be left on the sidelines.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:20.410
And I see this everyday,
I see this in Jasmine,

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.980
who lives in California, Oakland.

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.720
Her mother works at Burger King,
single mom, family of four.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.310
Everyday Jasmine would take
two buses and trains to go

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:32.830
from her house to Facebook
to learn how to code.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:37.440
And in our program, you can
build whatever you want.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:41.250
Jasmine decided to build
an app called Wacky Words,

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:45.550
to teach kids SAT words, because
too may kids in her community,

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:49.090
they wanted a shot at the American
story, but they didn't have money

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:52.490
for fancy tutors, or
the SAT classes.

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:57.950
She built an app, not for
herself, but to help others.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:03.990 position:56%
I think about Courtney, from Carlton
Ohio, father drives an oil rig.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:08.230
Carlton has been decimated
by the heroin epidemic.

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:12.300
There's no WiFi in the homes,
no WiFi in the schools,

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:18.760
but still every week, 40 girls meet
in the local library to learn how

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:23.250
to code, to get a shot
at the American dream.

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:27.260
The same look that I see in
Courtney's father's eyes,

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:30.560 position:56%
is the look I saw in my fathers eye.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.340
He would do anything,
and everything for me

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.820
to have a shot at the
American dream.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:39.540
This is possible.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:43.930
I feel blessed that we've had
an opportunity to write a book,

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:49.520
because year, after year, after
year, we have to turn girls away,

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.640
and I want to make sure that girls
across the country have a shot

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.690
to march up into the middle class.

00:49:56.690 --> 00:50:00.370
I also believe that in
the moment where we feel

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:01.860
that diversity is under attack.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:05.790
We just recently learned
about Katherine Johnson,

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:10.160
and the tremendous contribution
that she had made to the History

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.170
of Computer Science, and that most
of you don't who Ada Lovelace,

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:16.490
or Grace Hopper, or any
other the other women are,

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:21.940
is it important now, more than ever
before to set the record straight,

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:26.110
to make sure that girls see
themselves in these future jobs,

00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:29.280
which is why I'm so proud in this
book, that not only do we talk

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:35.980 position:56%
about Katherine, and Ada, and Grace,
we talk about Lela, and Sofia.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:42.030 position:56%
Lela, who wears a hijab, Sofia, who
is Latina, that has an Abuela, Lucy,

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:45.720
who has braids, and loves games.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:50.030
Every American girl can see
themselves in the stories

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:54.150
in our book, and I truly
believe that through this,

00:50:54.150 --> 00:51:00.230
we can change the world, one
book, and one girl at a time.

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.030
Thank you!

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:19.930
[ Applause ]

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:24.510
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentleman,
please welcome Diana Gabaldon.

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:33.470
[ Applause ]

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.250
&gt;&gt; Diana Gabaldon: Thank you
very much for being here tonight,

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.500
and thanks for having me.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:43.740
Be relaxed they said,
be casual they said.

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.320
[laughter] Do it in
seven minutes they said.

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.320
[laughter] Okay!

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:55.010 position:56%
Guten Abend, which some of you may
know, means good evening, in German,

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:57.380
and the reason I say
that, is because most

00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.870
of you have no idea how close
we came to having everyone

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:03.300
in this room know what that meant.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.170
Which is to say, at the time
of the American Revolution,

00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:10.030
once it had succeeded, and we had
become a nation, Benjamin Franklin,

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:13.560
who was one of the sages of
the revolution at that point,

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:18.780
suggested that since so many of the
citizens at that point were German,

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:22.640
German should be the official
language of the new United States.

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:30.530
That motion went Congress, it was
voted on, it lost, by one vote,

00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:36.700
and here we all are, and from
a variety of different places.

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:41.360 position:56%
My story sort of became the American
Story, other than the obvious,

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.950
about who my parents
grandparents, etc. etc., were.

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:47.020
That's much to long of
a story to tell you.

00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:54.330
The short form is that when I once
went to Germany to do a book tour,

00:52:54.330 --> 00:52:58.950 position:56%
I was having lunch with the Germans,
and they said, well how did you come

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:03.470
to write these books, and I told
them, and they were shocked,

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:08.640 position:56%
SHOCKED, you know, to hear that I
had thrown away a perfectly good PhD

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:13.950
in Science, I have a PhD in
Quantitative Behavioral Ecology,

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.710
which is just animal
behavior with a lot

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:18.740 position:56%
of statistics, don't worry about it.

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:23.550
[laughter] My dissertation
was entitled [inaudible],

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:30.640
or as my husband says,
why birds build nests

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.990
where they do, and
who cares anyways.

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:39.430
[laughter] Well, the Germans were
still more shocked even more,

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:42.290
when they found out that not only
did I throw away a PhD and 12 years

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:47.870 position:56%
of career as a successful Scientist,
but that I had not then go back

00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:51.340
to school and learn
how to write a novel.

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.930
And as they said to me, they
said, no one in Germany would dare

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:57.540
to right a novel before first
getting PhD in Literature,

00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.930
and I said, that's
probably why two thirds

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:01.850
of your catalog are
American Authors.

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:07.240
Actually I didn't say that
because I have better manners

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.660
than that, but it's true.

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.500
The thing is, is I was talking
to Scott Turow before dinner,

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:18.300
and we were agreeing that the only
way to learn to write, is to write,

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.550
and that's what I thought when
I started writing a novel.

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.850
So the question was, what
was I going to write?

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:25.620
And after I thought about it for a
while, I thought, the easiest thing

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.890
to write seems to be
Historical Fiction.

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:31.130
Because I was a Research Professor,
I knew my way around a library,

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:34.180
I said it seems easier to look
things up than to make them up,

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:36.800
and if I turn up to have no
imagination, I can steal things

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.610
from the historical record.

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:42.740
So, when I began, I said,
where shall I set this book?

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:46.870 position:56%
I've got no background in anything
particular, one time will do as well

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:48.430
as another, I have
to look it up anyway.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:51.200
So I was looking for a
particular place, and I happened

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.630
to see a really old Dr.
Who rerun on television.

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:57.720
I gather some of you are
familiar with Dr. Who.

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.970
Yes well, he is a time lord from
the planet galfray who travels

00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:04.540
through space in time, having
adventures, and picks up companions

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.880
over different periods of History.

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.210
Well, in this particular he
has picked up a young Scotsman,

00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:13.570
from 1745, this was a nice
19 or 20 year old man,

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:16.210
who appeared in his kilt., I said,
well that's kind of fetching,

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:22.110
and I found myself still thinking
about this the next day, in church,

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:25.910
and I said, well you know,
it doesn't really matter

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:28.810
where you set this book, okay
so you need to start somewhere,

00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:31.060
why not Scotland, 18th century?

00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.100
So that's where I began,
knowing nothing about Scotland,

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:37.160 position:56%
or the 18th century, having no
plot, no outline, and no characters,

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.060
nothing but the rather
vague images conjured

00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:40.830
up by the notion of a man in kilt.

00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:44.680
[laughter] Which, of course, is a
very powerful and compelling image,

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:48.040
as all of the ladies
here could tell you.

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:52.230
Going back to the Germans, one of
my later books was quite lucky,

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:56.050
and I won the Korena
National Prize for Fiction,

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:59.080
and had to go to Germany to
accept it, which was very cool,

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.650
but the German Publisher had me
interviewed during that week,

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:04.790
by everybody, and the German media.

00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:06.680
And toward the end of
this very tiring week,

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.490
I was talking to a very gentleman
about a literary magazine,

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:12.400
they said, your work is terrific,
your nerdy drive is perfect,

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.840
your characters are
so three dimensional,

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.900
and I'm thinking yes, yes, go on.

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:21.530
And instead, he stopped and say,

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:24.420
there's just this one thing I
wonder, can you explain to me,

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.060
what is the appeal
of a man in a kilt?

00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:31.260
[laughter] Well, I was very tired,
or I might not have said it,

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.810
but I suppose it's the
idea that you could be

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:35.630
up against a wall with
him in a minute.

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:44.760
[laughter] So, you may be
wondering what this has to do

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.130
with the American Story,

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:52.080
but it actually has quite
a lot to do with it.

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:56.420
Which is to say, that in fact,
not only did I not get a PhD

00:56:56.420 --> 00:57:00.360
in literature, the only thing
I knew about books when I began

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.810
to write this novel, was that
they should have conflict.

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:04.300
That was the sum total of what,

00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.780
12 hours of English
Literature in college.

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:10.200
It seemed to be enough, anyways,
I went to the library looking

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:13.300
for conflict in Scotland, in the
18th century, but you don't do

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:14.600
that for very long without running

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.710
into Bonny Prince Charlie
and the Jacobite.

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:19.360
And so that became the
material for my first book,

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.820
and again for the second book.

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:23.260
I was only going to write this
book for practice, I wasn't going

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:25.830
to show it to anyone, or
tell anyone what I was doing,

00:57:25.830 --> 00:57:27.130
but things happened.

00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:30.690
And I had an agent before I
finished it, and I told him,

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:32.170
I think there's more to this story,

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.370
but I think I should stop while I
could still lift it, and he said,

00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:37.690
okay, and so he told them that,

00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:39.760
luckily several people
did want to buy it.

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.130
And they said, trilogies
are very popular these days,

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:43.850
do you think she could write three?

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:46.600
Being a good agent, he
said, oh I'm sure she could.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.380
So I got a three book contract,

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:52.160
and proceeded with the Jacobite
revolution, the rebellion.

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:56.340
Well as you well know, the Highland
Scots lost big time on that one,

00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:00.430
and as a result, many, many, many
of them came to the Americas,

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:04.740
most of them involuntarily,
and here they rested.

00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:07.060
So at the time of the
American Revolution,

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:11.150 position:56%
one colonist out of every three, was
a Scot, and we have several of them

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:13.620
as signers of the Declaration,
and so forth.

00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:16.120
Now people reading my books,
at the end of the second book,

00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.150
and now the third book, and
people say, what is this,

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:20.700
it's not Scotland, and I said,
no, didn't you notice they lost

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:22.360
at the end of the last book.

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:25.110
Andy they said, well we want to
read about Scotland, and I said,

00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:28.620 position:56%
well tough the story went across
the ocean, and now we're in America.

00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:32.020
So, that's where the story has
developed over the next six books,

00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:36.400
and so forth, and became
increasingly interested

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.930
in how many different people
contributed to the American story,

00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:42.050
at this point and time,
we're working our way

00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:44.760
through the several years
of the American Revolution,

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.400
and we're dealing with Quakers,
and [inaudible] Germans,

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:52.690
non [inaudible] Germans, and with
the gales from the Highlands,

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:57.810
the low life Scots, also with
the Africans who were there,

00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:00.160
most of them involuntarily as well.

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.490
Interestingly enough,
the Highlanders,

00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:05.520
and the Africans had
things in common,

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:10.070 position:56%
both being involuntarily there, many
of them being there in servitude,

00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:14.810
but there was quite a lot
of cultural overlap in part

00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:17.550
to the music and songs they had.

00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:20.230
You will find something
called [inaudible],

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:23.550
singing in African
American early music,

00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:26.130
which was contributed
to American Jazz.

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:27.530
What's interesting
is that you will find

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:30.130
that very same thing
among-st Gaelic Highlanders

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:33.010
who have never seen Africa,
and evidently came up with it

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:35.740
on their own, the other
interesting thing is

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:43.390 position:56%
that as the gales came an indentured
servitude, still they were white,

00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:46.590
which was kind of an advantage at
the time, and therefore they were

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:51.990 position:56%
in some cases, made overseers of the
other slaves, I count them as slaves

00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:54.640
as well, on plantations,
and the like.

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.150
And the interesting thing was,

00:59:56.150 --> 01:00:00.800
that many of the Black people
there learned to speak Gaelic,

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.250
because their overseers
spoke Gaelic.

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:08.670
And as newly people
arrived from the Highlands,

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:16.520 position:56%
being mapped by black inhabitants on
the docks, and there response was,

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.860
my God man, what happened to
you, the sun must be terrible.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:26.060
And the thing is, there is this
cross fertilization always.

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:31.490
From the very beginning, several
members of my family fought

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:33.690
in the American Revolution,
on both sides,

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:36.330
as well as being German
mercenaries, my fathers side

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:39.560
of the family had landed
in Santa Fa in 1705,

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.350
so they kind of sat that one out.

01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:45.860
But you know, I have always
enjoyed what we call hybrid vigor,

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.960
it means that we derive our gene
pool, and our cultural fascination

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.090
from all different kinds of places.

01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:59.150
And the languages too
have contributed to this.

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:02.520
I heard someone say that
English is a language

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.690
that chases other languages down
a dark alley, knocks them over,

01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:08.470
a goes through their
pockets for loose grammar.

01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:14.370
[laughter] And this
is pretty much true.

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:17.540
However, as Miss Shetterly
said earlier,

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:22.220
the roots of our revolution, of
our language, of our culture,

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:26.500
go back to England, and the elegant
language of the 18th century,

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:30.930
Washington and Jefferson, mad as
much of an impact as they did,

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:35.860
in part, because of what they said,
as well as what they meant by it,

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.380
and so we kind of beat
Germany out by a bit,

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:41.670
and became a nation
of English speakers.

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:45.470
The funny thing is that
a lot of the philosophy

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:49.590
of the American Revolution
arose from English club men,

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:53.890
and this is where they got their
socialization, they all belonged

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:56.220
to societies, some of
which were philosophical,

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:59.750
some of which studied literature,
some of which had other views

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:05.300
in mind, such as the Anacreondic
society who's goal was drinking.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:10.260
And they had a particular song
that they sang at each one

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:15.440
of their meetings which ended
with, Besides I'll instruct you,

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.740
like meat and wine, [inaudible].

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:21.480
Which is the 18th century
equivalent of,

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:28.910
let's all get drunk and have sex.

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:36.910
Most of you will be more familiar
with it in it's later incarnation.

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:44.310
Oh say does that Star
Spangled Banner yet wave,

01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:48.490
ore the land of the free,
and the home of the brave.

01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:56.460
And the moral of that
is, the words matter.

01:02:57.510 --> 01:03:12.180
[ Applause ]

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:16.510
&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentleman, please
welcome David McCullough.

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:33.620
[ Applause ]

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.430
&gt;&gt; David McCullough:
What a wonderful night,

01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:37.770
and how privileged we
all are to be here.

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:41.630
I just look at these
fabulous words up here,

01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:45.980
Library of Congress
National Book Festival.

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:50.660
Think of what is entailed in just
those words, that we have a Library

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:56.740 position:56%
of Congress, that we have a National
Book Festival, and to take part

01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:02.100
in it, as one of the writers, is
for me, a very high privilege.

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:07.760
And I am pleased to say that I've
been involved with this event

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:14.560
since it's beginning in 2001, and
to prove, with all the enthusiasm

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:20.240
that I can, of keeping it going,
and keeping it going indefinitely.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.350
And I want to say thank you to Dr.
Hayden, and all of those who work

01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:29.180
with you, for the marvelous
contribution you make,

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:32.450
you and the staff of the Library
of Congress, to our country

01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:35.000
and to it's betterment
in so many ways.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.820
I have been devoting my working
life to the American story

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:49.930
for over 50 years,
and I'm ever grateful

01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:55.010 position:56%
that I somehow hove the good fortune
of having wandered into this way

01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:59.570
of life, this way of
contributing what I can

01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:03.830
to the betterment of our country.

01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:08.420
I've done this on paper,
I've done it in classrooms,

01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:15.700
I've done it on television, and on
the stage, and in every way I can,

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:20.710
to convey that history isn't
about boring statistics

01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:24.500
and quotations, and
memorizing dates.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:28.550
It isn't about just
politics in the military,

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:34.470
history is human, it
is about people.

01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:39.900
When in the course of human
events are declaration begins,

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.560
and the operative word
there is human.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:47.050
And I've had wonderful
responses from readers,

01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:53.220
and television viewers, students
I've lectures in colleges

01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.340
and universities all
over the country.

01:05:55.340 --> 01:06:00.610
And the compliments I
take very much to heart,

01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:01.910
including one that happened

01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:06.450
in the most unexpected
way just two years ago.

01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:11.700
In Boston, where we had that
horrendous blizzard series,

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:15.740
nine feet of snow, in a matter
of about a month or less,

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:20.230
it was a blizzard every two or
three days, with brief intervals,

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:25.140 position:56%
where we could try to get out to get
food, to get provisions to survive.

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:28.430
Rosy [assumed spelling] and I were
living in Bat may at the time,

01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:32.720
and she would make a list, I would
make a list, we would both go

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.090
over it to get what we needed.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:39.680
In one particular bad series
of storms, we got up a list

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.500
of everything we needed, and I
went over, when the break came,

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:47.380
in the weather, and the Star Market
[assumed spelling] back then was

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:52.790
just a mad house of people
trying to get stuff to get by,

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:57.870
and it was as if the Russians were
in Rhode Island, or something.

01:06:57.870 --> 01:07:07.620
And I got everything on the
list, except the cashews.

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:12.930
And as you know, you can't
survive without cashews.

01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:17.840
[laughter] So I saw a fellow
walking by with a Star Market label

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.880 position:56%
on his shirt, and I said, excuse me,

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.650
could you please help
me to find the cashews?

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:25.950
He said, yes follow me.

01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:28.420
So I followed him, and we
went around a few bends,

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:34.810
the whole peanut, and nut
department, and I got my cashews,

01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:39.770
and about seven minutes later I was
checking out at the cash register.

01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:44.230
And the same fellow came up
to me, and he said, excuse me,

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:48.370
I don't mean to bother you,
but that voice, your voice,

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:52.790
were you by any chance the voice
on Ken Burns Civil War series?

01:07:52.790 --> 01:07:56.690
And I said, yes I was.

01:07:56.690 --> 01:08:02.020
And he said, well I want to thank
you from the bottom of my heart,

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.950
because when that series
first came on the air,

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:08.510
I was suffering terribly
from insomnia.

01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:14.040
[ Laughter ]

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:17.980
He said, I'd hear your
voice and go right out.

01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:26.300
So I hope very much, I won't have
that effect on all of you tonight.

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:32.080
I found my vocation here,
in the Library of Congress.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.410
I had wanted to be a writer, I
had gone through Vale University,

01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:39.850
and I majored in English,
I thought maybe like to be

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:45.800 position:56%
like Carlton Wilder, who's been part
of a faculty there, and write plays,

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.640
or certainly not plays, novels.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:53.960
I had no expectation whatsoever of
writing a biography, or history.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.930
When I got out of college,
I couldn't make

01:08:55.930 --> 01:09:00.370 position:56%
up my mind whether I wanted to be an
actor, or an architect, or a writer,

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:04.470
or a painter and thought, I know
what I'll do, I'll go to New York

01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:05.770
and something will happen.

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:10.230
So I went to New York, and I
wound up working for Time and Life

01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:13.380
for six years, six and a half
years, and learned a hell of a lot,

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.740
about writing, and
about getting work done,

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:19.280
and getting it done on time.

01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:22.670
And then Kennedy was running for
President, and when he called

01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:26.980
on people, his address to do
something fro your country,

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:30.780
I took that directly to heart,
quit my job, came down here

01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.200
to Washington, and wound up working

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:36.750
for the U.S. Information
Agency under Edward R. Murrow.

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:40.750
It was a very exciting time,
not only because we were working

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:45.620
for Murrow, but we were
working on the new frontier.

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:48.450
And I was put in charge of a
magazine for the Arab world,

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:54.630
and I had a very limited budget,
which I had to keep-- make work.

01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:58.430
And one of the ways I discovered
that could be done was to search

01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:05.310
out the resources for free
material, principally pictures,

01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:09.500
the magazine was called
[inaudible], life in America,

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:13.780
it was based on Life magazine,
sold on the newsstands.

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:16.230
And I came up to the
Library of Congress,

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:19.340
to try and find wonderful
material that we could use

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:22.160
in the magazine, it was free.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:28.280
And while I was here working
one day, I passed the Department

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.240
of Photographs, I went by a table,

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.530
and on the table was this
wonderful array of photographs,

01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:40.620 position:56%
taken by a photographer that had
gotten into Johnstown, Pennsylvania,

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:45.130
within days after the terrible,
disastrous flood of 1889.

01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:48.930
and I had grown up in
Pittsburgh, and I had heard

01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:51.350
about the Johnstown
flood all my life,

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:53.510 position:56%
but I didn't know anything about it.

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:57.800 position:56%
All I knew was that when we were
kids, we used to put a lake of gravy

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.210
in the mashed potatoes, and
then we'd break the potatoes

01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:04.670
with our fork, and as they
gravy came down into the peas,

01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:09.220
we'd say, the Johnstown flood.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.150
[laughter] And I looked at
these photographs, and I said,

01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:12.950
what in the world happened?

01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:15.770
I couldn't believe the devastation.

01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:19.250
Now keep in mind, that was
the worst man made disaster,

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:24.300
and nature made disaster that had
ever hit the country, until then.

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:28.560
Over 2,500 people died,
as many as died

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:33.070
in the tower in New York, at 9/11.

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:39.320
And I got interested in it, and
I took a book out of the library,

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:45.080
this library, and it wasn't very
good, the author didn't seem

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.380
to understand the geography

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:49.580
of Western Pennsylvania,
I at least knew that.

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:53.260
So I took another book out, and
it was a pot boiler at the time,

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:55.930
it was very inaccurate,
so I thought, no.

01:11:55.930 --> 01:12:02.620
So, when I was in college, Thornton
Wilder was asked, how do you come

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:05.830
up with the id-- write the
plays and novels you've written?

01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:10.100
And he said, I imagine a story
that I would like to see produced

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:14.850
on stage, or to read in a
book, and if I can't find that,

01:12:14.850 --> 01:12:16.800
I write it so I can read it,

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.030
or write it so I can see
it performed on stage.

01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:24.520
So I said to myself, why
don't you write, try to write,

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.430
the book about the Johnstown
flood how you would like to read.

01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:31.300
And in effect, that's what I've
been doing with every subject

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:34.330
that I've undertaken
since I began this work.

01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:40.560
I had never done historic research,
I had never taken anything more

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.210
of history than what was required
when I was an undergraduate,

01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:47.240
I have no graduate degrees,
and I've never thought

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:49.390
of myself as a Historian.

01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:52.130
I'm called a Historian,
and I'm always complimented

01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:53.830
by that, but I'm a Writer.

01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:59.650
I'm a writer, writing what
really happened, as best I can.

01:12:59.650 --> 01:13:03.650
And because of a lot of writing
that I had done in college,

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:06.880
in the courses I took, and writing
that I had done at that time

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.150
in life, I realized, you have
to understand the people.

01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:13.450
Who was involved?

01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:14.750
What were they like?

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.060
What were they thinking?

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.360
How were they raised?

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.950
Where did they come from?

01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:22.830
What were there problems,
internally, or externally?

01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:26.030
And what were the adversities
they faced?

01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:29.100
History is about people.

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:33.450
And because I was in Washington,
during the Kennedy years,

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:36.540
Kennedy as many if you
may remember, or know,

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:40.750
was asked about what he was
reading, and he was reading,

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.700
Barbara Tuchmans, The
Guns of August.

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.850
So I went out right away and got
Barbara Tuchmans, Guns of August,

01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:49.740
I thought, whoa, this is the kind

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.460
of history book I'd
like to read more of.

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:56.960 position:56%
So I began reading people like Bruce
Caplan, and others, and I realized

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.930
that writers can write history.

01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:05.540
And Barbara Tuchman, in one of her
essays bout writing history, said,

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:09.560
there's no secret to writing
history, or teaching history,

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:15.420
tell stories, the American
Story, which has hardly,

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:19.100
been even half told so far.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:22.840
For one thing, too much attention
has been focused on politics

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.890
in the military, yes
politics in the military are

01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:31.810
of the utmost importance, but
they no means are the human story.

01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:37.210
That involves poetry, music, art,
it involves science and medicine,

01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:40.460
and finance, and it involves luck,

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:44.460
we never talk about what part
luck has played in history,

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:48.840
and it involves individual human
beings who made a difference.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.930
And what began to interest me
particularly, once I had gotten

01:14:52.930 --> 01:14:56.080
into writing, as soon as
I started doing research

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.360
for the Johnstown flood,
much of which I did here.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.230
I've done research for every single
one of my books here in the Library

01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:07.710 position:56%
of Congress to a large degree or to
a small, but to an important degree.

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:10.730
My book on the Wright Brothers,
was drawn almost entirely

01:15:10.730 --> 01:15:15.640
from the extraordinary, amazing
collection of letters and diaries,

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.230
kept by the Wright Brothers,
and their mother and father,

01:15:18.230 --> 01:15:21.520
and sister, all right here.

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.700
And, OH, could they write!

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:27.950
Because their father raised
them to express themselves

01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:30.540
in the English language
as best possible.

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:36.010
And he meant to express themselves
on paper, and on their feet.

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:38.920
They never had even
completed high school,

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.860 position:56%
and yet you read those letters
here, and you think, oh my goodness,

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:47.380
the vocabulary, the use of
the command of the language,

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:52.400
and you realize, we've got a
lot of catching up to the kind

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.440
of high school and kind of bringing
up those young men experienced.

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:03.160
They lived in a house, they had no
running water, no indoor plumbing,

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:10.170
no central heat, no telephone,
but it was a house full of books,

01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:12.690
because their father
believed you had to read.

01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:16.690
You have to read above your level,
so there were no children's books,

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:20.660
they were all real books, and
they read all their lives.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:25.270
I'm not, in any way
demeaning children's books.

01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:30.060
[laughter] They stick with you side
mazy lazy bird, hatching her eggs

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:32.650
on tiles and on boards, with
kinks in my leg from sitting here,

01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:34.790
sitting here, day after day,
it's work how I hate it,

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.090
I hate it, I'd much rather play.

01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:44.880
[laughter] [applause]
When I first went,

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:52.250
in grade school we were told we
could visit the school library,

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:55.580
and this was in kindergarten,
and we went in,

01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.880
and oh boy, were we thrilled.

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:02.900
And the Librarian, Miss
Powell [assumed spelling],

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:07.600
we all sat down at little
tables, the librarian said,

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:12.020
now did you all bring
your library shoes?

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:16.170
Meaning you couldn't be quiet, and
I thought, my mother didn't tell me

01:17:16.170 --> 01:17:19.540
that you had to have library
shoes, and I felt so awful,

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:22.620
I felt so insecure
about my library shoes.

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:26.020
I can't come into any of these
libraries now without wondering

01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:27.490
if I have my library shoes on.

01:17:27.490 --> 01:17:31.620 position:56%
But the first book I got up and went
over to the shelf to pick out was,

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:33.630
Horton Hatches the Egg,
the one I just quoted.

01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:37.760
It sticks with you, it's
important, it's part of growing up,

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.280
it's part of discovering.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.910
I often think that the book
that influenced me more

01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:46.940 position:56%
than anything was, The Little Engine
That Could, which has two lesson,

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:49.880
you persevere, but
also, you work together,

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:53.890
it's not just trying
to do something alone.

01:17:53.890 --> 01:18:00.690
I-- I've often wondered
about why I d o what I do,

01:18:00.690 --> 01:18:04.360
and whether I have some
weird ways of going about it,

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:09.330
and I've been reluctant to talk
about it openly, until recently,

01:18:09.330 --> 01:18:12.080
and I thought, what
the hell, admit it.

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.290
I've never undertaken a
subject I knew anything about.

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:19.560
If I knew all about it, I
wouldn't want to work on the book.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.950
To me, the writing, the
research, the thinking that goes

01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:25.950
into the work, is an adventure.

01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:30.740
It's working on a detective case,
it's stepping foot on a continent

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:34.110
where I've never set
foot in my life,

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:39.950
and I love that part
of the adventure.

01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:44.160
I also have felt very strongly
that I wanted to give some people

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.010
that don't get sufficient
credit, credit for the first time,

01:18:48.010 --> 01:18:52.880
bring them back, bring them on
stage, downstage, center stage,

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.320
with the lighting on
them, and bring some

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:59.750
of these seemingly peripheral
people up to the front,

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:02.980
in center stage too,
like Abigail Adams,

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.910 position:56%
or Emily Robling [assumed spelling],
the wife of the great engineer,

01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:12.980
of the great Brooklyn Bridge,
and to point out to all of us,

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:16.030
we can't forget these people.

01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:22.650
John Adams, always upstage with by
two tall Virginians on either side,

01:19:22.650 --> 01:19:26.440
but when you think of what
John Adams did in his life,

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:31.070
he was the only founding
father, President,

01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:35.260
who never owned a slave,
out of principal.

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:40.660
He would not own a slave, nor would
Abigail allow him to own a slave.

01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:44.680
And the first president after John
Adams who never owned a slave,

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:47.530
was their son, John Quincy Adams.

01:19:47.530 --> 01:19:50.080
Now, that's not a minor attribute.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.120
The oldest Constitution we have

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:56.100
in our country is not our National
Constitution, it's the Constitution

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.290
of Massachusetts, and he wrote it.

01:19:58.290 --> 01:20:03.760
And in that Constitution there's a
clause about education that applies

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:08.800
as much today, as it ever did then,
and hopefully will always apply.

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:15.080
I felt very strongly, that the
Wright Brothers, for example,

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.200
we would learn in high school
that the first airplanes,

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:22.130
motor powered plane to be flown
was flown by the Wright Brothers,

01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:25.820
but Kenny Hawkins was 19'3
and he changed the world.

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.440
But what about them?

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.740
How did they grow up?

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:30.570
What were they like?

01:20:30.570 --> 01:20:32.860
How did they grow up?

01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:34.280
What did they believe?

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:38.810
Well, one thing they believed is
that they had purpose in life.

01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:43.480
Don't just go on thinking it's
all about material acquisitions,

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.790
or getting a lot of property, or
becoming famous, or something.

01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:54.900
No! Have purpose, and
modesty, you remember modesty?

01:20:56.510 --> 01:21:06.160
[ Applause ]

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:12.600
The Wright Brothers never bragged
a word about what they achieved.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:16.520
The Wright Brothers never
said anything derogatory

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:22.620
about their rivals, never, because
that was the way they were raised.

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:27.910
And to be loyal, and to be
honest, to tell the truth,

01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:32.550 position:56%
and it's the way many of us, most of
us, I'd like to think, were raised.

01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:34.590
And we still like to believe that.

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:37.660
And we also believe that our story,

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.940
as a country, is a
story of progress.

01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:45.050
It doesn't always come easily,
it doesn't always come instantly,

01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:49.820
it isn't always apparent right
away, but it is progress.

01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:53.340
When I was working on my book about
Johnstown, I spent a lot of time

01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:57.030
in Johnstown, and I
heard about the engineer

01:21:57.030 --> 01:22:03.140 position:56%
who helped bring the Bessemer System
to the Steel Mills, in Johnstown,

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:07.390
very early, one of the
earliest mills in the country

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:10.180
to develop the Bessemer Process.

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:13.520
And this fellow was always
working to develop new machinery,

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:17.730
new equipment, new devices,
and his famous line was--

01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:20.690
after they'd been working for
months and months on a new piece

01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:24.060
of machinery, he'd say,
Alright boys, let's start her

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:27.680
and see why she doesn't work.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:33.310
That's what we're about, it's
call the Empirical Method.

01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:34.610
You do-- you try something,

01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:36.640
and if it doesn't work you
study why it doesn't work,

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:40.440
and then you fix it, and then
maybe eventually it will work.

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:43.240
It's been true all along.

01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:47.280
And we are constantly making
progress which we don't recognize

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.730
as progress because we're in the
thick of it, we're in the midst

01:22:49.730 --> 01:22:53.330
of it, as everybody always was.

01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:57.650
When you think for example,
what's happened in our country,

01:22:57.650 --> 01:23:02.490
in our lifetime, in medicine,
it's utterly phenomenal.

01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:05.710
I think that future historians
may very well, while looking back

01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:11.170
on our time, say, well that's
what real history was then,

01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:13.690
that was history being made.

01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:17.990
And it comes from ideas,
it comes from education,

01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:22.420
it comes from imagination,
and genius, yes.

01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:27.510
It does happen, because some people
really have that touch of genius,

01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:30.290
and they should be part of History.

01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:33.730
Those doctors who's names we don't
figure at all, we should know

01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:38.000
who they were, and what
they did, just as is true

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.080
about our painters and our writers.

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:44.900
I thank my lucky stars that
I quit my job in New York,

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.660
and came to this city when I did.

01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:52.050
It not only changed my
outlook, it changed my life,

01:23:52.050 --> 01:23:57.850
but it's given me ambitions
to expand the experience

01:23:57.850 --> 01:24:01.220
of being alive, through
the experience of history,

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:04.330 position:56%
the experience of our story in a way

01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:07.480
that probably would never
have happened, had I not taken

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.910
that step, taken that venture.

01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:15.520
And every time I come into
this library, I thank goodness

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:19.860
that we live in a society, in
a country that out the library

01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:23.600
on a acropolis, right
here with our Capital,

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:29.100 position:56%
because that's the way it should be,
that's how we should feel about it.

01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:33.960
And I know we all have favorite
libraries in our hometowns,

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:37.400
or where we grew up, but
this is one of the miracles

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:42.510
of the American Story, this
great Library of Congress.

01:24:42.510 --> 01:25:10.880
[ Applause ]

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.520
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:20.030
