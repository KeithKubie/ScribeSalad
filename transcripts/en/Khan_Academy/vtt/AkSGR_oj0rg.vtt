00:00:00.652 --> 00:00:05.113
(children talking)

00:00:05.113 --> 00:00:07.654
Salman: We do a lot of
virtual things on Khan Academy

00:00:07.654 --> 00:00:10.111
and We Teach Science and
the goal of the summer camp

00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:13.862
really is to give the students
a real physical experience

00:00:13.862 --> 00:00:16.529
that really connects a lot of
the concepts that you might learn

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.653
on something like a Khan Academy video.

00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:23.070
So we do things like real
engineering, we build Lego robots

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.445
that the students actually
write software for

00:00:25.445 --> 00:00:29.486
that autonomously sumo wrestle,
we do market simulations,

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:34.318
we perform experiments but this all
involves indoor and outdoor activities.

00:00:34.318 --> 00:00:36.228
We just do a bunch of
stuff that really connects

00:00:36.228 --> 00:00:39.011
a lot of the abstract conceptual
things that you might learn

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:41.923
on say a Khan Academy video and then
you bring it into the classroom.

00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:44.589
So in the market simulations,
students learn about probability,

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.506
they learn about gain theory,
they learn about trading.

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:50.398
In the robotics they learn about
engineering, they learn about math,

00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:53.173
they do a lot of trigonometry
and geometry so we really try

00:00:53.173 --> 00:00:56.090
to make it all very
tangible for the students.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.253
Aragon: So this is mental boot camp 2010.

00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:03.151
It's a one week course held in
Portola Valley in the Bay area

00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:08.151
for about 20 to 25 students ranging
from 6th grade to roughly 9th grade.

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:12.442
Spend a week exploring math and science
and technology in the real world.

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:14.942
What you're seeing today
is a big part of our course

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:19.363
which is the robotics portion and
we're using the Lego Mindstorm NXT's

00:01:19.363 --> 00:01:22.529
and we've given the kids a
challenge for the week to make

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:27.897
a sumo wrestling robot and they're
designed to fight on these wooden tables

00:01:27.897 --> 00:01:30.980
that you see, one-on-one, and the idea is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.695
to push your fellow robot off the edge.

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:36.195
So they're using a variety
of tools within the robots,

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:39.146
there are sensors to detect
when you've fallen off the edge,

00:01:39.146 --> 00:01:43.267
there are other things like the
motors that drive them around

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:47.089
and then they've got actuators to hammer
on each other and push each other off.

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:48.649
So that's the main thrust of the week.

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.898
We're spending half of
the time doing robotics

00:01:51.898 --> 00:01:54.273
and then the other half
we're doing board games,

00:01:54.273 --> 00:01:56.190
we're doing the math behind board games,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.689
probability and statistics, game theories.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.439
The kids are also learning
about markets and for example,

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.484
trading markets and how they work.

00:02:05.484 --> 00:02:06.658
Rahul: Hi, I'm Rahul.

00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:07.524
Lance: And I'm Lance.

00:02:07.524 --> 00:02:16.179
Rahul: And this week we're building
a Lego NXT robot for our project.

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:20.652
Lance: The goal is to push the
opponent's robot off the table

00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:22.862
before your robot falls off.

00:02:22.862 --> 00:02:28.277
Rahul: We can do that by
making ultrasonic sensor-

00:02:28.277 --> 00:02:30.363
Lance: It goes and tries to look for it.

00:02:30.363 --> 00:02:32.318
Rahul: Yeah and there's a
light sensor to make sure

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:37.693
it doesn't fall off the table and also
here we have a motion track sensor

00:02:37.693 --> 00:02:40.777
so that when it backs up it
doesn't fall off the table

00:02:40.777 --> 00:02:45.693
because the ultrasonic sensor's facing
that way and so is the light sensor,

00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:48.245
that's why we stuck a
track sensor back here.

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:53.526
We also have some wheels
and these are our motors.

00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:56.994
Lance: This isn't working
very well but it's a whacker.

00:02:56.994 --> 00:03:03.411
It just kind of whacks the opponent's
robots to try and disassemble it

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:07.359
or push it or knock it
off balance or something.

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.328
Rahul: And here we can try to motion.

00:03:10.328 --> 00:03:13.160
Lance: I'm just going to run the program.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.411
(robot sounds)

00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:34.109
(children laughing)

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.917
Voiceover: Your robot still won.
