- OH, OKAY,
I'M BOBBY BOTTLESERVICE,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.106 line:0%
 
AKA, BOBBY BOTTLESERVICE.

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.242
I HAVE A GREAT DESIRE
TO KNOW THE UNKNOWABLE.

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:10.244
TO SEE THE UNSEEABLE.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.112
TO UNDERSTAND PARALEGAL
ACTIVITY.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.881
AKA, GHOSTS.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:15.916
[bell peals]
WITH ME, AS PER ALWAYS,

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.685
IS MY BEST FRIEND
AND NIGHT-VISION VIDEOGRAPHER,

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.387
PETER PAPARAZZO...

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.124 line:0%
 
- YO, I'M NOT PARTICULARLY
AFRAID OF ANY SPECIFIC GHOST.

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.159
- AND OUR DEAF/MUTE
SOUND GUY GIAN.

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:28.028
I MEAN, THIS KID
ALWAYS SHOWS UP.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:37.404
AND TOGETHER,
WE'RE VERY MUCH <i>GHOST BOUNCERS.</i>

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.872
[woman screams]

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.447
SO WE RECENTLY GOT A CALL FROM
AN OLD-TIMEY TOURIST LOCATION

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.183
THAT THEY HAD FOUND GHOSTS.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:51.652
SO WE WENT DOWN THERE
TO FIND THOSE GHOSTS

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:54.388
AND BOUNCE THOSE GHOSTS OUT,
BRO.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.590
- THIS BUILDING DATES BACK
TO THE 1800s,

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.525
WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY
A BROTHEL.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.295
AND IN 1854,
THERE WAS A MASSIVE FIRE HERE

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:03.897
THAT DESTROYED MUCH OF
THE THIRD FLOOR AND THE ATTIC.

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:06.266
- WE WERE VERY MUCH AROUSED
TO LEARN THAT THIS LOCATION

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.235
HAD AT ONE TIME BEEN
A BROTHEL.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.070
DUDE, THIS PLACE IS SO OLD.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.506
THERE'S NO, LIKE,
FLAT SCREENS OR ANYTHING.

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.175
- YO, IS THAT A GHOST?
- NO, BRO.

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:17.611
THAT'S A VERY MUCH CUTE,
ADORABLE ELDERLY WOMAN.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.246
- SINCE BEEN RECONSTRUCTED,
AND OBVIOUSLY...

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.548
- [scoffs] WHAT IS THIS,
LITTLE HOUSE ON THE <i>SCARY?</i>

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:24.651
- [laughs]
GIAN, YOU GET THAT, BRO?

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:26.553
- NOW PLEASE FOLLOW ME
UPSTAIRS.

00:01:26.587 --> 00:01:27.588
[woman screams]

00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:29.456
NOW, ONE GIRL DID DIE
IN THE FIRE.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.825
[woman screams]
SHE WAS 16 YEARS OLD,

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.293
AND AS THE STORY GOES,
SHE WAS ON HER WAY

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:34.695
TO TURN HER FIRST TRICK.

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:38.165
- SO SHE WAS A WHORE?
- SHE WAS, YES.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.934
- BUT IN ADDITION TO,
AS WELL AS, SHE WAS A VIRGIN?

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:42.302
- YES.

00:01:42.336 --> 00:01:45.405
- OH, VIRGIN WHORE, BRO!
- PERFECT.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.674
- PERFECT. DUDE!
[snaps fingers]

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.576
APPARENTLY THIS WOMAN
WAS A GIRL

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.446
WHO WAS ALSO A VIRGIN BUT,
AS WELL AS, A HOOKER

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.747
WHO HAD DIED IN A FIRE.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:59.219
- SOME PEOPLE SAY THEY SMELL
THE WAFT OF A JASMINE PERFUME.

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:01.488
- I VERY MUCH PUT MATHEMATICS
TOGETHER

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:02.756
AND REALIZED THAT THIS VIRGIN
WAS ALSO

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.125
AND, AS WELL AS,
THE GHOST.

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.860
[woman screams]

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:09.863
WOULD YOU DATE ME?

00:02:09.897 --> 00:02:12.266
'CAUSE I THINK I LOVE YOU.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.301
WHY DO YOU LOOK AWAY?
WHY DON'T YOU SMILE FOR ME?

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.403
IT TURNED OUT THIS GHOST
WAS NO DEMON.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:19.173
TSK, TSK, TSK.
SHE WAS AN ANGEL.

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:21.542
- [ghostly whisper]
BOBBY.

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.810 line:0%
