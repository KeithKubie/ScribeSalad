wouldn't have threatened the lives of
 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.590
wouldn't have threatened the lives of
the cartoonists but I think there would

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600
the cartoonists but I think there would
 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.300
the cartoonists but I think there would

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.780
about this travesty that was allowed to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790
be expressed even as freedom of speech
 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.400
be expressed even as freedom of speech
is something that's that's recognized

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410
is something that's that's recognized
 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.530
is something that's that's recognized
and you know allowed the Nazi March and

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540
and you know allowed the Nazi March and
 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.289

skokie illinois in the in the 1970s or

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299
skokie illinois in the in the 1970s or
 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.560
skokie illinois in the in the 1970s or
80s I mean civil libertarians here I

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570
80s I mean civil libertarians here I
 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.670

said that March had to be allowed to

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680
said that March had to be allowed to
 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.430
said that March had to be allowed to
take place but so I think I think one

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440
take place but so I think I think one
 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.590
take place but so I think I think one
can understand of insensitivity that was

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600
can understand of insensitivity that was
 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.479
can understand of insensitivity that was
involved in the publication of the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489
involved in the publication of the
 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.770
involved in the publication of the
cartoons in a context in which this was

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780
cartoons in a context in which this was
 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.220
cartoons in a context in which this was
a really volatile and explosive issue

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230
a really volatile and explosive issue
 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.910
a really volatile and explosive issue
but I think they should have been

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920
but I think they should have been
 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.580
but I think they should have been
allowed to be published I do think

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590
allowed to be published I do think
 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.990
allowed to be published I do think
though that as I say I don't think if

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000
though that as I say I don't think if
 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.550
though that as I say I don't think if

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560
they had been I don't think the editors
 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.900
they had been I don't think the editors
of the paper would have allowed the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910
of the paper would have allowed the
 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.650
of the paper would have allowed the
publication of similar cartoons in which

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660
publication of similar cartoons in which
 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.630
publication of similar cartoons in which
anti-semitism could be the accusation

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640
anti-semitism could be the accusation
 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.340
anti-semitism could be the accusation
rather than a tax on on Muslims

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350
 
 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.860
