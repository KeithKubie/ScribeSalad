00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So given that we've just seen how to code up HTML comments,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
let's test out that knowledge.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Suppose we have our definition of HTML comments

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
plus a rule for word tokens that are

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
anything that's not a space, a left angle, a right angle, one or more of the above.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We return that token, and now I give you the following HTML input fragment,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"ob fuscation tuse tangle."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
For this blue string, for our lexer, we've got word tokens.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We've got HTML comments.

00:00:37.000 --> 09:59:59.000
How many word tokens are we going to find?
