00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:01.435
[truck horn blares]

00:00:01.535 --> 00:00:04.538
- WELL, IT WAS A NIGHT
LIKE ANY OTHER,

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:06.373
EXCEPT I HAD JUST
TAKEN MUSHROOMS

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:07.841
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.810
AND I WAS TRIPPIN'
MY GODDAMN BALLS OFF.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.578
OHH...

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.347
- COME IN, WALLY.
WHAT'S YOUR 20, GOOD BUDDY?

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:15.315
- YEAH, I'M TRAVELING DOWN
HIGHWAY 60.

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:17.117
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK TOO SOON,
BUT I'M THINKING

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.519
I MADE IT OUT
OF GREMLIN TERRITORY.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:19.520
- [snarls]
- [screams]

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.587
NO!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.023
YOU SCARY LITTLE SON OF A BITCH.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.892
AND AS I SAT THERE,

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:27.728
GAZING INTO
MY BEADY LITTLE EYES,

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:30.731
WHAT I REALIZED WAS THAT
I WAS ABOUT TO DISCOVER

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.699
THE MEANING OF LIFE.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.205
MOONBEAMS.

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.874
LOOK AT THEM SILLY GUMDROPS.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.543
- ALOHA, WALLY.

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:44.211
- GIVE PAPA A LITTLE PEEK.

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.180
- MMM, OH, WALLY.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.651
- IT WAS SHAPING UP
TO BE QUITE THE NIGHT,

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:51.718
BUT THE NEXT THING I KNEW...

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.855
[police siren wailing]

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.857
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:58.325
OH, GOD DANGIT!

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:01.028
OH, OH, OH, OH!

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:02.863
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:04.331
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.600
WELL, MOVE YOUR WHEELCHAIR!

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.168
OH, MY GOD, A STROLLER.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:11.038
NO!

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:12.339
[screaming]

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.540
OH, SON OF A BITCH.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.342
- PERCENT OFF TODAY ON ALL--
OH, MY GOD!

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.911
[voice distorting]
OH, MY GOD!

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:19.179
[explosion booms]

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:20.781
[truck horn blares]

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:24.017
[emergency sirens wailing]

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:25.219
- AND THAT, MY FRIEND,

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.689
WAS THE LAST TIME
I EVER DID TRY MUSHROOMS.

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.257
I CAN'T SAY I REGRET IT THOUGH.

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:31.925
I MEAN, I BELIEVE
IT IS IMPORTANT

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.727
TO BROADEN YOUR HORIZONS.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.130
HOW ELSE WOULD I HAVE LEARNED
TO LIVE AMONGST THE GRIZZLIES?

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:39.466
WOULD YOU PASS THE POTATOES,
DARLIN'?

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.801
- [roars]

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:44.004
- OH, BUT THAT'S A STORY
FOR ANOTHER NIGHT.

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:44.638
AU REVOIR, [bleep].
