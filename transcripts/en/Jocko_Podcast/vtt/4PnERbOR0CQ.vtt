00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.490
How do you deal with ultimatums from customers,
bosses,
et Cetera,

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.360
that are unrealistic due to the nature of the situation and the ultimatum.

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.050
What I'm gonna do with ultimatums is I am going to tell the truth

4
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.950
about the situation to them.

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.970
But first I'm gonna tell the truth about the situation to myself.

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.090
Because you got to look at the situation and say to yourself,

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.180
is this truly on attainable,
like truly on attainable?

8
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.460
And sometimes even though it seems truly on attainable,

9
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:41.310
but then when you actually think about it,
you realize,
oh,
I could attain this.

10
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:42.180
I can make this happen.

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.900
I'm going to have to sacrifice whatever to make it happen.

12
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.470
I'm going to have to,

13
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.890
to co it's going to cost me or the team or the company something in order to

14
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:57.320
make an APP.
Like,
Oh,
you want that done or you want that,

15
00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:01.950
do you want that project done by,
you know,
the 15th cool,
we'll get it done.

16
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.350
Uh,
but here's what we're not gonna be able to do,

17
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.700
or here's what I'm not going to be able to do.

18
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.990
And I'm also gonna make sure that I pressure test the ultimatum against me

19
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:18.810
giving the absolute full measure of effort,

20
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.090
right?
Like,
wow,

21
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.120
if I go 110% not even honored person beyond,

22
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.400
you're going to give it everything you can.
Is that achievable?

23
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.790
Because a lot of times people will do,
it's an old community,
can't make it.
Well,

24
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.740
as a member of a team,
I want people's attitude to be like,
you know what?

25
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.600
We're gonna do it.
We're going to get it done.
No one else be able to do this,

26
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:45.610
but we're going to do it.
Watch this.
That's,

27
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.350
I like saying that sometimes watch,
watch.
I used to say,

28
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.300
watch me work.
Yeah.
Where I got it from some rally.

29
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.210
So then,
okay,
so now you truly,
you tell yourself the truth about the situation.

30
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.240
You figure out that there's truly under no circumstances that this is possible.

31
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.020
Then it's my time to tell them the truth,
which is like,
listen,

32
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.990
and I'll get my data together.
I'll get my information together.

33
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.340
I'll explain to them what,
you know what,

34
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.820
why I can't,
I'm not going to be able to physically get this done.

35
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.940
It's just physically not possible and then you know what the shortfalls are

36
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.580
going to be.
Now I once I explained that to them,
if they're,

37
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.110
if they're completely unwavering,

38
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.870
cause if you explain everything and you put your data together and you say,
look,

39
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.140
the bottom line is to do to to assemble this many pieces by our best to people

40
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:40.580
on the team.

41
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.270
It takes them an hour each and you want us to assemble 14 of them in three
hours.

42
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.220
It is not possible for us to do that.
Even if you gave me more people,

43
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:52.650
it doesn't matter.
They know how to do that so we can't be done.

44
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.090
I need at least whatever,
six hours with those,
but whatever,
whatever it is,

45
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.363
if they're

46
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.990
to waiver on the ultimatum at all,
like no go.

47
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.690
You need to get it done.
You need to get done.
Well they wanted me to do okay,

48
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:11.380
I'm going to try my hardest.
I'm going to buckle down.
I'm going to do my best.

49
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.240
I'm going to see how much,
how close I can get to achieving the goal.

50
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.530
I'm going to have fun.

51
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.520
I'm going to go so hard that it's going to get nuts,

52
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.550
like we're going to get it done and then when if we fall short,

53
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.730
which we will because I figured out there's no physical humanly possible way to

54
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:34.564
make this happen,

55
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.660
then what I'm gonna do is I will go to them and I'll explain the things that I

56
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:43.540
am going to do differently next time in order to meet their goals.
Right.

57
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.730
I'm going to say,
listen,
you know what I,

58
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.380
I should have asked you earlier if this was a possible thing and I should have

59
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:51.670
had a backup plan,

60
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:54.010
so here's what I'm putting into place now to make sure this doesn't happen
again.

61
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.660
Or Hey,
I am going to need more manpower so that if we run into this again,

62
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.590
I've got the people,

63
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.680
it's my fault for not staffing us up correctly or I need to pay more attention

64
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.070
to what's happening in the future so that I can have a better aware.

65
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.810
I have better awareness of when this type of situation will unfold so I can have

66
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:18.520
my team prepared for it or these complexities that happened.

67
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.430
I didn't explain to them.
I can explain them to you well enough.

68
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.490
And so if you understood,

69
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.400
if I do a better job of making you understand the difficulties of making this

70
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:31.570
happen,
hopefully you'll realize that there's more time as needed.

71
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.650
So I'm not going to go in there and throw up my arms and see.

72
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.230
I told you so you were stupid.
I was right.

73
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.840
Because then that's just sabotage to now.
They don't believe you anyways.
Yeah.

74
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.010
Now when you say we did,
we couldn't get it done.
See,
like I told you,

75
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.160
I told you we need more time and they're like,
yeah,
of course you,
you know,
you,

76
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:50.160
you,
you went into it thinking we're going to fail.
And guess what?

77
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.670
The self fulfilling prophecy.
Good job.
Good job.
You proved yourself to be right.

78
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:57.160
Loser,
demoted.

79
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.700
And that's what I do up and down the chain.
By the way,
you know,

80
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.560
ultimatums can come up and down the chain of command.
Hold the line.

81
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.100
Do your best.
That's what you do.
Yeah,
that seems,

82
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.930
and tell the truth of it all starts with telling the truth to yourself and then

83
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:20.020
to your people that you're charged customer,
you know,
client,

84
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.320
I want this foundation poured by such and such a date.

85
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.390
Hey Week we will do our best,
here's the short falls,
you know,

86
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:31.930
whatever.
Like that's the way it is.
Yeah.
And that's a big one.
They're like,

87
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.250
where can I learn this from you?

88
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.230
Where it's cause you can like to tell you like,
oh hey I can't,

89
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.570
this can be done.
Like you kind of,

90
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.310
you get to the point in your mind where you're like,
we both know it can be done.

91
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.840
But you know,
given my current risk and sleep schedule,

92
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.680
you know,
I got this chill,
I like to watch it cutting.
You know,

93
00:05:57.681 --> 00:05:58.970
it's like that kind of situation.

94
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:03.120
Why you five Oh zero don't want to miss that one.
So it,

95
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.900
it kind of shapes up to be like that.

96
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.840
You know where it's like for sure we both know and I don't know,

97
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.520
you know like if there's a boss who's like just grinding someone into the
ground.

98
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:16.340
Okay.
That's a whole different scenario.
But yeah,
at the end of the day,

99
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:17.870
like if you're truthful and he's like,

100
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:20.480
hey get this done or you're fired kind of thing.

101
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.690
And then you start with the truth that you say,
it'd be like,
can I get it done?

102
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:26.960
And then you really think,
let's say like you were gonna die or I don't know,

103
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:29.660
you could get it done a lot of the time.
I'm not saying,

104
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.250
I'm not saying all the time.
Of course,
of course.

105
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.420
The amount of times in my naval career,
let's call it when I was in the navy,

106
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.660
that guys said to me like,
we can't do it.

107
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.890
I can't even remember times cause guys were the guys just being like,

108
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.750
I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They wouldn't be like,
Whoa,
I don't know.

109
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:50.830
Jocko.
I'd be like,
hey look,
here's what we got to get done.
Yeah,

110
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.320
I think we can do it.
And they'd be like,
Yup,

111
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.540
good.
Cause we're about to go get some.
But yeah,
and you know,

112
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.220
obviously the situation,
some situations are more like more serious,
you know,

113
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:08.030
like you're not gonna.
I don't know for sure.
But yeah,

114
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:10.550
that telling the truth thing tell the truth.

115
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.100
I do speak from a position of luxury where I have the truth reflected up pretty

116
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:18.770
accurately on a pretty regular basis.

117
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:20.930
So I'm not saying it's that easy to tell the truth,

118
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:23.990
but if you just try hard trade genuine,
you've got to be genuine,
right?

119
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.040
Genuinely be like,
yes,
this is true about myself.

120
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.180
Do it.
Check.
