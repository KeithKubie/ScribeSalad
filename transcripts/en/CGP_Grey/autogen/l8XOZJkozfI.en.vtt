00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.060
 The Queen of the Lioness decided to make the elections in her kingdom fairer. 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.930
 At the moment he has his citizens divided into groups, each of which selects one representative, 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.809
 who will then sit in the council that constitutes laws for the kingdom of the jungle. 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.710
 But the citizens are dissatisfied and it is easy to see why: the council is full of monkeys. 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.759
 Of course, some citizens are monkeys, but not all. This advice 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.630
 it does not represent the kingdom fairly. 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.479
 Therefore, the Queen of the Lioness will visit one of the electoral groups to find out how to correct the problem. 

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:30.659
 There are five monkeys in the group, four tigers, three owls, two lynxes and one bison. 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.870
 One stands for each and the other citizens choose their own kind. 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.910
 The rule of choice is that the candidate with the most votes wins, which is a monkey. 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.960
 But this is a very unsatisfactory result, as 2/3 of citizens in this group * are not * 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.749
 monkeys and monkeys would not vote. 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:50.440
 Likewise, across all the other groups in the kingdom, monkeys have more votes 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.409
 than anyone else, so they win elections, even if they are a minority of the overall population. 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.379
 A closer survey will reveal that independent counselors hired to set boundaries between groups 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.679
 first and foremost, they weren't as independent as they seem at first sight. 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.630
 The result is dissatisfied citizens who do not trust the jungle council to make for everyone 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.320
 creating laws, quite rightly. 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.520
 The queen of lion's goal is to maximize the number of satisfied citizens after the election. 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.460
 One solution is to cancel electoral groups and use a proportional system ... However, her 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.840
 citizens * want * to have a local representative. 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.110
 So the queen needs a system that will satisfy the maximum of citizens by taking advice, while 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.430
 maintain local, regional elections. 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.340
 After a short survey, he finds a solution to the problem: one portable voice system. 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.430
 His big change is that the election groups send more than one representative, which is 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.590
 it may seem strange, but the queen decides to try it: she takes the three groups she used to do 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.329
 they chose one deputy, and join them into one larger one that chooses three. 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.850
 On election day, citizens cast votes and results in this new group are exactly the same 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.340
 as before: 34% for monkey, 33% for owl and 33% for lynx. 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.479
 But now he doesn't win the most votes: to get the winner, we'll take all the votes 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.390
 and divide them by the necessary number of representatives, in our case three, which gives 33% as 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.539
 the threshold needed for election. 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.790
 So * all three * candidates will go to the board - which exactly reflects the will of the voters 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:09.830
 in the group. 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.910
 While with the old system, each group would choose a monkey and leave 2/3 of the citizens 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.330
 without proper representation. The larger group with multiple representatives allows the group to be more 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.580
 Proportional. 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.830
 This test went well, but it was also the simplest maybe - the queen now wants to see 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.890
 how the election goes, in which not everyone wins. 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.840
 Another big group to try is five candidates: gorilla, tarsi, monkey, 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.280
 tiger and lynx, three of whom may be representatives. 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.580
 The election day took place and here are the results of the citizens' vote: 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.500
 gorilla has 5% gorilla has 28% 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.310
 monkey has 33% tiger has 21% 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.730
 feature has 13% 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.060
 The candidate needs 33% to vote, as last time. The monkey has so much and is therefore immediately 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.070
 elected one of three representatives. 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.830
 But no one else has achieved 33%, so how are the remaining two representatives selected? 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.230
 Step One: Get rid of the candidate with the least votes. Sorry tarsier - you really didn't have a chance. 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.970
 When citizens voted, they could just tick off their favorite candidate, but 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.360
 with a portable voice they also have the opportunity to rate candidates. This is important because 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.030
 we will learn how the elections would have ended if one of the candidates were missing. 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.720
 A small and frightened tarsier would give his voice a large calm gorilla if the tarsier was not among them 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.050
 candidates. So if their candidate doesn't win, they want to put their gorilla voices instead. 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.370
 This will move the gorilla to 33% and it will become the next elected representative. 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.220
 Valuation allows citizens to support their favorite candidates without worry - no sense 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.360
 speculate how others will vote. The system works to maximize 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.290
 satisfaction of voters with results. 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.590
 Back to the group: there is still one representative to choose, so the next one will be a feature. 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.170
 His voters don't like monkeys, but he thinks that tiger intentions are similar to their intentions, 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.870
 and therefore when a feature cannot win, they want to give the tiger a vote. The tiger gets 33% and becomes 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.260
 third and last elected representative. 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.010
 Election results look fairly good, especially if they take into account the first * and * second choice of citizens. 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.570
 More citizens now have a local representative that they can easily contact while the old system 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.480
 everyone would have a monkey. 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.510
 The Queen still wants to know what happens in a group with only two political parties. 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.079
 More candidates of the same party would be a disaster with a "majority vote wins" system: 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.900
 they would divide their voters and give the victory to the candidate. 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.240
 The queen will try out the last group with 2/3 tigers and 1/3 gorillas and as before 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.009
 needs three representatives. 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:33.469
 Because with a portable voice, citizens evaluate their candidates, there may be more candidates 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.360
 same sides without problems. 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.139
 Tigers have two candidates as well as gorillas. 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:47.139
 The white tiger is elected first representative, but what next? Though the tiger seems to have now 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.229
 least votes, it is also clear that he would have a lot more votes if he was not in the elections 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.219
 A white tiger. If a candidate has more votes than he needs, like a white tiger, 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:09.310
 first, the excess voices are passed to his second alternative. This gives the tiger 33% 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.689
 and becomes another elected representative. 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:14.860
 If it seems strange, there are two things to consider: 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.610
 1) If the excess voices were ignored and the tiger removed, the gorillas would then 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.090
 they had two remaining seats, which would obviously not represent the group. 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.740
 2) Ignoring these excess voices means punishing citizens who have insured 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.860
 a popular candidate, which makes them think how others choose, rather than what they want. 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.060
 If the candidate gets extra votes, then first of all means his voters 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.669
 they make up a large proportion of the citizens and should thus gain more 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.499
 representatives. 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.909
 As soon as the tiger's voices are handed over, the election will be completed last time: the gorilla 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.969
 it was the last one to be eliminated and the other alternative to its voters is the younger candidate, so 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.779
 the gorilla gets a place. And the results are fair. 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:00.499
 The Queen of the Lioness saw that the portable voice was working. Let the groups have one or more 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.199
 parties, the process is the same: 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.629
 1. Citizens rate their candidates. 2. Candidates above the threshold will win immediately. 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:09.499
 3. Extra voices shall be transmitted to the second alternative. 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:13.680
 4. If there is no winner, the last candidate is eliminated, and his votes go second. 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.599
 5. Repeat until we have all the winners. 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.659
 This whole process is designed to maximize the number of voters satisfied 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:21.169
 with results. 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.870
 This process gives the portable voice many advantages over the old "most votes win": 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.629
 1. Citizens can sincerely vote for their favorite candidates without speculation about others' choices. 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.659
 2. It is more proportional. So monkey games 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:37.379
 with borders. 3. Almost all citizens will have a local representative 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:39.189
 whom they actually voted. 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:42.969
 The Queen of the Lioness finally decided to switch to a system of one portable voice, 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:45.649
 to provide better jungle advice for everyone.
