named Rachel Kline.

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:04.470 align:start position:0%
She's here and dying.

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:06.806 align:end position:100%
- Okay, that's not how we
talk out loud in a hospital.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.075 align:end position:100%
Are you family
or celebrity?

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.744 align:start position:0%
- Oh, um, celebrity?

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:14.580
- Okay, we're actually already
checking on that name for P!nk,

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:17.483
so you can go ahead and have
a seat next to her assistant.

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:19.052 align:start position:0%
- Which one is her--

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:24.190 align:start position:0%
I found her.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.297 align:start position:0%

exactly like P!nk.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.499 align:end position:100%
- It's like dogs
and their owners.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:35.501 align:end position:100%
This was me
when I first started.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.304 align:start size:53% position:47%

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:39.739 align:end position:100%
You don't look
like anyone famous.

some advice.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:47.447 align:end position:100%
Never let your boss
get into aerial gymnastics.

I'm not gonna be
an assistant for long.

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.584 align:start position:0%

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.093 align:end position:100%

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:02.261 align:start size:47% position:53%
but she's rich.

pretend to be in a hospital?

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:15.735 align:start position:0%
- They don't think anyone
will actually show.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.336 align:start position:0%

keeps happening,

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:31.918 align:end position:100%
why do you
keep showing up?

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.853
- Because one time out of ten
it really is a dying girl,

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:36.255 align:start position:0%
and if you don't show up,
it's bad optics.
