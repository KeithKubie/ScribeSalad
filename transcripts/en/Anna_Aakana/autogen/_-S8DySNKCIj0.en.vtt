00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
I'm not a morning person.  But I want to be.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.380
You know, there was a period in my life

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.220
when I was waking up at 5:00am everyday

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.040
and I loved it!

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.260
I would wake up, meditate, write, read, exercise, do my chores,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.800
make breakfast, all before noon!

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.760
It was awesome.  I was a productivity machine.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.040
Unfortunately, it only lasted about 6 months.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.400
Until life got a little crazy and I reverted back to my old habits.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.860
I would sleep in late, and of course I would hit the Snooze button.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.280
And hit the Snooze button.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.200
Snooze button.  Snooze.  Snooze.  Snooze.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.620
I desperately want to get back to waking up early.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.280
So I have been devouring articles for any kind of advice

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.500
on how to get out of bed.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.680
And I feel like I've tried everything.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.680
You know, I take melatonin and I lay in bed eary.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.360
I put my phone in high places where I can't reach it.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.360
I've even tried using one of those alarm clocks

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.200
where you have to shoot it with a toy gun to turn it off.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.540
But every day it's the same story:

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.400
I wake up.  I hit Snooze.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.780
And then I go back to bed to cuddle with a cat.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.340
That is until I found this blog by a guy named Steve.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.680
This is what you do:

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.480
When you're getting ready to go to bed, set your morning alarm.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.920
But also set a bunch of little alarms

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.500
that will occur over the next 15 to 20 minutes

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.520
all about 2-3 minutes apart.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.060
But try to do it in a way so that you don't remember exactly

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.440
how many alarms you're setting.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.940
Then put your phone out of reach, and go to bed.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.620
Now, when your alarms start to go off,

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.380
act like it's the morning.  Do whatever you do in the morning.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740
For me, that's getting up, turning off my alarms

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.420
stretching, and heading to the bathroom to brush my teeth.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.460
But, you'll go back to bed.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.760
You'll try to fall asleep.  And when the next alarm

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.740
goes off, you do the same thing.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.000
Repeat, repeat, repeat.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.260
Eventually, this gets so annoying that every time you lay

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.680
back down in bed, your body gets sleepier.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.760
And I personally love that because

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.160
I have a hard time getting to sleep.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.420
It takes me like 30 minutes to 2 hours

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.080
of just laying there to even feel sleepy.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.980
Somehow this practice kind of like tricks

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.920
my body into being so annoyed with the mini alarms

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.120
that eventually I will just end up falling asleep

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.380
once they're all done until the real alarm kicks in, in the morning.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.100
And before you can even think about it, your body

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.280
will get up and do whatever it is that you practiced the night before.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.480
So, if you want to be an early riser,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.080
this technique will be mildly annoying but insanely effective.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.200
You're welcome.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.500
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.860
Oh, and a few announcements.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.500
I have these live shows coming up, I do stand up

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.860
improv, and then a little meet and greet afterwards

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.380
as a thank you for coming and then we can take fun photos

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.160
and I'm usually really sweaty, so just be warned

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.280
if you're hugging me and I'm sweaty, I'm sorry.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.900
I also have these short films

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.700
"Loose Ends" and "Super &amp; Associates."

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.880
I'm super proud and I'm super excited and I hope you like them!

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.320
Also, the podcast, Explain Things To Me,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.500
the one where Brad and I interview professionals in various fields

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.380
is going to be on iTunes only now

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.160
so you can go to itunes.com/ExplainThingsToMe

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.900
and listen to all the cool people that we are interviewing there.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.820
Finally, people have asked me for Q&amp;A videos

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.900
and unfortunately I don't really want to do a Q&amp;A video for my channel

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.440
but I will be doing weekly broadcasts on YouNow so here are the dates and times.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.440
If you can make any of those, and you have a question

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.760
I'm happy to answer anything about short filmmaking

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.400
or my cats or where I get my cat furniture

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.960
or whatever questions you may have.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.960
That's all for the announcements.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.500
Get the fuck out of my house.
