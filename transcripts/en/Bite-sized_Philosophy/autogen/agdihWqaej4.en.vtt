00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.830
 
so this is more differentiation of the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840
so this is more differentiation of the
 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.749
so this is more differentiation of the
archetype fundamentally so you see the

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759
archetype fundamentally so you see the
 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.610
archetype fundamentally so you see the
dragon of chaos here the potential

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620
dragon of chaos here the potential
 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.980
dragon of chaos here the potential
manifesting itself into this ambivalent

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990
manifesting itself into this ambivalent
 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.290
manifesting itself into this ambivalent
feminine figure both both promise and

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300
feminine figure both both promise and
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.379
feminine figure both both promise and
threat and then I've mapped this one out

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
threat and then I've mapped this one out
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.510
threat and then I've mapped this one out
so the ambivalent feminine figure so

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520
so the ambivalent feminine figure so
 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.400
so the ambivalent feminine figure so
sort of multivalent gives rise to the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
sort of multivalent gives rise to the
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.230
sort of multivalent gives rise to the
positive mother and then the positive

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
positive mother and then the positive
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.609
positive mother and then the positive
mother gives birth to the hero and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
mother gives birth to the hero and
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.009
mother gives birth to the hero and
that's Hercules there and this I like

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
that's Hercules there and this I like
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.439
that's Hercules there and this I like
this image a lot so Hercules is in this

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
this image a lot so Hercules is in this
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.390
this image a lot so Hercules is in this
container so that's that you can

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
container so that's that you can
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.830
container so that's that you can
interpret that both has something

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
interpret that both has something
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.479
interpret that both has something
feminine in the container but also as a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
feminine in the container but also as a
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280
feminine in the container but also as a
representative of culture because it's a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
representative of culture because it's a
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.690
representative of culture because it's a
boat that's floating on the chaotic

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
boat that's floating on the chaotic
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.940
boat that's floating on the chaotic
ocean here so that's Hercules he has to

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
ocean here so that's Hercules he has to
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.549
ocean here so that's Hercules he has to
be in a container that sustains him in

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
be in a container that sustains him in
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.280
be in a container that sustains him in
the murky water of chaos and you see

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
the murky water of chaos and you see
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.650
the murky water of chaos and you see
he's going out into the unknown and he's

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
he's going out into the unknown and he's
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.290
he's going out into the unknown and he's
got a lion skin on and that's partly

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
got a lion skin on and that's partly
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.830
got a lion skin on and that's partly
because one of the initiation rituals

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
because one of the initiation rituals
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.110
because one of the initiation rituals
for her young men when the reliance say

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
for her young men when the reliance say
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.520
for her young men when the reliance say
in the Middle East and that wasn't very

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
in the Middle East and that wasn't very
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.750
in the Middle East and that wasn't very
long ago is that you had to go out to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
long ago is that you had to go out to
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.610
long ago is that you had to go out to
kill a lion with a spear or with a bow

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
kill a lion with a spear or with a bow
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.869
kill a lion with a spear or with a bow
and arrow or something like that it's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
and arrow or something like that it's
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.860
and arrow or something like that it's
like that's you know impressive all

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
like that's you know impressive all
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.210
like that's you know impressive all
things considered I mean you really

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
things considered I mean you really
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.039
things considered I mean you really
think about that for a minute you really

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
think about that for a minute you really
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.510
think about that for a minute you really
want to go out try to kill a lion with a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520
want to go out try to kill a lion with a
 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.510
want to go out try to kill a lion with a
stick it's like it probably you probably

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
stick it's like it probably you probably
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.160
stick it's like it probably you probably
wouldn't be quite the same after you did

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
wouldn't be quite the same after you did
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.510
wouldn't be quite the same after you did
that that would be my guess

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
that that would be my guess
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.609
that that would be my guess
and so anyway so there's Hercules has

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619
and so anyway so there's Hercules has
 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.260
and so anyway so there's Hercules has
got his lion skiing on and that shows

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
got his lion skiing on and that shows
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.330
got his lion skiing on and that shows
that he's assimilated to the lion the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
that he's assimilated to the lion the
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.950
that he's assimilated to the lion the
dominant sort of animal and that he's

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
dominant sort of animal and that he's
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.600
dominant sort of animal and that he's
also mastered it and he's got his bow

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610
also mastered it and he's got his bow
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.730
also mastered it and he's got his bow
and arrow so he's he's going to hit the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
and arrow so he's he's going to hit the
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.770
and arrow so he's he's going to hit the
target properly he's not he's someone

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
target properly he's not he's someone
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.270
target properly he's not he's someone
who doesn't sin because he can hit the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280
who doesn't sin because he can hit the
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.310
who doesn't sin because he can hit the
center of the target and he's got this

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
center of the target and he's got this
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.719
center of the target and he's got this
Club which I really like because it's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
Club which I really like because it's
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.660
Club which I really like because it's

play this game of protection and
 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.289
play this game of protection and
encouragement right protection and
