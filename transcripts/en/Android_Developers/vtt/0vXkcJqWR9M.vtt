00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.530
Hello, my name is Reto Meier.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.630
RETO MEIER: We'll be looking
at home screen widgets, and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.790
interviewing--

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.420
Hello, my name is Reto Meier.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.530
RETO MEIER: We'll be looking
at home screen widgets, and

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.190
interviewing Kevin Barry, of
TeslaCoil Software, to learn

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.450
some tips and tricks for
improving in the efficiency of

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.430
your widgets.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.025
All in the next 30 minutes on
this week's App Clinic.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.430
Home screen widgets are an
interesting category, as they

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.920
can be either released by
themselves, or value adds to

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.900
existing apps.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: And by providing
a window into your app

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.150
directly on the home screen,
widgets can be a powerful tool

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.160
for increasing user engagement,
and encouraging

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.520
people to get back
to your app.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.090
RETO MEIER: Now to get started,
you really need to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.330
think about how you're going
to present your widget.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.140
So perhaps more than any other
app type, widgets really need

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.920
a lot of attention to detail
on the design side, even

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.310
before you start developing.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right,
because they're always there,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.910
and they're very, very small.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.550
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.370
IAN NI-LEWIS: So start by
checking out the widget design

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.300
patterns on the design tab
at developer.android.com.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.290
RETO MEIER: And then, it's time
to head over to the app

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.730
widgets API guide, where you
can learn all the practical

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.650
details of exactly how you put
your design in action.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.830
So we're not going to the
specific details of how to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.580
build an app, as all that
information is already

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.800
available online.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.180
But what we do want to do is
have a look at some tips for

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.252
making your widgets a little
bit more awesome.

00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:35.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.710
Users love widgets as a way to
keep information front and

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.270
center, and as a way to
customize your home screen so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.480
that it's designed
uniquely for you.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.390
RETO MEIER: Now with limited
space available on the home

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.270
screen, it's important
to do a good job

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.730
to keep your widgets--

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.650
and help them stay
front and center.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right, you don't
want people getting annoyed

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.310
with your widgets and
uninstalling them.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.770
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.050
So it comes down to doing
things like this-- not

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.900
draining the battery, making
sure that they have timely,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.660
up-to-date information, that
they have a UI that's

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.770
consistent with the platform but
is still representative of

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.170
what you're trying to do.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.485
And then they should be as
interactive as they can be.

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:10.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.570
It's really annoying to have a
widget that's just sitting

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.180
there, being a larger version
of a shortcut.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.440
You want to be able to not only
put information on the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.950
screen, but also make
it accessible.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.030
So for instance, the calendar
widget does a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.880
great job of that.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.420
RETO MEIER: And so over the
years, the power of widgets

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.190
has increased as the platform
has developed to give greater

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.280
support for how they can be
integrated within it.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.260
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now this started
with support for collection

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.410
widgets, including lists
and galleries.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.765
Then we had the ability to
re-size widgets, which I'm

00:02:39.765 --> 00:02:42.350
telling you, that's a god-send
for my calendar.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.950
RETO MEIER: More recently, we
also provided support to embed

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.040
widgets directly into the lock
screen, and this has opened up

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.280
a whole new world of
possibilities.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.310
This is extremely powerful.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.730
It allows users to perform
actions or view data without

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.620
even having to unlock
their phone.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.610
RETO MEIER: And as is typically
the case, along with

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.780
this great power comes
similarly great

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.580
responsibility.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.990
So it's really important to take
a few precautions when

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.780
allowing your widget to be
lock screen-enabled.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: The first thing
you want to think about is

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.115
being careful about exposing
information.

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:19.310
The thing is, your lock screen
is what you see when the

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.540
phone's not locked-- or when
a phone is locked.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.570
So anyone can pick up the
phone and see that

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.350
information.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.360
If you're exposing things on
that lock screen that have to

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.940
do with your meetings you're
having at work that have

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.660
confidential topics, people
that are phoning you,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.130
whatever-- you have to
remember all of that

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.260
information is going
out into the world.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.880
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.130
In many cases, that's a decision
for the users to

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.110
make, particularly
with something

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.530
like calendar or email.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.180
It's up to you how sensitive
you think that is.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.270
But you need to make sure as a
development that it's really

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.200
obvious to your users what data
or actions that they're

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.610
effectively removing that lock
screen protection from.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: And for
most user data,

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.170
that's fairly obvious.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.360
But especially for actions--
it's important to protect any

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.410
actions that might cost the user
money or risk exposing

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.880
private information.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.750
You want to make sure that's in
an activity that's launched

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.610
from the widget, not
directly available

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.150
on the widget itself.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.550
And even though it should be
obvious to the user what

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.840
they're exposing when they add
a calendar or text message or

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.520
recent calls widget to their
home screen, you might want to

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.080
give them a little
reminder anyway.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.880
Because a lot of times, you
think, oh yeah, I'm going to

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.690
put my calendar there.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.120
And you don't dig deep and
think, wow, sometimes my

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.520
calendar has some pretty
sketchy stuff on it.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.160
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.160
So today we're going to look at
three home screen widgets,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.980
starting with the Minimalist
Shortcut

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.800
and Terra Clock widgets.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.910
IAN NI-LEWIS: And then we'll
break out the scalpels for a

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.840
particularly penetrating look
at DashClock, from our very

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.500
own Roman Nurik, who turns out
isn't a very good designer at

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.370
all, and his app is garbage.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.060
I'm just kidding.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.800
Let's take a look at Minimalist
Shortcut.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.130
RETO MEIER: OK, so I love that
this widget maintains its

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.420
philosophy within its
logo and banner.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.810
So it's all about minimalism,
and they've taken that

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.860
approach here.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.230
I'd probably go a step further,
though, and consider

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.370
removing the "Declutter Your
Home Screen" text, and really

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.270
tighten up that banner
a little bit more.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.370
I don't think it really adds
a lot of information, and

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.530
actually just makes it a little
bit less minimalist.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Ah, you know,
I actually have

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.400
the opposite feel.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.940
I think it's kind of
cool, actually.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.200
RETO MEIER: OK, well,
there you go.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.470
Now this is a screen
shot provided in

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.710
the Google Play listing.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.230
And it's worth noting that it's
not immediately obvious

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.380
where the widget actually is.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.640
But that's as much a feature
as it is a bug in this

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.570
particular instance.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.820
The point of this app is to
try and have these very

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.350
minimalistic widgets.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.140
Now one of the confusing things
is that each of the

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.540
screenshots has a different
wallpaper, and a slightly

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.270
different layout.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.710
So it's difficult to tell what's
a widget, and what's a

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.160
background, and when things
are changing and how.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.360
So in any case, you can see what
they're trying to achieve

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.950
here with each of those
tiny little androids--

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.270
a really light gray on the dark
gray background along the

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.800
edge of the screen.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.630
Now I wanted to stop by calling
out a common challenge

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.790
for widget developers.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.140
And if you're building an app
that happens to have a widget,

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.350
then there's a variety of things
you can do to help

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.130
encourage your users to
check out the widget.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.980
And even if they never
find it, they can

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.330
still use the app.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.480
But what if, as in this case,
it's just a widget?

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.640
Well, a lot of developers will
still choose to include a

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.610
launcher activity to
help users find and

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.940
activate that widget.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.000
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.490
That's perfectly appropriate.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.270
It stops people from hitting
install, and then going, oh, I

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.780
installed your app and
I can't find it.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.590
But as this is going to be the
user's first interaction with

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.440
your app, it's really important
to make sure that

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.090
the aesthetic of your app
is maintained in this

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.710
introductory activity.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.220
So in the case of Minimalist
widget, that means paying a

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.350
little more attention to the
padding, and maybe even

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.050
considering switching to
something like a light style

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.070
with a white background.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.600
Something which matches the
banner, the logo, this idea of

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.910
minimalism.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.290
It's also worth noting that the
specific instructions like

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.850
the ones given here, they're
going to change depending on

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:04.750
the OS version.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.580
And in fact, on my Jelly Bean
device, this doesn't work.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.530
Long-pressing on the home screen
doesn't bring up the

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.550
widget chooser.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.720
So it's something you want to
think about when providing

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.990
specific instructions that you
may want to check to see what

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.680
version of the OS it is.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.310
And even still, a lot of users
are going to have their own

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.390
custom launches, their own
custom home screens, which are

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.080
going to be different again.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.630
So you really want to consider
perhaps providing links to

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.800
external resources, rather than
telling people exactly

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.230
what they should do.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: And it's worth
mentioning that, when you talk

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.010
about the padding, this is one
thing that makes your app look

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.330
really unprofessionalism, is
when you've just got a big

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.990
block of text, and it goes
all the way across.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.400
Because, obviously, you didn't
really do any layout.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.630
But as I learned while we were
trying to do some sample apps

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.860
last week, it's actually really,
really difficult to

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.090
make that look attractive.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.080
So we're going to put out a
sample app fairly soon here

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:57.190
about making good, readable text
layouts that work from

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.010
Froyo on up.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.630
You can do it with spaces
on Jelly Bean.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.350
But--

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.250
Jelly Bean, I think actually,
ICS had it.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.380
RETO MEIER: I think
ICS, as well.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: But pre-ICS,
you didn't have it.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.660
RETO MEIER: So the purpose of
Minimalist Shortcut, as I've

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.050
kind of implied already, is to
let you have shortcuts to your

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.110
favorite apps while keeping
your screen

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.130
as simple as possible.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.020
It's basically a way of having
shortcuts without covering up

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.880
your awesome wallpaper.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.750
And now, they're currently in
beta, so if this sounds like

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.590
something you're into, now
would be a great time to

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.120
download the app, provide them
some feedback, help them build

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.290
something even more awesome.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.140
Now speaking of which, here's
a little bit of candid

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.539
feedback for you guys to help
you create an even better app.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.000
This is the config activity
that's displayed when you add

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.700
a new widget.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.179
It's got everything you need.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:43.320
But the presentation
can be a little

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.150
challenging, shall we say?

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.170
Now this is something
that comes up a

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.320
lot on The App Clinic.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.110
And I know a lot of developers
to find this to be kind of

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.890
really nitpicky advice.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.300
So I'm going to explain just
really quickly why this is so

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.820
important, why we keep harping
on about this.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.940
Most users are going to judge
both the utility and quality

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.360
of the app within the first few
seconds of opening it up.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.895
Now fairly or not, most of that
judgment is instinctual.

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:08.210
And it's based on the UI
aesthetics, and the usability

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.690
of that app.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.260
So that first impression
here is of something

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.180
really quite complex.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.080
There's this list of options
that's totally comprehensive,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.580
but that also means
it's really long.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.200
So I'm scrolling for a long time
before I see everything

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:21.680
that's there.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.910
Now as a first time user, I'm
not sure which of these

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.790
settings is required, which are
optional, and, in fact,

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.190
the most important setting-- the
one which lets me choose

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.720
the shortcuts and the icons
that I want to use--

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.180
isn't obvious to find.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.080
And in fact, it's not even
here on the front page.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.280
Now getting this right
is a challenge.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.610
And in fact, it's probably the
area for a lot of widgets

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.510
where you're going to need to
spend the most time in terms

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.210
of your design is figuring out
how do you present this

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.630
one-off config settings to
people in a way that they can

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.620
find intuitive, and
not challenging.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.110
You want to have the things you
need there without hiding

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.362
too much of the functionality.

00:09:58.362 --> 00:10:00.830
But you don't want to display
everything and intimidate them

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.510
till they go away.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.700
So in lot of cases, this is
where good defaults and easy

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.320
editing comes in really handy.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.030
You just need to make it really
easy for me to create

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.420
that first widget, and
then with some

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.360
really sensible defaults.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.850
So in this example, you may
choose some of the most common

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.020
pre-packaged apps, build
shortcuts to them directly

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.320
with what you think are
the most common icons.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.690
And then make it really easy for
users to click something

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.530
within your widget set, too,
to edit that and modify it.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.190
All right.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.350
So that's all I want to
talk about in terms

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.510
of Minimalist Shortcuts.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.100
Pretty good app.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.340
I think it's basically some
nitpicky UI changes, which

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.430
could make it even
more powerful.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.430
So let's take a look at
TerraTime, by top developer

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.240
Sterling Udell Now
I love the icon.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.920
A little less excited
about the banner,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.780
which is a little crowded.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.140
Wouldn't you agree?

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, this is one
of those banners where it

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.540
feels like there's a lot of
effort put into a certain set

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.440
of elements on the banner.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.420
And then the rest of it was like
handed off to an intern

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.270
or something.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.310
TerraTime there is in
a really flat font.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.910
It's not probably the
best font for this.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.090
It would be very difficult to
read on a small device.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.710
But the background
bitmap I love.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:16.550
It's really cool.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.940
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.550
And it gives you a really good
indication of the app.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.520
Now I should point out, having
looked at TerraTime--

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.720
and this is not a new app.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.520
You can see that Sterling is
in fact one of our top

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.000
developers.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.630
So this is a really popular app
that a lot of people love.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.970
And once we get to see some of
the screenshots, you'll see

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.000
just how beautiful it is.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.320
And so making sure that that
first impression is consistent

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.660
with the awesome graphics of the
app itself, I think, is a

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.050
really simple but important
first step you can take.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:48.890
Interesting.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.600
Now, unlike Minimalist
Shortcuts, TerraTime is an app

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.100
as well as a widget.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.650
So it has the advantage of being
able to show this when

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.670
you launch the app.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.620
Now this is a pretty
stunning UI.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.260
You've got the earth semi-lit,
based on the current time.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.520
You've even got the lights in
the night sky showing in the

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.960
area that is currently at night,
which is incredible.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.560
But we're not looking
at apps today.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.690
So let's take a look at the
widgets that you can install.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.400
So there are in fact two
of them, and this is

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.370
what they look like.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.780
And they're both visually
stunning.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.030
They're really good examples
of the power of a widget to

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.310
really customize your home
screen, and make it something

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.370
that you really like
to look at.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.390
And I think it's fair to say
that both of these options are

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.060
significant improvements over
the default analog clock

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.490
widget, I think.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:35.820
Yeah.

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.690
So Sterling's biggest challenge
here is really

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:38.930
around efficiency.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.160
He's got this rich dynamic
content that needs to be

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.630
regularly updated.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.260
And when you're building
widgets, it's vital that you

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.690
minimize the required update
frequency of them.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.050
And also, minimize the amount of
data that you're regularly

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.830
sending to your widget.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.100
So you'll note, for example,
that there's no second hand on

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:53.830
the display.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:57.460
So at most, he's only going to
need to update that widget

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:57.980
every minute.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.080
And hopefully, he's found
ways to do it even less

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.100
frequently than that.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.480
It's also great to see that both
widgets are resizable.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.450
And they're available as lock
screen widgets, as well.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.470
And in fact, after playing with
this today, I've set the

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.200
globe widget as my new default
home screen icon--

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.010
lock screen icon--

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.380
because it just looks
so stunning.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.800
And they've done a really great
job in that it scales

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.990
really well between when it's
sort of full lock screen,

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.010
between when the keyboard is
available and the globe is

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:27.540
compressed.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.070
So, really thrilled,
really impressive.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.410
And we're going to learn some of
the tricks that you can use

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:36.150
to have something like this,
this rich UI, without draining

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.380
the battery, or risking crashing
the launcher when we

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.990
talked to Kevin later today.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.940
So what else?

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.542
Finally, let's take a look at
DashClock, a new release from

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:47.540
our very own Roman Nurik.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.120
I think you looked at
this in more detail.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:49.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes, yes.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.840
And let's just get it out of the
way right now-- this is a

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.380
masterpiece of beautiful,
clean, intuitive design.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:57.760
It sets the standard by which
all apps should be measured.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.670
And it's the last lock screen
widget you will ever need.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.410
So, let's rip it apart
a little bit.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:12.600
So first off, the lock screen--
or, I'm sorry, the

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.590
feature graphic, I
think, could be a

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.400
little bit better done.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.170
The title has more space
that it could take up.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.830
I don't think you should be
afraid of letting your title

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.610
overlap other elements
in your scene.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.866
It needs to be really,
really big.

00:14:30.866 --> 00:14:31.560
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: And especially
with its extremely minimalist

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.470
feature graphic, it could really
use a little bit more.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:42.530
In fact, I would take out the
device with the 3D look, and

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:47.590
maybe just zoom in on the widget
itself to help people

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.900
understand what it is.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.370
RETO MEIER: But really, you're
just bitter because there's

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.620
all those gradients
in the background.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: I know.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:55.670
He never lets me do gradients.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.720
RETO MEIER: I think he has
the gradient license.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, it makes
me feel a little bit better

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.390
that he still feels forced to
use that horrid blue that he

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.640
makes us use.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.400
OK, so this is a
wonderful app.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.570
This is what you see when
the app is launched.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.200
There's a very obvious
set of extensions.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.250
It's really, really easy to
understand how you're going to

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.850
add an extension, because he
went ahead and put an add

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.960
extension button as the last
thing in this list.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.170
It's really easy to manage
the extensions.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.470
In fact, the only complaint
I had was that--

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.530
probably because I'm old--

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.780
I wasn't able to rearrange the
extensions very easily.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.250
Once you get a lot of
extensions in here--

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.790
Roman did put in a great
drag-and-dropper re-arranger.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.230
It's very, very fast.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.280
It's very, very fluid.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.520
But only works if you grab the
absolute left-hand side there

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.510
where that little bitmap
handle is.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.770
The one that says grab
me obviously.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.960
But the reason I feel like this
is worth talking about is

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.750
that you can swipe the
notification--

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.560
or, swipe the extension to
dismiss it, just like a

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.130
notification.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.580
And you can swipe it
from anywhere.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.200
So the horizontal swiping
works when your finger's

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.740
anywhere on the extension.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.720
And vertical swiping only
works in one place.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.840
Now, that kind of confused me.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.450
I thought that was
unnecessary.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.660
You'll notice that some
extensions, but not all, have

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.040
extra screens available.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.280
And notice that Roman's put
really nice looking chevrons--

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.070
I'm just kidding.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.900
He put his Settings icon on the
one's that have settings,

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.170
so it's really obvious how to
get to the second page if

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:41.760
there is one.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.760
And it's also really obvious
which extensions don't have a

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.120
second page.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.700
So bravo there.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.310
The second page is also an
interesting study in how to do

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.330
an action bar right.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.510
So he's gone to a page of
settings for an extension

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.090
which may or may not have been
written by the author of the

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.550
app, because DashClock actually
accepts third-party

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.220
extensions.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.490
Really kind of cool.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:13.390
So he's changed the action bar
from blue to black, and then

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.990
of course but a nice little icon
in the corner there to

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.069
let you know how you can
get back to your

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.180
main settings page.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:27.390
When you actually use this
widget, it can display in two

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:28.444
different modes.

00:17:28.444 --> 00:17:31.360
There's sort of compact mode
here, where you see just the

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:38.140
clock, and a minimal version
of some of the widgets or

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.880
extensions that you've chosen.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.330
Or, the full mode, where
you can see all of the

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.440
information.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.210
The only thing that I thought
was difficult to use about

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:54.910
this app actually was that,
while I can customize a great

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.960
deal about the appearance, I
couldn't customize it with a

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.700
preview that was on top
of my wallpaper.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.450
So as you can see, it was
difficult for me to get a set

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:13.050
of appearance settings that
actually worked with the kind

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.880
of busy wallpaper that
I have on my phone.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.160
So I was a little disappointed
in that.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.560
I was also a little disappointed
in some of the

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.200
extensions.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.740
I actually don't know which ones
Roman wrote, and which

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.960
ones other people wrote.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.360
But as you can see in this
shot, there's a couple of

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:28.990
extensions.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:34.020
For instance, the upcoming
alarms, or the mail extension,

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.250
that are perfect.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.810
Just a little icon with all of
the information you need.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.570
But then there's a couple of
other extensions that get cut

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.100
off, and get ellipsified.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.680
And that seems to me to be
a really big problem.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:52.430
I don't know if that area is
just too small, or if it needs

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.860
some more design thought.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.290
Or maybe Roman just needs to do
something about third-party

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:57.940
extensions.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.500
But as soon as you see ellipses
in that area, you get

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.750
really confused.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:10.020
The only other thing that I was
a little bugged about was

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.290
the appearance dialogue, which
I don't have a screenshot of.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.950
And the reason I don't is
because I've got a lot of

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.810
nitpicks, but they're
all design nits.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.500
And they don't really
have anything to do

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.510
with The App Clinic.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.980
So Roman and I are going
to have a little

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.120
meet-up in New York.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.450
And I'm going to show him
exactly what's going on.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.415
Then, if I'm lucky, I'll
be back to show.

00:19:30.415 --> 00:19:32.260
RETO MEIER: No guarantees.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:32.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.300
So let's go ahead and move on.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.180
RETO MEIER: So some of the
most important aspects of

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.100
building good widgets
are pretty much

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.550
invisible to the user.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.190
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, but they're
not invisible to the

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.440
app that's hosting
your widgets.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.670
So luckily, we have the
developer of several app

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.930
widget hosting apps, Kevin
Barry, of TeslaCoil.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:54.260
And he is the developer of the
app launcher Nova Launcher.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.010
RETO MEIER: Yeah, we interviewed
him yesterday to

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.770
find out what he's learned
about good widget design.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.780
So to find out a little bit more
about how you can build

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.160
really great quality widgets,
we've got Kevin Barry, from

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.690
TeslaCoil Software, developer of
a very popular home screen

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.830
replacement, Nova Launcher.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.300
Now, he's been developing Nova
Launcher, which is a

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.910
replacement for the home screen,
which means he can see

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.500
first-hand what happens when
you build a widget which

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.160
doesn't really work very well.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.070
So let's throw it over
to Kevin to find out

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.600
a little bit more.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.820
So can you start off by telling
us a little bit about

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.630
yourself, and TeslaCoil
Software.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:33.080
KEVIN BARRY: Sure.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.470
So as Reto said, I'm Kevin.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.295
I do Nova Launcher and
WidgetLocker, which both can

00:20:39.295 --> 00:20:40.870
host widgets.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.500
TeslaCoil Software is just me,
so it's a small operation.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.460
Nova Launcher is built off the
open source Android launcer so

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.940
that gives me a good
place to work with.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:51.810
RETO MEIER: Excellent,
excellent.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.510
And so it's just yourself.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.210
Are you able to do this
full-time, or is this a hobby

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.200
that you do on the weekends?

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.270
KEVIN BARRY: Yeah, this has
been my full-time job.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.352
Just WidgetLocker alone
was enough to be my

00:21:02.352 --> 00:21:03.900
full-time job, so.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:04.790
RETO MEIER: That's fantastic.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.390
KEVIN BARRY: It's worked
well for me.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.370
RETO MEIER: Always good to see
if someone who is able to take

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.170
something fun, and turn
it into a day job.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.720
So nicely done.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.350
All right, so I guess
what we're talking

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.190
about today is widgets.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.400
And so, can you tell us a little
bit about how is it

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.140
you're able to give us some
of these efficiency gains.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.110
Or, how do you get that extra
insight into what

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.905
makes a good widget?

00:21:26.905 --> 00:21:29.575
KEVIN BARRY: Well, so a lot of
the launcher is displaying the

00:21:29.575 --> 00:21:32.860
widgets, and being
fast and smooth.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.320
And displaying the widgets
is a lot harder

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.520
than you would think.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.000
The widgets are generally
content-rich, which it makes

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.170
sense for the widgets
provider.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:42.410
And it makes sense
to the user.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.580
They want to see the
beautiful images.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.500
But it uses a fair
amount of memory.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.030
And so this--

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.560
just using the memory, Nova
Launcher can hit its memory,

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.190
or any launcher can hit its
memory limits for having too

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.200
many of these widgets.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.130
Or changing out these images can
cause garbage collection,

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.640
which is going to slow the
scroll of the launcher.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.190
So really, I like to see the
well designed widgets there

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.350
that are just using right image
size or that are using

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.440
these images.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.480
They're sending them
efficiently, so there's less

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.000
work on the launcher, and it
keeps everything smooth.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.400
RETO MEIER: All right.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.870
So then basically, the better
the widget, the more smooth,

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.550
fast, and efficient your
launcher can be.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.780
KEVIN BARRY: Yeah.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:22.025
Many users care about this.

00:22:22.025 --> 00:22:24.307
And they will start noticing
it's not the launcher, it's

00:22:24.307 --> 00:22:25.690
the widget.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.680
And they'll ask me for widget
recommendations.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.560
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.690
So that's yet another
vested interest.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:32.370
It's interesting.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.410
It's something we found last
year at I/O. We made a big

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.690
deal about Project Butter,
making everything smoother and

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.570
faster, and everything else.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.350
So it becomes incredibly
important when you're

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.100
embedding someone else's app--

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.950
you know, their widget into
your app if you want what

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.440
you're doing to be smooth
and buttery.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.515
And users-- like you say--
really do care.

00:22:49.515 --> 00:22:51.305
It's important that the things
you're putting in

00:22:51.305 --> 00:22:53.140
there work as well.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.600
So what are some of the most
common best practices, or I

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.850
guess maybe anti-patents--

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.020
either way you want to look at
it-- that you've seen widget

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:05.270
developers use or not use, which
you'd like to share.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.390
KEVIN BARRY: So the main thing I
wanted to talk about was how

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.120
to set the images.

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:15.940
And so, there's two popular ways
of a setting the images.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.530
One is to use the
remote views.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.220
They have a set bitmap or
set image view bitmap.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.000
And this is pretty nasty.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.440
If you use it for a small
bitmap, it's fine.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.565
And it's convenient, because you
just generate your bitmap,

00:23:26.565 --> 00:23:27.490
and you send it.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.300
But what has to happen here
is, first, your service--

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.385
your widget service has to make
a copy of all the pixels

00:23:33.385 --> 00:23:34.280
of the bitmap.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.790
So it's a large amount.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.590
Then it gives it to the Android
framework, where that

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.960
has to hold onto it for
a little while.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.970
Then it sends it to
the launcher.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.925
The launcher then has to
unparcel that, so it's

00:23:45.925 --> 00:23:47.060
creating another copy of it.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.720
So a large amount-- double the
memory needed for the image.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.810
And then we can ultimately
display it.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:53.860
So this is-- it's creating
garbage.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.440
And Android has a transaction
size limit, so you

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.090
individually can only
transfer so much.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.415
And I only [INAUDIBLE]
can see so much.

00:24:01.415 --> 00:24:03.770
And if I have too many widgets
sending updates at

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.187
once, I can't it.

00:24:06.187 --> 00:24:07.830
I'll crash.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:13.510
So sending bitmaps through
parcels, through binders--

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.370
it's bad.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:16.890
There's a better method
which just uses the

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.270
imaging site image URI.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.020
So this means that your binder
overhead is really small.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:25.050
You're just making it URI,
then sending that over.

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.300
Then the launcher
itself loads it.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.810
There's some tricks to using
this, though, too.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.725
It means you have to have a
URI, so you need a content

00:24:34.725 --> 00:24:36.430
provider for it.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:39.260
And previously, I've seen
widgets use the

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.240
file:/sys/ as the URI.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.285
And this worked, but some future
version of Android is

00:24:45.285 --> 00:24:47.410
going to have to read external
storage permission.

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.152
And the default launcher
doesn't have

00:24:49.152 --> 00:24:49.820
that at this time.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.630
I kind of doubt it
will get it.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.470
So you don't want to be using
this file:/// URI.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.115
So you need to create your own
kind of wrapper URI that can

00:24:58.115 --> 00:25:02.375
just open up the info stream,
and send it off.

00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:04.405
I don't a good example
of that, as I'm

00:25:04.405 --> 00:25:05.630
not making the widget.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.050
I'm just receiving it.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.090
Another downside of the second
[INAUDIBLE] is it's not

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:14.640
asynchronous, but neither is
the second entry of bitmap.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.460
This is something that hopefully
a future version of

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.730
Android framework can help
with is letting widgets

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:20.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.920
asynchronously, not like
in the launcer.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.900
And you still want to use small
images here, because

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.830
even though you're not creating
a copy of it, but

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.640
you're still getting this
potentially large image to

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.230
launch display.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.800
And so Launcher has
to scale it down.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.210
That's taking time to scale
it, and it's using the

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:38.430
launcher's memory quicker.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.260
I've seen some contact widgets,

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.610
scroll the contact widgets.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:42.250
So they'll look nice.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.300
You can fling through
and they scroll.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.960
But when you fling through--

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.340
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.752
and they're loading the full
size contact picture, which

00:25:49.752 --> 00:25:51.710
can be 1,000 pixels wide.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.984
And you're displaying
it at 96x96.

00:25:54.984 --> 00:25:57.530
So you could scale those ahead
of time, save them to the SD

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.830
card, or save them to your
original storage or something,

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.560
and just give the launcher the
smallest version you need.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.480
RETO MEIER: That makes
a lot of sense.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.590
I wonder if along the same
lines, using something like--

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:10.610
I remember exactly the name--
but drawable where you're able

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.990
to set the image level, so
that you have basically,

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.050
rather than having to send
through the bitmap of the

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.920
drawable every time you want to
change it, you could just

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.700
basically send through the int
value of the level that you

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.320
want to display.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.825
Would that sort of approach
work has similarly?

00:26:24.825 --> 00:26:25.940
KEVIN BARRY: Yeah, for
something like--

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.960
I imagine [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.800
you could use something
like that.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.794
But for something where you're
getting dynamic contents, it's

00:26:33.794 --> 00:26:34.620
not in your resources.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.100
You're not going to be
able to do that.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.030
RETO MEIER: That makes
a lot of sense.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.495
So going on the same lines, you
were mentioning that if

00:26:40.495 --> 00:26:43.710
you get too many updates from
too many widgets at the same

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:46.150
time, then that's going to
cause you problems in

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:47.720
processing all of those.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.830
And it's something which we've
talked about before, as well,

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.860
which is widgets--

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.770
it's important to keep
them updated.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.900
But it's also important not
to refresh them too often.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.320
From your experience, do you
have sort of a best practice

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.010
of what you would recommend as
an appropriate frequency with

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.550
which to refresh your widgets?

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.800
KEVIN BARRY: I guess it really
just happens when it happens.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.530
Like Nova Launcher actually
tries-- if you're scrolling

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.655
through the screen, it tries
to kind of defer

00:27:13.655 --> 00:27:14.930
those widget updates.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.720
But it's tricky to that.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.140
The framework's really
not built for that.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.590
So it can't always
manage to do so.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.385
Really, the only real problem
I've had is when people have

00:27:24.385 --> 00:27:27.400
had animated widgets, which
Android does not support

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:27.830
animated widgets.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.180
RETO MEIER: No, it doesn't.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.120
KEVIN BARRY: And any hack to do
it slows the whole system

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.385
to a crawl.

00:27:31.385 --> 00:27:32.540
It's really bad.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.840
Don't do animated widgets.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.220
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.130
And it's one of the key tips
that we say is you should

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:41.310
really only be updating
kind of on demand.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.800
And certainly no more frequently
than every sort of

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:44.450
30 minutes.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.840
It's almost like you want to
send as much content to a

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:51.550
widget as you can, and have it
use things like image pages to

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:54.270
modify the content without
having to sort of send stuff

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.910
to it to constantly
have to process.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:02.820
So I wonder, efficiency aside,
are there certain things which

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.260
you are seeing a lot of people
making mistakes on.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.260
Things causing crashes in
widgets, which you then have

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.140
to deal with within
your launcher?

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.650
KEVIN BARRY: So widgets
can crash--

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.230
can and do crash the launcher.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:19.030
So Nova Launcher tries to catch
these, and just crash

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.270
the widget, not the
whole thing.

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.410
But then I save the crash
report, so I can try to

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.270
contact widget developers.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.330
But I can't tell [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.690
So some common things are--

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.730
there's a legal state exception
that can happen if

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.830
you update a list view
adapter not from

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.480
the UI thread without--

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.970
and this can happen
to any of us, too.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:39.800
But it happens widgets, too.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.360
So when you're updating the
adapter used for your

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.160
scrollable widget, make sure
you've found the best

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.150
practices there.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.360
You're updating it from the
UI thread on your--

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.050
you want to find any changes.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.540
There's transaction too large
which I kind of touched about

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.480
before, which is, generally,
bitmaps.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.400
But no matter what you're doing,
don't embed a huge

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.560
amount of information in
your widget update.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:04.490
Try to get it from a content
provider if you can.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.320
Oddly enough, there's security
exceptions sometimes.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.830
Sometimes widgets will ask the
launcher to splice them from a

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.010
content provider it doesn't
have access to.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:17.330
Like getting something from a
context provider or whatever.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.050
I imagine these are caught
pretty quickly.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:22.480
But some like the LG launcher
does have more permissions.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.450
It has permissions to the
context provider.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.265
So if you just test on some
skinned phone, you're not

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:28.470
necessarily going to see this.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.060
So you really want to test
on a third-party

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:31.000
launcher, as well.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.490
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:33.260
And that's a good point,
as well, right?

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.990
In that the widgets themselves
are running within your--

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.080
or the launchers process,
which means that the

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.330
permissions which your app
needs, or what your widget

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.390
needs, it depends on what the
home screen, the launcher

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.000
actually has.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.250
KEVIN BARRY: And you can't--

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.620
no launcher actually does--

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.840
it is a [INAUDIBLE] for an SD
card, because I use it for

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.980
other things.

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.230
You can't count on a launcher
having that.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.970
The default Android
launcher doesn't.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:03.530
Well, it does now, because
Android allows anything to it.

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:07.430
But when Android doesn't, the
Android-- the default launcher

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.900
probably won't.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.730
And the different launchers
behave different.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:14.780
This is different from
the widget crashing.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:18.430
But on the Galaxy S III,
the default launcher--

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:19.440
Samsung's launcher--

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.430
doesn't apply any padding
to the widgets.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.680
But Ice Cream Sandwich said
that widgets get--

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.090
it's generally 80
dp of padding.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:31.370
So if you test your widget in
the Samsung launcher, then you

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.740
test it in a third-party
launcher, or you test it in

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.410
the stock Android launcher,
you're going to see the

00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:37.736
padding's different.

00:30:37.736 --> 00:30:40.230
And there's not-- you can't
really control this.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.280
You can't detect if you're
running on Samsung, you can

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.225
add extra padding, because
they might be using a

00:30:44.225 --> 00:30:45.290
third-party launcher.

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:49.350
So just test so it looks good
either with the padding stock

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:51.310
Android has, or without
structure

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.050
which it doesn't have.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.080
RETO MEIER: Yeah, that's
a really good point

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.770
for testing, as well.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:56.700
Sorry, I interrupted.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.110
Go on.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.830
KEVIN BARRY: Sure.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:03.085
One more exception I wanted to
point out was when you're

00:31:03.085 --> 00:31:05.790
dealing with a list view, and
you have different view types.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.130
So this is sometimes you have a
header, and then you have an

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:09.760
actually item.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.950
You have to return a count
for get view type count.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.750
And so in a normal app, if you
don't return the correct value

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.160
here while you're scrolling
through it,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.750
your app will crash.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.193
In the case of widgets, if you
return the wrong get view type

00:31:22.193 --> 00:31:25.632
count, then the launcher itself
is going to crash.

00:31:25.632 --> 00:31:25.990
RETO MEIER: Fun times.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:27.610
KEVIN BARRY: And you'll see in
the right index out of balance

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.560
exception, add scrap view--
that's the key there.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.980
So there's fixes to probably
increase your get view type

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.690
count to the correct number.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:38.650
RETO MEIER: Right, and
that's a good tip.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.230
That's actually a good point
you made earlier, as well,

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.950
about testing.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.660
I think a lot of people are
going to just use an emulator,

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.920
or whichever device they happen
to own, to test their

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.260
widgets, not considering the
fact that not only are you

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.030
going to have different home
screens from different

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.610
manufacturers.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.660
But in fact, users may download
things like Nova

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.470
Launcher to have their own
third-party launcher.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:00.930
So I think it's a good tip for
people building widgets to

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:04.570
test on multiple launcher
implementations to make sure

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.590
it doesn't just work
on stock Android.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:08.880
Great.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.610
Well, that's definitely
really helpful.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.510
I think a lot of really
good tips there for

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.940
people building widgets.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.450
It would be remiss of me not
to ask what some of your

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.670
favorite widgets are.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.720
KEVIN BARRY: One of widget I
like, but other developers

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.490
will probably like to use, as
well, is Appmonger, which it

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:26.360
shows your app sales
for the day, or

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:27.360
whatever you set it to.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:27.740
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.362
KEVIN BARRY: So that's nice to
have on your home screen, to

00:32:29.362 --> 00:32:31.510
keep an eye on how you're
apps are doing.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:33.000
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.390
KEVIN BARRY: Android Pro
Widgets is another

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:35.330
nice set they have.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.790
Scrollable widgets for like
Twitter and calendar, and

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.490
everything--

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:40.430
contacts.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.205
And I've worked with the
developer there to work out

00:32:42.205 --> 00:32:44.050
some performance issues.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:45.710
So they're pretty
good now about

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.500
using proper size images.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.640
RETO MEIER: Excellent.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:49.820
Cool.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.450
Well, all right, thank you
very much for your time.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:53.800
I very much appreciate you
coming on and sharing some of

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.940
your experience and
wisdom on widget

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.790
creation with our audience.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.390
So thanks very much,
and I hope to talk

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:02.040
to you again soon.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.297
KEVIN BARRY: Thanks Bye.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: So some really
useful tips there from Kevin.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.460
Thank you, Kevin.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.350
That was fascinating.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:12.000
RETO MEIER: Yeah, thanks
for stopping by.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.720
We appreciate it, and would
invite any of the developers

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.510
whose apps we're going
to be a looking at to

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.450
get in touch, and--

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:18.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh,.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:19.050
Absolutely.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:21.980
RETO MEIER: --and offer some
of their of feedback.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.480
So our next step is to take a
closer look at today's apps,

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:29.090
and see how close they are
to being pure Android.

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.320
So to do that, as always,
we're going to pass them

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:34.920
through each of these
checklists.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: Till
then, we can--

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.640
you can find our pure Android
collection at

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.000
bit.ly/PureAndroid.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.280
And you can nominate your
app for consideration

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:47.660
by adding it to--

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.150
RETO MEIER: Our Trello page.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:52.280
You find that by searching for
"App Clinic Trello." We've

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.540
actually updated this recently
to give a little bit more

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.370
insight into exactly what
we're planning to

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:58.700
do week over week.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.500
So we're going to be reaching
out to some developers

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.200
specifically to ask if we can
review their apps online.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.080
And we would encourage you to
self-nominate by going there,

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.710
finding out what's happening
in the coming weeks, and

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:10.909
throwing your app in there.

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:13.100
Would also help us out if you
would give us some contact

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.210
details, so we can reach out
and talk to you beforehand.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:16.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:19.590
Now, before we go, I got
to ask you this.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:24.790
Because we talked about how the
Minimal launcher had an

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.820
app icon that's in the launcher,
so you can get to

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.179
its Settings page.

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:33.760
Roman's widget does not.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.370
I think it should.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:35.530
What do you think?

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.310
RETO MEIER: I think it's a
really interesting question.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:41.489
I think if you're building a
widget which is going to

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:43.960
target pretty much every Android
device which can have

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.150
widgets, then I think it
probably makes sense to have

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.730
some sort of icon there.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:50.530
The challenge or opportunity
with Roman's is that it's only

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.469
available for devices
running Android 4.2.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:56.610
And now especially, that tends
to be pretty new phone

00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:00.540
purchases, more of the sort of
upper end of the techie, geeky

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.310
sort of equilibrium.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:04.570
So the sorts of people
installing and using the app

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.300
may be more likely to be able to
find the advanced features,

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.560
such as a lock screen widgets.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:13.210
So I think it's kind
of a tricky call.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.270
But yeah, I think some of the
challenges that we talked

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:19.930
about, the fact that you can't
even give really simple,

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:22.260
step-by-step instructions on
how to install the widget

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.970
means that, well, if you're the
one who has to explain how

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.920
to install widgets, your chances
of them finding it,

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.770
and finding it useful, probably
are pretty low.

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:32.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I always
used to hate it when somebody

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.630
would install an icon for
their live wallpaper.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.660
Right, that--

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.330
and the only thing that made
me think otherwise was that

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.530
Roman's widget is not
just a widget.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:44.645
It's also a container
for other widgets.

00:35:44.645 --> 00:35:45.020
RETO MEIER: Yes.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.080
Yes, that's a good point.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:46.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: Something
to think about.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.520
We'd love to hear what you guys
think about that, and

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.250
other questions.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.120
So go ahead and give us a
shout-out on Google+.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.350
RETO MEIER: And we'll
be back next week.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.870
Don't forget to join Roman,
Nick, and Adam on Android

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.000
Designing Action next Tuesday.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.930
And until the next week,
I'm Reto Meier.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:03.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:04.650
RETO MEIER: And this has
been in The App Clinic.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: Goodbye.
