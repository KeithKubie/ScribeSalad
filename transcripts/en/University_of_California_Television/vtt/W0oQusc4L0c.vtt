00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:01.358
(rumbling)

00:00:01.358 --> 00:00:03.608
(bleeping)

00:00:05.449 --> 00:00:08.532
(lively piano music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.630
Bipedal.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.890
Naked.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.923
Large-brained.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.703
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.873
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.883
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.770
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.693
of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.713
to exchange insights on who
we are, and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.970
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.693
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.807
(ambient music)

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:30.186
(uptempo music)

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.610
- I'm gonna present some
data from a study I did

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.340
to evaluate the ecology
of hominin scavenging,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.390
but I'll start by talking
a bit more broadly

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.430
about how archaeologists can use evidence

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.990
from butchered animal bones

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.390
to understand prehistoric meat-eating

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.990
in terms of potentially
both hunting and scavenging.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.230
So, as someone who studies prehistory,

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.400
I start with a totally blank canvas

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.240
when I attempt to reconstruct
the diets of ancient humans.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.940
I try to paint a picture of the past

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.240
that I know will always be incomplete.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.340
We will never have all the pixels,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.640
but I'm dedicated to finding the filters

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.710
on the lenses through which
we can peer back in time

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.860
and try to reconstruct
something rich in detail

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.850
like this National Geographic illustration

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.161
of what I can only describe
as a hominin meat picnic.

00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:34.161
(audience laughing)

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.860
One of the fun things about
studying hominin meat-eating

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.770
is there are so many
different lines of evidence

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.780
that we can use to do so.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.960
We can use chimpanzee
and human forager diets

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.870
and the talks earlier today
have addressed some of these.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.410
We can look at hominin fossils themselves,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.220
we can look at the size
and shape of teeth.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.670
The talk before mine by
Margaret addressed this a bit.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.560
We can look at jaws and skulls

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.260
and we can look at even
body size and shape.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.250
We can also look at the chemistry

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.500
which is what the talk
before mine really focused on

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.970
of those actual hominin fossils.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.370
We can look at animal
fossils, particularly those

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.420
with direct evidence for butchery

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.130
and that's what I'll focus
on a little bit after this.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.260
To do that we often use
a method called actualism

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.650
where we either do experiments

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.120
or make observations in the present.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.150
We look at bones on the present
for traces left of behavior

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.440
from those experiments or observations.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.840
We then look at fossils in the past,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.730
see if we can find similar traces

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.110
and then we can infer that
similar behaviors occurred

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.660
in the past.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.700
We can also look at the
archeological record

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.700
at tools made by hominins
that were used for meat-eating

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.560
and we can even use newer methods

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.260
like looking at ancient molecules.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.090
And so less than a year half ago,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.480
a team of archeologists announced

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.080
that they had found
ancient animal proteins,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.810
basically the residue of blood,
skin and flesh from animals

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.730
on the edges of 17 stone tools
from an excavation in Jordan

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.950
dating back to 250,000 years ago.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.630
It kind of blows my mind a bit

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.220
that now we have direct evidence

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.380
for even what kinds of animals
hominins were butchering

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.980
a quarter of a million years ago.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.240
In this case we're talking about camels,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.013
wild cattle, rhino, horses and duck.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.010
So I use a method called taphonomy,

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.150
this is the lens that I
most often look through

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.110
to examine the diets of early humans.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.860
Taphonomy is the study of
what happens to an organism

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.940
after its death until its
discovery as a fossil.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.790
Here's a great illustration by a paper

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.220
by Nina Jablonski and colleagues

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.810
of a possible taphonomic
scenario resulting

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.860
in the accumulation of giant
panda bones in a cave in China.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.410
I'm particularly interested
in what happens right at

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.450
and after death.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.900
So that's that middle row really

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.910
between boxes number three and four.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.680
And when it comes to thinking
about hominin meat-eating

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.880
the main way to investigate
this is through the study

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.510
of animal fossils with butchery marks,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.520
including cut marks made from skinning,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.420
disarticulating and defleshing animals,

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.630
as well as percussion marks
left by bashing bones open

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.610
to get at the fat and calorie-rich marrow.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.870
I also study tooth marks

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.070
and other chewing damage
left by carnivores.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.530
The lens I use is literally a hand lens,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.930
like a simple magnifying
glass that I can use

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.053
to identify these marks on fossil bones.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.800
So I'm gonna take you
on a taphonomic timeline

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.810
of what we know about
the earliest evidence

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.110
for hominin carnivory.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.920
And the bulk of the evidence
for the earliest carnivory

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.100
in human evolutionary history really comes

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.160
from three sites in Ethiopia.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.870
The oldest is a 3.3 million
year old site called Dikika,

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.330
where a team led by people
including Jessica Thompson

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.270
and Shannon McPherron
discovered just a handful

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.410
of bones, including those
pictured on the left

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.960
with possible butchery marks on them.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.160
Two other sites from Ethiopia
called Gona and Bouri,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.130
the bones on the right
are from pictures of bones

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.810
with butchery marks from Bouri.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.900
Those date to 2.6 and 2.5
million years ago respectively.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.103
They also preserve a handful
of butchery mark fossils.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.550
While much ink has been spilled

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.690
about whether some of these marks

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.060
are actually butchery marks

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.260
and not marks made by
crocodiles, mammalian carnivores

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.860
or other butchery mark mimics
like sedimentary abrasion,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.110
the importance of these sites

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.900
is that they signal the beginning

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.060
of a dietary shift in hominin
evolution to occasionally,

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.190
but apparently only occasionally,

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.793
butchering and eating animals.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.120
There was a shift at two million years ago

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.730
when we have the first evidence
of both persistent carnivory

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.390
and early access to small animals,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.620
and I'll explain what that means.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.350
And the image up here is of
some butchered animal fossils

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.100
from this site called Kanjera
South in Southwestern Kenya.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.140
This is some research
that I've been involved in

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.860
led by Rick Potts and Tom Plummer

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.630
as well as Jennifer
Parkinson and Joe Ferraro.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.890
At Kanjera there's clear evidence

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.430
from hundreds of butchery mark
fossil bones, animal bones,

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.370
that hominins acquired and
processed numerous relatively

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.690
complete small animal
carcasses for meat and marrow.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.830
They got to these animals
first before other predators

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.490
and butchered the meatier parts of them,

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.010
so that's the early access part.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.660
The Kanjera hominins also had
at least occasional access

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.660
to meat and marrow from
larger-sized animals.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.700
An important difference between
this and the earlier sites

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.000
where we do see evidence
of hominin butchery

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.960
is that there's evidence
for hominin butchery

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.960
on bones at Kanjera from
three stratigraphic intervals

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.610
that span hundreds to thousands of years.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.170
So hominins were coming back to this place

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.650
in Southwestern Kenya over and over again

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.200
over a long period of
time to butcher animals.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.670
This is what persistent carnivory is.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.030
And this gives us a sense
that this dietary behavior

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.700
is becoming more important

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.850
or at least it's becoming
more commonplace.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.870
Just a little bit later in time,

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.050
a work led by David Braun
in a place called Koobi Fora

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.380
in Northern Kenya, there's evidence

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.800
for hominin butchery marks on
turtles, crocodiles and fish.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.970
So at this time hominins
are already broadening

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.660
their butchery behavior
to include both aquatic

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.403
as well as terrestrial animals.

00:08:04.237 --> 00:08:05.530
There is another shift that happened

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.020
about one and a half million years ago.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.700
From several different bone assemblages

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.200
from the sites of Olduvai Gorge,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.000
some of which date back to
about 1.8 million years ago,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.070
and Koobi Fora, some of which date back

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.680
to 1.5 million years ago, led by a variety

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.950
of different teams, there's
evidence from the skeletal parts

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.220
that were transported and
butchered at these sites

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.630
hominins had early access
to large animal carcasses.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.140
Basically they were now able
to get to these carcasses first

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.550
and butcher the meatier
parts of large animals.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.520
The photo up here is a butchery marks

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.380
on one and a half million year
old fossil antelope leg bone

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.170
from Koobi Fora in Northern Kenya

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.230
and this is part of an
assemblage that I studied

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.393
and excavated as part of my dissertation.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.840
So, you're probably picturing
hominins striding out

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.670
onto the African savanna armed

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.210
with their stone-tipped spears

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.980
getting ready to hunt these animals.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.680
Like this bronze sculpture
reconstruction of a Homo Erectus

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.860
from the Hall of Human
Origins at the Smithsonian

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.053
carrying a goat-sized gazelle on her back.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.960
Well, the earliest solid
evidence for hunting technology

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.920
doesn't come into the record
until half a million years ago

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.180
with the spear points from
a site called Kathu Pan

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.810
in South Africa that have

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.140
what are called diagnostic
impact fractures on their tips,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.350
indicating that they were definitely used

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.100
as the ends of weapons.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.210
It's possible that hominins were hunting

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.830
with unmodified rocks or
sharpened sticks made into spears

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.850
maybe like the Fongoli chimpanzees

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.760
or other basically
archeologically invisible tools,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.940
but we haven't figured out
a way to detect this yet

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.350
in the prehistoric record.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.100
And this is particularly likely

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.690
in the case of the small
animals at Kanjera,

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.450
so many of the small animals
themselves were juveniles,

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.660
and very young defenseless
antelopes are often stashed

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.180
in thick grass clumps for
several weeks by their mothers.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.440
And doesn't take very
sophisticated technology

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.430
to basically walk up to
those little antelopes

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.210
and bop them on the head
and then you have dinner.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.790
So what made early human carnivory

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.770
or early hominin carnivory unique,

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.680
particularly compared to the possible diet

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.500
of our earliest ancestors,

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.880
as well as the diets of chimpanzees?

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.620
There are four things.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.750
The first is that it involved big animals.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:15.060
And so, animals much
larger than themselves.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.190
As you heard from the talks earlier today,

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.120
chimpanzees don't hunt animals

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.230
that are larger than themselves.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.190
This is a really useful reconstruction

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.060
of an extinct elephant being butchered

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.070
by a group of Homo Erectus based

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.510
on a one-million-year
old archeological site

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.180
I'm involved in studying from
a Smithsonian research site

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.093
in Southern Kenya called Olorgesailie.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.900
The second thing is that
it involved tool use,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.403
and rare occasions including
the Fongoli chimps aside,

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.240
we don't think that our earliest ancestors

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.850
necessarily used tools when they hunted.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.790
Hominins also don't have the sharp teeth

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.560
of mammalian carnivores to be able

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.580
to get through the skin of large animals,

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.500
let alone slice meat off of their bones

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.150
and bash them open to get marrow.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.980
It also likely involves something

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.170
called deferred consumption,

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.120
which is basically not
eating something right away

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.210
as soon as you find it.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.090
This is a weird thing that humans do.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.400
We don't go to the grocery store,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.630
sit down in the middle of the aisles,

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.550
open the packages and start eating,

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.350
I guess, unless we're really hungry.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.290
But in the earliest record
of hominin meat-eating,

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.280
we have evidence that hominins
transported carcass parts

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.740
to central places for some
kind of communal consumption,

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.730
potentially food sharing.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.570
So if early humans were
eating meat from large animals

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.710
for about two million years
before we have evidence,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.760
good solid evidence
for hunting technology,

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.200
how were they getting access to them?

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.780
One suggestion is that they
were scavenging the leftovers

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.190
from large carnivore kills,

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.900
and I should point out
that this is something

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.780
that is very rarely seen
in chimpanzee behavior.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.910
Chimps don't seem to look at dead things

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.710
and think of them as food,
things that are already dead.

00:11:51.006 --> 00:11:52.560
So what does scavenging look like

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.520
behaviorally and ecologically?

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.610
There have been two
main kinds of scavenging

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.800
that have been proposed
for early hominins.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.480
The first is called confrontational

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.550
or aggressive or power scavenging.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.160
This is when hominins
actively chase carnivores off

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.120
of kills, presumably getting access

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.970
to a lot of meat and
marrow in the process.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.986
There was probably a
pretty high risk of injury

00:12:11.986 --> 00:12:15.170
or predation of the hominins
themselves when they did this.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.510
And there are a few
hominins with bite marks

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.760
on them from carnivores to
indicate that this did happen

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.963
at least occasionally.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.340
The second is passive scavenging,

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.970
and this is waiting until carnivores

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.680
are completely done eating a kill,

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.650
they've moved off, the scene is safe,

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.220
hominins could go in
and eat the leftovers.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.590
One of the main criticisms of
the passive scavenging idea

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.490
is that there probably wouldn't
be much worth going after

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.910
when carnivores were
done eating their fill.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.540
But is this the case?

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.370
I decided to try to answer this question

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.420
by simulating passive scavenging

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.360
in a modern African
ecosystem similar to those

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.810
in which our earliest
meat-eating ancestors lived.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.270
And I'm very happy to leave simulating

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.150
confrontational scavenging
to somebody else.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.520
(clears throat)
(audience laughing)

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.950
So is passive scavenging worth it?

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:02.650
The research I'll be
talking about here was part

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.160
of my dissertation and it
was published a few years ago

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.860
in the Journal of Human Evolution.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.840
In 2002 to 2003, I spent
seven months in a game reserve

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.900
in central Kenya called
Ol Pejeta Conservancy,

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.450
which you can see here on
a zoomed in map of Kenya,

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.020
and I simulated passive scavenging.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.740
I specifically chose this
conservancy, Ol Pejeta,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.530
because the felid, the carnivore community

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.430
is dominated by lions, and most
models of hominin scavenging

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.790
are based on interactions
with large felids,

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.443
including lions, leopards
and extinct saber tooths.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.500
There have been a few
other scavenging studies

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.750
that were done before
mine but these were done

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.300
in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro
ecosystems of Tanzania,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.530
as well as the Maasai
Mara ecosystem of Kenya

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.240
that's actually all one big ecosystem

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.290
that happens to be separated
by an international border.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.630
But these ecosystems have
unusually high numbers

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.630
of predators and
particularly high competition

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.000
among predator species.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.040
So I was interested in going
to a felid-dominated ecosystem

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.693
to simulate passive scavenging.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.650
Ol Pejeta is an African savanna ecosystem,

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.280
it was about 100 square
kilometers when I was there.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.200
It was called Sweetwaters
Game Reserve when I was there.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.710
Now it's been expanded to
almost four times that size.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.980
And here you see some images
of what it looked like there.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.460
It has mixed grassland
and woodland vegetation.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.980
All the photos on this slide are photos

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.520
I took in the reserve.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.800
The vegetation map on the top left

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.680
shows open grassy areas that are in black.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.520
They generally run east to
west on kind of high plateaus.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.270
The photos with the
giraffe with the zebras

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.580
in the background are a good example

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.720
of what those open grassy areas look like.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.320
There's a permanent river
called the Ewaso Ng'iro

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.860
that runs north south through the reserve.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.140
You can see that on the western
side with that green strip.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.620
That green is basically
riverine vegetation,

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.620
trees particularly dominated
by yellow fever acacia

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.918
or acacia that's xanthophloea.

00:14:59.918 --> 00:15:02.800
There's a picture of
that on the top right.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.340
The dominant bush in the
ecosystem is called euclea.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.220
This is noted in the bright blue areas,

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.490
you can see that on the top middle.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.310
Whistling thorn acacia
or acacia drepanolobium

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.770
are also very prevalent,

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.330
those are noted in light
blue on the vegetation map.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.750
And the yellow and pink
areas on that map are areas

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.110
of mixed bushland, woodland and grassland

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.760
in kind of different proportions.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.400
The predator community during the time

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.510
of my study was dominated by
lions as I mentioned already

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.090
and the herbivore community
was dominated by zebras

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.313
followed by warthog,
impala, buffalo and baboon.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.130
So, my study methods were pretty simple.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.810
After finding out about a carnivore kill

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.780
from a variety of sources, I would wait

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.000
until the lions were completely satiated,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.370
like this one in this photo
(audience laughing)

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.360
with a distended belly full of warthog,

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.010
this was a really happy sleepy lion,

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.810
and I would document what
was left on their kills.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.600
I had two advantages over
my earlier ancestors.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.050
I had a four-wheel drive vehicle

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:01.320
and I had an armed guard
with me at all times

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.240
lessening the likelihood
of me becoming one

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.861
of my own samples.

00:16:04.861 --> 00:16:06.140
(audience laughing)

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.280
In the time that I was at Ol Pejeta,

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.280
I collected 24 kill samples
from several different species

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.270
of carnivores which you
can see in the left column

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.640
of this table, but I'm
gonna focus particularly

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.130
on the lion kills today as
that's my largest sample

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.850
and the most relevant for thinking

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.150
about models of hominins scavenging.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:24.760
I separated the prey into
two size divisions related

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.570
to how we classify the size of animals

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.760
when we're doing archeological analysis,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.400
but here I'm just generally
calling them large or small.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.070
Larger animals are over 250 pounds,

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.483
small animals less than 250 pounds.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.840
I documented the location
and estimated the amount

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.230
of meat left over after
the lions had their fill

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.230
and here are some examples

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.000
of what these leftovers looked like.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.130
The top right is a
picture of a zebra ribcage

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.800
with quite a bit of meat left on it

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.640
and the bottom right is a
picture of a part of a limb

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.040
of a young Grant's gazelle
with hardly any scraps left.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.630
And I should say specifically

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.120
that I followed previous
researchers in defining bulk flesh

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.080
as masses of muscle at least
10% of their original size,

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.880
flesh scraps were usually
pieces of flesh less than size

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.910
of the palm of your hand, but
over two to three centimeters

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.310
and weighing more than
about a third of a pound.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.260
So how much meat can a scavenger
eat from a large animal,

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.490
something like a zebra
or a large antelope?

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.410
I'm gonna walk you through
the axis of this graph

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.000
before I show you the data.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.930
So the x-axis is a skeletal
element or bone arranged

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.610
in groups from left to right
with the total sample size

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:29.680
of each bone listed in parentheses.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.270
The important part is the left two bones,

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.920
they're bones of the hindlimb,
then bones of the forelimb,

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.610
then bones of the torso, and all the way

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.850
on the right are bones
of the head and neck.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.040
The y-axis is the
proportion of those bones

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.660
in all samples with three different levels

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.470
of flesh availability,

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.880
and I basically colored
them like a traffic light.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.470
Green for bulk flesh,
yellow for flesh scraps

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.230
and red for no flesh.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.950
So what did I find?

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.100
You see a lot of green
and yellow on there.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.570
In large kills, over 50%
of bones were abandoned

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.040
with large muscle masses
still on them in green,

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.110
and 95% of the bones had either bulk flesh

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:06.560
or flesh scraps which you see in yellow.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.010
That's from large prey.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:10.250
Small prey is a different story.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.890
Only a single bone on smaller lion kills

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.440
retained bulk flesh on it.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.930
About half the bone still
had some flesh scraps

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.820
and the other half were totally defleshed,

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.370
you can see that in red.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.860
And one take-home from the study

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.650
is that if you're an
early human scavenging

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.803
from a lion kill, the size
of the prey really matters.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.460
So, how does this translate into actually

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.260
how much meat a scavenger could eat?

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.910
We can use weights of
adult wildebeest and zebra

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.570
which are pictured here.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.670
The hindlimb of wildebeest
yields about 19 pounds of meat,

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.820
a zebra about 50 pounds.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.650
A defleshed hindlimb of
a wildebeest would be

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.670
about two pounds, defleshed
zebra about five pounds.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:48.910
That's only a single hindlimb.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.340
A defleshed wildebeest carcass

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.850
could yield 12 pounds of meat.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.670
A defleshed a zebra carcass could yield

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.600
about 34 pounds of meat.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.420
So if we estimate a four
calories per gram of meat,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.080
this is about 2,200
calories from a wildebeest

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.860
and almost 6,100 calories from a zebra,

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.060
and these are defleshed.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.270
So, translating this into
things we can understand here,

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.840
that's about a little more than five

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.410
and a half In-N-Out burgers
worth of meat from a wildebeest,

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.890
a little more than 15 and
a half in burgers worth

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.033
of meat from a zebra.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.107
I'm using an estimate of
somewhere between 2,100

00:19:25.107 --> 00:19:28.010
and 2,300 calories per day
required for Homo Erectus.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.730
A defleshed wildebeest is pretty much

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.330
your daily caloric requirement.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.220
This is even without breaking the bones

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.940
to get at the marrow inside.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.840
So the main take-home message
is that I think scavenging

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.120
from even relatively defleshed carcasses

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.320
would have been a profitable

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.413
and worthwhile activity for hominins.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.650
I just want to acknowledge
Government of Kenya,

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.820
the funding, my PhD advisor and
the people and the predators

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.396
and the prey of Ol Pejeta.

00:19:51.396 --> 00:19:52.229
Thank you.

00:19:52.229 --> 00:19:55.850
(audience applauding)

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.740
- So the idea that women have
evolved to be plant gatherers

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.500
and men hunters has dominated
evolutionary thinking

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.910
in the popular imagination for decades.

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.900
It's been suggested that
men are better navigators

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.820
than women as a result of a long history

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.170
of natural selection on hunters

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.610
who can pursue mobile prey
across vast landscapes

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.270
without getting lost.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.030
Men are thought to be more
cooperative than women

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.580
because throughout our
evolutionary history

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.740
they've needed to work together

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.180
to bring down hunted prey
much larger than themselves.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.650
Men's hunting is argued to
have driven the evolution

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.990
of our two-legged gait, supplied
the nutritional advantages

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.340
and protein and fat to support

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.970
our energetically-expensive brain

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.130
and given our juveniles the luxury

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.730
of a long pre-reproductive
life of relative leisure

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.210
in which they can take the time to learn

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.793
all the skills of adulthood.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.870
Although it's widely recognized
that women's gathering

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.740
is usually the more reliable contributor

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.490
to family subsistence,
we also tend to think

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.620
that men's hunting must be
on the whole more productive

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.500
than women's foraging

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.673
because they often take
very large animals.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.600
Some have even argued that the
origins of the nuclear family

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.610
where men and women cooperate
in different tasks lie

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.500
in the evolutionary origins
of female specializing

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.070
in childcare and depending
on a man's hunting production

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.390
in order to feed her children.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.361
The generalization that men tend to hunt

00:21:11.361 --> 00:21:12.340
and women gather holds

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:14.570
for some well-known
contemporary hunter-gatherers.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.620
So among the Hadza in
Tanzania for example,

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.450
women primarily gather plant foods,

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.480
lower-quality small-packaged food items

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.650
high in carbohydrates.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.770
And men typically spend
their time hunting,

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.570
acquiring higher-quality
large-packaged food items high

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.470
in protein and fat.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:32.380
Similarly, among the Juǀʼhoansi
in Botswana and Namibia

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.640
and the Ache in Paraguay, women
specialize almost entirely

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.773
on plant-based foods while men hunt.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.220
However, this is not a universal pattern.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.990
There is a great deal of variation

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.830
among hunter-gatherers in the extent

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.330
to which women do
specialize on plant foods.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.200
And many hunter-gatherer
women do acquire animals.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.860
There's the Ata, the Ainu, and the Dene,

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.090
where women hunt deer.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.690
The Cree where women
hunt caribou and geese.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.360
Central African Aka women hunt
for duikers and forest pigs.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.920
Mixed-gender communal hunts
for rabbits were common

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.940
among the Shoshone,
and Paiute women hunted

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.880
and in many cases still
hunt ground squirrels

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.223
and prairie dogs.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.620
Australia is another place that
challenges our understanding

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.190
of who hunts and why.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.360
Across Australia, pre-historically women

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.970
were active hunters.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.190
They had a primary focus
on the hand capture

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.060
of small to medium-sized animals.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.200
And in many locations,
women skillfully used fire

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.140
and hunted with dogs to
improve their efficiency.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.000
For example, Phyllis Kayberry
found Walmajarri women

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.960
in the Kimberly in 1935 were using dogs

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.020
to hunt kangaroo and monitor lizards.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.180
And she suggested that
the family was dependent

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.620
on the woman's efforts to a greater extent

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.070
than on those of her husband.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.580
In the 1950s, Jane Goodall also found

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.140
that Tiwi women were active
and productive hunters.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.190
And she too characterized women

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.140
as the most consistent providers

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.430
not only of plant foods,
but of meat as well,

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.373
especially meat from small animals.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.750
People I work with, Martu.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.090
Martu women of Australia's
Western Desert, too,

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.550
are hunters more than anything else.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.640
On any given day between about 60 to 70%

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.550
of the bush food that's produced
is from women's hunting.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.460
Women take more than half of the perentie.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.400
This is one of the largest
species of monitor lizard,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.943
aside from the Komodo dragon.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.020
Women also take a little more
than half of the feral cats.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.620
Feral cats spread into the desert starting

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.470
about 100 years ago and
were readily adopted

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.043
as prey by Martu hunters.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.460
Women will take about 20% of the bustards

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.730
and 6% of the kangaroos.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.630
So bustards are the largest
flying bird in Australia

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.270
and males can weigh up to 20 kilograms.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.990
Kangaroo are the largest
endemic non-human in Australia

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.650
and weigh up to 80 kilograms.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:47.240
So these are large for Australia,

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.920
not for Africa, but for Australia.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.350
The staple prey of Martu women

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.930
are the smaller sand monitor lizards,

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.490
sometimes called goanna.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.700
And they acquire more than 80% of them.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.800
They're easily the most
abundant large vertebrate

00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.633
in the desert.

00:23:59.633 --> 00:24:00.890
They weigh about half a kilo.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.160
Women hunt them in two
ways which vary seasonally.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.040
In the hot summer months
they track the monitors

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.300
on the surface hoping to chase them

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.400
to trees or corner them in the open

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.500
to avoid having to dig
them out of their dens.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.110
In the winter the monitors
are denned most of the time

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.120
and they have to be dug out.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.250
So to accomplish this and also to aid

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:18.630
in the search for fresh dens,

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:20.280
women burn the spinifex grass

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.253
that obscures the tracks and signs.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.170
Women often cooperate with each other

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.780
in sand monitor and perentie hunting.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.510
So they work together to
burn an area for hunting

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.853
to locate tracks and dens and
then to extract the animal.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:35.780
Now, the most important
thing nutritionally

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.340
about a monitor lizard is
not the meat, it's the fat.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.420
So lizards become dormant
in the cool season.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.800
They lay down about 10 to
20% of their body weight

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.320
in the form of large fat
bodies in the abdomen and tail.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.900
And most people say a skinny lizard

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:48.920
isn't actually worth eating.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.460
So women really pride themselves

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.893
on being able to find
and capture fat ones.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.020
Now while Martu women do a lot of hunting,

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.780
they also do most of the collecting too.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.700
So they produce nearly
100% of things like roots,

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.970
98% of insect larva, 90% of the fruit,

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.793
a lot of the nectar and
about 30% of the honey.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:13.250
Now, in comparison, men are
looking for small things.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.140
About 30% of the time
they're out foraging,

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.730
but most of the time they prefer to search

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.980
for the larger animals like
emu, kangaroo and bustard.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.640
And rather than hunting
cooperatively like women,

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.153
they primarily hunt alone.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.380
Now, the social context of hunting

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.820
is similar to what you might see

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.410
in any hunter-gatherer society.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.220
So women leave the residential camp

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.860
in a group of other women,
often with children along.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.010
They establish what
they call a dinner camp.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.040
They acquire food.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.380
They return to that
temporary dinner camp to cook

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.800
and consume food socially,

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.400
and then they return
to the residential camp

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.800
at the end of the day.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.550
So the question that I'm
gonna to start off with

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.513
is why are women hunting?

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.140
So, traditionally, if we
think about men's hunting,

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.020
the goals of men's hunting
are explained usually

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:55.910
in one of two ways.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.890
So either men are hunting in order

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.640
to provision a nuclear family

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.250
or men are hunting to show off their skill

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.280
and attract alliances and
favorable attention from women.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.370
In many cases, the kinds
of hunting that men do

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:11.860
don't appear to be well-designed
to provision others.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:14.810
And when men focus almost
solely on large animals,

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.210
they sometimes run the risk
of coming home empty-handed,

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.340
especially in more arid
environments such as this one

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.743
where animals are patchy and
very infrequently encountered.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.560
So per hour spent hunting,
a kangaroo hunter does tend

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.360
to average a higher return
than a monitor lizard hunter

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:32.190
taking home over a kilo of meat,

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.943
while a sand monitor hunter
gets only a third of that.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.610
But the meat from larger animals,

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.140
kangaroo, bustard, and that sort of thing

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.010
comes in only very infrequently,

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.990
about once and in every five hunts.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.310
And although the average is higher,

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:47.560
there are often many days

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.280
when nothing is acquired by any hunter.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.910
So, in comparison, women's hunting

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.470
is much more reliable than men's.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.400
They don't have as many big bonanzas,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.250
but they also don't have as many days

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.140
with less than they might need.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.030
Men only end up out-producing
women on 25% of days.

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.590
And on 37% of days no men are successful

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.340
at hunting any type of game.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.180
Fully a third of these meat
droughts are between about three

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.840
and six days in duration.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.890
And for women, in comparison,
failure is less than 5%

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.330
and they don't have any meat droughts.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.760
So, even though larger animals
have a higher mean return,

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.590
in reality, this obscures the fact

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.050
that men's production comes in the form

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:25.940
of these periodic huge bonanzas

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.353
and long meat droughts rather
than a steady daily stream.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.370
The meat from larger animals
is also distributed widely.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.850
The hunter keeps only
about 10% for himself

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.060
and his own family.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.370
After sharing, the returns
to a hunter's family

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.500
in terms of the grams of meat
per hour hunting is the same,

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.323
regardless of what kind of
animal has been acquired.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.980
Now, if women's hunting is more reliable

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.520
and provides similar payoffs
to family consumption

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.670
when successful as does men's hunting,

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.400
then it might suggest maybe

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.040
that the goals of foraging for
men and women are different,

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.010
that men might be hunting
to show off their skill

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:04.290
and attract alliances
and favorable attention,

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:05.750
while women are foraging simply

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.520
to feed themselves and their families.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.760
So women hunt more
reliable smaller animals

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.520
and they trade off this
reliability with larger harvests

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.220
because reliability is a better way

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.730
to reduce the risks of going hungry.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.230
So it might suggest something
like men hunt to share

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.543
and women hunt to eat.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.020
Men use the hunting and
sharing of highly-valued meat

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.790
to engage themselves in
these political arenas

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.420
of social competition and social support.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.060
And kangaroo hunting by men
is an overtly political game

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.410
where young men hunt
for public consumption.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.830
They donate their labor to gain the trust

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.360
that's required to gain access

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.280
to deeper levels of ritual secrets

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.200
which are very important for men.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.880
They work to provide meat for all,

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.100
especially in-laws and potential in-laws

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.500
without any material reward

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.120
in order to gain the trust of older men

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.770
who guard the way that
secret ritual knowledge

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.470
is transferred and gained.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.590
So a man who demonstrates willingness

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.140
to work for the public good

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:02.900
is trusted with more ritual secrets

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.310
and he can rise in the ritual hierarchy.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.870
A man who demonstrates willingness

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.810
to work for his in-laws
was traditionally trusted

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:12.640
with the opportunity to
marry their daughter.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.990
Hunting for men is as
much about assuring trust

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.320
and cooperation in the
distribution of meat,

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.310
as it is about showing off
skill and acquiring meat.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.210
When men talk about the
benefits of hunting,

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.700
they emphasize that they hunt to share,

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:25.550
they don't hunt eat or
favor their own children

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:26.983
and families over others.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.400
If men hunt to share,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.270
do women then hunt only
to feed their families?

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.640
When you hunt with Martu women

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.690
what puzzles you the
most is not the hunting,

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.290
it's actually the sharing.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.820
So more than 70% of the
time women's harvests

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.580
of small animals are shared
well beyond their own families.

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.470
And on an astounding 23% of lizard hunts,

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.620
a successful hunter will
take nothing for herself.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.090
She gives it all away either
to her own family members

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:52.590
or other people sitting
around the cooking fire.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.307
When women share, they often
exchange identical lizards

00:29:55.307 --> 00:29:57.530
and the hunter will always
give away the largest prey

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:58.740
to someone else.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:01.370
Lizards are shared to others
who have already eaten.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:03.180
In this video, the hunter returned late

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.930
and she's the last to
cook and share her harvest

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.000
and she gives away
nearly the entire harvest

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.360
to other women and men in the group.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.530
She keeps only the bottom
half of one for herself.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.810
One of the women that
cooperated with her hunting,

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.040
she receives three lizards
in the initial division.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.050
She passes two to those sitting behind her

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:19.550
and one to the woman on her left.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.140
And the hunter passes one to her husband.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.220
Things are transferring back and forth.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.560
And ultimately, out of a
harvest of six large lizards,

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.090
each hunter received less than 8%.

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.130
And all of the non-hunters got portions

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.020
that were actually bigger than each

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.070
of the hunter's portion.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.680
And the goal in this
distribution was to make sure

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.750
everyone present around the
fire had an equal-sized portion

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.043
and nobody went hungry.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:47.320
Not only do women share
extensively with each other,

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.300
they share in ways that don't
make sense economically.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.070
So women often exhibit a
producer's disadvantage in sharing.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.130
So when you have a
producer's disadvantage,

00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.420
the size of the portion the
hunter, the producer keeps,

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.600
is smaller than the average size

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.190
of portions given away to those

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.660
that didn't participate in the hunt.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:09.250
And the usual cross-cultural
pattern is for producers

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.530
to take an advantage to
compensate themselves

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.730
for paying the cost of going out

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:13.870
and acquiring the food item, right?

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.530
They usually keep a portion
that's bigger than any

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.030
of the portions that are
given out to non-hunters.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.880
But when Martu women hunt small animals

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.000
like monitor lizards,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.540
they often keep a smaller
individual portion

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.140
than the average portion size given

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.660
to a non-hunter or family member.

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.580
And we don't see this pattern for men.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.150
When men share small animals,

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.760
they'll take the producer's advantage

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.630
and they'll keep a larger
portion for themselves.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.700
Women compared to men also
give away more portions.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.290
Given an average-sized harvest,

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:43.620
women will give out more than
twice as many portions as men.

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.890
They usually give out around six compared

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.760
to men who give out two.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.570
Because they give out
more portions than men,

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.720
their average portion size
is a little bit smaller,

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.000
but they prevent the portion size

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.880
of becoming too small
by stinting themselves

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.543
in favor of feeding others.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.270
Now, the cost that the
hunter pays doesn't seem

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:02.070
to be balanced by shares coming in.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:05.000
So a successful hunter
gets significantly less

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.260
from others than an unsuccessful hunter

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.400
or someone who didn't hunt at all.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.630
So that the hunter who acquired the most

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.670
often takes home the
smallest share of meat

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.720
after all sharing has been accounted for.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:20.040
So women are way too
generous with small prey

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.410
than we might expect if we're thinking

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.710
about sort of the simple
economics of sharing.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.780
It's also the case that in the sharing,

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.800
women are not just sending
those larger shares

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.460
to family members, stinting
their own consumption in favor

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.850
of their children or their close kin.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:39.070
Women also share widely beyond
their own kinship network

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.740
and they also share mainly to other women.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.270
So this is a network of
sharing relationships

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:48.070
between people who made
dinner camps with each other.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.830
The circular nodes, the circles are women.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:52.300
The squares are men.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.770
And the color corresponds
to the kinship clusters

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.630
in the bottom diagram.

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.940
Those are the four, five
major kinship clusters

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.090
in the community.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:03.410
The ties between each
of the nodes are those

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.973
who had shares of meat
passing between them.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.940
Sharing cross cuts kinship ties

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.300
and it brings together women

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.493
from all kinship clusters
in the community.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.440
So our hypothesis that women are hunting

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.950
to provision their families
seems poorly supported.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:21.610
Why hunt at all if it's
only going to share,

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:22.820
if you're only going to share most of it

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.190
to unrelated dinner camp members.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:27.260
Martu themselves suggest
that one of the main reasons

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.610
that women hunt is to acquire meat

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:29.960
to share with other women.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.470
When Martu women talk about hunting,

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.220
they describe their underlying motivation

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.600
as hunting to share.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.920
This is especially the case for women

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.140
who are known as murtilya, good hunters.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.240
Anyone can gain the
status of a good hunter,

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.700
but to be a murtilya, you
don't simply produce more,

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.370
you also share more of that
production with others.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.537
So as one hunter put it, "When
a murtilya goes out hunting,

00:33:47.537 --> 00:33:49.507
"she has a good feeling that
she's going to get so much

00:33:49.507 --> 00:33:51.067
"and be able to feed others.

00:33:51.067 --> 00:33:52.817
"Good hunters always think
that when they go out

00:33:52.817 --> 00:33:54.517
"and it helps them to hunt better.

00:33:54.517 --> 00:33:55.837
"When a really good hunter goes out,

00:33:55.837 --> 00:33:56.847
"she gives so much away

00:33:56.847 --> 00:33:59.227
"and takes home only a
small piece for herself,

00:33:59.227 --> 00:34:02.117
"but she will always walk
away feeling pukurrpa."

00:34:03.702 --> 00:34:06.630
Pukurrpa is what women see
is the reward for murtilyas.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.980
So pukurrpa means generally
warmth and happiness.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.520
But it's a happiness that's the product

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.900
of generosity that binds people together.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.330
Without generosity, you
feel you're not in a family,

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:17.010
you're just for yourself
not for everybody,

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:18.560
you don't share things.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.120
According to Martu, good hunters share

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.660
in order to demonstrate their commitment

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.960
to building family and
contributing to the public good.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.990
And this is the kind of sharing

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:26.860
that we would experience
around the dinner table.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.160
It's the sharing that
cements social relationships,

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.203
that feeds and nourishes, but
treats everyone like family.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.200
Theoretically, we know that the generation

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.680
of warmth and trust or
demonstrating generosity tends

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:38.800
to have substantial effects

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.110
on the likelihood of cooperation.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.270
And there's been quite a bit
of experimental work suggesting

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:43.640
that people tend to cooperate with

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.180
and trust more of those
who demonstrate generosity.

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.890
And this suggests that one
reason women share so widely

00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:49.723
may have something to do

00:34:49.723 --> 00:34:51.600
with their cooperative social networks.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.200
Martu women are more than twice as likely

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.710
as men to hunt cooperatively.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.010
And for some hunting activities

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.550
more than 40 times
likely to be cooperative.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:00.930
Women also cooperate in childcare, cooking

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.610
and other daily activities in ways

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:06.180
that cross cut their
residential group memberships.

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.270
Older and younger women,

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.720
even those from different hearth groups,

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.510
will team up to cooperate in childcare

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:13.070
and different forms of foraging
and subsistence activities,

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:15.070
dividing their labor
so that some will hunt

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.313
while others collect.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.450
One of the most frequent
forms of cooperation today

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.283
is in small animal hunting.

00:35:20.283 --> 00:35:23.240
So this is a small animal
cooperative hunting network.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.560
Hunting partners help each
other out in tracking, digging

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.740
and searching for prey.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.060
They usually pool their catch.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.650
Again the same sort of colors
are indicating the kin groups.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.960
And it turns out that
women who are more generous

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.500
on average, but not those

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.370
who are the necessarily the best hunters

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.340
are more central in this
cooperation network,

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.740
meaning they have more partners

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.670
and they have more partners
who are also more generous.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.220
So this supports the hypothesis

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.220
that one of the main
reasons that women share

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.600
is to foster more
cooperative relationships

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.583
with other women.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.430
So this story of women's
hunting in desert Australia

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.220
gives us a much different picture

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:58.870
of the goals of hunting and
its associations with gender

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:01.210
than we've generally gotten
from another hunter-gatherers.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:05.510
It breaks a lot of our assumptions
about who hunts and why.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.920
Foraging women can be
efficient hunters and trackers,

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.810
and small animal hunting
can be just as productive

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:12.060
and more reliable than
large animal hunting.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.010
Women can even specialize on small animals

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.430
if it's reliable enough.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.060
Women can support a number of others

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.740
from their hunting
efforts, not just children,

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.710
and can engage with others as cooperative,

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:24.200
political and social agents
outside of the spousal union.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.620
Women could share meat outside
of their immediate families

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.930
and draw on those ties
created through meat sharing

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:31.090
to engage in other cooperative endeavors.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.360
Women can form divisions
of labor with other women

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.880
and in so doing,
collaboratively (babbles),

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.110
collaboratively both care
and provision dependence

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.280
with meat independently of men.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.010
So a model of the origins of human hunting

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:45.180
and sociality based on women's acquisition

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.910
and sharing of small animals, I think,

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:49.570
is at least as plausible, if not more so,

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:52.220
than models based on
men's hunting of big game

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:54.840
and women's dependence on
men's hunting production.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.792
Thank you.

00:36:55.792 --> 00:36:56.906
(audience applauds)

00:36:56.906 --> 00:36:59.570
- I do study chimpanzees in a savanna

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.810
and I'd like to tell you a
little bit more about that site

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.630
because it does have a
lot of importance as far

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.970
as the chimpanzees' hunting behavior goes.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:08.850
And this map I will show you,

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:12.360
most of the long-term
chimpanzee study sites

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.940
operating today, not all of them,

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:18.530
but these sites most of
them here have been ongoing

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.070
for at least 10 years and in some cases,

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.220
and the case of Gombe and
Mahale, more than 50 years.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.230
And so, most of you are probably
familiar with Jane Goodall

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:32.160
and at least the person,
but Gombe is the site

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.580
that she helped to establish
that Ian talked about.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:38.870
I'm across the continent
and I'm over in West Africa,

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:42.410
this is my site, the Fongoli study site.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:45.720
And I chose this site
because it is in a savanna

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.303
and we think that our lineage,

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.670
evolutionarily speaking
evolved in this type of habitat

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.760
and so I'll show you some
images from the site.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.050
My underlying questions have to do

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:01.910
with how these chimpanzees differ

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:03.670
from chimpanzees living in forests,

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.250
like the chimps we've heard about before

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.030
and in Goualougo and in Gombe.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:10.040
And I will cite Jim Moore here,

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.050
he's written a lot about using chimpanzees

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:13.690
as what we call a referential model

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:15.320
and that is comparing them

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.857
to chimpanzees living in a forested site.

00:38:17.857 --> 00:38:21.380
And the assumption is that the
environment will have effects

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.250
on their behavior.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.900
And I did think this going in,

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:26.210
I had ideas about what
the differences might be

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.320
and the chimps kind of went their own way

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.240
and showed me a lot more
differences, including hunting,

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.383
and so I'll talk to you about that today.

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:37.960
So though I'm going to talk
about three main questions

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.180
and I focus on the types of hunting

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.810
or aspects of the Fongoli
chimpanzees' hunting

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.610
that you don't necessarily
see at other sites

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.243
or that are very rare.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.350
And so one of the things
that we see here commonly

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:54.200
is that chimpanzees hunt with tools

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.200
and that's something that we
use to define our own species.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.210
It has been seen literally
a handful of times

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:02.180
at another site in Tanzania,

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:06.160
but at Fongoli chimpanzees
do this quite frequently

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.930
so we've seen hundreds of cases now

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.710
and I'll talk to you more about that.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.300
So one of the questions that I'll touch on

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.733
is why hunt with tools in
this particular habitat?

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:19.860
Something else that is not really common

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.210
at other chimpanzee sites is that in fact

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.210
in regarding this
particular type of hunting,

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:29.180
females are more frequently
going to be those hunting

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.640
with tools compared to males,

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.020
and as we heard that's just not the case

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.860
in most other chimpanzee study sites,

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.310
so I'll talk more about that.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.310
And then to follow up with David's talk,

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:44.240
I will talk about meat sharing
or I use the word sharing

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.660
and I'll talk about how I define that,

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.433
but I'll specifically talk
about how females dole out meat.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.020
And then finally I'll
come back to this idea

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.640
about using chimpanzees as a model

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.763
and what perhaps the Fongoli chimpanzees

00:39:59.763 --> 00:40:04.500
that I study can help us
say or think about in terms

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.803
of the evolution of early
hominin or bipedal ape hunting.

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:14.720
So these are some images
from my study site,

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.670
the Fongoli study site
is one of the hottest,

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:22.670
driest and most vegetatively
open sites that you see today

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.420
where chimpanzees have
actually been habituated

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.810
to human presence.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:29.440
So this took us quite a long
time, it took us four years.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:34.240
I started in 2001 and we
habituated males to our presence

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.310
by 2005, but I wasn't able to identify

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:40.380
all the chimpanzees in
the group until 2006.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.810
That's when we identified all the females,

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:46.250
this is a view of my
pretty fancy camp there.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:49.450
And hopefully that gives you
some idea of the vegetation.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.160
So it's a woodland savanna,

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.590
the dominant understory
is grass the savanna,

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:57.360
but you do have a large proportion

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.900
of the habitat as woodlands.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.380
Over half of the habitat is woodland

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.260
and only a very small portion is forest,

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.350
about 3% of the habitat is forest

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:08.540
and this is where you
find your water sources.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:11.360
This is really the chimpanzees'
most limiting resource

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.830
at Fongoli is water.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.690
Temperatures are incredibly hot,

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:17.040
really hot for me, even hot for chimps.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.580
So right now we're, well,
yeah, the month of March

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.830
in Senegal is almost approaching
the peak of the dry season

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:28.300
so temperatures are
regularly over 100 degrees.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.590
They may get up to 115 or so.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.710
During the rainy season or
at least at the beginning

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:35.400
of the rainy season, you find some relief

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.330
because the trees will
put out leaves again.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:39.810
They lose all their trees
during the dry season.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:42.270
But yet you have this lag,
you have hot temperatures

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.700
and then you have this high
humidity which is really fun.

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.010
And so, literally...
(audience laughing)

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:51.740
The heat index in June is around 120-125,

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.902
and that's when I take students out.

00:41:53.902 --> 00:41:57.500
(audience laughing)

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.903
So a little bit about
the Fongoli study group.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:02.410
Within this particular habitat

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:05.560
they have a very large
home range, 110 kilometers,

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.750
which is one of the largest,

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:10.070
if not the largest, so far described.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:12.070
The community size is relatively small,

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.530
it's not the smallest
chimpanzee community studied,

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:17.200
but it's on the small
size, around 35 chimps.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.080
And importantly we have
a sex ratio that is sort

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.900
of the opposite of what
you see at other sites.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.460
So we have more males than females,

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.660
that's usually not the case.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.330
And the data that I'm
gonna talk about today stem

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:33.683
from 2005 through 2017.

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.860
One other thing I'll say about adult males

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.700
versus adult females
is, because of the fact

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.500
that when I first got to Fongoli I heard

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.330
that even though chimpanzees
are not eaten at the site

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.990
and this is not within a national park,

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:48.460
this is outside of a national park

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.740
so you do have villages
in the area, anthropogenic

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:55.260
or human disturbance accounts
for about 5% of the habitat.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.730
You do have chimpanzees
living alongside people,

00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:58.960
they're not habituated to them,

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.790
they're habituated to us, so we're okay

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.320
but other people are not.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.070
But in rare cases you do have people

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.600
that will try to hunt a chimpanzee

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.250
in order to get a female's
infant for the pet trade

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:11.260
and we had that happen
one time in 17 years.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.760
And because of that,
I focus on adult males

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.560
as my focal subjects.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.270
The Fongoli community is often
together as one large group,

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:20.620
so I can collect data on females,

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:23.150
but they are more timid
when they're by themselves

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.120
and I don't try to follow them
when they're by themselves.

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.400
So I think I know a lot about
what is going on with males

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.830
and I know some about what
is going on with females

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.383
but perhaps not as much.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:38.090
So this pie chart gives you an idea

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:41.360
of the prey species consumed
by Fongoli chimpanzees both

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.580
by males and by females.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:47.850
And as Ian pointed out,
there are no colobus monkeys

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:49.090
in this particular habitat.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.050
So it is a savanna woodland habitat,

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:53.280
colobus monkeys don't occur here.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.080
Forest guenons like red-tailed monkeys

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.980
or other colobus monkeys, blue
monkeys do not occur here.

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:00.780
Instead you have savanna
species like baboons,

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.793
patas monkeys, vervets.

00:44:04.262 --> 00:44:06.660
You have mongooses,
bushbucks, things like this.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:08.020
And then on the very lower right,

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.940
you see that adorable little bush baby

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.700
and Ian introduced the galago as well.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.770
The galago is actually
the main prey species

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:19.150
of Fongoli chimpanzees,
both males and females,

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.980
and this is the animal
that they hunt with tools

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:24.270
and I'll actually hopefully
show you some video of that

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:26.680
and talk more about that.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.490
So the prey profile, if
you wanna call it that,

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:32.860
really reflects the
savanna type of habitat

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.230
and it does also support
as Ian pointed out

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.863
or talked about what is
called a risk-averse strategy.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.510
So I'm just going to show you some video

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:44.763
and try to narrate it here.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.440
So this is tool-assisted hunting.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.690
What this image is gonna show you

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:53.180
is an adult female
that's, if you can't tell,

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.180
that's Farafa, she's an older female.

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:57.240
We estimate her age to be around 40.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.353
She's one of the top female
hunters in the group.

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:04.470
So she's trying to get at these
adorable little bush babies

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:06.590
that try to sleep in
cavities during the day

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.330
until this rude chimpanzee
comes with the tool.

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:12.130
That's an adult male, that's Jumpkin,

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.583
and he goes about it a
little bit differently.

00:45:17.258 --> 00:45:20.258
(audience laughing)

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.750
And so, even though females
hunt with tools more

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:29.540
than expected, I'll talk a
little bit more about that next,

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.511
males do exhibit this type
of hunting behavior as well.

00:45:32.511 --> 00:45:35.410
(audience laughing)

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:37.211
I have to say he's
usually better than that.

00:45:37.211 --> 00:45:38.570
(audience laughing)

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.370
They just caught him on a bad day.

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:43.370
(audience laughing)

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:57.330
Well, we'll let Jumpkin try one more time.

00:46:01.378 --> 00:46:04.378
(audience laughing)

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.750
If you didn't guess he wasn't successful

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:13.292
in this particular bout.

00:46:13.292 --> 00:46:16.033
So we're looking at a lot of
different aspects of this.

00:46:16.033 --> 00:46:18.940
Well...
(audience laughing)

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.490
I almost feel bad showing that.

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.280
We're looking at a lot
of different aspects

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.950
of this particular behavior

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:28.280
and so this is a juvenile female, Vivian,

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.980
that was her mother that was hunting.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:33.230
And the juveniles start this behavior

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:34.660
when they're about two years of age,

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.770
when they're still infants and nursing,

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:39.363
but they don't learn really
the proper, you know,

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:41.980
tool length and that sort of thing

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.070
until they get to be about four.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:46.138
So she gets a little frustrated too.

00:46:46.138 --> 00:46:48.260
(audience laughing)

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.161
All right, enough fun, I guess.

00:46:51.161 --> 00:46:51.994
(clears throat)

00:46:51.994 --> 00:46:55.740
So, in terms of our results so far, um...

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.700
I apologize because in your
abstract I put over 500,

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:02.400
I was sure that we would
hit the 500 mark this year.

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.646
499, I just can't believe it.

00:47:04.646 --> 00:47:05.640
(audience laughs)

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.830
But we have 499 hunting records,

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:09.540
those aren't all successes

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.820
and that's including adults and immatures.

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.330
We've only seen adolescent
and adult individuals

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:17.040
successful in this type
of hunting behavior.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.050
Like I said, infants begin to exhibit it

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.870
and they do really good
as far as making the tool

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.620
but they don't make a proper tool

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:24.960
until they get to be a juvenile.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.160
So we see about 32 hunts
per year on average

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.090
when you take into account
that there are some days

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:31.610
that we can't be there,
the river's too high

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:32.870
or someone's sick.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:36.800
We think that they probably
hunt at least 50 times a year.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.570
And, again, our most
recent analysis suggest

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:42.220
that females do hunt
significantly more than expected

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.460
with tools, even though males also hunt.

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.610
And we did analysis taking into account

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:51.730
not only their membership
in the community as a whole

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:54.730
but also their membership
and so-called hunting parties

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:57.763
or parties that the chimpanzees
are in on those days.

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:00.260
So, I want to talk a little bit more

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.587
about just the hunters themselves,

00:48:03.587 --> 00:48:05.750
and this is a lot of color there,

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:09.500
but I wanted to show you the
top 10 hunters at Fongoli

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.660
and also the different types of foods

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.600
or prey that they hunt.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.120
And so, you have two
females that are actually

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.520
among the top 10 hunters at Fongoli.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.360
Interestingly, I think is
that both of those females,

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.010
females are very high-ranking.

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:27.000
So Tumbo there is currently
our alpha female based

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.990
on these very stylized pant grunt records,

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:33.010
sorry, vocalizations, and we keep records

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:35.410
of these vocalizations where
a subordinate individual

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:37.970
will pant, grunt to a dominant individual.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:40.900
And Tumbo actually overtook
that alpha position

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.480
from Farafa there about two years ago.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:48.440
And so, females actually do
hunt some in this community

00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.180
or at least enough to be considered

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.620
among the top 10 Fongoli hunters.

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:56.580
And also I'd like to point out
that we have a tie right now

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:59.130
for the very top hunter,
and one is the alpha male,

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:00.053
that's David.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:05.040
He is tied for the top
hunting position with Siberut

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:07.930
and some of you will be
happy to know that Siberut

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:11.100
who is pictured there is
not only the oldest hunter

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.580
in the group, he's oldest male,

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.023
but he's also the lowest
ranking male as well.

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:19.250
And then if you look at female
hunting behavior in general,

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:21.510
females, almost all females hunt

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.350
and almost all males hunt as well,

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:25.160
so they hunt about what you would expect

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.670
or at least their participation
in hunting overall

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:30.340
is what you would expect based
on their their membership

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.583
in the Fongoli community.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:38.480
I wanted to look, talk a little
bit about Fongoli hunting

00:49:40.772 --> 00:49:44.670
and the context of female
hunting across study sites.

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:46.160
So, Ian talked about that some

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.990
and I've used data from
his work and others

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:53.600
to look at Fongoli female
hunting and, in fact,

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.700
there are females
elsewhere that also engage

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.670
in quite a bit of hunting.

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.300
In fact, females at
Mahale hunt a little more

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.020
than females at Fongoli if you look

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:04.350
at Fongoli female
hunting behavior overall.

00:50:04.350 --> 00:50:06.260
And then when you look at tool use,

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.770
you see that Fongoli
females do hunt quite a bit,

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:12.070
almost half of the tool-assisted hunting

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:13.470
at Fongoli is by females.

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:17.490
And, again, remember that we
have fewer females at Fongoli,

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:20.690
we don't follow females
systematically like we do males.

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:23.920
And so one question as to why females hunt

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.503
is basically as David started out with,

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.810
you know, it's probably no surprise

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:32.750
that the chimps gained a lot
of nutrition from hunting,

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.350
but I think perhaps a
more interesting question

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:38.060
is why females don't
hunt more at other sites.

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:40.990
And Ian talked about some
of these issues as well

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:43.510
that I'll pursue right now.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:46.143
And so, if you looked
at for example theft,

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:49.960
there's not a lot of theft at Fongoli,

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.790
so when I use the word share
I'm referring to, basically,

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.740
the last three categories I
think that David talked about.

00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:00.470
So active food transfer
but not theft, right,

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:02.440
and passive food transfer, et cetera.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.150
So I consider theft to
be a different category

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.360
and at Fongoli you have very little theft.

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.370
The only thought we've seen involves

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.420
two different alpha males,
so very little theft.

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.000
Whereas at other sites you
do have quite a bit of theft

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.913
and so I believe, as Ian said,

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.750
females don't have incentive
to hunt at some sites.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:26.040
At Fongoli there definitely is incentive

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:30.750
and not only females, but this
is a little video of, again,

00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:32.660
that lower-ranking male.

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.810
So out of 13 males he's number 13.

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:36.850
He's the oldest male, that's Siberut.

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:39.960
So he's walking by a number of adult males

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.360
with this bushbuck fawn that he's captured

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:46.090
and no one makes any
attempt to take it from him.

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.590
He had actually been eating
on that fawn for over an hour

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:50.740
and he had a number of
individuals sitting around

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.350
basically begging, he
didn't share with them.

00:51:53.350 --> 00:51:55.050
And as he moves off you'll see

00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:57.640
that there's another older
male that will follow him

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.333
and this is his ally, Bandit.

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:06.080
Where's Bandit?

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.800
There he is.

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.690
Calmly following his buddy Siberut out.

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:12.830
And so, he did end up sharing with Bandit.

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:17.830
So not only do you see
some sort of concept...

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:20.230
Well, I hate to say concept of ownership

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:21.130
but you see tolerance.

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:24.740
So tolerance of possession of prey, uh...

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:28.020
By dominant males of these
low ranking individuals,

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.050
females and also lower ranking males.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.030
So I think that at
Fongoli you actually have

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:33.030
the incentive to hunt.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:35.880
It's one of the reasons that
you see so much hunting,

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.253
at least tool-assisted hunting in females.

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.010
I wanna show it a slightly different way.

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:43.540
So, these are the same top 10 hunters,

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:47.100
but rather than being
expressed in the number of prey

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:50.160
that they brought in, this
is the number of kilograms

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.660
or estimated kilograms of meat, right?

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:54.800
And so, you see that David has jumped up

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.540
to number one position there.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.000
It depends on what you hunt

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.850
and almost everybody hunts
bush babies except K.L.,

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:02.830
we've never seen him capture a bush baby.

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:04.380
But what's interesting is you see

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.400
that the third top hunter there,

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.760
at least in terms of prey captures, Lupin,

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.250
has fallen quite low because he does seem

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:13.870
to specialize on bush babies.

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:15.950
So the females really didn't
change positions at all,

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:17.610
they're still in the top 10,

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:19.440
but you do see a lot of variation.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.470
So that's something that
we're looking at now,

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.630
and so, I wanted to talk just a little bit

00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:26.670
about what females can provide

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:29.853
in terms of transfer or sharing.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.040
And we...

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:37.150
So far this is still
preliminary to some degree.

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:39.910
We've looked at sharing or
food transfer by females,

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:42.650
and again I'm considering
David's categories

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:44.780
of active transfer, passive transfer

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.360
and scrounging but tolerated scrounging,

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.210
and I'm not considering
a theft in this category.

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:53.750
Females actually shared
with other individuals

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:55.660
more often they did with their offspring.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:59.110
So that's something that
we're exploring right now.

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:03.020
And, basically, I would
argue that females,

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:07.960
as Rebecca has pointed out,
should be considered as well.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.390
And, finally, I'll just
move on to my last slide

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:13.040
and leave you with a couple of thoughts.

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.880
First of all, I think
Travis Pickering said it

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.530
probably better than I can.

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:20.920
So, he actually thinks that if you...

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.940
Think about the tool-assisted
hunting at Fongoli,

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.960
it perhaps can tell us more about some

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:28.640
of the early hominin hunting
that went on compared

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.550
to the emotionally-charged
hunting of chimpanzees,

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:34.030
as he puts it.

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:36.290
And I'll just end up by saying,

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:39.890
echoing what Rebecca has said
as well about female humans,

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:42.890
is that just now, and I
think Richard mentioned this

00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:44.440
as well, we're beginning
to understand more

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.180
about female chimpanzee hunting,

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:50.000
and that they also play
a part in this scenario.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.265
So, thank you very much.

00:54:52.265 --> 00:54:54.693
(audience applauding)

00:54:54.693 --> 00:54:57.360
(uptempo music)
