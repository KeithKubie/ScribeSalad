00:00:02.742 --> 00:00:03.825
SPEAKER 1: Hello everyone.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:04.385
SPEAKER 2: Hi.

00:00:04.385 --> 00:00:06.509
SPEAKER 3: Today's episode
is all about good times.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.840
SPEAKER 4: First thing,
you need a Google account.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.625
If you don't have one,
that's easy to fix.

00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:12.140
SPEAKER 5: Doing
so will reward you

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.640
with a plethora of colors
and bars on your device.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.995
SPEAKER 3: Engaging users
in an immersive, enjoyable

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:17.495
experience.

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:19.970
SPEAKER 2: To help you make
your graphics look their best.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.520
SPEAKER 6: That
kind of intelligence

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.954
will be built
inside the software.

00:00:22.954 --> 00:00:24.370
SPEAKER 7: Our
team here at Google

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.790
works closely with
app developers.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.267
SPEAKER 8: What
kind of challenges

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:29.100
do you see developers
facing and what are we

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.475
doing to make
their lives easier?

00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:32.634
SPEAKER 9: Great apps
engage all learners.

00:00:32.634 --> 00:00:34.300
And so we did a very
simple web app that

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.642
lets you type in your address
and the age of your kid,

00:00:36.642 --> 00:00:38.100
and it would tell
you which schools

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.205
you were eligible to attend.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.163
SPEAKER 10: So you can
think of today's episode

00:00:41.163 --> 00:00:42.550
as a little bit of extra credit.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.462
SPEAKER 2: So how
does this help you?

00:00:44.462 --> 00:00:45.670
SPEAKER 4: Let's take a look.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.400
SPEAKER 3: Look.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.460
That dinner reservation
is on my Google calendar

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.210
so I don't forget.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.140
SPEAKER 11: These are things
that you can worry less about.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200
SPEAKER 9: But with a
fundamental understanding

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.975
of how the digital world works.

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:57.530
SPEAKER 3: Highlighting
what matters most to users.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.270
SPEAKER 10: But I want to
show you something here.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.728
SPEAKER 4: What if
I told you I was

00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:03.520
going to do it without using a
database or a back-end server?

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.019
SPEAKER 8: Sounds
like a lot of fun.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.946
SPEAKER 10: Whoa.

00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:09.036
SPEAKER 5: This is the
type of technical minutia

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:09.910
that's worth knowing.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.830
SPEAKER 9: They've
never before realized

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.870
how important geeks are.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.254
SPEAKER 8: One billion active.

00:01:16.254 --> 00:01:16.920
SPEAKER 11: Yes.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.660
SPEAKER 9: And you'll end up
with a community of people

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.557
that you really enjoy
and feeling really

00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:22.640
good about the work that
you guys can do together.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.389
SPEAKER 3: Well, these
are just some ideas

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:26.980
of how to take good experiences
and making them great.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.785
SPEAKER 4: So now we're done.

00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:31.600
SPEAKER 5: Don't forget to join
our Google+ community as well.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.175
SPEAKER 6: And make
software more intelligent.

00:01:33.175 --> 00:01:34.960
SPEAKER 3: And Google
takes care of the rest.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.251
SPEAKER 4: Thanks for watching.

00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:39.950
SPEAKER 3: Hope we get an
opportunity to serve you again.
