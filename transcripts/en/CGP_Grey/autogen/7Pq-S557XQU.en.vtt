00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.990
 Humans used hunting or gathering to survive. But humans are cleverly lazy 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.680
 We have made tools to facilitate our work. From the sticks to the plows to the tractors and the shift from the position 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.210
 Everyone needs to produce food to the current agriculture without almost anyone needing to produce 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.400
 Food and yet we have abundance 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.080
 And of course this is not only in agriculture, but everything we have spent thousands of years 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.580
 We make tools to reduce physical effort of all kinds. These muscles are mechanical 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.140
 Stronger, more dependable, and less tired than human muscles can be 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.660
 This is good. Replacing human effort with mechanical muscles saves human time for specialization. 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 This leaves everyone better off, even those who are still physically active. So grow 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.610
 The economy is improving and living standards are improving 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.230
 Some people specialize in being programmers and engineers. Their job is to build minds 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.120
 Mechanical. As mechanical muscles reduced the demand for human effort, just like mechanical brains 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.100
 Reduce demand on human minds 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.809
 This is an economic revolution. You may think we've gone through this situation before but we have not 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.499
 This is a different situation 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:07.130
 # Human effort # 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.619
 When you think of automation, you often think about it: massive, specially crafted robots 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.450
 Expensive but very stupid, ignorant of the world and about her work. It was a scary type 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.450
 Of automation but did not seize the world for it 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.310
 Cost-effective in a few cases 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.289
 But the old kind of automation, this is the modern type 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:28.319
 I offer you Baxter 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.200
 In contrast to these things that need skilled operators and technicians and millions 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.039
 Of dollars. Baxter can see and can learn what you want to do by watching and doing 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.579
 It costs less than the average annual wage of a human worker. Unlike his brothers 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.649
 Adults do not have pre-programmed for one job, can do any work under 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.399
 Good. Baxter can be thought of as a general-purpose robot 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.579
 Being for the general purpose is important. 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.849
 Think of computers, also began to be specially manufactured and very expensive, but when they appeared 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:02.749
 The relatively cheap calculus became necessary for everything quickly 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:07.429
 A general purpose computer can easily calculate the change or identify seats on the plane 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:13.180
 Play a game or do anything just by changing its programs. This is a strong demand for computers 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.170
 Of all types is what makes it the strongest and cheapest every year 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.320
 Baxter today is like a computer in the eighties. It is not the summit, but the beginning 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.960
 Despite Baxter's slow hourly cost of electricity consumption of pennies while his human rivals 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.770
 They charge the minimum wage. Ten speed is cost effective when it costs 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.610
 One hundred times less. And while Baxter is not smart some things 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.600
 Which we will talk about is clever enough to take on a lot of skill-less jobs 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.290
 We have already seen less intelligent robots from Baxter replacing jobs. In modern stores 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.540
 What was a job occupied by 30 people is occupied by one person watching 30 robotic treasurer 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.820
 Or a hundred thousand barista workers in the world will bring robot Barista to them 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.960
 Of course, the barista you know makes the moka double whatever you like and you will never trust anyone 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.260
 Another, but millions of people do not care and just want a good cup of coffee. By the way 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.300
 This robot is actually a huge network you remember 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.040
 And how you like your coffee wherever you are. Very comfortable order 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.650
 We think of technological progress as modern, exciting and expensive, but real change is happening 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.360
 When the things of the last decade become cheaper and faster. This is what happens now to robots 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.230
 And the ability of their mechanical minds to make decisions wins in competition with 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.730
 Humans to function in a way can not muscle. Pure human competition with it 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.670
 # Horsepower # 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.180
 Imagine a pair of horses in the early 20th century talking about technology. One of them worries that 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.170
 These modern mechanical muscles will make horses unnecessary 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.420
 The other reminds us that every technological development so far extends their lives "I remember all that work 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.210
 On the farm? Remember the enemy from the beach to the beach to deliver mail? Do you remember going to battle? 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.930
 They are all ugly. These jobs in the city are very convenient "and with the presence of all these people in the city has become 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.400
 There are more jobs for horses than before 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.840
 Even if this thing is called a car may say there will be new jobs for horses 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.680
 We can not imagine it 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.240
 But you, my dear viewers of the years after 2000 know what happened, there are still many working horses 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.650
 But not as before. Census of horses reached its peak in 1915 and since then 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.650
 Continue to decrease 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.900
 There is no rule in the economy that states that the best technology offers newer and better jobs 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.599
 For horses. This sentence sounds so dumb, but if we replace the word horses with humans 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.389
 Suddenly people think it is a correct sentence 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.460
 Just as mechanical muscles have replaced the place of horses in the economy will do mechanical minds 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.099
 The same for humans. Not immediately and not everywhere but in very large numbers and soon enough 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.099
 So much so that it will become a big problem if we do not prepare. And we are not ready 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.099
 Like a second horse, you may consider putting technology up now and you think it is not possible 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.310
 To replace your job but technology is getting better and cheaper and faster than you can not 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.289
 Living organisms compete with it 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.520
 Just as the car was the beginning of the end for the horses now the car was strewn 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.710
 This is what will come from things 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.999
 #the cars# 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:05.999
 The cars that drive themselves are not the future but are now working. These cars moved 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.419
 Two hundred thousand miles on the coast of California during the cities 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.199
 And all this without driver intervention 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.870
 The question is not "Will they replace cars?" But no matter how fast they change, they do not need to be excellent 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.580
 They only need to be better than us. Incidentally kills 40,000 human error each 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.979
 General in the United States only. Because the cars that drive themselves do not blink 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.960
 Do not send phone messages as they drive, do not sleep or do dumb things easy to see them become more efficient than 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.779
 From humans it is already so 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:39.150
 But naming cars that drive themselves as cars is like naming the initial cars horses 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.090
 Mechanical. Horse cars outperform everything in such a way that the use of the word horses limits 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.710
 Of your thinking about what you can do. To call cars that lead themselves to what they are 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.289
 :on him 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.129
 Auto: "The solution to the problem of connecting things from point A to point B is" traditional cars happen to be suitable for size 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.669
 Humans for human transport But small autos can operate in warehouses and the giant Otto can 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.539
 To work in open mines. Who knows how much function depends on the transfer of things but sector 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.319
 Transportation in the United States employs about three million individuals and an inductive estimate of at least 70 million 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.469
 Function in the world 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:15.270
 These jobs will disappear 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.370
 The usual view is that unions will prevent them, but history is full of workers 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.870
 They fought the technology that later replaced them and the workers lost each time. The economy wins 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:30.389
 There are always great incentives in various industries to adopt the auto 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.749
 For many transport companies, humans have about a third of their total costs. This cost 

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:39.439
 Are only wages. Sleeping in long trucks costs time and money 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:44.069
 Costs cost money, negligence costs money and if you think that insurance companies will oppose 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:48.689
 This change, you are wrong, for them the excellent driver is the one who pays their small premium and does not cause 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:50.099
 .accidents 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:54.110
 Autos are coming and is the first place where most people will see 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.490
 Robots change society. But this change occurs in many economic places 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.860
 But it is not visible 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.830
 As with the Otto, it will happen with everything 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.929
 # What will come from things # 

00:07:04.929 --> 00:07:06.580
 ##Office Posts ## 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.740
 It is easy to look at the Otto and Baxter and think that as long as the technology has gotten rid of 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.400
 One of the few jobs is to rely on the skill that people do not want to do. They will increase specialization and work 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.900
 More jobs depending on higher education, as they have always done 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.580
 Even if we ignore the disaster of imposing higher education on another hundred million people 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.009
 Office work is not safe if your job is to sit in front of a screen 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:31.110
 Writing and clicking (just as it is supposed to do now) robots will come 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.539
 You too, my dear 

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:37.599
 The software robots are more concrete, faster and much cheaper than physical robots 

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:41.960
 And because office functions (from a corporate perspective) are more expensive and more 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.129
 The motivation to automate their work is even greater 

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:51.009
 This is the function of automation engineers. These are skilled programmers and their job 

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:54.759
 The whole thing is to replace your job with a software robot 

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.939
 You might think that the smartest translation engineer in the world can not make a robot to do 

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:03.669
 (And you may be right) but the level of progress in programming is not smart programmers 

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:08.589
 They program robots, but smart programmers program robots to teach themselves how to 

00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:11.749
 Things that the programmer can not know 

00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:15.529
 How this happens outside of this video but the bottom line is that 

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:20.249
 There are limited ways to teach robots how things work. But if a robot is offered a quantity of things that are made correctly 

00:08:20.249 --> 00:08:23.969
 He can find out how to do the job 

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:28.099
 Even with a goal only and no example of how to reach this goal robots can learn. If we take 

00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:33.680
 The bourse (which in many ways is no longer a function for humans) is often robots that have taught themselves 

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.150
 To trade shares with other robots taught themselves 

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:37.780
 For the second time: these are not robots carrying out orders according to what a human router wants 

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:38.280
 They are robots that decide what to buy and what to sell on their own 

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.039
 As a result, the New York Stock Exchange is no longer full of stock traders 

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.780
 They do their daily work it's a great TV studio 

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.970
 So robots learned the market and also learned to write. If you've just grabbed a newspaper 

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.240
 I often read a news story written by a robot 

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.940
 Learn robots to write anything: sports articles, test reports, procedure specifications, and even quarter reports 

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.730
 The year you write in your work 

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.680
 Paperwork, decision-making and writing Many human work is in this box 

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:09.510
 The demand for human mental work in these fields is about to decline, but of course the professions 

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.450
 You're safe from robots, are not you? 

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.650
 # Professions # 

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.890
 When you think about the legal profession it is easy to imagine trials. But the majority of the lawyer's work 

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.380
 "Drafting legal documents and anticipating the possible outcome and impact of judicial proceedings and so-called" discovery 

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.730
 And in which the office of the lawyer gives boxes of papers and on it 

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.610
 To find a repetitive pattern or find a transformation not in a locality in all the papers 

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:38.700
 This can become a robot function. Special discovery is not a human function in many law firms already 

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.420
 Not because there are no papers to investigate, there is more to it than ever, but because 

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.720
 Smart search robots scan millions of emails, notes, and accounts within hours 

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.750
 And not weeks, to defeat their human competitors not only by cost and time but by the most important 

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:56.890
 .Precision. Robots do not feel sleepy while reading millions of messages 

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.340
 But these are just simple things: I have a robot company called Watson. Maybe I saw him on television 

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.590
 Jeopardy is crushing his human rivals in a program but this was a side-project of entertainment for him 

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.810
 Watson's daily mission is to be the best doctor in the world to understand what people are saying in their words 

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.250
 And gives them accurate diagnoses. And already does so in the center 

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.710
 Where he advises on Slone-Kettering lung cancer treatments 

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.700
 Just as with Otto they do not need to be excellent, just need to make mistakes less than humans 

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.930
 As with a doctor robot 

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.100
 Human physicians are by no means excellent, as the frequency and severity of cases of diagnosis are poor 

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.240
 Terrifying, and severely incapacitated human physicians in dealing with the complex medical record 

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.940
 Of the patient. Understand the effect of each drug and its interaction with each drug 

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.940
 The last thing is beyond the scope of human knowledge 

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.450
 Especially when there are research robots whose full function is to test thousands of properties 

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.030
 At the same time 

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.200
 Physicians can improve through their expertise. Doctors can learn from doctors 

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.930
 The experiences of each robot and other doctor read the latest medical research and follow up everything that happens 

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.190
 To all their patients around the world and to find connections from 

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.760
 It is impossible to deduce in another way 

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.350
 Not all doctors will disappear, but when the comparison between robots, doctors and human beings, 

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.850
 Keep in mind that you can access them through your phone 

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.370
 So the professionals, the office workers and the low-skilled workers are worried 

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.180
 .from him 

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:21.620
 But perhaps you are not worried because you are a unique creator but 

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.910
 Let me tell you, you are not so unique 

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.190
 # Creative work # 

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:32.840
 Creativity may seem magical, but it is not. The mind is a complex machine, perhaps 

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.930
 The most complicated machines in the whole universe, but that did not stop us from trying 

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.220
 His mimics 

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.050
 There is a theory that just as mechanical muscles allowed us to move to mental work 

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.410
 Mechanical minds will allow us to move on to creative work. But even if we assume 

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:51.270
 That the human mind is magically creative (though not), but for the purpose of discussion we will assume that 

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.940
 Creativity is not what most jobs depend on. Represents the number of writers and poets 

00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:00.630
 Directors, actors and artists who rely on these jobs a small percentage 

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:04.550
 Very strong workforce. And because these functions depend 

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.610
 On the grassroots, will always represent a small proportion of the population 

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.800
 There is nothing to claim economics of poems and paintings 

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.270
 And by the way, this musician with the background you hear now is a robot 

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.310
 She can write Emily Howell's number of endless pieces 

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.700
 All day and free. People can not distinguish between them and human authors when they are done 

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.010
 Test them 

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:32.120
 The talk of artificial creativity turns to strange talk quickly ... what is the meaning of this term originally 

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.800
 And yet it is a growing field 

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.390
 People thought that playing chess was a unique creative skill for humans and could not 

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:44.290
 To do it correctly until they beat our best. This will be the case for every human talent 

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.040
 #Conclusion# 

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.220
 Well, this may be too much to absorb and may want to reject. It is 

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.610
 Easy to mop up endless and foolish expectations for the future will not be. Therefore 

00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.200
 It is necessary to stress again: this is not the creation of science fiction, these robots 

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:05.530
 here right now. There is an awful amount of automation in the laboratories and warehouses 

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.470
 around the world 

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.950
 We have been through economic revolutions before. But the robots' revolution is different 

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.990
 Horses are not idle now because they have become lazy as sex, they are not suitable for work 

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.440
 There is little work the horse can do to pay for his home and food 

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.620
 Many smart and capable people will find themselves in the horse's shop: they do not work 

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.220
 Without committing a sin 

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:33.010
 And if you still think that modern jobs will save us, you have to look at a final point 

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:38.620
 In 1776, the United States Statistics Office collected data on a small number of jobs. Now there are hundreds 

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.870
 But the modern ones do not represent a large proportion of the workforce 

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.880
 This list of jobs is ranked in descending order according to the number of people who perform it, and it is a list that comes up 

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.370
 The mind and the transport sector in the first place and examining the rest of the list, we find that all these works existed 

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:58.450
 In one form or another a hundred years ago and nearly all are easy targets for automation. Just 

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.660
 When we reach number 33 in this list we finally find something new 

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.340
 Do not think that every barista and office employee should lose his job before a problem arises 

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.010
 Where the unemployment rate during the Great Depression was 25% 

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:17.010
 While the previous list represents 45% of the workforce. What we talked about today only, what works efficiently 

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:22.520
 He can pay unemployment above this figure in the near future and because even in 

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:28.210
 In our technological world, modern jobs do not represent a small percentage of the economy 

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.990
 This is a big problem 

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.870
 This video is not about the ugliness of automation, but its inevitability 

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.960
 It is a way to create abundance with little effort. We must start planning from now on what we do 

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.130
 When a large proportion of the population becomes unfit for work, without committing a sin 

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:49.220
 , What we will do in a future where for most jobs people will not progress
