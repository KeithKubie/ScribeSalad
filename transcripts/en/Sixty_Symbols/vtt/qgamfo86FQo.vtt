00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
I thought I would talk about the very strange cloud formation in this rather beautiful picture

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.500
taken on the Norfolk coast a week or so back.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500
Their technical name amongst cloud people is they call fluctus clouds.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.700
Amongst physicists, they're called Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds and the reason why they called Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.800
is they illustrate a phenomenon called the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability -

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.880
discovered by Lord Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz in the mid 19th century.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.360
[Brady]: I'm going to call them hook clouds.
[Professor Merrifield]: Okay, cool.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.580
Kind of like breaking waves, maybe?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.500
I mean, you're right, they tilt over. It turns out it's a very common phenomenon.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.070
I mean you see it in clouds from time to time,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.959
but actually it's the same physics that if you have wind blowing over water.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.919
It's why you get ripples appearing in the surface of the water, you see these kind of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.860
in the cloud patterns on Jupiter,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.340
on the sun.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.240
If you have a jet of material coming out of the center of a galaxy and it starts to wiggle around, that's probably this Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as well.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.540
It's basically wherever you have two streams of material traveling at different speeds, this instability will kick in.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.439
Let me draw you a picture. Two streams of stuff, and they're just traveling at different speeds

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.880
but just for simplicity we'll start one going that way and one going that way.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.489
It could be one still and the other moving but they just have to be moving relative to each other.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.360
Instability is something where if something starts to grow it will continue to grow.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.830
If you start with a little perturbation it just becomes a bigger and bigger and bigger perturbation.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.119
And it turns out there is this thing called the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which will kick in in this case.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.540
So let me draw the same thing again, but with just the beginnings of kind of an instability in the middles.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.860
It's tiny, I mean it can be very very small,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.860
It's just a question of you know will it go away again, in which case nothing happens;

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.420
or will it keep growing and growing growing, in which case it's interesting.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.120
So what happens in this case is if you look at the air flowing here,

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.719
you can see it's the same kind of volume of air is moving all the way along here, but you can see here

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.840
its passage gets a little bit constricted. There it gets wider, there it's constricted again.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.720
In the place where it's constricted, in order to get the same amount of air through, it has to go faster.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.320
Okay, so the air flow here becomes faster

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.160
to get through and actually here, there's more space for the air flow below it, becomes slower.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.400
Doesn't have to go so fast.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.409
The material traveling over the top of this bump here is actually traveling faster than the material below

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.860
and there's this effect, this thing called the Bernoulli effect.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.179
It's the same thing that makes aeroplanes wings have lift,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.929
which is where air is traveling faster and it is decreasing the pressure.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.070
That's why with an aerofoil, with the air going over the top of it, the air travels further

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.130
and therefore it travels faster and therefore the pressure decreases and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.700
that causes the wing to go up. So we have the same phenomenon here. We have lift.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.980
Like that the air here is traveling faster than the air here which means the pressure here goes down

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.940
So the net effect of that is that then this bit gets tugged up because the pressure above it is lower and pressure below it is higher.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.329
And similarly down here is a decrease in pressure here and that means that this pulled that way.

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.209
So you can see that what was a little ripple here is now starting to grow, and then the last thing that happens is

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.259
as this thing grows across it's going to get kind of swept along by the air flowing this way,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.700
so it likely end up being curled over that way.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.980
That's the phenomenon you see in these clouds. The little things started to grow out there it grew bigger

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.920
and then it got caught up in the flow above and got pushed over that way.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.920
And so those little kind of horse head shapes that appear here are basically this Kelvin-Helmholtz instability,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.660
of the instability first growing upwards and then getting pushed along with the airflow above.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.580
[Brady]: Horse head clouds, that's an even better name.
[Professor Merirfield]: That's nice, yes.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.580
So there it is, the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability.

And we have another Sixty Symbols video about stripey clouds this time,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:23.620
or to really complete your cloud fix, why not check out this Objectivity video about the so-called Father of Cloud Studies.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.240
There's a guy you'd wanna meet. A cloud resembling a lock of hair or a feather

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
Yeah. Okay
