00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.390
OK, let’s be honest, guys.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.570
When’s the last time you washed your pants?

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.620
Just think about it.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.270
Hey clothes-wearers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.730
Some of us wash our clothes twice a week,
some of us wash them...well, let’s just

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.830
say I wash them less.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.140
But is that bad?

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.740
What health risk could there possibly be from
wearing that T-shirt for the 20th time?

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.160
Well, human skin sheds around 500 million
skin cells a day.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.510
Add in all the dirt, sweat and oil that builds
up on our skin, and you’ve got yourself

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.350
a hotbed for bacteria to breed and multiply.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.820
But not all of these are bad.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.760
In fact, normal human skin is covered in hundreds
of microbes -- including bacteria that may

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.499
help protect you from diseases.

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:53.260
But there are some harmful bacteria that could
get onto your clothes.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.149
A professor at London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine found that many pathogens

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.030
can remain on the surface of fabrics for long
periods, depending on the strain and the viability

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.260
of the fabric itself.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.110
E. coli , for example, can remain on fabrics
for hours.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.500
Salmonella can last up to 24 weeks on fabric,
and strains of fungi for several weeks as

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.500
well.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.910
And Staphylococcus, which causes staph infections,
has been found to survive for weeks or even

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.910
months.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.190
And, one of the most common causes of skin
infection, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.720
aureus (or MRSA), can be easily transferred
from our skin to our clothes and towels and

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.690
spread by sharing them.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.130
Another offender is our dirty underwear.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.750
The average undergarment harbors a tenth of
a gram of fecal matter, which can carry a

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.420
number of viruses and bacteria such as hepatitis
A, norovirus, salmonella and E. coli.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.170
I'm sure you're starting the washing machine
right now, and maybe you should.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.660
Because according to the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, again, bacteria

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.090
begin to multiply the longer you wear your
clothes without washing, and if you give them

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.920
enough time to build up, even your washing
machine will have a hard time removing them.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.470
The thing is, scientific studies on how often
you should wash clothing are thin on the ground,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.670
with many being funded by corporations with
a vested interest in the outcome.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.899
For example, a study done by a University
of Arizona researcher was paid for by Clorox

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.180
bleach, found bacteria from your laundry might
spread through the washing machine during

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.480
cleaning and end up on future loads.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.010
And another study done by the same researcher
in 2007 (likely funded by Clorox) found 92

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.620
to 99% of viruses were killed, but recommended
bleaching your machine anyway.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.000
However, the CDC in the US and the National
Health Services in England both recommends

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.500
using simple heat.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.359
The NHS says to use water at a temperature
of 60 C (140 F) to kill bacteria -- that would

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.209
be the HOT setting.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.329
And they suggest running the washing machine
empty or with chemical disinfectant once a

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.160
week to decontaminate it.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.470
And the CDC says to dry on hot for a long
while to ensure some sterilization.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.810
More heat is better, but they also realize
that can be a fire hazard.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.540
So, Philip Tierno from the New York University
School of Medicine says that while cooler

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.069
temperatures could keep the bacteria living
in the washing machine, drying clothes in

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.980
the sun, can kill bacteria with ultraviolet
radiation!

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.620
So, there are options, if you're worried!

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.549
Although there could be a risk of infection
with dirty laundry in your home, the International

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.010
Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene says that
the risks are probably less than if you touch

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.959
a solid surface, a food, or have direct contact
with someone else’s skin.

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.579
This is because pathogens can survive better
on hard surfaces than they can on fabric,

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.870
and because while we constantly touch the
same hard surfaces like door handles, we don’t

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.720
all touch each other’s clothing.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.379
. Still, if you can’t remember the last
time your tshirt saw the inside of a washing

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.400
machine, maybe it’s time to get on that.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.030
Do you guys have a science question about
stuff around your house?

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.129

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.989
video about why we even smell in the first
place.

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.019
Cause, where else are your clothes gonna get
that stank?
