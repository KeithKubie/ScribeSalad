00:00:02.825 --> 00:00:05.885
Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta and this

00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:08.825
Is Crash Course Theater and this is

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:09.825
Yorick.

00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:11.185
More on him later.

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:12.620
(Crash Course theme plays)

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.640
(theme fades)

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.940
So maybe you're a part of your school theater program,

00:00:22.945 --> 00:00:26.025
Maybe you're a Broadway musical devotee, maybe you've just been waiting for a

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.795
Series that would explain things like, what are are these

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.995
Phalluses doing in Greek drama? And

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:35.315
Who thought neoclassicism was a good idea?

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:39.155
And the Theatre of Cruelty, why so mean?

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:42.235
If that's the show that you're after then great, have a seat.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.380
We've explored several plays in Crash Course Literature,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.535
Mostly Greek tragedies and Shakespearean

00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:50.535
Tragedies, and we'll be looking at plays in Crash Course Theater,

00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:53.185
But we'll be doing a lot more than that too. We'll

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:56.235
Explore theater's history, its theories, and even

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:59.005
Its performance technologies, from the Greeks

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.765
Right into the modern era. Thunder sheets, fog

00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:04.565
Machines, rotating gobos. Because reading a

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:07.675
Play is great but if you've attended live theater then

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:10.695
You know that it's a different and pretty extraordinary

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.615
Experience to see that play performed right

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.600
In front of you. We're going to investigate how that experience

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.465
Is produced and what it's meant throughout history

00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:22.355
To theater going audiences. Theater going at

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:25.195
Least when they aren't running off to go see rope dancers, or

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:28.205
Consorting with prostitutes, or heading out to grab a beer and a chicken

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:31.165
Leg. Audiences are tricky but we say it's worth

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:33.340
Staying in your seat. Why?

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.240
Because theater is the art form most like life.

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:39.265
It's performed by real people, in

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.295
Real space, in real time, and it's often a way

00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:45.745
To work out our ideas about the social conflicts

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:48.545
And problems of the day. Theater

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:51.300
Is a laboratory for life.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.540
Plays explore how people feel about government, and religion, and birth

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.800
And death, and love, and each other. And sometimes

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.860
They explore how it's funny to put on a wig and tell lewd jokes. So really just

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.380
Something for everyone. And oh, just so you know,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600
I won't be teaching you how to act, or direct, or write

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.835
Plays, or hang lights, or...

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.060
Sew phalluses onto costumes.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.395
Not because I don't love making theater, I actually--I've been making

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:16.735
Theater since I was a kid and before YouTube

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.720
I was actually a full-time professional

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.775
Theater artist making multimedia performance art in New York.

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:23.505
And I still do that stuff occasionally don't worry

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:26.655
I'll invite you to my one man show. So it's not like we don't find the

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:29.655
Nuts and bolts of theater exciting, quite the opposite.

00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:32.495
But here we're mostly concerned with

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.160
Theater's history, technology, and its

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.000
Cultural significance on the whole. I'll tell you about

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:40.615
Greek tragedy, and Roman comedy, and

00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:42.565
Classical Japanese theater, and how

00:02:42.565 --> 00:02:45.485
Theater returns to the west because of one Nun.

00:02:45.485 --> 00:02:48.165
We'll see cycle plays, and passion plays,

00:02:48.165 --> 00:02:51.135
And commedia dell'arte, and Shakespeare obviously, but also

00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:54.125
Renaissance writers other than Shakespeare. We'll cover really long

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:56.975
French plays, and shorter Spanish ones, and classical Indian drama,

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.760
And melodrama, and symbolism, and dadaism, and expressionism

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.020
And futurism, and all the -isms!

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.700
Well some of the -isms. A very reasonable number of 
-isms.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.300
And I promise at least one mention

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.760
Of Hamilton. Until then, exit Mike Rugnetta,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.540
And I mean could we end a theater show any way

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.520
Other than, curtain!

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.080
(Crash Course outro plays)

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.720
