00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.910
The graph below shows the
percentage of American adults

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.580
who smoke over time.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.170
Assuming the trend
shown in the data

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.440
has been consistent
since 1945, use the graph

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.570
to estimate the percentage
of American adults

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.980
who smoked in 1945.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.640
So let's see what's
going on here.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.946
The horizontal axis here,
they say years since 1965.

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:23.320
So at this point
right over here,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.680
this is 0 years since 1965.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.330
So this really represents 1965.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.030
And we see it
looks like around--

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.750
let's see, if I
were to eyeball it,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.567
it looks like it's around 42%
of Americans, just looking

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:36.150
at this graph.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.170
I know that's not
an exact number.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.910
Roughly 41% or 42% of
Americans smoked in 1965

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.250
based on this graph.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.910
And then five years
later, this would be 1970.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.010
10 years later,
that would be 1975.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.150
And they don't sample
the data, or we

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.120
don't have data from
every given year.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.662
This is just from some of the
years that we happen to have.

00:00:59.662 --> 00:01:01.120
But what is clear,
it looks like we

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.400
have a negative linear
relationship right over here,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.950
that it would not be
difficult to fit a line.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.630
So let me try to do that.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.450
So I'm just going to
eyeball it and try

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.510
to fit a line to this data.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.350
So our line might look
something like that.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.065
So it looks like a pretty strong
negative linear relationship.

00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:21.560
When I say it's a negative
linear relationship,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.160
we see that as time
increases, the percentage

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.870
of smokers in the
US is decreasing.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.980
So that's what makes it
a negative relationship.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.290
Now, what are they asking?

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.640
They want to estimate the
percentage of American adults

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.100
who smoked in 1945.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.800
Well, 1945 would be
to the left of 0.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.830
So we could even
think of it as if 1945

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.620
is 20 years before 1965.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.660
So let me see if
I can draw that.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.940
So 20 years before 1965.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.540
Let's see, this would be 5
years before 1965, 10 years,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.010
15 years, 20 years before 1965.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.450
So I could even put that as
negative 20 right over here.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.370
Negative 20 years since 1965
you could view as 20 years

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.979
before 1965.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.464
So that would represent
1945 right over there.

00:02:14.464 --> 00:02:16.380
And one thing that we
could do is very roughly

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.220
just try to extend this negative
linear relationship backwards.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.290
And they allow us
to do that by saying

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.770
assuming the trend shown on
the data has been consistent.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.610
So the trend has
been consistent.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.390
This line represents the trend.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.680
So let's just keep
going backwards,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.100
keep going backwards at the same
rate, so something like that.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.000
I want to make
sure that it looks

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.349
like it's the same
rate right over here.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.890
And you could just
try to eyeball it.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.410
You could say, well, let's
see, 20 years ago, 1945.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.880
If I were to extend
that line backwards,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.570
it looks like there
were about 52%

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.200
of the population was smoking.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.212
It seems like we're about
52% right over here.

00:03:01.212 --> 00:03:02.670
Another way to
think about it would

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.720
be to actually try to
calculate the rate of decline.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.590
And let's say we do it
over every 20 years,

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.298
because that will be
useful because we're

00:03:10.298 --> 00:03:11.740
going 20 years back.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.640
So if we go 20 years from
this point, so this is 1965,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.010
you go 20 years in the future.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.820
So that is 10 years, and
then that is 20 years.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.974
So my change in the
horizontal is 20 years.

00:03:25.974 --> 00:03:27.390
What's the change
in the vertical?

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.270
Well, it looks like we have a
decrease of a little bit more

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.950
than 10%.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.450
It looks like it's
11% or 12% decrease.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.652
So I'll just say
minus 11% right there.

00:03:40.652 --> 00:03:42.110
And let's see if
that's consistent.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.030
If we were to go
another 20 years.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.320
So if we go another 20 years,
it looks like once again we've

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.390
gone down by about 10%.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.442
So that looks like roughly 10%.

00:03:52.442 --> 00:03:54.400
If we're following the
line, it should actually

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.780
be the same number.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.330
So let me write it this way.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.670
It's approximately down 10%.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.330
So that little
squiggly line, I'm

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.860
just saying approximately
negative 10% every 20 years.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.870
So if you go back 20 years, you
should increase your percentage

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.600
by 20%.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.100
So this should go up by-- or
you should increase your percent

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.840
by 10%, I should say.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.022
So if we started at
41% or 42%, once again,

00:04:31.022 --> 00:04:32.980
this was what we saw when
we just eyeballed it,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.530
you should get to 51% or 52%.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.040
So my estimate of the
percentage of American adults

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.285
who smoked in 1945
would be 51% or 52%.
