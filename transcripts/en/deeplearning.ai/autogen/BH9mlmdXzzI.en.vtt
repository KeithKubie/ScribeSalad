it's not always easy to combine all the
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.430
it's not always easy to combine all the
things you clear about into single real

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440
things you clear about into single real
 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.099

number evaluation metric in those cases

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109
number evaluation metric in those cases
 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.960
number evaluation metric in those cases
I found it sometimes useful to set up

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970
I found it sometimes useful to set up
 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.299
I found it sometimes useful to set up
satisficing as well as optimizing

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309

metrics let me show you what I mean

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519
metrics let me show you what I mean
 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.950
metrics let me show you what I mean
let's say that you've decided you care

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960
let's say that you've decided you care
 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.560
let's say that you've decided you care
about the classification accuracy of

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
about the classification accuracy of
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.380
about the classification accuracy of
your cat classifier this could have been

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
your cat classifier this could have been
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.880
your cat classifier this could have been
f1 score some of the measure of accuracy

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890
f1 score some of the measure of accuracy
 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.929
f1 score some of the measure of accuracy
but let's say that in addition to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
but let's say that in addition to
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.939
but let's say that in addition to
accuracy you also care about their

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
accuracy you also care about their
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.740
accuracy you also care about their
running time so how long it takes to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
running time so how long it takes to
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.500
running time so how long it takes to
classify an image and caused by our a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510
classify an image and caused by our a
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.959
classify an image and caused by our a
takes 80 milliseconds B takes 95

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969
takes 80 milliseconds B takes 95
 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.360
takes 80 milliseconds B takes 95
milliseconds and C takes thousand five

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
milliseconds and C takes thousand five
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.520
milliseconds and C takes thousand five
hundred milliseconds as 1.5 seconds to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
hundred milliseconds as 1.5 seconds to
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.220
hundred milliseconds as 1.5 seconds to
classify an image so one thing you could

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
classify an image so one thing you could
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.650
classify an image so one thing you could
do is combine accuracy and running time

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660
do is combine accuracy and running time
 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080
do is combine accuracy and running time
into an overall evaluation metric go

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
into an overall evaluation metric go
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.420
into an overall evaluation metric go
into the cost such as moving overall

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
into the cost such as moving overall
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.779
into the cost such as moving overall
cost is accuracy minus 0.5 times running

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789
cost is accuracy minus 0.5 times running
 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.049
cost is accuracy minus 0.5 times running
time but maybe it seems a bit artificial

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
time but maybe it seems a bit artificial
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.709
time but maybe it seems a bit artificial
to combine accuracy and value time using

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
to combine accuracy and value time using
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.230
to combine accuracy and value time using
a formula like this like a linear way to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
a formula like this like a linear way to
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.350
a formula like this like a linear way to
sum of these two things so here's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
sum of these two things so here's
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.460
sum of these two things so here's
something else you could do instead

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
something else you could do instead
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.560
something else you could do instead
which is that you might want to choose a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
which is that you might want to choose a
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.140
which is that you might want to choose a
classifier that maximizes accuracy the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
classifier that maximizes accuracy the
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.719
classifier that maximizes accuracy the
subject to that the running time that is

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
subject to that the running time that is
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:27.170
subject to that the running time that is
the time

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
the time
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.630
the time
take the cosine image that that has to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
take the cosine image that that has to
 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.990
take the cosine image that that has to
be less than the equal to 100 or the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
be less than the equal to 100 or the
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.670
be less than the equal to 100 or the
seconds

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680
 
 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.410
 
so in this case we would say that

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420
so in this case we would say that
 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.760
so in this case we would say that
accuracy is an optimizing metric because

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770
accuracy is an optimizing metric because
 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.710
accuracy is an optimizing metric because
you want to maximize accuracy you want

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720
you want to maximize accuracy you want
 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.100
you want to maximize accuracy you want
to do as long as possible on accuracy

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110
to do as long as possible on accuracy
 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.150
to do as long as possible on accuracy
but that running time is what we call a

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160
but that running time is what we call a
 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.670
but that running time is what we call a
satisficing metric meaning that it just

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680
satisficing metric meaning that it just
 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.170
satisficing metric meaning that it just
has to be good enough it just needs to

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180
has to be good enough it just needs to
 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.360
has to be good enough it just needs to
be less than 100 milliseconds and beyond

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370
be less than 100 milliseconds and beyond
 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.300
be less than 100 milliseconds and beyond
that you don't really care or at least

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310
that you don't really care or at least
 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.930
that you don't really care or at least
you don't care that much so this will be

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940
you don't care that much so this will be
 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.000
you don't care that much so this will be
a pretty reasonable way to trade off or

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010
a pretty reasonable way to trade off or
 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.930
a pretty reasonable way to trade off or
to put together accuracy as well as

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940
to put together accuracy as well as
 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.790
to put together accuracy as well as
running time and then may be the case

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800
running time and then may be the case
 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.010
running time and then may be the case
that so long the running time is less

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020
that so long the running time is less
 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.990
that so long the running time is less
100 milliseconds you users won't care

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000
100 milliseconds you users won't care
 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.790
100 milliseconds you users won't care
that much whether there's 100

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800
that much whether there's 100
 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.590
that much whether there's 100
milliseconds of 50 milliseconds or even

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600
milliseconds of 50 milliseconds or even
 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.190
milliseconds of 50 milliseconds or even
faster and by defining optimizing as

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200
faster and by defining optimizing as
 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.890
faster and by defining optimizing as
well as satisficing metrics this gives

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900
well as satisficing metrics this gives
 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.560
well as satisficing metrics this gives
you a clearer way to pick the quote best

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570
you a clearer way to pick the quote best
 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.050
you a clearer way to pick the quote best
classifier which in this case would be

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060
classifier which in this case would be
 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.880
classifier which in this case would be
classified B because of all the ones

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890
classified B because of all the ones
 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.280
classified B because of all the ones
with a running time back to 100

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290
with a running time back to 100
 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.240
with a running time back to 100
milliseconds it has the best accuracy so

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250
milliseconds it has the best accuracy so
 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.650
milliseconds it has the best accuracy so
more generally if you have n metrics

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660
more generally if you have n metrics
 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.020
more generally if you have n metrics
that you care about is sometimes

trigger words how likely are you to
actually wake up your device and you

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080
actually wake up your device and you
 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.080
actually wake up your device and you
might also care about the number of

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090
might also care about the number of
 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.039
might also care about the number of
false positives

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049
false positives
 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.930
false positives
so when no one actually said this

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940
so when no one actually said this
 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.330
so when no one actually said this
trigger word how often does it randomly

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340
trigger word how often does it randomly
 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.650
trigger word how often does it randomly
wake up so in this case maybe one

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660
wake up so in this case maybe one
 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.830
wake up so in this case maybe one
reasonable way of combining these two

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840
reasonable way of combining these two
 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.320
reasonable way of combining these two
evaluation metrics might be to maximize

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330
evaluation metrics might be to maximize
 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.590
evaluation metrics might be to maximize
accuracy so when someone says one of the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600
accuracy so when someone says one of the
 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.240
accuracy so when someone says one of the
trigger words maximize your chance that

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250
trigger words maximize your chance that
 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.030
trigger words maximize your chance that
you device wakes up and subject to that

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040
you device wakes up and subject to that
 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:46.080
you device wakes up and subject to that
you have and most one false positive you

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090
you have and most one false positive you
 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.030
you have and most one false positive you
know every 24 hours of operation right

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040
know every 24 hours of operation right
 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.130
know every 24 hours of operation right
so that your device randomly wakes up

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140
so that your device randomly wakes up
 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.409
so that your device randomly wakes up
only once per day on average when no one

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419
only once per day on average when no one
 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.870
only once per day on average when no one
is actually talking to it so in this

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880
is actually talking to it so in this
 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.040
is actually talking to it so in this
case accuracy is the optimizing metric

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050
case accuracy is the optimizing metric
 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.560
case accuracy is the optimizing metric
and the number of false positives every

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570
and the number of false positives every
 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.590
and the number of false positives every
24 hours is the satisficing metric where

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600
24 hours is the satisficing metric where
 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.440
24 hours is the satisficing metric where
you be satisfied so long as there's an

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450
you be satisfied so long as there's an
 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.940
you be satisfied so long as there's an
knows one false positive every 24 hours

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950

picking the quote that's one now these
evaluation metrics must be evaluated or

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940
evaluation metrics must be evaluated or
 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.880
evaluation metrics must be evaluated or
calculated on a training set or a

so one of the things you also need to do

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669
so one of the things you also need to do
 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.240
so one of the things you also need to do
is set up training data for development

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250
is set up training data for development
 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.190
is set up training data for development
as well test sets

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200
as well test sets
 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.750
as well test sets
