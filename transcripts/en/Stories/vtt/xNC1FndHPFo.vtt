00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.070
SPEAKER 1: Ever since man began
to fly, people came to watch.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.670
The first passenger
flight in history

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.360
was not only seen by the
curious public, but by royalty.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.360
Humanity's interest in flying
goes beyond the specific desire

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.530
to get into a cockpit
and take control

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.430
of a carefully
engineered machine,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.750
streaking across the sky at
speeds not natural to man.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.620
We also have a desire
to witness flight,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.540
to simply be near flight.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.710
To hear it, feel it,
and talk about it.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.780
Because the incredible
feat of human powered

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.440
flight was conquered by a few,
but is appreciated by many.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.990
This is the Farnborough
International Air Show,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.320
one of the biggest air
shows in the world,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.310
and a place that is as connected
to flying and aeronautics

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.790
as any other place on Earth.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.120
Partly because it is the
site of the United Kingdom's

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.230
first human powered controlled
airplane flight back in 1908.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.690
And over 100 years later, it is
still synonymous with flight.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.140
But it's not just
the history that

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.990
keeps this place
flying high, it's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.840
the continuous crowds
of interested people.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.360
The people wanting to be
near flight, the people that

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.477
go to air shows.

00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:12.310
RANDY TINSETH: It's a
celebration of flying.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.370
And as I drove in today, I
saw people already lined up

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.690
with their cameras ready to
take pictures of these aircraft.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.050
So I think there's a
pretty special thing,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.249
a magic about flying.

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:23.290
You don't think about it.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.710
Flying 35,000, 40,000
feet at 600 miles an hour,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.070
connecting any two
places in the globe.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.020
You know, flying has really
opened up what we can do,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.300
what we can experience.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.530
It's opened up business.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.410
It really changed the world.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.840
SPEAKER 1: And
it's that big idea,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.300
that flight is this
magical, world changing

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.260
thing that makes people
want to be a witness to it.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.670
To say they were there,
that they saw it up close,

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.260
they were one of the first to
see what could be possible.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.605
JENNA MCMULLIN: The
excitement of flight

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:53.060
and the excitement
of space travel

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.880
is the excitement
of possibility.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.920
It's the excitement of what if.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.320
Where could we go, how
could we get there,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.021
what if we tried this new idea?

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:03.020
SPEAKER 1: Talking to
people around the air show

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.220
and hearing their
conversations with each other,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.720
the idea of the near
endless possibilities

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.459
aerospace can provide is
a big part of the draw.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.000
Learning about what's
next in flight,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.580
about space travel, drones
and flying airships.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.310
But a lot of other people
break down the draw of an air

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.010
show more simply, like
Royal Air Force Squadron

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.390
Leader, Mark Faltz.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.710
MARK: I just think airplanes
are generally quite cool.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.840
SPEAKER 1: Now it may not
be the most poetic reason

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.460
why we're drawn to airplanes,
but it is definitely

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.500
a major factor.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.540
Coolness is what makes kids
and adults look up with a grin

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.260
as an impressive aircraft
shows off for the crowd.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.370
It's what makes people stare
upwards until their necks hurt.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.870
It will literally stop
people in their tracks

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.590
as they watch something
they never thought possible.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.940
Planes are a lot
of things, but cool

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.480
may be the first on the list.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.140
But if you're
drawn to airplanes,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.520
drawn to the power and
impressiveness of human flight,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.030
it may not be any of this.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.690
It may not be because you think
it's cool or inspirational.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.852
It may be because of
something much, much deeper.

00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:08.420
JEREMY VANDOMELEN: I think
it's a very primal instinct

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.190
that ever since the dawn
of man we looked at birds

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.790
and we've wondered how they fly.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.860
And we're able to finally build
the machines to get up there.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.930
And I think it's
just that feeling.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.914
We dream of flying.

00:03:19.914 --> 00:03:21.330
And I think that's
what drives it.

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:25.600
SPEAKER 1: Of course,
it's probably not

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.260
just one thing that makes people
interested in human flight.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.810
Each person has a unique
take on what draws them in,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.380
what makes them devote a
day, a weekend, or their life

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.560
to airplanes.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.750
But the key to air
shows might come down

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.400
to a couple of simple things.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.500
GUY NORRIS: Bit of history,
bit of the future, and right

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.799
outside the very present.

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:43.840
What more could you want?

00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:54.500
SPEAKER 1: Over
the past few years,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.020
there's been a worldwide
focus on STEM education.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.730
And nowhere is
that more apparent

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.680
than in the schools'
Build A Plane Challenge

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.870
where school kids come
together to literally build

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.032
an airplane from scratch.

00:04:05.032 --> 00:04:07.240
What was your favorite thing
about building the plane

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.860
in general?

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.070
STUDENT: That's really
hard, because I've enjoyed

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.520
building most of the plane.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.940
I'm going to be a Naval
engineer when I'm older.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.545
So this will help definitely.

00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:16.920
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you for watching

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.899
