00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Evans] Let's think about how to define union.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We need to make a procedure that takes 2 lists as its inputs.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We'll call the lists p and q.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
To define union we want to modify p by adding elements from q.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We should remember that append operation does that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It adds a new element to a list.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So we're going to use append to add elements from q to p.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
To define union we need to go through all the elements in q.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Check for each element whether it already exists in p.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If it does, we do nothing.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If it doesn't, then we add it to p.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So we'll use a for-loop.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We need to make sure that we loop through the elements of q.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Those are the ones that we want to add to p.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
For each element we need to test whether or not it's already in p,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
so we check to make sure the element is not already in p.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If this is true, that means e is not in p,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and we want to add it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
To add e to p, we use append.
