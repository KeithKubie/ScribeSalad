JEREMY WALKER: Hello,
everyone.

00:00:01.065 --> 00:00:01.800
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hi, Jeremy.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.883
How are you doing?

00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:04.019
JEREMY WALKER: I'm not
doing too bad.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:04.960
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Good.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.560
Welcome to YouTube
Developer's Live.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.800
We have an exciting show
for you today.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.810
Special guest will be Steve
Rosenbaum and Kimberly

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.970
Peterson from Magnify.net.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.610
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Hi, there.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.255
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: We are
actually streaming live from

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:18.900
New York City.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.230
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Howdy.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.786
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How
are you guys doing?

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:20.132
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Excellent.

00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:20.480
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Good.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.710
STEVE ROSENBAUM: We like
the forest very much.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.600
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is this
how New York City

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.530
typically looks like?

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.460
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Absolutely.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.760
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Occasionally
we have parrots

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.920
and other wild animals.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.800
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.390
So we will also talk
about curation.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.150
So for those of you that have
seen our announcement, Steve

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.720
actually wrote a book
about curation

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.190
called Curation Nation.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.340
So we are planning to drill
him on curation, which is

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.170
something quite new to
all of us, I think.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.640
But he seems to think it's
quite important.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.920
But we also have couple of
announcements later on.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.010
We'll cover a couple of the
events that are coming in the

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.840
YouTube Developer land.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.805
So shall we get to it?

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:07.780
JEREMY WALKER: Let's
get started.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.550
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So first,
Steve, tell us a little bit

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.050
more about yourself, for those
of you that are watching that

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.500
haven't actually had
a chance to do a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.950
search on your bio yet.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.090
And then tell us what's
curation, and what

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.130
got you into it.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.620
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So I've been a
filmmaker and a tech company

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.370
founder kind of intermittently
through all of my career.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.650
And the thing that people know
me best for was that in the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.620
early, early days before the web
was actually born, I went

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.410
in and sold MTV on this
idea that their

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.350
audience would make video.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.845
And in hindsight, people joke.

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:50.440
And they say, well, it was
Monday morning and everyone

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.930
was hung over, which is why
they paid attention.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.050
But I sold a show to MTV
called UNfiltered.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.700
And UNfiltered worked
in a very kind

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.110
of sneakernet fashion.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.610
You would call an 800 number,
for those of you

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.200
who remember those.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.720
We would FedEx you a camera.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.080
You'd record your video.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.990
You'd FedEx the camera back.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.840
We'd edit it, and we'd
put it on MTV.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.360
And this is pre-YouTube.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.390
And the thing that was so clear
to me during the four

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.560
years we did that show was that
people really wanted to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.430
make contact.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.340
They wanted to be able
to reach an audience.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.780
They just needed a framework.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.800
They needed a platform.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.770
And they needed some guidance
and some organization.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.860
So that's really kind of the
root of my passion, both for

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.270
video and for curation.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.865
And Kimberly and I, for
the last four years--

00:02:38.865 --> 00:02:39.150
KIMBERLY PETERSON:
Five years, yeah.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.200
STEVE ROSENBAUM: --five years,
have been building this

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.850
technology.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.670
I want to be fair.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.150
Kimberly's been building it,
along with our former CTO.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.800
And I've been out hawking it
and then trying to make it

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.630
consumer friendly, with the idea
that the volume of video

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.890
that's on the web today, and
that is-- as you guys know

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.430
better than anyone--

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.400
growing just stunningly, needs
human help to get discovered

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.190
and organized.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.330
And so that's kind
of the overview.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.520
And I can dive into some
specifics about curation, but

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.460
I want to just--

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.725
let me kind of set
the stage there.

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:10.570
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, great.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.520
That sounds great.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.130
So it sounds like you were doing
user-generated content

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.641
before user-generated content
was all the rage.

00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:21.330
STEVE ROSENBAUM: I was
painfully early, yes.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.500
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: No, that's
an amazing story.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.570
So you mentioned that we are
actually drowning in the sea

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.890
of content, and human curation
is important.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.780
Can you expand on that?

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.400
Why is it that you think
humans are key to

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.995
the equation here?

00:03:37.995 --> 00:03:41.460
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So if you look
at the data that comes

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.250
out of YouTube over the last
four years, the one thing

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.950
that's clear is the number of
devices that make video is

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.970
growing exponentially.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.280
The number of different uses
for creation of video is

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.800
growing dramatically.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.970
YouTube is doing an amazing job
storing and serving them.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.340
But the word that gets kicked
around a lot is quality.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.580
So if you're Madison Avenue,
there are some metrics about

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.200
what they consider quality.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.250
But if you're an end
user at home--

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.600
and I'll just give
you an example.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.590
If you have a 14, 15-year-old
son, as I do, and he wants to

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.110
fix his bicycle, as he did
three weekends ago.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.070
And you're trying to find a
video about how to fix a

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.690
derailleur on a particular
bicycle.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.320
Yes, I can search YouTube and
type "how to fix a bicycle"

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.830
and get hundreds of responses,
thousands of responses.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.190
But if I can find a site that
has a highly curated

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.220
collection of excellent bicycle
repair tips for

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.720
teenagers, as opposed to bike
professionals or racing bikes,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.190
all of a sudden, trusting that
curator makes my job of

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.180
searching easier.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.810
So humans are the
contextualization, if you

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.436
will, of search.

00:04:50.436 --> 00:04:51.344
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:04:51.344 --> 00:04:52.670
That makes a lot of sense.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.660
JEREMY WALKER: That's
pretty interesting.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I
think Jeremy is a

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.960
weekend bike repairman.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.180
JEREMY WALKER: Yeah,
from time to time.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.605
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I'm
not very handy.

00:04:59.605 --> 00:05:01.530
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Do
you make videos?

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.840
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I
only repair things

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.440
in the virtual world.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.140
JEREMY WALKER: I only repair
things if I have to.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.390
So Steve, can you tell us a
little bit more about Curation

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.880
Nation, your book?

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.130
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Sure.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.500
So when I went out to raise
money for Magnify.net back

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.810
before New York had a tech scene
of any substance, I went

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.370
up and down Sand Hill
Road talking to VCs.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.490
And I went to all the shops
that you know very

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.670
well, big VC firms.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.750
And each one of them said to
me, what is this slide

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.090
"curation" you have
in your deck?

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.910
Get that out of there.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.410
It sounds elitist.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.910
It sounds like a museum.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.130
And I, for a couple of years,
took their advice and tried to

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.280
come up with another word for
the mix of man and machine

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.470
collaboration around content.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.390
And then I finally realized
that the word

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.310
was the right word.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.110
And I went looking for a way
to kind of validate that.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.870
And found that nobody
had written--

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.300
there had been blog posts
here and there.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.560
But nobody had actually sat down
and said, I'm going to

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.330
turn this into an actionable
thesis that could actually

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.650
look like a book.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.790
And for all of us who write
Twitter feeds or blog posts,

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.010
writing a 300-page book requires
you to be both

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.090
diligent and a student in a
way that I don't think I

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.410
really fully understood.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.800
And so I learned a lot
writing the book.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.000
And here, I brought a copy.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.190
I would sign it for you guys,
but you're far away.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.060
And in the book, basically
what I did was go out and

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.920
explore the universe of how
content was being organized,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.790
and give people really very
specific examples of how

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.390
curation existed in the
past and how it will

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.390
exist in the future.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.130
And it's been a great entry
point for me into this

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.680
community of makers, which
I am very proud to

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.980
be associated with.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.730
And I think what Kimberly
would tell you is that,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.150
increasingly, it used to be that
Magnify customers would

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.440
say, oh, we need a
video platform.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.200
And by the way, yeah, throw in
some of that curation stuff.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.230
And now we're hearing, actually,
we really need a

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.310
curation solution.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.840
So the book was a little early,
but not painfully so.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.800
And it continues to be well
read and well reviewed.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.141
So that's pretty much it.

00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:20.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Very, very
interesting story.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.620
So did that book help
educate the VCs?

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.000
Do you know if they are
reading it right now?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.360
STEVE ROSENBAUM: That's
a fair question.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.920
Oops, I need a password to get
back into this computer, Jeff.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.560
I didn't keep it live.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.220
I've always had good
relationships with VCs.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.450
And I continue to have good
relationships with both our

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.820
VCs and kind of the
broader community.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.020
I think the book did
help, actually.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.190
I think a lot of them
have read it.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.380
There is no VC today that isn't
getting pitched some

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.150
kind of curation technology.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.360
So video and curation are hand
in hand, kind of hot.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.210
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I haven't
finished the book yet.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.030
I started reading it.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:04.810
And right from the start, you
actually talk about the

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.600
business models for curation.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.460
And you referred to a potential

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.570
revenue trickle for curators.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.400
And let me just quote
from the book.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.620
You say that "when these micro
careers are knit together,

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.970
your curated knowledge can
evolve from a hobby to an

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.410
avocation to one of the many
gigs that pay the rent."

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.020
So you seem to be kind of
setting the expectations very

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.650
low for curators.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.220
And obviously, there are many
ways in which people feel

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:40.070
realized and people are
motivated to perform certain

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.490
activities online.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.520
And obviously, revenue
is one of them.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.250
But there are others.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.186
But if you look at the business
models behind

00:08:49.186 --> 00:08:52.500
curation, can you share some
more thoughts about how you

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.840
think that is going to evolve?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.360
Because ultimately, for VCs
and entrepreneurs, that's

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.510
going to be important.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.990
How will the ecosystem evolve in
your mind around curation?

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.990
For creation, I think the rules
of the game are fairly

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.820
well established.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.925
But I think curation
is still very new.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.920
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So one of the
things I've learned, and that

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.210
we've learned together, is the
ecosystem around how a market

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.510
changes requires a
bunch of players.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.050
So Google, from an advertising
perspective, can say, we want

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.380
to sell ads around
curated content.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.810
We think that's a really
valuable opportunity.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.990
But advertisers need
to buy into that.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.040
Madison Avenue, and then
individual advertisers, need

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.060
to raise their hand and say,
great, I'd like to participate

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:37.910
in that ecosystem.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.220
And I think there's been some
false starts there.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.780
And early on, I think we
believed that if you made a

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.680
collection of high-quality
video that clearly had an

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.550
advertising opportunity, that
the money would start to kind

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.160
of tick away and come in.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.230
And I think we're now beginning
to see that happen.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.580
And the game changer, which
maybe we didn't know, but the

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.660
game changer really is
the flat screen.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.680
It's really YouTube to
the living room.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.180
Because what we know is that
someone will be willing to

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.670
search on an individual video.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.130
I mean, when I wanted that video
of my son's bike repair,

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.530
I was able to type in
and search for it.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.770
But once I want to see a
collection of videos about

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.880
sports, or music, or the arts,
or anything in which a number

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.630
of clips have to be strung
together, I really don't want

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.930
to have to search from
my living room

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.340
couch every two minutes.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.410
I want somebody to have curated
the 10 best Gangnam

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:32.630
style videos.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.310
God forbid.

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.090
Did I just say that?

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:34.590
KIMBERLY PETERSON: You did.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.580
Now I'm going to be stuck
on that for days.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.970
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Can
we rewind the tape?

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:38.780
I take that back.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.872
I'm so sorry.

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:40.510
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Too late.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.900
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Someone is now
curating that as we speak.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.320
So Magnify's vision is that in
between the collection of the

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.990
world, kind of the content
space, and then individual

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.810
publishers and creators, there's
the opportunity to add

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:59.690
value, both aesthetically
and contextually.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.100
And that there will be revenue
that will arrive.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.770
I personally think it's
going to be a larger

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.030
revenue stream sooner.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.770
But I made the decision in the
book to not promise that.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:14.480
Because again, what's the thing
about rear-view mirror--

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.730
is things are farther away
than they appear.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.360
I didn't want to make the
mistake of having somebody

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.940
come up to me at South by
Southwest and say, dude, I

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.520
quit my day job because
of your book.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.060
And now I can't feed
my family.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.640
I think I actually say in
the book, don't quit

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.610
your day job yet.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.580
KIMBERLY PETERSON: We've
definitely seen things shift.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.040
A lot of our customers that were
coming to us, say, three

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.370
or four years ago--

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.210
they wanted to upload all
of their own content.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.460
And definitely, we've seen
things dramatically

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.290
shift away from that.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.630
They're really buying into
curation at this point.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.482
And it's because the environment
has changed.

00:11:47.482 --> 00:11:49.610
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So content
creators themselves are

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:50.820
warming up to the idea--

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:51.080
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Absolutely.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.660
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --of
their content

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.220
being curated by others?

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.210
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Well, I think
part of what has changed in

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.330
the last two years--

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.520
and again, that's how fast
this space is changing.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.850
Two years ago, if you went to
CES, all anyone wanted to talk

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.230
about was DRM.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:10.310
Walled garden, lock my content
down, digital watermark, keep

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.540
it out of the hands of all of
the evil aggregators who were

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.310
going to somehow steal my
precious intellectual fluids,

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.790
or whatever.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:24.760
Now, increasingly, people call
us and say, hey, how can we be

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.760
added to your collection?

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.990
Or we want our content to
be part of your search.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.050
KIMBERLY PETERSON: They want to
see their content moving.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.060
And as long as it gets picked
up and moves around the

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.920
Internet, that's what
makes them happy.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.570
So it's a really big change.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.865
STEVE ROSENBAUM: And I think
creators needed to get over

00:12:40.865 --> 00:12:43.620
seeing curation as the enemy.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.390
And in fact, I gave a talk
at South by two years--

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:50.240
year and a half-- maybe it was
two years ago, in which--

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.370
that title was "Creationism vs.
Curationism." And it was a

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.090
pretty angry room.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.150
I mean, it was yelling.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.390
And the creators were like,
you're stealing our--

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.740
it was very intense.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.620
And a year later, that
had all evaporated.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.630
So I think that as creators
understand that curation

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.690
actually helps their-- and I
don't mean to be kind of

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:13.750
pollyannish about this.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.000
It doesn't just make your stuff
get seen by more people.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.940
There is an economic
model evolving--

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.970
and YouTube's part of that, and
a lot of people are part

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.580
of that-- that I think really
makes it likely that curation

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:30.990
will be a paid profession
soon.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.790
By the time your kids
are out of college.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.990
Depending on how old
your kids are.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.460
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So you guys
were kind of switching a

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.980
little bit into the
Magnify.net talk.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.520
So we definitely want to talk
a little bit about that and

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.210
see a demo.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.620
You kind of gave a little
information

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.080
on what it's about.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.960
Can you tell us a little bit
more, and a little bit more

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.010
about how it got started?

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.680
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Sure.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.900
Kimberly, do you want to
tell the product story?

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.370
And I'll prep a little bit.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:01.472
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Sure.

00:14:01.472 --> 00:14:02.680
I can talk a little bit
about that, and you

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.750
can prep some stuff.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.540
So the company actually started
out as a totally free

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.140
product, very similar to
a YouTube concept.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.550
And anyone could come and make
a site, and set up a

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.210
yourname.magnify.net
video site.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.990
And either upload your video
and/or bring in content from

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.470
other APIs out there, including
the YouTube API.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.630
And then we eventually added a
pro tier onto that where you

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.910
can come and swipe a card, and
you can get some extra stuff.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.990
You can get pre-roll
on your own videos.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.270
And then we actually got into
kind of what we call our

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.530
enterprise product, where we
have larger companies coming

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.450
to us and actually paying us a
monthly fee to provide a lot

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.200
of different services for them,
both video upload of

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.170
their own video content
and curation.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.410
And that's something that
we started, what,

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.320
about three years ago?

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.080
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Yeah.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.750
And one of the things that is
kind of fun about this, and

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.030
why we like the partnership
with YouTube so much, is

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.915
YouTube, in addition to creating
a great opportunity

00:15:01.915 --> 00:15:05.130
and awareness of the
preponderance of video--

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.950
also working with you guys.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.210
I mean, there are things
you build.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.230
And then there are things that
you give us tools to build.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:16.130
So as the volume of video gets
greater, some people that are

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.610
doing narrow, tiny little niche
sites turn out to need

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.190
fairly complex tools to
organize, build playlists,

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:29.310
build players, all this kind
of presentation-layer stuff

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.340
after the API.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.290
And so the easiest way is
to kind of show you

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.700
a before and after.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.480
And we think it's a
little awesome.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.320
And then Kimberly
can talk about--

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.700
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Let's go for it.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:41.790
STEVE ROSENBAUM: All right.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.710
The we can talk about how the
code works under the hood.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:46.010
KIMBERLY PETERSON: And this is
actually a Magnify site.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.510
This is the TEDxTalks
video site running

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.630
on the Magnify servers.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.000
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So
let's say you want

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.320
to search by language.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.436
Where is language?

00:15:56.436 --> 00:15:59.680
KIMBERLY PETERSON: So TEDx has
this whole taxonomy that they

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.650
came to with us.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:05.045
And you can search by topic, and
by city, by language, all

00:16:05.045 --> 00:16:07.120
of these different ways that
you can actually slice and

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.600
dice their YouTube content.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.770
None of the videos that you're
seeing here are actually

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.570
hosted by Magnify.net.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.040
They actually upload and have
all of their various talks all

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.880
over the world upload all of
their content to YouTube.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.030
And then we use the YouTube
API to actually bring that

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.140
content into the Magnify site,
into their content management

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.240
system, and allow them to
categorize it in all of these

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.860
different ways so that it's
easier to browse.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.810
And gives kind of a different
context to all of it.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.120
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So here's all
of the TEDx talks in Japanese.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.350
And let's just look
at this one.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:47.570
So what you're seeing is the
YouTube player embedded,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.970
playing on the page inside
the TEDx trade dress.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.850
So for TEDx, this page
is literally

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.610
delivered pixel perfect.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.760
So the logo is perfect,
the color is perfect,

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.900
the tabs are perfect.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.480
But you're getting a YouTube
experience with a more

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.390
granular search and
a more customized

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:09.089
front end, if you will.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:10.420
And this is fully automated.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.560
So as people from all across
the TEDx community upload,

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.290
it's automatically organized.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.640
The taxonomy is baked in.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.040
And in a few minutes,
we'll get to how

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.829
the technology works.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:23.630
We'll take you behind
the scenes and show

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.339
you some of the tech.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.450
And it's pretty awesome.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:27.940
Questions?

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.356
Does that make sense?

00:17:29.356 --> 00:17:29.960
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.860
It sounds like this use case
that you have shown here, it's

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.800
kind of video publishing
platform use case, where the

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.470
content exists on YouTube.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.790
But you want to organize
it differently.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:47.960
And then potentially provide
some value add with branding

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.870
from the actual customer.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.280
So looking at the this,
the TED jumps out.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.220
There's obviously a YouTube logo
in the embed, but it's

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.340
very clear that this
is a TED site.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.360
STEVE ROSENBAUM: And that's
exactly right.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:06.470
And people at the end of the
video have an option.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.730
What it is is a little
cul-de-sac, if you will, of

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.830
YouTube content.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:16.000
And the curatorial overlay is
a TED curatorial overlay.

00:18:18.818 --> 00:18:20.840
KIMBERLY PETERSON: I was going
to say, we provide--

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.010
oh, there's no related videos.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.200
We can provide related video
content and things that are

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.480
all curated by the TEDx
editors in our content

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.270
management system.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.990
So if you wanted to move on
to other videos that they

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.540
consider to be related, you
can usually do that.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.900
I don't see one here on this
page, but it provides that

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.200
feature as well.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.000
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So let's go
to a sandbox site that

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.750
Kimberly allows me to break
multiple times a day.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.950
And then we'll show you kind of
how the technology works.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.230
So this is a site called Travel
Online, which is just a

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.300
made-up site.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.966
KIMBERLY PETERSON:
It's a demo site.

00:18:51.966 --> 00:18:53.560
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So Kimberly,
just walk us through what

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.930
we're seeing on this page.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.860
KIMBERLY PETERSON: So this is
actually the home page of a

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.380
Magnify site.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.830
Everything that you're seeing
here is actually a drag and

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.520
drop module.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.760
In the content management
system, you can build

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.010
playlists of your content.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.270
And you can drag and drop those
different playlists in

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.800
these grid modules onto the
home page of your site.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.080
And they can be really
rapidly updated.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.550
We have a lot of customers who
have a special featured video

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.340
of the day, or maybe for
holidays, or something that.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.570
So it's really easy for an
editor to come in and change

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.240
out the content really
frequently.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.600
Here we're looking at-- what
are we looking at?

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.220
We're looking at a category
of videos.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.040
STEVE ROSENBAUM:
Called Luxury.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.200
KIMBERLY PETERSON: This is part
of browsing the taxonomy.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.970
You can actually bring in these
videos from all of the

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.610
different APIs, including
YouTube, that we support.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.080
And kind of tag them up
and categorize them.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.620
And people can just browse them
based on your sidebar

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.060
navigation, which was also a
drag and drop module that you

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.156
can stick on your pages.

00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:50.680
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So let's
actually get into the admin,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.760
which I don't know if we've ever
shown publicly before.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.290
KIMBERLY PETERSON:
I don't think so.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:56.440
STEVE ROSENBAUM: What I've
now done is I've

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.580
skipped the login part.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.420
It's like a cooking show.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.150
I logged in it before, so the
cake would be fully baked when

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:02.340
I took it out of the oven.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.850
But this should look to you
like any relatively

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:11.890
straightforward WordPress-style
blog tool.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.180
And let's go to Design.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.380
And we'll just look
at the page.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:21.510
So what you just saw, the travel
site, is literally

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.850
built by a series of modules.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.310
And these modules are all
adjustable, so you can

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.290
re-layout the page
any way you want.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.700
You can add new elements, both
graphically and content-wise.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.610
And for a lot of people that
want to build robust video

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.180
collections, and then have
them change on a daily or

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.820
weekly basis, not having to go
to a developer to make a

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.990
change, to say, this
week I want to do

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.470
video travel from Ireland.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.730
To be able to do that without
having to change the

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.770
underlying code is actually
pretty powerful.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.550
KIMBERLY PETERSON: We actually
also have a type of playlist

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:59.490
called a tag-based playlist that
works really well with a

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.820
lot of the discovery
that we do through

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.380
our third-party APIs.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.620
So you can actually go ahead and
set up something that we

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.990
call Automated Video Discovery,
and run a search.

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.420
Basically, save a search
and set it

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.290
up to run on a schedule.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.810
And it will go out to, say,
YouTube and bring in videos

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.390
that match your search terms.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:20.330
Send you an email letting you
know that you've got new

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.000
videos to come and take
a look at and approve.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.660
And you can tag those
videos up.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.030
And the tag-based playlists
will automatically update.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.770
So you could go ahead and put
some playlist modules onto

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.680
your home page with a certain
topic-- a tag-based playlist.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.880
And that content could update
every hour, every 24 hours, or

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.650
once a week with new content
just kind of automated.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.840
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Are these
submissions typically

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.570
moderated by the curator?

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.320
KIMBERLY PETERSON: They
definitely are.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.790
Yeah, they are.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.190
We have sort of a whole
editorial process.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.980
It's actually configurable.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.410
And it can also depend on the
search that you're running.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.170
You can set up a search that
doesn't go through an

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.250
editorial process.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.210
For instance, if you're bringing
in your own videos

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.002
from your own account at
YouTube, you know that you

00:22:06.002 --> 00:22:08.200
just want to go ahead and bring
them in and have them go

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.110
live automatically.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.580
They can actually skip that
editorial process.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.560
But usually, if you're doing a
search for videos that you

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.020
don't know anything about, they
actually do go into an

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.270
editorial queue.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.670
And the editor assigned
to that queue will

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:20.880
actually get an email.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.670
And they can come and log
into the admin and

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:23.600
preview those videos.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.830
And reject the ones that don't
fit, and approve and publish

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.460
the ones that they want
to have go live.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.550
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So here's
a great example.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.650
Without knowing anything about
travel to Ireland, I've just

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.920
searched the keyword
Irish Travel.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.580
And I've found that there's
a site on YouTube called

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.610
TravelToIreland.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:40.190
KIMBERLY PETERSON:
There you go.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.670
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So I might
spend a few minutes looking at

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:43.610
a couple of their videos.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:47.360
But my guess is what I found is
a very high-quality Irish

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.570
travel video collection.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.350
So let's say that
I've done that.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.350
And I've now decided,
you know what?

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.120
This is great.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.450
This is exactly what
I was looking for.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:58.090
So now we can create an AVD,
automatic video discovery.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.300
And I can say--

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.530
we won't do it here, but I could
literally say, user,

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.110
colon, and then the name
of the YouTube channel.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.160
And any time TravelToIreland
publishes a new video, my

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.100
site's going to discover it,
categorize it, put it in my

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.530
Irish Travel category.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.830
And so as you build this
collection of AVDs, what

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.050
happens is they get smarter
and more robust.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:20.830
And we kind of think
this is the--

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.320
I don't want to say the
antidote, because that's not

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:22.710
what I mean.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.070
But it's like it's the
ying to the yang of

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.050
the growth on YouTube.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:29.130
Which is the faster YouTube
grows and the more content

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.960
that's being poured into it,
if you can build smart,

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.860
human-assisted searches around
that and build high-quality

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.250
collections, then all of a
sudden, YouTube starts to be

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.110
able to surface.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.660
Wow, what an amazing
collection of

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.240
Irish travel videos.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.420
How awesome is that?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.600
And humans are core to this.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.840
We think algorithms are great.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.340
We think they get you 90%
of the way there.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.750
But just looking at--
here, let's look at

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:52.160
it a different way.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.660
Let's look at this just
as thumbnails.

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:57.760
If you look at these thumbnails,
without having to

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.340
drill in too far, it's pretty
clear that this one's probably

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.040
worth looking at.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:01.650
This one--

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:02.900
these are all beautiful
images.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.650
This one not so much.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.890
I think maybe Clondalkin Travel
I wouldn't look at.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.960
So I'm not looking for talking
heads, but I'm looking for

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.560
beautiful travel videos.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.680
Here, let's look at this one.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.910
And what you find is the
combination of thumbnails and

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.320
trusted sources starts
to really

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.354
make the process easier.

00:24:25.354 --> 00:24:27.050
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.910
Sounds very good.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.530
Especially given the amount of
content that we are actually

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:33.470
getting on YouTube.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.110
I think we're up to 72 hours
uploaded every minute.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.530
So lots of Irish videos
there, I'm sure.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.600
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Well, and
again, the thing that's

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.190
interesting and challenging
is as the volume

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.180
goes up, keyword searches--

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.580
they're part of the solution.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:54.060
But we would argue that it's a
combination of a keyword, a

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.190
trusted source, a curator.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.380
And by the way, my Irish travel
site and yours might be

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.150
very different.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:01.010
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Yeah, we
curate very differently.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.800
STEVE ROSENBAUM: But you might
want edgy stuff in the pub, on

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.610
the streets.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.700
And I might want beautiful--

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:12.140
and very hard to teach an
algorithm an aesthetic choice

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.430
between Kimberly's view
of travel and mine.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.810
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Ultimately,
you're providing your own

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.120
context for these videos.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:22.670
And the curation context is what
makes them more valuable.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:23.870
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Since we have
a minute, let's just do one

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:24.280
more thing.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.830
So I've just gone, and I'm
just going to go ahead.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.850
Kimberly knows.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:29.350
Kimberly is a detail person.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.840
She cares about periods and
commas and all that stuff.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.960
I tend to curate by scooping
up big collections and then

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:36.850
narrowing them down.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:40.960
So here, I've just added
70 videos to this

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.830
collection, to the site.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.445
And now I'm going to go
back up to Content.

00:25:45.445 --> 00:25:47.150
And I'm going to build a
playlist very quickly.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.600
And I'll just show
you how it works.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.550
So this site already has
36 playlists on it.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.690
And I'm just going to build
a curated series.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.200
And I'm going to search
for Ireland.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.710
I should spell it right.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:03.960
There we go.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.900
There should be more
than five.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.760
All right.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.590
So Select All, Add
to Playlist.

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:15.840
And I'll do Irish.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.320
So there's 993 results.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.750
So that's probably too many.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:31.320
Let's do quotes, "Irish travel."
Well, you know what?

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.165
I'll bet they're waiting to
be approved is what it is.

00:26:33.165 --> 00:26:34.070
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Yeah,
very possibly.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.760
STEVE ROSENBAUM: All right.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.010
So we'll go back to Irish.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.260
So the idea here is
that somebody can,

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:42.510
with a couple of clicks--

00:26:46.012 --> 00:26:48.920
KIMBERLY PETERSON: I think
you've already got most of

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:49.560
them over there.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.450
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Oh,
good enough.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.970
OK.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.750
So I'll just save this
as Irish Travel.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:01.340
And then we'll go ahead and
post it on the home page.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.590
And then we'll be done.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.860
So we're going do Design.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.770
So let's say that tomorrow
is Saint Patrick's Day.

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:10.210
And we really want to
put up Irish travel.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.460
Well, we just built
a collection.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.150
This is not my computer, so
it's a little confusing.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.950
There we go.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:20.430
Save.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.700
And then we'll go back
to the public site.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:27.850
Change the title.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:29.420
JEREMY WALKER: While you're
doing that, Kimberly, would

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.530
you mind talking a little bit
about the actual integration?

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.500
It looks like, from what you
guys have shown so far, you're

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.420
doing an integration both
at our Data API to get

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.060
information about videos and
things like that, and the

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.100
Player API, where you're
actually playing it back.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.550
And then skinning
the look of it.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.140
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Yeah.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.930
We're actually not skinning the
player itself, but we are

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.100
using some of the JavaScript
API to actually

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.010
instrument the player.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:00.890
I can certainly talk about how
we're using the Data API.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:04.950
Obviously, we support a whole
bunch of different APIs.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.370
And I was saying a little bit
earlier that there's always

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:10.800
this challenge where we've kind
of built our own language

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.460
for searching all
of these APIs.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.310
And everything has to go through
a translation layer.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:19.140
So our own language can be saved
in our database and have

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.450
that search replayed
back at any time.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.400
And then we actually translate
those searches into, say, for

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.040
instance, a request out to the
YouTube Data API to do a

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.520
search, get search
results, and then

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.040
present them to our users.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.790
If a user decides to use that
video on their site, we

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.240
actually store your [? UVID ?]

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.160
for the videos, the unique
ID for the video.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.720
And then we actually use the
player API to go ahead and

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.890
build YouTube embeds
on the site itself.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:53.700
And the JavaScript
API as well.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.440
To instrument that, we can
actually do omniture tracking

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.450
for video, for YouTube
players.

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:02.880
And we also do continuous play
for YouTube, which is a

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.710
feature a lot of our
customers want.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.520
So you can get kind of a
leanback experience, where you

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.970
can load up a whole playlist
of videos.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.230
And regardless of whether
they're videos that have been

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.500
uploaded to the site or YouTube
videos, or there are a

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.980
couple of other players that
have JavaScript APIs as well.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.270
When a video ends, we can just
roll through to the next video

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.540
in the playlist.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.370
And it allows people to curate
from a lot of different

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:27.820
sources, but provide an
experience that seems pretty

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.640
seamless, regardless of where
the video's coming from.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.205
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So one of the
things I just did while

00:29:33.205 --> 00:29:34.100
Kimberly was explaining--

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:34.710
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.615
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So everything
on the site is drag and drop,

00:29:36.615 --> 00:29:37.840
so what I've done is
I've started to

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.370
update the player page.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.800
So you can do a large hero
player at the top of the page.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.410
You can do related
videos down.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:46.000
And these are all modules.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.910
And these models can literally
be laid out so that the page

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.410
is full of content.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.350
It turns out that a lot of our
partners and our customers

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:56.710
really have very different views
of what they want the

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.680
video experience to be like.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.090
Some want the video
to be great--

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.270
by the way, that's
really strange.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.395
I'm sorry.

00:30:04.395 --> 00:30:06.150
This is what you get when you
don't know what videos you're

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:08.360
playing in advance.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.710
But the player page
is very important.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:14.255
And we should talk about our
embedded player as well, how

00:30:14.255 --> 00:30:15.110
we embed the YouTube player.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.660
But let's pause for a second.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:18.740
Kimberly was talking tech.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.580
KIMBERLY PETERSON: I'm sorry.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.380
I think somebody had
a question there.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:21.780
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.070
My question was as you were
integrating with the APIs and

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.310
actually building your product,
is there anything

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:28.570
that really surprised you?

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.640
Things that were
counter-intuitive, you were

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.570
not planning on?

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:33.970
Not necessarily--

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:36.790
either about the API integration
or the space

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.050
itself or the product?

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.230
Any aha moments that you would
be willing to share?

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.610
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Sure.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.970
Specifically about YouTube.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.220
Actually, one of the things
that we found really

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.380
interesting, and we were talking
about this over lunch,

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:53.850
was the fact that you guys only
surface a maximum of 950

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.880
items per search.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.960
Which, when you think about it,
makes a whole lot of good

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:01.810
sense, but wasn't something
that we were necessarily

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.770
expecting when we originally
did the integration.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.910
And actually, our integration
was done back in, I think,

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:09.800
2008, or even prior to that.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.890
We had an older integration.

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:16.150
So there was a little
bit of surprise.

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:17.880
But it makes a whole
lot of good sense.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.545
Obviously, pretty much any
search that you do through the

00:31:21.545 --> 00:31:26.500
GData API, you're going to be
getting a humongous number of

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.410
search results.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.280
And the idea that somebody would
really need to go any

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:35.810
farther into a results set than
that makes good sense.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.170
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So how did you
overcome this limitation?

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.040
Did you end up changing anything
in your system to

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.550
kind of work with it?

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.580
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Well,
definitely, we've got custom

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.620
code that actually works
with each one of the

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.990
APIs that we support.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.960
So we did actually have
to write a little

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.590
bit of custom code.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:58.110
We can't necessarily lean on our
base class for doing all

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:00.030
of the integration with
the YouTube API.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:04.880
It wasn't particularly onerous,
but it was something

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.870
that deviated from kind of a
standard that we had set up

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.120
for ourselves.

00:32:11.955 --> 00:32:14.130
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.070
Jeremy, anything else that you
would like to know about

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:17.355
Magnify.net?

00:32:17.355 --> 00:32:18.796
JEREMY WALKER: No, no.

00:32:18.796 --> 00:32:21.530
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: There was
one question, and I think

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.550
Steve alluded to that,
embedding.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.265
So it sounds like right now if
I want to use the product, I

00:32:26.265 --> 00:32:29.450
will have a micro site hosted
on Magnify.net.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.780
Or do you have an IFrame embed
of sorts, where I can just

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.670
plug in my curated content
directly into my site?

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:36.290
STEVE ROSENBAUM: You just
said our favorite word.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.530
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Well,
we actually do.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:43.150
You would have to have a
Magnify.net micro site as kind

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:43.630
of the base.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.960
It's where your content
management system lives.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.960
But you wouldn't necessarily
have to use that.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.350
If you wanted to integrate the
Magnify content from your

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:56.120
content management system
directly into your own site,

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.760
we actually do have an API.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.470
And we do have a bunch of
customers that are using our

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:05.280
own API to actually build
pretty full-featured

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.700
implementations that are
embedded in their own site.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.820
We also have our own players.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.540
And actually, this is
interesting, because we had an

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:18.520
IFrame player long before
YouTube ever adopted the idea

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.370
of putting a player
inside an IFrame.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.020
And we did it for a
number of reasons.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.530
Not just so that you can
actually switch between an

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.450
HTML5 player and a Flash Player,
but because we are

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.200
wrapping so many different
players and so

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.220
many different services.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.220
So it was actually kind of a
great day when YouTube decided

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.440
to implement the IFrame.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.680
Because our customers-- for a
long time, they complained

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.400
about the fact that we
had an IFrame embed.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.900
And we could finally point to
somebody and say, hey, well,

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.020
YouTube's gone to IFrame, so
this totally validates us.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.900
And actually, people don't
get as upset about it

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.730
as they used to.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:51.530
It's become a little
bit more standard.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.730
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Oh, that story.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:56.740
STEVE ROSENBAUM: So here's
an example of our player.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.270
So this is a playlist of all
YouTube videos that we

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.170
literally just spun up
in 30 seconds while

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:03.860
you guys were talking.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.820
You can literally use
our standard skins.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.990
Or you can build any
skin in CSS.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:09.679
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Yeah.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.620
So because it's delivered in an
IFrame, we can give people

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:15.790
the ability to really customize
what we call the

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.250
chrome around the player.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.110
So the video player itself,
obviously, could be coming

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:21.000
from anywhere.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.540
And it doesn't necessarily
come from an API.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.940
We can take embed codes.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.940
We can take oEmbed end points,
all kinds of ways that

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.530
third-party video could be
discovered and brought into

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.170
the content management system.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.020
And then it's kind of
wrapped in this.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.620
It's just basic HTML and CSS
that's pretty easily

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.870
customizable.

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:44.219
STEVE ROSENBAUM: And part of
what we think is important is

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.080
oftentimes, when we show the
product to people, people are

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.870
like, oh my god, I have all
this YouTube content.

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.880
And I've been wanting to find
different ways to expose it.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.944
But I thought that I was going
to have to write a new player

00:34:52.944 --> 00:34:53.920
or write a new wrapper.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.929
And the fact that this is all
drag and drop in CSS,

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.910
generally speaking, makes
folks really happy.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:01.240
And I just made this 750.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.410
Let's make it 900
wide and 500--

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:05.980
KIMBERLY PETERSON: So there are
a lot of different ways

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.650
that you can adjust the
size of the player.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:11.840
It can be vertically oriented
instead of horizontal.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.070
We also offer something that we
call a single-view player,

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.170
which doesn't have a playlist
loaded up into it.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:21.960
So this is another way that
content can move around sort

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.850
of off of a Magnify channel.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:28.360
We also have some plugin
implementation.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.990
So if you have a Magnify channel
and you're running a

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:34.220
WordPress or a Movable Type blog
or a blog that actually

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.080
supports the TinyMCE toolbar
as your WYSIWYG editor for

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.160
blog posts, you can actually
plug a Magnify plugin right

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.410
into that toolbar.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:47.380
And you can actually surface
video and add it to your

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.210
channel right from the plugin.

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:52.510
And then you can drop players
into a blog post or onto your

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:53.680
site that way really easily.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.460
And we have a number of people
who are using that as well.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.100
JEREMY WALKER: Cool.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:57.970
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:01.330
So we have a couple of
topics to cover, so

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:02.400
let's switch gears.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.540
So thank you very much for
the introduction and the

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:09.960
fascinating introduction to
curation and the overview of

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.520
your product.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.390
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Sure.

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.830
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Thanks
for having us.

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:13.905
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: It's just
some really nice work.

00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:16.750
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Wait, I have
a question for you.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.505
When does the new
API come out?

00:36:19.505 --> 00:36:21.260
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah, that's
a good question.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:25.750
So for those of you watching,
the question relates to the

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.665
version 3 of the API.

00:36:27.665 --> 00:36:31.320
And we actually hosted our
product manager, Vladimir, on

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.570
the show a little earlier.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:35.990
We're trying to get a commitment
from him, as well.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:39.730
But we didn't get a firm
commitment, because these

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:43.000
things tend to have a
life of their own.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.650
We are certainly working with
trusted testers right now.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:51.440
And I think there is a very
strong desire to launch in Q4,

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.140
but we don't have a firm
date in mind just yet.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:57.530
But stay tuned.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:01.840
We will definitely have more
about API v3 coming up on this

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.500
show as well.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.460
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Cool.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:06.022
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:37:06.022 --> 00:37:07.800
JEREMY WALKER: Actually, I was
going to say, I'll be talking

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:08.720
a little bit--

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.720
I think you were going to talk
a little bit about this.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.830
But this weekend, I'll be
talking at the Silicon Valley

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:17.160
Code Camp here in California.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.250
And I'm actually going to talk
a little bit about version 3

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.450
for any beginners out there
that don't know much about

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:25.770
YouTube or the benefits of
integrating it into their

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:29.190
apps, and coding a little
bit against it.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:33.420
I'm going to show some basic
examples of version 3 and how

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.730
easy it is to use.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:39.360
So if you're around Los Altos
and want to see that, that's

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.905
this Saturday at the Silicon
Valley Code Camp.

00:37:41.905 --> 00:37:42.760
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, great.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.880
So it sounds like if you're not
a trusted tester, in the

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.680
meantime, you can come to their
event at Silicon Valley

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.220
Code Camp, and see you doing
some live coding with v3

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.820
version of the API, ask
some questions.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.620
JEREMY WALKER: Yep.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:58.520
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sounds good.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.330
Now, another event that we are
planning-- and this is a

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.820
special announcement for you
guys watching, since on this

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:11.650
show, we tend to share
information before it goes out

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:15.150
to our standard channels, for
those of you who are watching

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.240
us every week.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.810
We are actually planning to
have a hackathon in Los

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:23.320
Angeles later this month.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.490
We're looking at the last
weekend of October.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:30.840
So if anybody would like to
learn more about YouTube APIs,

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.860
we'll be showing v3 version of
the API, the new Player API.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:38.630
We're also looking to actually
have some Google

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:41.420
TV folks with us.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:46.310
So if you are looking into
coding a large-screen

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:49.010
application, you can
do that as well.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:50.820
We will shortly be
hearing some more

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.390
information about it.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.790
But if you're in Southern
California or you're planning

00:38:55.790 --> 00:39:00.410
to be around, please book the
last weekend of October and

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:01.480
come join us.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.210
Let's do some coding at the
Google offices in Venice,

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:07.326
California, end of this month.

00:39:07.326 --> 00:39:08.950
JEREMY WALKER: Great, yeah.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:09.820
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.390
So let's see.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:17.160
I think there is a couple of
questions in the moderator.

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:23.610
JEREMY WALKER: Yes, well, the
first one is related to

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.145
hiring, actually.

00:39:25.145 --> 00:39:28.960
The question is, is
YouTube and Google

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.275
Developer Relations hiring?

00:39:31.275 --> 00:39:32.730
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes,
we are hiring.

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:37.900
More information is at
developers.google.com/jobs, so

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.540
you can see all the positions
that we actually are

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.010
recruiting for actively
right now.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:47.960
And not only for YouTube, but
also for Google Developer

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.940
Relations in general, so there's
a lot of product teams

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:51.930
that are hiring.

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:54.910
So if you're interested in
joining, please check out

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:57.510
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.250
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:59.410
And we have one more.

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:02.160
The question is, how many
viewers are in the class?

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.380
And I think they're referencing
the class I was

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.440
talking about, the Code Camp.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.340
Right now, I think there's going
to be about 30 people

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.900
that have already registered,
just for my particular class.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.400
I mean, obviously, there's
tons of classes in this

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.400
weekend getaway.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.210
Some up to 60.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.710
So it may increase.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:28.440
But it won't be an overly
large class.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.040
So if you need a little--

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.970
you want to come by and talk
to me afterwards, I'll be

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:33.704
there to help out.

00:40:33.704 --> 00:40:34.550
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:38.720
Special one on one assistance
from Jeremy.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.612
JEREMY WALKER: Yes.

00:40:39.612 --> 00:40:40.500
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.520
So I think we have exhausted
the questions for today.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.520
If anything else comes up,
then please let us know.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.340
Otherwise, we'll see you next
week, same time, Wednesday

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.050
10:00 AM Pacific.

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:59.520
Special thanks to our guests,
Steve and Kimberly.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.895
Thank you so much for joining.

00:41:00.895 --> 00:41:02.375
KIMBERLY PETERSON: Thanks
for having us.

00:41:02.375 --> 00:41:04.090
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Behind the
camera, we actually have

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:08.220
Jeffrey Posnick from New York
City, for those of you that

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.430
were hoping he was going to
be on the show today.

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:13.400
Actually, he was the live
streaming producer

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.960
live from New York.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.310
STEVE ROSENBAUM: And by the way,
he didn't cough at all.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:16.615
No coughing.

00:41:16.615 --> 00:41:17.290
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Ah, yes.

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:17.920
No coughing.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.890
That's very encouraging.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.500
Jeff, I think we are looking
forward to your full recovery

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:23.865
in time for the cold season.

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:27.140
All right.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.210
Thank you very much.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:28.680
JEREMY WALKER: Thank you.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:29.670
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Have a good day.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:30.920
STEVE ROSENBAUM: Bye, guys.
