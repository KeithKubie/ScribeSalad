00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.149
The media is tripping over a new study finding
that LSD may lower anxiety.

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:09.240
Get it?

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.549
Tripping?

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.379
I'm Cristen Conger of Stuff Mom Never Told
You in today for DNews.

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.349
The results of a Swiss study examining the
impact of LSD therapy on anxiety among terminally

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.140
ill cancer patients has attracted a swarm
of media attention even though it was too

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.619
small-scale to yield conclusive results.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.810
Research on LSD has been largely shut down
in the United States ever since the psychedelic

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.690
drug became illegal in 1966.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.210
But recently, researchers have begun taking
closer looks at the possible medical benefits

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.800
of banned drugs like LSD.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.120
Take psilocybin, a hallucinogenic cousin to
LSD and the key ingredient in "magic mushrooms."

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.480
It has also been shown to have therapeutic
potential.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.330
A 2010 study also conducted on a small group
of cancer patients suggested the psychedelic

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.839
compound may also ease anxiety, and a 2012
study examining MRI scans of people while

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.210
tripping on it found that it appears to calm
down brain areas associated with depression.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.750
Considering that its street name is ecstasy,
it's not too surprising that the drug MDMA

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.170
might also assist with anxiety and post-traumatic
stress disorder, or PTSD.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.469
A recently published study compared fMRI brain
scans of participants both on and off MDMA

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:33.790
and found that the drug seemed to make happy
memories happier and sad memories less sad.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.260
The researchers suspect the pain-dampening
effect has to do with how MDMA lowers blood

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.799
flow to the brain's limbic system that helps
regulate our emotional reactions.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.579
A lesser-known drug that's received attention
from the medical community is ayahuasca, a

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.189
psychedelic blend of plants developed by native
peoples of Amazonian Peru commonly associated

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.460
with spiritual enlightenment by those who've
taken it.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.889
Ayahuasca ceremonies were also used in a 2013
study on substance abuse.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:07.119
For the dozen study participants, taking ayahuasca
was correlated with greater long-term feelings

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.140
of hopefulness and improved quality of life.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.860
Self-reported tobacco, alcohol and cocaine
use also diminished.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.890
Marijuana habits, however, persisted -- which
brings us to the last drug on our list which

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.580
might not even be illegal, depending on where
you live.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.040
Various studies have indicated that weed might
be helpful not only for pain management and

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.380
nausea suppression among chemotherapy patients,
but also for soothing anxiety, depression,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.560
bipolar disorder.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.570
Pot -- or the THC in pot, that is -- may even
be an effective treatment for autoimmune disorders

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.490
and multiple sclerosis.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.230
But remember kids, many of these studies are
preliminary AND there also are negative side

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.520
effects to all of these drugs, hence them
being classified as controlled substances.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.061
Do think illegal drugs could actually be "good"
for us?

00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:58.150
