00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.190
You guys!

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.430
You've probably heard about the impossible
drive or the Em Drive, we literally just did

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.430
a video about it.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.880
But there's already an update!

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.360
Hey spaced-out DNews fans, Trace here for
a DNews update.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.870
This past weekend, we posted this video about
the EmDrive -- a resonant cavity thruster

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.840
that should allegedly move through space without
expelling matter to push against, potentially

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.950
violating a basic law of Newtonian Physics! It's a great video.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.390
What timing we had though!

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.349
Because, several hours before we put the video
up, NASA's paper on the so-called 'impossible

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.660
drive' hit the hot sheets of the American
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics’

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.449
Journal of Propulsion and Power! One of my favorites.

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:45.559
One of my favorites. NASA's Eagleworks Laboratories
in Houston assayed the thrust from a 'Q-Thruster'.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.600
Q-Thrusters are quantum vacuum plasma thrusters:
according to NASA theories, Q-thrusters push

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.359
off quantum particles to generate movement...

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.050
Like a propeller for the quantum ocean of
space.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.460
This  family of thrusters includes the EmDrive,
but also other designs like the Cannae and

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.670
Mach-Lorentz drives.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.100
So, the Q-thruster NASA tested produced approximately
1.2 millinewtons per kilowatt.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.780
That's pretty significant.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.580
It's "two orders of magnitude" more other
out-there techs like light sails (which use

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.510
the power of the solar wind or lasers), but
less than the potential of ion-thrusters that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.000
shoot individual charged particles; and technically
ion thrusters aren't propellant free anyway.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.100
You can see videos on all of these things here on DNews.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.260
To test this, they put their Q-Thruster on
a low-thrust torsion pendulum, basically its an

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.950
uber-balanced rotational arm to measure micronewton
thrust.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.000
The pendulum was balanced perfectly to give
the thruster experiment the illusion of zero-gravity

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.270
conditions, and then the whole setup was placed
inside a vacuum chamber to eliminate any movement

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.270
of air.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.280
They even dampened any quote "harmonic" or
"oscillatory" motions, as well as vibration.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.880
And they registered 1.2 millinewtons per kilowatt.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.200
They then ran a bunch of experiments to make
sure the thrust they measured wasn't simply

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.230
expansion due to heat, electricity running
through the system, or anything else they

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.920
could think of… they even called it out
in the paper: saying errors could be from radio frequencies

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.730
bouncing off the inside of the vacuum chamber,
magnetic interaction from the power cables,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.490
heating of the pendulum itself, unaccounted-for
vibrations, electrostatic interaction, outgassing,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.540
even stray photons were accounted for!

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.550
And they still registered 1.2 millinewtons
per kilowatt!

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.620
But before you celebrate in the streets, a
published paper does not mean the 'impossible

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.650
drive' is perfect, or even that it works.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.491
Mostly, what the publishing of a paper indicates
is, an experiment was reviewed by the researchers'

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:43.700
peers and found to be valid, meaning no obvious
experimental eff-ups.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.020
The researchers even admitted they still need
to account for the heating of the components,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.610
but holy crap.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.300
This thing could work!

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.240
True propellantless propulsion could mean
we could get to the moon in hours, to Mars

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.240
in days!

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.850
But before you get excited scientists aren't
yet convinced and until they rule out all

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.160
the errors they can think of, they're going
to keep researching.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.430
So watch this space.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.470

thing and want to know WTF is this emDrive
