00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.790
I hope you enjoyed thinknig about this question.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.480
And I also hope you came up with something

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.075
resembling the right answer. Now overall you should

00:00:07.075 --> 00:00:10.570
have gathered from all this information that a genetic

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.120
susceptibility is prominent for type two diabetes here.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.310
Remember, a higher heritability value, anything over 0.5 indicates

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.160
a larger variance between the monozygotic and dizygotic twins.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.450
Anything over 0.5 indicates something that's more genetically influenced.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.180
Anything less than 0.5 would be more environmental.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.049
We also have information from our monozygotic, dizygotic twin

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.444
concordances. Notice that we have from 70 to 90%

00:00:34.444 --> 00:00:38.430
for monozygotic. And something significantly less for the dizygotic

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.410
twins. Again, this is indicative of a genetic component.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.770
We even know, from our GWAS study, that there

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.120
are about 50 genetic factors influencing the trait. Now,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.590
each one has a small effect, but that doesn't

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.730
mean it's any less genetic. It just means that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.880
we have a lot of genetic factors contributing a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.240
small amount individually. So given this explanation, I want

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.320
you to tell me. Look at your answer from the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.250
question. How satisfied are you with your own answer

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.160
on a scale from one to five with one

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.090
not being at all satisfied and five being completely

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.810
satisfied. I want to know how you think you did.
