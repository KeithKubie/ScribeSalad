00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.890
Hey, what's going on it's Bill Burr?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.820
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, April 10th,

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.660
2017 what's going on? How is ya? How's it going everybody?

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.050
Are you doing good? I apologize that the podcast is late.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.640
I apologize that it's late. I e. A I was flying back from San Antonio.

6
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:21.720
I meant to do it yesterday,

7
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:25.890
but I was doing a tour San Antonio and the day got away from me, you know,

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.920
I was going all around San Antonio. Went out to Jeff,

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.050
right drum shop.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.130
I got some Mexican food around the corner that was fucking delicious.

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.420
Um, I forget the name of that place, but it's going to be on the video.

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.550
Then it went down to the river walk and over to the stupid fucking Alamo,

13
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.860
Jesus Christ, just crawling with fucking tourist reenactors,

14
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.970
all kinds of magnets and shit. And I just was like, you know,

15
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:55.500
every time I go to San Antonio, I was like,

16
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:58.890
I'm gonna fucking go in there and I'm going to read up on all these guys who

17
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:01.950
fought to the last guy I'm going to read up on. Every time I get there,

18
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.670
there's like 9,000 people in jeans, shorts as a fucking gift shop.

19
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:09.150
And I just say forget it. And I felt bad about it. Like, Hey, what do you know?

20
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:12.130
What do you not patriotic, they bill, you know?

21
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.550
But then I ran into somebody from San Antonio, do you ever go onto this thing?

22
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:20.320
They go, no, we live here. And I was like, oh, I get it now. I get it.

23
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.480
The Alamo is your time square. If like nobody in New York goes to Times Square.

24
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.950
Okay.

25
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.950
Nobody in La goes to fucking Disneyland or fucking universal unless you have

26
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:35.390
kids. But I mean, just as an adult, you're not going to have Gina,

27
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.770
she's going to fucking go there. You know?

28
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.640
You don't stand in line in your own fucking town. Okay.

29
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.930
One of the advantages of it being your own fucking town is you don't have to

30
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:47.690
stand in line with everybody else. Cause you know all the spots.

31
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.300
You know where to go, you know where not to go.

32
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.700
And when you're in San Antonio, where not to go is the fucking Alamo,

33
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.710
unless you're a goddamn tourist.

34
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.640
Then you go in there and then you're going to go over to the riverwalk,

35
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.800
which is actually for a touristy thing, was very nice. Then Manmade River,

36
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.330
I've got to tell you something. That's the first time I walked down and I,

37
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.410
I liked it. I really enjoyed it.

38
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.560
There was a bunch of people standing outside getting a little hustle going on,

39
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:15.440
trying to get you to go in and drink a Margarita, right?

40
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.900
All kinds of wacky people wearing the hats.

41
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.830
People driving by on the little gondolas, you know, it was like you went Venice,

42
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.600
but it was Texas, right? That little slice of fucking Italy,

43
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.980
you know? And then right around the corner was the majestic. Yeah,

44
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.570
very ornate. The word only used to describe a theater. Very ornate. Hey,

45
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:40.870
my buddy reads, did his garage. Oh, it's, it's beautiful. It's so ornate.

46
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.030
Nobody ever says that right. To take, they call it a fucking man cave. Okay.

47
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:48.330
So the man caves for fucking, you know, the twinkle toes there.

48
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.560
The Broadway stars are these theaters and this thing had like a, I mean,

49
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:54.200
I had like fucking houses and she looks on Peter Pan Stuff. Yeah,

50
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.540
it was amazing. And evidently while I was on stage,

51
00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:03.541
there was a flying around that went past me and aside the fact that it was a bat

52
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.450
, like nobody even reacted. They're so used to bats down there. Evidently they,

53
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.720
uh, they kill all the fucking mosquitoes around, enough of them,

54
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.060
you know what I mean? So people in San Antonio evidently cool with bats.

55
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.860
I don't know, but I had two great shows.

56
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.040
The first show went awesome in the second show was just fucking next level.

57
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.450
And I actually texted my agent, I was like, the hour's ready. And he was like,

58
00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:28.350
really? And I'm like, yes. So let's fill up the calendar. They have, fuck,

59
00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:33.330
oh no, that's not how I talked to my agent. Um, I go, let's fill up the,

60
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.960
you know, let's fill up the fucking calendars. So his mission should,

61
00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:40.230
he chooses to, to accept that he's going to fill up my calendar and then,

62
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.680
and I gave him the list of the eight teams that I have left that I need to go

63
00:03:46.201 --> 00:03:49.350
see. All right, so if you're on this list,

64
00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:53.310
I'll be doing a show at some point within the next fucking year cause I'm

65
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.240
knocking these out in the next year before my daughter starts walking and

66
00:03:57.241 --> 00:04:00.060
talking and doing all that stuff. I've got to knock this out.

67
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.900
So I need the Toronto Raptors, the Ottawa

68
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.810
play in my Boston Bruins and the first round of the playoffs.

69
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:13.310
Congratulations to both teams making the playoffs. It's a big deal. Playoffs.

70
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.920
Oh wait, no, no, no. Wait. Are we playing them? I think we are playing them,

71
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:20.100
which makes no fucking sense to me. Fucking hockey.

72
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.790
If we like the aide seats, should we play the capitols?

73
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:28.290
Shouldn't the capitals be rewarded that they won their fucking division rather

74
00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:31.380
than having to play the fucking penguins and then they knock one another out and

75
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:34.110
all we got to do is try and get past the senators. No disrespect,

76
00:04:34.111 --> 00:04:38.040
but disrespect intended. I'm just being honest. All right,

77
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:41.400
let's check this shit out right now. Okay? You know this isn't gonna work.

78
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.370
You know it's not, you know I'm going to be on the wrong fucking one.

79
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:46.440
The Boston Celtics are a second seed.

80
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.060
They're a fucking second seed there. All right. Hang on a second.

81
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.100
N H l play off

82
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.370
bracket. All right. Here we go and fail NHL.

83
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.000
Fucking play off bracket. All right. Yes.

84
00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:07.400
This is what the fuck I want you to make me click on it again.

85
00:05:07.401 --> 00:05:10.490
I typed what I wanted and then you're like, is this what you want? Yes, this is,

86
00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:15.440
this is what I want. All right. The ranges of versus Canadians.

87
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.400
The Bruins. Get the senators. I don't get it. Capital's get the maple leaves.

88
00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:22.250
Okay. All right. All right. All right. I thought, and then Cole,

89
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.820
there's a good one. Columbus first.

90
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.880
The penguins that [inaudible] Nashville predators made a plan of spleen,

91
00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:33.830
the black cocks, Minnesota wild versus Saint Louis blue. And I'm ducks first.

92
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.790
The Calgary flames and the San Jose shacks verse Edmonton Oilers.

93
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.820
Here we go. Brad Marshawn is back in all of that shit. So anyways,

94
00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:48.320
yeah, I've got to get the Toronto Raptors auto senators. I gotta get, uh,

95
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.780
the Brooklyn Nets. I've already seen the New Jersey Nets,

96
00:05:50.781 --> 00:05:53.330
but my rule is if you get a new stadium, I don't give a fuck.

97
00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:57.950
I'll eventually see it. But if you move to a new city, especially a state,

98
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.093
<v 1>you know,</v>

99
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.940
<v 0>then yeah, I got to go fucking see you again. All right.</v>

100
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.390
I need the Carolina Hurricanes, Orlando Magic,

101
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.280
Tampa Bay Buccaneers,

102
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.070
the Memphis Grizzlies and the New Orleans Pelicans.

103
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.740
So there you go. So I'm going to try to get, you know,

104
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.820
I'll probably do the Canadian ones at the same trip and I'll try to do the

105
00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:25.480
fucking, um, Orlando Tampa at the same time.

106
00:06:25.481 --> 00:06:28.960
Then I think I'm going to do a bus trip to knock out those fucking three

107
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.710
Carolina fucking Memphis and New Orleans. I think that's,

108
00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:37.300
that's what I'm going to do. And then I'll be done. And then what we'd do both,

109
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:40.540
well you know what I'll do is I'll move on to fucking college. All right.

110
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.420
Cause the day I go out on the road and I don't have something to fucking look

111
00:06:43.421 --> 00:06:46.240
forward to and I just sit in the Goddamn hotel waiting for the show. That's it.

112
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.030
I'm going to dry up. You hear me dry?

113
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

114
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.611
<v 0>So anyways,</v>

115
00:06:53.611 --> 00:06:58.410
I got Boise coming up and I just got an email from the theater via my agent

116
00:06:58.411 --> 00:07:00.840
saying, Hey, we've been watching these videos, seen a bill,

117
00:07:00.841 --> 00:07:02.040
likes to play the drums.

118
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.550
What if we rented a drum kit and put it in the theater during the day and if

119
00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:08.790
Phil wants to play during the day, he can come in and play for like an hour.

120
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.860
How fucking great is that?

121
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.330
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

122
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.330
<v 0>it's the coolest thing ever. I might, I'm up it my put that on my fucking rider.</v>

123
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.520
I don't give a shit how much it costs cause this is the thing, they always say,

124
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.560
hey, we'll do that for you. And then they just, you know,

125
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.690
they pay me less money. That's how it works.

126
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.700
Nope. God Damn it. This isn't in fucking stereo. I just realized it.

127
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.600
Wait a sec. Wait a second. She let me see something there. We,

128
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.750
oh, you fucking son of a bitch.

129
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

130
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:42.580
<v 0>That's not it. How do I get this thing in stereo? You know,</v>

131
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.860
this is just one of these fucking days, isn't it?

132
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.830
Isn't it just one of these days? Now I'm just going to push your buttons.

133
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.330
What's going on there it is. Now it's in Stereo.

134
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.130
Oh, Jesus Christ. I thought there was something wrong with the wire.

135
00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.850
My fault. Well, you had to suffer for seven 53. I'll let you,

136
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.910
I'll just say that it isn't, you know, the scene of something.

137
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:06.700
You know what's great about it? It'll give you something to complain about,

138
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.740
you know, unless the Great Andrew Themis fixes the fucking thing. I Dunno.

139
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.910
Anyways, plowing ahead here. Um,

140
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.790
so what else? Okay, so I went down there and I saw, uh,

141
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.270
I saw a lot of San Antonio this time. And like I said,

142
00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:26.830
I had great fucking shows. You know what? Who's kidding, who? I lost.

143
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.000
I completely lost my train of thought cause now I'm fucking mad at myself.

144
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:31.950
Why didn't I think to just fucking push that button?

145
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.670
I immediately thought it was the wire. I troubleshooted

146
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:41.580
I never knowingly lied about the wire. Um, all right,

147
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.920
so now I know what you guys are thinking. Hey Bill, you don't,

148
00:08:43.921 --> 00:08:46.710
you said that you were going to watch some alternative sports this weekend.

149
00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:48.780
You said you were going to watch them masters,

150
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.490
the Moto GP and fucking Formula One. Well,

151
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.080
all fucking Billy freckled

152
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.510
<v 2>the fat tinted, no gluten, heaven fucking cunt. I did two out of three.</v>

153
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.050
I watched the moto GP. You know what's hilarious?

154
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:07.500
I didn't realize that there was two undercard motorcycle races and I'm sitting

155
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.130
there going like, this fucking race has only 20 laps. What's going on here?

156
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:15.840
Right. The first one was the GP three then are some the moto three,

157
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.960
then the moto too, and then a, then there was the last one.

158
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:21.540
So I kind of fast forward through the first two. And then I watched the whole,

159
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.280
um, I watched the whole a moto GP. Uh, the real fucking one.

160
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.130
And, uh, congratulations to,

161
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.940
I don't even know how to say this guy's named maverick finales.

162
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.410
You know, I saw that mark, mark and Berg, whatever his fucking name is,

163
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:40.800
he was cruising around and all of a sudden he just didn't make this turn and he

164
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:45.060
was very upset with himself. That's his name. Mark Menendez.

165
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.580
That's not who it is. That's the guy. I'll kill this fucking

166
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:49.243
<v 3>okay.</v>

167
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.320
<v 2>When he killed his parents, I don't know what happened. And then, uh,</v>

168
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:58.000
Valentino Rossi came in second and both of them stay seemed very excited about

169
00:09:58.001 --> 00:09:59.530
that. You know what I mean? They got some points.

170
00:09:59.531 --> 00:10:01.870
They felt good about themselves. And, uh,

171
00:10:01.871 --> 00:10:04.660
I gotta tell you something about those fucking guys and you gotta check out the

172
00:10:04.661 --> 00:10:05.494
Moto GP.

173
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:11.670
It's unfucking the amount of crashes that I saw in all three of those races.

174
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.310
<v 3>Okay.</v>

175
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.780
<v 2>There was one guy who has gone through the turn.</v>

176
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.490
He started to accelerate in the back end, kind of kicked a little bit.

177
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.510
So he got off it. Then he got back on it and the fucking, the God damn bike had,

178
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:22.530
I had a seizure,

179
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.380
fucking did a couple of little ss and then just like started flipping over and

180
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:30.840
then the guy of course fee flies off the damn thing.

181
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.830
It hits them in the back of the head. It amazes me that they get back up again.

182
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.970
Those suits they have are incredible. They got little air bags in them and shit,

183
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.940
but still they always end up fucking up their hands or their ankles if something

184
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:45.810
like that. But this guy kind of high sided on it, which is basically, you know,

185
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:48.840
if you're a novice like me when they just sort of lay it down and the bike

186
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:50.280
starts sliding and then you just Kinda,

187
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.690
you just touched the ground and slide with the fucking thing high sidings when

188
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:57.840
it hits the ground and you fucking catapult over the top of it,

189
00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:01.290
the high side of it. And that's when you get, seems to me,

190
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.430
that's when you get fucking hurt. Um, it's ridiculous.

191
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.480
They're going like 200 miles an hour in something that you can just fall off of.

192
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.900
Um, but I enjoyed the race immensely.

193
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.020
I enjoyed that race as much as you guys probably didn't enjoy the first seven

194
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:20.490
minutes, 53 seconds of fucking no stereo on this. Um,

195
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.980
I n I then I watched,

196
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:28.010
I watched the masters too and I could not be happier for Sergio Garcia.

197
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:29.790
I mean, I just, you know,

198
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.680
it's one of the things about being at his level when you go that long without

199
00:11:34.681 --> 00:11:37.710
winning is that gives you every, it gives every mouth breathing.

200
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:41.940
Haagen daas eating fucking douchebag who never achieved anything.

201
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.480
The right to walk up to you and start telling you about how you can't get it

202
00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:47.070
done. You know what I mean?

203
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:50.520
Sitting there wearing a wifebeater with your flabby grandmother fucking arms.

204
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.070
You know, just giving this

205
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.050
<v 0>guy shit. When he missed that one on 18, I was like, Oh God, Oh boy, here we go.</v>

206
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.870
Here we go. Shades it Kenny Perry. Is this what we're going to see again?

207
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.690
And actually every year when I watched the masters, you know,

208
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.600
I don't watch it every year. I shouldn't say that, but every time I watch it,

209
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.900
somebody always folds in the back nine and I actually get mad at the tournament.

210
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.870
I always ended up, you know, I was actually texting my,

211
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.580
I was texting up court who did the a live, um,

212
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.360
final day of the masters and I was just like, dude,

213
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.550
can somebody just win this fucking event?

214
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:31.870
Does anybody ever just win the masters? No one ever wins the masters.

215
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:35.860
Somebody fucking loses it every year. And you just have to watch somebody.

216
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.720
Like a buddy of mine tested me, uh, texted me, tested, texted me and said,

217
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.420
uh, is Sergio doesn't win this playoff. He said, that punt,

218
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.480
that pot will haunt him. It's like, no, it won't. It will.

219
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:52.820
But you know what's going to haunt him is every cheesecake factory eating Douche

220
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.510
, douchebag walking up to him, Hey, remember that time,

221
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.270
you know, giving him shit, right.

222
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.870
Not realizing that that miss pot is a fucking metaphor for the other person's

223
00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:08.350
entire goddamn existence. This guy has played in over 70 something majors.

224
00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:09.184
So anyway,

225
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.730
it's just like watching Phil Mickelson when it way back in the day in like, oh,

226
00:13:12.731 --> 00:13:15.190
four was so great to watch him get the monkey off his back.

227
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:18.280
So congratulations to him. Um,

228
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.580
winning the most difficult activity known to man playing the non-sport that is

229
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:25.834
golf.

230
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.863
<v 4>Okay.</v>

231
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.780
<v 0>You know, I still had to give a shit, right? It's such them. I know.</v>

232
00:13:30.781 --> 00:13:34.830
It's such a duty. It's so hard. It's such, it's a fucking mind. Fuck,

233
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.010
I get it. I get it.

234
00:13:38.011 --> 00:13:42.250
But I would rather have to do that than face a fucking roided up. Uh,

235
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.630
uh, well, he never got convicted, so

236
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.470
Kadra remens right. Roger Lemons.

237
00:13:52.471 --> 00:13:57.330
Right. I wouldn't want that guy thrown half a fucking bad at me, you know,

238
00:13:57.331 --> 00:14:00.210
just muttering explicative as I walk up to the plate,

239
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.930
I would much rather have to try to sink a fucking three foot,

240
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.650
then some fucking roided up maniac on the goddamn mount who can admit that as

241
00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:11.880
fucking career's over.

242
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.600
So he's got to go out and take some fucking horse tranquilizers.

243
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.970
Not saying that he did it, and you know what if he did, God bless them.

244
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.880
God bless him that he did. I am. I am so fucking, I told you I'm pro steroids,

245
00:14:23.881 --> 00:14:26.490
dude. I'm fucking pretty. Everybody should get on them.

246
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:32.460
You know I want every fucking athlete on steroids. Okay.

247
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.850
And then the doctors can look at you and see what the side effects are and they

248
00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:39.480
can gradually make them better and better and better and better until it's like

249
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:41.160
vaporized weed. You know,

250
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.210
you just have like a steroid mist and meet with my fucked up shoulder.

251
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:48.060
You know what I mean? I'll just come in and just walk into the doctor's office.

252
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.440
You know, they'll put a fucking hot towel over head.

253
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:54.770
Like I have hay fever and then they'll just have me breathing steroids.

254
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.033
I'll walk out,

255
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.990
I'll have glutes again after 20 years of sitting on my ass and planes and rental

256
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:07.550
cars, my fucking glutes will come back. That just like nonexistent.

257
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:10.500
I don't know what happened. I just fucking like, you know like a,

258
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.040
when you're going to make something and you got to pound out like a fucking

259
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:13.880
chicken breast. Yeah.

260
00:15:13.881 --> 00:15:18.170
That's what my fucking ass is like after years of being on a plane. So, um,

261
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.950
I actually made my way across to the gym when I was in San Antonio to their

262
00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:26.180
sister property sister property.

263
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:27.650
I mean the other hotel

264
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.070
fucking Weirdos. Anyways, and I went in there,

265
00:15:33.071 --> 00:15:38.071
I did the elliptical for about 40 minutes and then I just did a fucking for me,

266
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:43.840
for me, I did a savage fucking leg workout and now I, I, you know,

267
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.300
I know you guys all think of, well, what did you do below? All right,

268
00:15:46.301 --> 00:15:48.880
this is what I did. I add the exercise ball,

269
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.380
I put it on the fucking wall between me and my back and then I would just roll

270
00:15:53.381 --> 00:15:56.650
down with that, you know, so I can keep my back nice and straight and my,

271
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:57.940
my weight on my heels,

272
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:02.950
pushing through my heels to engage my veal fucking buttocks.

273
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:04.903
<v 1>Okay.</v>

274
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.210
<v 0>Um, there, what did I do? I did hip thrusts after that, you know,</v>

275
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.350
then I did, uh, some calf raises.

276
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.560
Then I did the classic, you know, the things you sit down,

277
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.230
where you do the front parts of your quads, and then the other one,

278
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.510
you stick them in your fucking go the other way.

279
00:16:24.511 --> 00:16:29.250
You do the back part of your legs. And then I got on this the squat machine.

280
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.260
I'll, I don't like don't let you stand up on,

281
00:16:31.261 --> 00:16:33.600
I like the one that you sit down on affiliate, you can go deeper.

282
00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:37.550
You don't have to worry about your fucking back. And uh, and I did that.

283
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.170
I did fucking three sets of all of that shit. And uh,

284
00:16:40.171 --> 00:16:43.740
this morning my legs were definitely killing me. Um,

285
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.400
so that's a new part of my workout. Okay. That's what I'm doing.

286
00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.520
But I don't have all those leg machines when I'm here, you know what I mean?

287
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.630
And my shoulder is fucked up,

288
00:16:51.631 --> 00:16:54.660
so I'm not putting a barbell on my back with a bunch of fucking weight. Okay.

289
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.441
I will just,

290
00:16:55.441 --> 00:17:00.150
I will choose to do more squats without any weight because I am an old man.

291
00:17:00.151 --> 00:17:03.210
But I swear to God, I swear to God, man,

292
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.380
this fucking athletes, man, they got gotta keep taking steroids. You know,

293
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.650
just like the singers, you know, a singer can't sing a song. What do they do?

294
00:17:10.651 --> 00:17:14.220
Give her, give her a little bit of fucking steroids right in the throat.

295
00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.070
Give her throat deal right there. Fred, what happened? She fucking,

296
00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:21.650
she goes out there and starts singing a song. She makes it simple.

297
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.870
And you know what, in the last, the whole night long, sorry. Um,

298
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.500
and then lastly, for alternative sports at,

299
00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.900
I thought I'd take the fucking Formula One race in Shanghai, China,

300
00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:35.330
and I didn't fucking pisses me off. So all I did was I just watched the,

301
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:40.170
the highlights. So, uh, congratulations to Lewis Hamilton, him and the, uh,

302
00:17:40.171 --> 00:17:41.690
the guy that won the Australia, they couldn't, you know,

303
00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.410
they came in one and two and now they just flipped.

304
00:17:43.411 --> 00:17:47.250
So they're tied with 43 points. The fuck's his name. I should know his name.

305
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.580
He only want a god damn race. Right. That's all right.

306
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.750
Sebastian Vettel for the Ferrari team.

307
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:59.580
They're tied at 43 and Max Verstappen is 25th,

308
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.580
25 points. I'm sorry. In third place.

309
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.680
And a fucking Rikki rocket is in fits place.

310
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.980
Kimmy Raikkonen now he's not the guy called who's a guy called fucking Ricky

311
00:18:13.981 --> 00:18:18.720
rocket. Nico Rosberg. No, Nico Rosberg fucking, yeah, I don't fucking know.

312
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:21.440
There's too many God damn sports going around my head now. Anyways,

313
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:26.340
the playoffs in NHL Stat, we play in Ottawa. I like her goddamn chances.

314
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:29.280
I heard that defense has a little banged up according to Joe Barton Dick on the

315
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:33.270
puck off podcast. I'll be watching all of those. I'll be tweeting,

316
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.210
I'll be fucking Facebook and I won't be doing any of that shit,

317
00:18:36.211 --> 00:18:41.030
but maybe I will. Um, so anyways, ate pretty good when I was on the road now.

318
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.880
So he kinda bed, you know, I had that Mexican food and was just fucking,

319
00:18:44.881 --> 00:18:47.340
you know, I used to, you know, I used to always make fun eye and the tour,

320
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:50.010
I was making fun of like Mexican food as far as like, you know,

321
00:18:50.011 --> 00:18:52.860
the fried green beans in the, in the race that they put in the plate.

322
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.390
And I was just like, you know what this shit is,

323
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.020
this is Mexico's version of Coleslaw. You know, a Coleslaw.

324
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:02.430
Like most people don't take it seriously. It's basically, it's a plate filler.

325
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.030
You know, you got your piece of meat, you got your vegetable,

326
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.800
and then they just throw that shit. They're just so,

327
00:19:07.801 --> 00:19:09.930
the plate doesn't look naked. You know what I mean? Yo, wow.

328
00:19:09.931 --> 00:19:12.320
Look at this big plate of food I got. No, no, no. That's Mike.

329
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:17.040
More than 60% rice and beans. I didn't get it. All right then.

330
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:19.590
Once I understand now you mix all that shit in together.

331
00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:22.530
He grabbed one of those little fucking round pieces of bread,

332
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:24.780
whatever the fuck you call it. You put it on there, you know,

333
00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:28.080
a little bit of hot sauce. It's delicious. You got a little bean and rice.

334
00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:32.310
Fucking a fucking thing. They're thinking of a Jig. Sorry, I'm white.

335
00:19:32.311 --> 00:19:35.640
I don't know. I'll learn it. I've only been out in La for 10 years.

336
00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:39.660
At some point I'll, I'll, I'll learn it. Was that a Tostada? Um,

337
00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:43.770
I know what an Enchilada is. I know what a crispy Taco is.

338
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.730
She said crispy or puffy. Never had puffy before.

339
00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.700
Um, I always go crispy. You know what I mean? But the crispy Tacos, it's, it's,

340
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.050
it's only good on the first bite,

341
00:19:55.051 --> 00:19:58.080
cause then the whole fucking thing falls apart. You know what I mean?

342
00:19:58.081 --> 00:20:00.020
It's like an old person's hip. You barely touch it.

343
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.860
The whole thing just cracks and it doesn't work anymore.

344
00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:06.860
So you kinda gotta go soft Taco, right? The flacid Taco.

345
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.730
All right, I'm sorry.

346
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.730
But then if you mix the beans and rice in there is all I can say. It was,

347
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.280
it was God damn delicious. Let me, yeah,

451
00:26:35.601 --> 00:26:40.601
I flew for the first time and went up with an instructor and a holy shit.

452
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.280
Anybody out there who flies? I mean, Geez,

453
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.830
<v 0>I missed the fucking pad when I was coming in. I mean,</v>

454
00:26:46.831 --> 00:26:51.780
I missed it by probably 60 yards, just coming in way too fast. I was like,

455
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:54.210
I got, I guess settling with power. Fuck this.

456
00:26:54.211 --> 00:26:56.520
I just kind of continued on past it.

457
00:26:56.521 --> 00:27:00.060
Like you're supposed to came back around the next time. You know,

458
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.030
I came up a little short. It took me about, I don't know,

459
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:07.710
26 goes around till I was starting to feel it again. And uh, it was funny,

460
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:11.790
like my fourth times, I just flew the traffic pattern down there in long beach.

461
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.660
And um,

462
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.200
my fourth time around I was turning to go downwind and I just started laughing

463
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.030
and my instructor started laughing too, cause he knew I was laughing.

464
00:27:21.031 --> 00:27:24.240
I was just like, this is fucking awesome. She's fucking,

465
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.550
it's fucking awesome.

466
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:31.350
And it just totally re lit the fire in me to go do it.

467
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.540
And I'm going to try and fly again before the end of the month.

468
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:37.260
So if I can just kind of fly like once every 10 days or something while I'm

469
00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:41.520
getting the little one going, you know? Um, I would be very happy with that.

470
00:27:41.521 --> 00:27:42.150
It's such a,

471
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:47.100
it was such an accomplishment in my life to get my pilot's license.

472
00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:49.890
I would hate to just not do it and forget how to do it.

473
00:27:49.891 --> 00:27:53.250
It's so much fucking fun and it's really safe, you know what I mean?

474
00:27:53.251 --> 00:27:55.290
If you just do what they say, the way they maintain them.

475
00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:57.960
I know everybody always tries to freak out, but you know,

476
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.350
they always freaking and always freaking me out. Like, dude,

477
00:28:00.351 --> 00:28:02.770
be careful out there. Be careful. Oh yeah. Okay.

478
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:07.410
I was going to fly with a blindfold, you know, but I get it. I get it.

479
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.490
Anyways, so let's, um, let's plow ahead here. Um,

480
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.030
oh yeah. So I ended up, uh, you know,

481
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.400
I can't blow her head here cause I was gonna Start Doing the reeds and I'm only

482
00:28:17.401 --> 00:28:21.540
at 28 minutes, so I need to run my yap a little bit longer. So, um,

483
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:24.450
the, I think we flew the tab traffic pattern for like,

484
00:28:24.451 --> 00:28:25.890
just like a little over an hour.

485
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.280
I got a 1.1 on the Hobbs Meta and um, didn't do any autos.

486
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.620
It was just all low approach, you know, normal approach, steep approach.

487
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.590
That's all I was doing. And um,

488
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:43.200
it was fun flying the 22, which was my, that's my favorite one,

489
00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:47.370
even though the 44 is cool, you know, it's a nicer one.

490
00:28:47.371 --> 00:28:51.330
I just thought the to 22 is like driving an old sports car with no power

491
00:28:51.331 --> 00:28:55.440
windows, no power steering, fucking drum brakes.

492
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.950
I always just put that one. It's just like I'm whatever it's doing,

493
00:28:58.951 --> 00:29:00.030
I'm actually doing it.

494
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.080
I heard on some of those high end helicopters if you want to,

495
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.810
if you want to hover, you just push a button and it just does it for you.

496
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.530
That's the one you get when you get older. You know what I mean?

497
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.900
I don't want to shut there and draw it on a done. Um, all right. You know what?

498
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:17.400
I'm just going to start reading these fucking,

499
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.690
I'm going to start doing the reads here for the week. Oh, by the way,

500
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.640
what's the deal with all the haunted houses in San Antonio?

501
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.300
You know, it was the usual stuff as far as, uh,

502
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.480
as far as you know, Texas goes,

503
00:29:33.481 --> 00:29:36.870
Texas is the king of the shiny four door pickup truck that's never seen a

504
00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:41.590
construction site or off road in Texas.

505
00:29:41.591 --> 00:29:43.960
That's a four door sedan. Then I'll tell you,

506
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.940
they've got some fucking nice ones. I saw a guy pull up in a,

507
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.450
a Ford F150 four door. It's got giant tires on it.

508
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:55.420
This old fucking guy, big white cowboy hat,

509
00:29:55.930 --> 00:30:00.430
big fucking belt buckle in white cowboy boots. I was just like,

510
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.460
ah, this is Chris. You know, as a tourist. It's like,

511
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:06.940
that's what the fuck I wanted to see. Now I can say I went to Texas.

512
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:07.391
You know what I mean?

513
00:30:07.391 --> 00:30:09.310
I don't want to see somebody looking at their fucking iPhone.

514
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:13.900
I can do that out here. All right. Update Psycho from yogurt shop video.

515
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.370
All right, Bill. Turns out that Nutjob I don't even remember this.

516
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.120
Who was a costing the couple all, oh, that's right.

517
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:27.390
This goes back to like a couple podcasts ago where there was this woman who was

518
00:30:28.811 --> 00:30:31.450
trashing these two people for kissing in public.

519
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:36.060
Saying that it was sexual harassment and all of that type of stuff. And, uh,

520
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.760
I kind of agreed with her on, on a level. I just,

521
00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.980
I hate watching people kissing in public, you know what I mean?

522
00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:46.420
Give each other a quick peck, you know, going for one real one if you want to,

523
00:30:46.421 --> 00:30:48.280
but then just keep it moving. You know what I mean?

524
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:51.130
To literally sit there and take her to the point where her pussy is getting wet

525
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.780
and your Dick starts standing up. It's like,

526
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.990
what are you don't get the fuck out of here. It's gross.

527
00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.530
[inaudible] all over each other. I fucking can't stand it.

528
00:30:59.531 --> 00:31:04.450
I don't like it in movies, you know, it's disgusting. Um, anyways,

529
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.650
so here's an update for this lady flipped out and was yelling at them and you

530
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:10.090
know, it was, I don't know gonna call the cops.

531
00:31:10.091 --> 00:31:12.160
I couldn't get through the whole thing cause she looked like she was a little,

532
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:15.070
uh, you know, had some mental issues going on.

533
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.520
Some was going on and she was extremely lonely or somebody filled her up with

534
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:20.450
Jesus. I don't know what happened. Anyways, Bill,

535
00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:25.330
it turns out then that nutjob who was a costing the couple at the yogurt shop is

536
00:31:25.331 --> 00:31:29.050
an amateur porn actress, Eh,

537
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:34.051
boy and witnesses say that the guy only kissed his girlfriend on the forehead.

538
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.550
No lip service. Oh, all right. My fault.

539
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:39.970
And it wasn't the first time she's yelled at people in public.

540
00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:44.710
It took the interland like half a day to get to the bottom of it. Ah,

541
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.670
well that's too bad. Ah, that's too bad.

542
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:53.110
You know what I mean? You know what's weird about watching porn?

543
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:57.100
As much as you watch it, you know, nobody wants to do it. Nope.

544
00:31:57.101 --> 00:32:01.570
That was not a fucking job. All right, let me read this here. Go to the page.

545
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:07.940
Go to the page. That's what I sage. Alright,

546
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.700
here we go. Is it going to come up for me?

547
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.250
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

548
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:15.720
<v 0>Viral video of meltdown over four. How exactly did they figure out who she was?</v>

549
00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.900
How does the Internet get to the bottom of all of this stuff?

550
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:26.540
All right, here we go. Uh, recently a viral video video went viral.

551
00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.490
Having a meltdown over a forehead kiss. Yeah.

552
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.100
This all happened at a Santa Monica restaurant.

553
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.590
It goes so far to believe that the women omen is something, something,

554
00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.740
it seems screaming.

555
00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:46.740
<v 2>Oh Jesus Christ. Yeah. Come on man. It's not enough.</v>

556
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.380
It's not enough. She made an ass of herself. We gotta take it.

557
00:32:49.381 --> 00:32:50.850
I don't want to fucking know about this person.

558
00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:54.060
Feel bad for her if she turns a life around. All right. Update.

559
00:32:54.061 --> 00:32:56.880
Great Barrier Reef. It's time for another update.

560
00:32:56.881 --> 00:33:01.260
Sounds like your skepticism of the reports that it ain't all that bad was

561
00:33:01.261 --> 00:33:05.750
warranted. All right. The Great Barrier Reef. Yeah. This is more shit out.

562
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.200
I'm going to read about fucking people have gone crazy doing porn and I don't

563
00:33:10.201 --> 00:33:13.170
read about the fucking Great Barrier Reef dying. What are you guys doing to me?

564
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.200
I got another fucking 27 minutes to go. Oh my God.

565
00:33:19.201 --> 00:33:23.790
Is this the f? Oh Holy Shit. Okay. Great. Barrier Reef at terminal stage

566
00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:28.870
scientists' despair at latest coral bleaching data

567
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.320
Australia's politicians has betrayed the reef and only the people can save it.

568
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.800
Oh, I should read this cause maybe I dunno. Maybe they can turn it around.

569
00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.340
Cause there are uplifting stories about nature out there.

570
00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:45.700
You know where certain species are making a big comeback, you know what I mean?

571
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.530
All right. Back to back.

572
00:33:47.531 --> 00:33:52.030
Severe bleaching events have affected two thirds of Australia's Great Barrier

573
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.270
Reef. A new aerial survey have found the founding.

574
00:33:55.330 --> 00:34:00.280
The findings have caused alarm amongst scientists who say the proximity of the

575
00:34:00.281 --> 00:34:05.281
2016 and 2017 bleaching event is unprecedented for the reef and will give damage

576
00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.660
, coral little chance to recover. Um, all right.

577
00:34:10.661 --> 00:34:15.550
What site is this? This is called the Guardian. Now, what is their agenda?

578
00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.530
Yeah, I mean, you never know what the fucking believe here.

579
00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:21.460
Scientists with the Australian Research Council, Center of Excellence,

580
00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:23.650
Jesus Christ, take it down a little bit, Huh?

581
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:28.480
Fucking arrogant bastards for coral reef studies last week compiled aerial

582
00:34:28.481 --> 00:34:32.860
surveys of the world's largest living structures scoring bleaching at 800

583
00:34:32.861 --> 00:34:36.280
individual coral reefs across 8,000 kilometers.

584
00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.260
The results show the two consecutive mass bleaching events have affected 1500

585
00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.040
kilometer stretch leaving only the rate's southern third unscathed.

586
00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:50.630
Oh boy. Oh there you go.

587
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.420
<v 4>Okay.</v>

588
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.190
<v 2>You know what the deal is? We have to go,</v>

589
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.190
a significant portion of us have to go, you know,

590
00:34:57.191 --> 00:34:58.570
maybe it's good that the robots come.

591
00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.470
Are they going to be electric robots? Are they going to require oil also?

592
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.180
But you know something. All these fucking electric cars,

593
00:35:06.181 --> 00:35:09.810
you know when you go to the split, when that Tesla, that giant Tesla battery,

594
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:13.200
now what do they do with that? When you're done with the car,

595
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.620
what happens to that battery? I know the car constantly has updates.

596
00:35:16.621 --> 00:35:19.830
Does that also include the battery? Can you make the battery better?

597
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.291
Let's look that up.

598
00:35:22.291 --> 00:35:25.700
I bet there's a bunch of fucking oil companies putting some shit up.

599
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:30.540
True or otherwise about this? Um, Tesla

600
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.430
car.

601
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:35.160
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

602
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.090
<v 2>Footprint.</v>

603
00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:37.340
<v 4>Okay.</v>

604
00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.060
<v 2>Okay. Let's</v>

605
00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:42.540
<v 4>see. The carbon footprint of Tesla manufacturing Teslas.</v>

606
00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.530
The lefts. Electric cars aren't as green as you might think.

607
00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.740
The electric cars aren't green yet. Nothing is green.

608
00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.820
Nothing is green. Okay.

609
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.350
<v 2>Then Doug Stanhope, Doug Stanhope had a great joke.</v>

610
00:35:54.351 --> 00:35:56.840
He said the greatest thing you can do is kill yourself.

611
00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:03.200
And I would go further if he didn't just say it and then add yourself buried in

612
00:36:03.201 --> 00:36:07.010
the top soil. So you get fucking give it some nutrients. Um,

613
00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.210
actually we're also full of fucking God knows what mcdonalds and shit.

614
00:36:11.211 --> 00:36:14.570
You'd probably cause the tree next to your body to die. Um,

615
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.620
does the Tesla model s electric car pollute more than an SUV?

616
00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.730
This is the green car report. All right, let's see. Well,

617
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.140
let's see who's kidding.

618
00:36:27.141 --> 00:36:28.940
Who the Tesla is not about being green.

619
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:31.850
That's about going zero to 60 in 2.3 seconds.

620
00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:36.830
Does the supposedly clean green Testamatta s really pollute more than a gas

621
00:36:36.831 --> 00:36:40.190
guzzling jeep grand Cherokee sports utility vehicle.

622
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.950
That's what one analyst has claimed.

623
00:36:42.951 --> 00:36:45.590
Now what I love about this is everybody has a dog in the fight.

624
00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:50.810
Obviously the oil guys don't want you to switch over to the fucking electrical

625
00:36:50.811 --> 00:36:54.470
shit and all the electric people, they're so convinced that batteries,

626
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.430
you know, didn't Michael Jordan do a commercial long time ago,

627
00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:01.430
but recycling your batteries, didn't he do that? You know,

628
00:37:01.431 --> 00:37:03.920
that's how I know about it. Right? Cause an athlete told me not to do it.

629
00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:06.150
Then what about that giant battery at the bottom of the Tesla?

630
00:37:06.151 --> 00:37:08.030
What do you do with that thing? What do you do with that when it's done?

631
00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:09.620
All right.

632
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:14.600
In an exhaustive 6,500 word article on the financial websites seeking alpha

633
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:15.350
analysts,

634
00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:20.350
Nathan Weiss lays out a case model s that the case model s actually.

635
00:37:20.811 --> 00:37:23.030
Okay. Okay. We know what he said. He said it was worse

636
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.490
as an s owner. I was shocked. For me, I just felt this is crazy.

637
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.670
Although the carbon emissions were not a big factor in my decision.

638
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:35.410
Blah Blah Blah Blah. Okay.

639
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:43.340
Why says Ben Advising his clients to short the stock of Tesla and it's fit that,

640
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:49.610
uh, all right, not so fast. Power plant emissions counter. All right,

641
00:37:49.611 --> 00:37:51.500
I'm not reading all this fucking shit. You know what this is.

642
00:37:51.501 --> 00:37:55.820
This is just an immediate war right now going on and I don't know where the fuck

643
00:37:55.821 --> 00:37:58.410
to get the facts and I'm not going to just look at the up the first goddamn

644
00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:02.030
thing and read it. I have no idea. You know, but I can tell you this.

645
00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:03.913
All right.

646
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.340
I know that guy that had a Tesla has like ridiculous security around them.

647
00:38:07.341 --> 00:38:10.340
Cause remember that Gal came up with the car that could drive across the country

648
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.490
just on water. And then he went around and told people about it.

649
00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.990
His last words when he walked out of the diner was they poisoned me and then he

650
00:38:17.991 --> 00:38:22.550
died and then his car disappeared. Um, I know that sounds crazy,

651
00:38:22.551 --> 00:38:27.110
but that's a true fucking story. It's a true story according to the Internet.

652
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.620
All right, follow up girl who gave weed optimism. I love the followups.

653
00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:35.740
Every body. This is like our own little mini series here on podcast.

654
00:38:35.741 --> 00:38:39.040
This is tremendous. I'll give you that guy's name too.

655
00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.540
You guys can look it up and you guys let me know if you think this is fucking

656
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.120
<v 0>real enough. All right. Uh, water power.</v>

657
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.700
<v 1>Car</v>

658
00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:54.420
<v 0>inventor vanishes. What is his name? What's his name?</v>

659
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:59.570
<v 2>What's the name of the fog and water guy? Yes. Stanley Meyer's water.</v>

660
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.900
Fuel cell. There you go.

661
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.970
<v 0>Look that guy up. Go down that fucking Rad. Hope rabbit hole. M.</v>

662
00:39:07.971 --> 00:39:11.550
E y e r I think is how you spell it, right, Stanley?

663
00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:13.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

664
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.070
<v 0>Stanley's are always fucking honest, aren't they? Um,</v>

665
00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.360
one of my favorite promoters around the country. That's his first name, Stanley,

666
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.860
right is fucking rain. Um, all right,

667
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:27.070
follow up to the girl who gave me the weed ultimatum. All right,

668
00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:30.670
for those of you missed the podcast a couple of times ago, there was a,

669
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:34.300
this woman, this guy was dating, you know, he's always smoking weed around her.

670
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:37.710
She had problems with alcohol and shit. And then one day, I don't know,

671
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.930
she cleaned up and she just lashed out at him and said he needs to just totally

672
00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:44.950
quit smoking weed or you know, it's either her or the weed. All right,

673
00:39:44.951 --> 00:39:49.150
so here we go. He says, Yo brother, bill on for three.

674
00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:53.890
You responded to my email about the ultimate and my girlfriend gave me a her

675
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.360
versus weed. My fucking computer's going to die. Hang on. I gotta hit pause.

676
00:39:58.361 --> 00:40:01.690
I can't keep fucking yammering. Expect you guys to listen to this shit. Hold on.

677
00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.640
All right, I'm back. I'm back. I'm powered here. I'm powered up here. All right.

678
00:40:06.641 --> 00:40:07.211
On for three.

679
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:10.390
You responded to my email about the ultimate and my girlfriend gave me

680
00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:14.010
<v 2>her versus we'd either choose her or the weed. Man,</v>

681
00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:18.210
she has sensitive minted that she was being a cunt by giving me the ultimatum

682
00:40:18.211 --> 00:40:19.890
and no longer cares if I smoke.

683
00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:24.120
She has since been smoking more weed than me and two days after she gave me the

684
00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:26.340
ultimatum, the following happens yet, dude,

685
00:40:26.341 --> 00:40:28.530
I don't even need to read this sheet. This woman is unstable.

686
00:40:28.531 --> 00:40:31.200
She needs to get help. And if I was you, I'd get out of this relationship,

687
00:40:31.201 --> 00:40:33.510
but I'll read it for the entertainment value here.

688
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.470
She stumbled into our apartment so drunk that she couldn't stand.

689
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.890
She was accompanied by another man. Oh, bonus. Here we go.

690
00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.940
The guy she was with happened to be the one guy that she swore she'd never

691
00:40:44.941 --> 00:40:49.260
talked to again because a couple months ago he sent her a 10 page email

692
00:40:49.261 --> 00:40:54.000
professing his love for her and trying to convince her that I'm an asshole and

693
00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:56.580
she should be with them. Up until that point,

694
00:40:56.581 --> 00:41:01.050
they were friends that hung out on occasion, which I was okay with,

695
00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:05.580
oh Jesus. But after he sent the love letter, which she read to me,

696
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:09.360
she told me she would never speak to him again. Why did she read this to you?

697
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:13.550
You didn't need to hear all of that. Okay. Anyways,

698
00:41:13.551 --> 00:41:15.620
back to the cup a couple of days ago,

699
00:41:15.621 --> 00:41:19.690
we got in a fight and I said I was going to leave because of the bullshit.

700
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.340
We'd ultimatum, but instead she left

701
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:29.510
<v 0>anyways, back to a couple of days ago. So wait, when did she stumble into,</v>

702
00:41:29.511 --> 00:41:33.080
this is like a fucking Tarantino movie. Two days after she gave.

703
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:38.120
<v 2>All right, so I guess before this bullshit happened,</v>

704
00:41:38.121 --> 00:41:40.910
you said you were going to leave due to the fucking weed ultimatum.

705
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:43.783
Is that what you're telling me?

706
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.870
But instead she left claiming she was spending the night at her sister's.

707
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:51.470
Instead she went straight to this dude's place, got shit faced drunk,

708
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.460
went to a bar with him, then came back to our apartment, both of them.

709
00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.590
She did not expect me to be home. When she saw that I was there,

710
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:05.540
he immediately walked out. Oh Jesus. She was so drunk.

711
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:07.250
She was unresponsible.

712
00:42:07.251 --> 00:42:10.730
So the fight didn't come until the next morning when she claimed that the only

713
00:42:10.731 --> 00:42:13.940
reason he walked in was probably because he was just making sure she got home

714
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:17.750
safely. Oh boy. Um,

715
00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:20.930
I told her that I'm done and that I'm moving back to my home state,

716
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:24.260
seeing as she is the only reason I no longer live in my home state. Good,

717
00:42:24.261 --> 00:42:27.200
good move. Good move. Sir. Since this incident,

718
00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:31.040
she has been crying and begging for me to stay and wants to get married,

719
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.780
et Cetera, and get the fuck outta here.

720
00:42:32.781 --> 00:42:37.280
She claims that she has no interest in him and she was just mad at me and was

721
00:42:37.281 --> 00:42:41.360
under the impression that I had already packed my things and left and she just

722
00:42:41.361 --> 00:42:42.950
needed a friend. At the moment,

723
00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.880
those are all lies and this is the tip of the fucking iceberg, sir.

724
00:42:46.881 --> 00:42:49.790
That goes all the way down to the fucking ocean floor. Personally,

725
00:42:49.791 --> 00:42:52.460
I don't think I can forgive her on or trust her,

726
00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:56.060
but I need to make a decision in fast. Get the fuck out of there sir,

727
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.880
because I'm either gonna tough this out and stay here.

728
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:03.080
All Jesus hoping this shit doesn't happen again or I'm going to get the fuck out

729
00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:05.870
of dodge and move back home and start over and helped me out. Brothers,

730
00:43:05.871 --> 00:43:09.230
should it, should I stay or should I go your thoughts?

731
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.590
Thanks and go fuck my life. No, not fuck your life.

732
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:14.660
If you stay your fucking,

733
00:43:14.661 --> 00:43:18.230
you'll have to get out of there now that you just heard what you wrote out loud

734
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:22.130
back by me reading it out loud, which probably made no sense. Um,

735
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:28.280
you realize how insane that is. How insane it would be for you to do that.

736
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.360
Um, I'm almost thinking it as much as she needs to get her life together.

737
00:43:32.361 --> 00:43:36.530
You need to look at yourself as to why you would stay with a person like this.

738
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.400
Yeah. You need to get the fuck out of here, dude. All right.

739
00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:43.790
You still get your whole life ahead of you. All right.

740
00:43:43.791 --> 00:43:46.820
And as far as like married somebody, you basically get one draft pick.

741
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.130
All right. Cause when you get divorced,

742
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.970
your franchise gets cut in half and then you start drafting in later rounds.

743
00:43:52.971 --> 00:43:56.180
You know, you getting older and shit. This is your number one draft pick.

744
00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:01.480
This is what you're going to pick this person with all the fucking problems that

745
00:44:01.971 --> 00:44:06.410
happen at the college level. I'm telling you,

746
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:11.180
get the fuck out of it, right dude. I mean Jesus Christ.

747
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:12.903
<v 1>Okay?</v>

748
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:19.450
<v 2>If you don't believe me, go, go as tell 20 strangers that fucking story,</v>

749
00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:21.740
<v 1>okay?</v>

750
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.830
<v 2>I swear to God, they're all gonna say the same thing. Get the fuck out of there.</v>

751
00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:31.040
Go on Dr Phil Hill Day. You need to get the fuck out of dodge.

752
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:35.340
He'd say the same thing. Actually, he probably wouldn't because she's a woman,

753
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:40.490
his audience's female. So He'd probably go, well, maybe if you, um,

754
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:45.710
smoked a little less weed and she tried to fuck a little less other people,

755
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:51.390
maybe y'all could find a middle ground now where we'll be like, whew,

756
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:56.520
I inserted myself into that situation. Alright,

757
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:59.380
men going their own way. You could go, oh,

758
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:07.180
um, all right, this is a fucking amazing. [inaudible] Hey y'all,

759
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:10.200
Billy boy. I was wondering if you were secretly behind this movement.

760
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:15.180
This is fucking crazy. This right here is, um,

761
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:19.740
there's some movement evidently down in Australia,

762
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.220
down in all z down and all is whatever the fuck they say.

763
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.070
I don't know if the fuck they say, I've only been there a couple of times. Oh,

764
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:30.510
the plug came on done. Was there a reason why they turn the plug into a magnet?

765
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.620
You know, back when it plugged in, it did much better. I guess.

766
00:45:34.621 --> 00:45:38.310
It's easy to find, you know, it's got navigation kind of,

767
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.850
and you can find the fucking hole, but it won't stay in there. All right. Uh,

768
00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:46.230
there's a growing movement of men in Australia called men going their own way.

769
00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.710
I just pause for all the guys listen to this with their girls so she could have

770
00:45:50.711 --> 00:45:53.860
time to roll their eyes and be like, Oh God. All right.

771
00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.410
M g t o w Mega Sao. Um,

772
00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:00.190
it's an offshoot of the men's rights movement,

773
00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:05.370
but rather than getting stuck in and tack stuck in and tackling issues,

774
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.720
no. Rather than getting stuck tackling issues.

775
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.360
These guys have vowed to stay away from women,

776
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:15.720
stop dating and not have children.

777
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:17.460
<v 7>Okay.</v>

778
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.293
<v 2>Jesus.</v>

779
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:22.650
Essentially m g t o w was this statement about living your life rather than

780
00:46:22.651 --> 00:46:26.670
trying to make a woman happy. Sorry, happy. Sorry.

781
00:46:26.671 --> 00:46:27.870
Screamed all my jokes last night.

782
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:31.770
Or being a slave to cultural expectations.

783
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:35.580
One SW member says, um,

784
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.390
this isn't about a specific rule book more on mindset,

785
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:43.740
although there are purists in the movement who are the most extreme and avoid

786
00:46:43.741 --> 00:46:47.850
women entirely. There's a growing number of men who've had enough,

787
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:52.560
enough of the feminism and enough of being told they have to work for a greater

788
00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:54.600
good, which doesn't actually exist.

789
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:59.640
Start looking into this manosphere and it's like going down a rabbit hole.

790
00:46:59.641 --> 00:47:00.480
This person says,

791
00:47:00.481 --> 00:47:05.481
happiness here is supposedly freedom and shunning relationships is now sweeping

792
00:47:06.301 --> 00:47:07.860
through the younger generations.

793
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:12.450
Is it or is this just a very interesting article? Okay.

794
00:47:12.451 --> 00:47:16.740
Tom 15 from NSW north,

795
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:17.910
south west.

796
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.870
Whenever the fuck that is is what you call what you would call the growing

797
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:24.930
number of teens going their own way.

798
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.560
Jesus kid never even got off the ground. He goes, it's probably not.

799
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:33.370
It's probably not true. But I got the feeling that women are actually dangerous.

800
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.850
Maybe the men around me have just had bad experiences.

801
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.360
He tells the news woman. Um,

802
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:44.560
he said it's scary being a teenage boy. I'm not sure how it all,

803
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:47.620
it's all meant to fit together in the future. Says Tom,

804
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.660
last year my uncle lost everything because his wife of 40 years decided she

805
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:56.470
didn't love him anymore. Just like that. She randomly got up and left,

806
00:47:56.590 --> 00:48:01.000
it got nasty and he lost everything. His house, cars and loads of money.

807
00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.150
There's no way I'm ever getting married. Well they, I mean Shit,

808
00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:06.370
you saw a very traumatic thing. Of course,

809
00:48:06.371 --> 00:48:10.480
teenage boys look at other males in their life together. Some perspective.

810
00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:13.360
I'm just going to read quotes cause I'm not gonna read all this. Uh,

811
00:48:13.361 --> 00:48:16.330
my older brother was 20. I was dating a girl for a few months.

812
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.960
She turned real nasty in the breakup and made a string of allegations to the

813
00:48:19.961 --> 00:48:24.340
police that made me suspicious of women to my mouth. My brother's a good guy.

814
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:29.140
Okay. Why should she be able to just say what she wants?

815
00:48:29.141 --> 00:48:32.170
Accused him of anything and then get on with her life like that.

816
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.940
It doesn't seem fair to me. I'm not sure what rights I have. Maybe none.

817
00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:38.290
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

818
00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:41.830
<v 2>Okay. Both sexes. Okay. It's crucial that we encourage our children,</v>

819
00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:44.740
find a mentor or a teacher or some blah, blah, blah.

820
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:48.460
Someone who supports communicate. [inaudible]. Yeah, but skills.

821
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:51.340
Getting a healthy relationship. That's exactly what I was going to say.

822
00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:55.780
What are you just going to walk away from women? You know?

823
00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:00.130
You never going to bang another one. Maybe you just go on Tinder.

824
00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.640
Look, you can get a lot done. Not being in a relationship, male or female,

825
00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:05.800
just focusing on your fucking career. Budding. You know?

826
00:49:05.801 --> 00:49:08.520
If you want to be alone, that's fucking cool, but a,

827
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.390
to do it because of fear reasons is wrong,

828
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:13.780
but you need to learn how to do is set up your relationship and how you set up a

829
00:49:13.781 --> 00:49:16.030
relationship is you have to,

830
00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.890
you don't pretend to be something you're not and just tell them what the fuck

831
00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:25.120
you want from day one. When she's going like,

832
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.740
do you watch sports all the time? Be like, yeah, I love him.

833
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:32.950
Love it. Do you know what I like doing most when I do that?

834
00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.480
Like drinking a beer and then going out and smoking a cigar. That's what I do.

835
00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:40.020
Hey Sweetheart, what do you do? Don't lie.

836
00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:44.540
Just tell me what you do and let's see if what you do mixes. What, what,

837
00:49:44.541 --> 00:49:48.320
what I do. Cause if we both start pretending,

838
00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.760
then we go do what we do up at,

839
00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:53.640
you're going to go back to go what we know now we, oh my God, you changed. No,

840
00:49:53.641 --> 00:49:54.810
I didn't change. I just,

841
00:49:54.811 --> 00:49:58.230
I just started being myself for the first time around you.

842
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:59.783
<v 4>Okay.</v>

843
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:05.220
<v 2>I didn't mention that I was into a dog sleds. Yeah. Uh,</v>

844
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:07.290
well I've just figured during the first three months I,

845
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:10.460
I'd make you fall in love with me and then I would bring my 18 huskies into the

846
00:50:10.461 --> 00:50:14.240
fucking house. Um, all right.

847
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:17.060
You're talking about a guy who's made every fucking possible mistake that you

848
00:50:17.061 --> 00:50:18.110
can make in a relationship.

849
00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:21.380
I've fucked up more God damn relationships with great women.

850
00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.600
I gotta take something. Okay. You know?

851
00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.213
<v 4>Okay.</v>

852
00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:27.980
<v 2>I, I, I dated some great and I, I fucked</v>

853
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.910
<v 0>them all up. All right?</v>

854
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:33.530
And it wasn't until I met my now wife,

855
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:36.410
not saying I didn't make a bunch of fucking mistakes after that,

856
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:39.320
but I just met somebody that, uh, I don't know.

857
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:41.510
I was in that part of my life where I could just be like, all right,

858
00:50:41.511 --> 00:50:45.440
this is what I do. Is that what you do? Yeah. I never, you know,

859
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.170
that's the one thing. I am you only the few things I am proud of,

860
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:51.290
all the relationships I've had with women as I've never liked a,

861
00:50:51.291 --> 00:50:53.990
I never judged him as far as like whatever the fuck they were into.

862
00:50:53.991 --> 00:50:57.860
I didn't give a shit. You know, whatever you want to do,

863
00:50:57.861 --> 00:50:59.120
just just fucking do it.

864
00:50:59.121 --> 00:51:01.790
Cause I just looked at it like if I give you that sort of freedom,

865
00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:05.300
then you'll give it back to me. And if you don't, then I'm fucking Outta here.

866
00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.710
And what are you going to say? What are you gonna say?

867
00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:11.510
That's the thing that's my, you know, my friends come over here.

868
00:51:11.511 --> 00:51:14.590
Jesus Christ failed you always fucking cleaning up the kitchen.

869
00:51:14.591 --> 00:51:17.650
You fucking doing all this type of shit around the house. It's, I can't exactly,

870
00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.300
it's the genius.

871
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:23.260
I earn a great living and then I come home and I fucking crush it.

872
00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.193
<v 4>Okay.</v>

873
00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.310
<v 0>So then when I'm going to go out and go see my buddy play drums tonight,</v>

874
00:51:28.311 --> 00:51:32.990
what's my wife going to say? No. Why?

875
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:36.650
Because you have a daughter. Ah, Shit. You're right. Okay.

876
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.130
She got the daughter car now. So what am I going to do?

877
00:51:40.131 --> 00:51:43.790
Plus I fucking love my daughter. So great coming off there now. That's the best.

878
00:51:43.791 --> 00:51:47.270
It's a greatest thing ever. Greatest thing ever. She's not,

879
00:51:47.271 --> 00:51:51.800
she's slept with the two the night for the first time. Um,

880
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.910
of course the day I had to get up early, you know, and fly out.

881
00:51:55.911 --> 00:51:57.740
So I missed the last three hours. She, she,

882
00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:01.460
I think she slept like she slept from like 10 to like seven in the morning.

883
00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:05.630
It was fucking unbelievable. And um,

884
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:10.700
she's such a cute, happy, chill kid. I'm so happy about that. You know,

885
00:52:10.701 --> 00:52:13.520
cause I am a fucking loony ticket and I, I, she's not home right now.

886
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:14.960
That's why I'm doing the podcast a little late too.

887
00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.030
So she's out with her mother and that is my goal.

888
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.900
You know, I don't know if we'll have another one. I have no idea.

889
00:52:23.901 --> 00:52:27.860
But whatever kid or kids that I ended up having, I want them to be happy,

890
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:33.200
relaxed. I want them to feel like they can approach me. They can ask questions.

891
00:52:33.201 --> 00:52:35.180
I am by no means going to be a pushover.

892
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.960
I'm not going to buy him a bunch of Shit. I'm already against that.

893
00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:42.380
Buying kids fucking toys before they're like three years old or two and a half

894
00:52:42.381 --> 00:52:45.470
is stupid. They don't even know what toys are. Okay.

895
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.230
They want to go out in the kitchen, they want to play with pots and pans.

896
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:52.460
You know, they want to play with your shoes. They want to play with everything.

897
00:52:52.461 --> 00:52:57.200
But toys, toys actually bore them. Okay. You get them some pots and pants.

898
00:52:57.201 --> 00:53:01.190
It's over. They love them. They like the noise, they liked the handles,

899
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.320
they like making a fucking mess. It's great. Um,

900
00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.830
but you know, I'm not going to be that fucking person by engine.

901
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.490
You have 78 fucking iPads.

902
00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.720
Be Funny if my daughter's pissed at me in the future and she goes back and

903
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:19.280
listen to this episode is now playing it to me sometime in the future. You know,

904
00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:23.750
Jesus. Oh, that'd be a rough one. Anyways. Uh, let's plow ahead. Let's get, yes,

905
00:53:23.751 --> 00:53:26.100
I would say like that whole, like men

906
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.840
<v 2>going their own way. I don't know. It's, that's silly. Why would you do that?</v>

907
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:32.820
You're 15 years old. You're in the prime of your life.

908
00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.490
You not don't want to be in a relationship to just be that guy with finger bangs

909
00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:37.620
, chicks on the weekends, you know?

910
00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:41.400
And then on Monday when you go to school and they're like, hey, you know,

911
00:53:41.401 --> 00:53:43.950
like we going to do that again and be, hey, you know, if you want to hang out,

912
00:53:43.951 --> 00:53:46.770
I mean, I'm kind of doing this. And then when they fucking go like,

913
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:50.390
so what's she deal? You just going to finger me and it's just like you, what?

914
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:55.080
You didn't enjoy it. Yeah. I'm like, I did something bad. You know, just,

915
00:53:55.081 --> 00:53:59.430
I just don't want to be in a, our relationship right now. I'm young, you know,

916
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:04.320
and they called it finger banging, Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

917
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:07.140
Um, our girlfriends spiked my drink.

918
00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.200
Jesus Christ. You know, it's funny if I said that in front of a crowd,

919
00:54:12.201 --> 00:54:15.590
everyone would laugh. It's the other way around.

920
00:54:15.591 --> 00:54:19.460
Everybody gasps once you do spike your drink and fucking take your wallet.

921
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:24.383
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

922
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.380
<v 2>that's a woman rape summit. Um, all right. Uh, hey bill,</v>

923
00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:30.450
a couple months ago I went to a party,

924
00:54:30.451 --> 00:54:35.451
went to a garden party to reminisce with Mile France a couple months ago.

925
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.950
That was Ricky Nelson. Everybody if you didn't recognize it. Um,

926
00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:42.360
a couple months ago I went to a party with a few friends.

927
00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:47.190
Among them was the girl that would become my current girlfriend and I had a few

928
00:54:47.191 --> 00:54:50.850
drinks, but we shocked to see just how drunk they got me.

929
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:54.690
I don't remember the entire night because I was so drunk, you know,

930
00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:57.150
some of these are so fucking over the top, I just can't believe.

931
00:54:57.151 --> 00:54:58.890
Don't even tell me. Then you ended up with this person.

932
00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:00.120
I'm supposed to believe this.

933
00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:05.700
I went to the bathroom twice because I felt that was going to throw up today.

934
00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:10.620
My girlfriend confessed to me that she and her friends had spiked my beer with

935
00:55:10.621 --> 00:55:15.420
shots of vodka. All right. That's not so bad at some college shit.

936
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:16.493
He didn't taste it.

937
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:21.270
She thought it was a funny prank until I clearly expressed how fucked up that I

938
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:25.740
was. She apologized and all that saying she never wanted to hurt me.

939
00:55:25.741 --> 00:55:27.930
But I'm thinking this is breakup worthy.

940
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:31.200
Most of my friends and family agree I should leave.

941
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.810
This isn't the only issue in our relationship.

942
00:55:33.811 --> 00:55:37.770
And I'm thinking red flags at this caliber are too large to ignore.

943
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:41.070
Should I walk away and will, dude,

944
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:43.020
you only gave me one piece of the puzzle there.

945
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:44.880
<v 3>Okay.</v>

946
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:48.310
<v 2>Do you know if she was drunk and she was in a silly mood with their friends and</v>

947
00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:49.510
they fucking did that?

948
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.093
<v 3>Um,</v>

949
00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:54.003
<v 2>I don't know,</v>

950
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:59.100
but like it seems like there's a bunch of other shit that she's doing and uh,

951
00:55:59.111 --> 00:56:01.660
you already seem convinced that you should fucking walk.

952
00:56:01.661 --> 00:56:04.600
So I don't know what the other stuff is. So I can't give you advice on that one,

953
00:56:04.601 --> 00:56:08.620
sir. I don't have an that you, you, I'm a hung jury on this one.

954
00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:12.970
I need, I need more information. I don't know what to tell you.

955
00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:15.693
<v 3>Um,</v>

956
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:20.030
<v 2>so I dunno if that's the only one that you were going to tell me and that's not</v>

957
00:56:20.031 --> 00:56:21.980
a great way to start a relationship.

958
00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:28.740
<v 0>It is kind of funny though. I don't know. I'm kind of an LTE,</v>

959
00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.090
so in a way that's my dream girl.

960
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:33.870
Do you know at some point you also gotta admit that she knows she did buy a

961
00:56:33.871 --> 00:56:38.340
couple of shots that night, didn't she? You just didn't know it. Um, alright.

962
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:41.850
I'm taping a lot of shit on me. TV from me,

963
00:56:41.851 --> 00:56:44.580
TV taping,

964
00:56:44.581 --> 00:56:46.890
a couple of episodes of 'em.

965
00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:49.133
<v 1>Okay.</v>

966
00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.300
<v 0>Oh well what the fuck's anyway,</v>

967
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.690
that show was even was show Valerie Bertinelli was in

968
00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:01.440
with the red headed lady and then the other chick and then Schneider next door.

969
00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:05.860
The fuck wasn't even that show. Not The apartment.

970
00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:07.900
Not The odd couple.

971
00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:09.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

972
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:12.900
<v 0>Not Three chicks and a janitor. What the fuck was the name of that shove? Gone.</v>

973
00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:14.740
<v 1>Okay.</v>

974
00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.450
<v 0>S C H Schneider.</v>

975
00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:17.713
<v 1>Okay,</v>

976
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:21.410
<v 0>sit calm. Let's see what we got.</v>

977
00:57:21.411 --> 00:57:24.530
What did we get one day at a time.

978
00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:26.571
One day at a time.

979
00:57:26.571 --> 00:57:29.360
I take a couple episodes of that and then an episode of Alice.

980
00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:32.180
I didn't remember how those fucking theme songs went.

981
00:57:32.181 --> 00:57:34.430
Do you guys remember those ones day a day at a time

982
00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:37.243
<v 1>theme?</v>

983
00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:45.850
<v 0>It's called this is it the fuck out of here? Hi.</v>

984
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:47.000
What happened to my memory?

985
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

986
00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:49.470
<v 0>See if I remember this.</v>

987
00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:51.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

988
00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:00.133
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

989
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:04.980
<v 0>crushing Valerie Bertinelli but the the day was so fucking broke.</v>

990
00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:08.700
That's what all these fucking 70 sitcoms were about.

991
00:58:08.701 --> 00:58:10.680
They were just fucking broke ass people.

992
00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:16.170
I guess it was reflecting the economy at the time. You know,

993
00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:18.960
like Alice was like, you know,

994
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:23.990
divorced driving this piece of Shit to Phoenix Ford Ltd station wagon.

995
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:29.040
<v 8>Yeah. [inaudible]</v>

996
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:34.030
Sonny's thinking. Just sentence patterns.

997
00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:42.460
<v 0>What is it that cannot be the real fucking song.</v>

998
00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.970
That was fucking horrible. Sing.

999
00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.950
And that's what happens when we let the star of the show sing it.

1000
00:58:48.951 --> 00:58:52.220
Did she sing that fucking thing? You don't,

1001
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:55.220
I can actually block out this thing and to listen to the old studio musicians.

1002
00:58:55.221 --> 00:58:56.054
That's what I miss.

1003
00:58:56.090 --> 00:58:58.760
Cause now it's just some asshole with a fucking laptop and the keyboard.

1004
00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:02.090
Those are all individual people playing. All those instruments

1005
00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.860
<v 8>I'm going to take off. Joanne goes,</v>

1006
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.140
Richard's bow,

1007
00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:18.380
<v 0>good, got divorced,</v>

1008
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:22.850
got the station wagon and I'm in a new neighborhood.

1009
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.870
<v 2>I'm like, you don't play Tommy. He was fucking adorable.</v>

1010
00:59:26.871 --> 00:59:30.800
And then in between like season five and season six,

1011
00:59:30.801 --> 00:59:33.890
he grew like three feet and that includes his teeth.

1012
00:59:33.891 --> 00:59:37.670
All of a sudden he had these fucking horse teeth. He was fucking gigantic.

1013
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:43.270
It looked like he went from fucking being her kid to being the a walk on for the

1014
00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:47.660
Phoenix Suns. Um, anyways, that's the podcast for this.

1015
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:52.340
Uh, for this Monday, I want to thank everybody that came out.

1016
00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:53.600
Um,

1017
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:58.460
two shows at the majestic theater on a Sunday night and all you guys had to go

1018
00:59:58.461 --> 01:00:01.400
to work the next day. I had such a great time. San Antonio is great.

1019
01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:03.170
I didn't talk about it. I went to the spars game,

1020
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:07.110
went to this bar as far as fucking, uh,

1021
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:12.470
against the La Clippers. Great game. Fucking amazing fans. Very,

1022
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:16.880
very knowledgeable of the game. I got to see their five championship trophies.

1023
01:00:16.881 --> 01:00:17.750
They got 'em right out there.

1024
01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:22.460
We can see him took a picture and all that shit was great. And um,

1025
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:26.210
but I gotta tell you something. If you wanna win some free shit,

1026
01:00:26.211 --> 01:00:29.750
go to a spurs game. I've never seen so much free shit given out in my life.

1027
01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.170
First of all, they had this coyote and a mask, uh,

1028
01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:38.690
a guy in a coyote mascot costume and like 19 times during the game,

1029
01:00:38.961 --> 01:00:43.850
he stoled the vendor's cotton candy and they would play the Benny Hill Song.

1030
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:47.240
<v 9>Wait, wait [inaudible] but bank</v>

1031
01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.210
<v 2>and the vendor would sort of mock chase him around as the thing was fucking</v>

1032
01:00:51.211 --> 01:00:53.040
throw in free cotton candy all over the place.

1033
01:00:53.041 --> 01:00:56.670
They did that like 10 fucking times, which made me immediately think like,

1034
01:00:56.671 --> 01:00:59.040
they ordered too much cotton candy this month. It's going bad.

1035
01:00:59.041 --> 01:01:01.320
Let's just get rid of the shit so we don't have to throw it out.

1036
01:01:01.321 --> 01:01:04.920
And we'll also look like, you know, like we're good guys for giving it away.

1037
01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.920
They had cookies coming down from the ceiling in parachutes.

1038
01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.900
You know, they would just float down. People jumping up for fucking cookies.

1039
01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:19.440
They drag some guy out of the fucking crowd and put us,

1040
01:01:19.441 --> 01:01:23.400
put a couch that you could recline in and they put it at the foul line.

1041
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:26.560
They're like, if you could sit down and you can fucking sink this file shot,

1042
01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:29.580
we're going to give you this couch. And next thing you know,

1043
01:01:29.581 --> 01:01:32.580
I get you like you forget about the game. There's so much shit going on.

1044
01:01:32.581 --> 01:01:36.720
I'm rooting for this fucking couch potato to win a new fucking couch to slowly

1045
01:01:36.721 --> 01:01:40.560
die on, you know, shoots the first one. Oh,

1046
01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:41.910
the next one rims out,

1047
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:46.170
and then he hits it and everyone's like freaking out.

1048
01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:49.620
He's jumping up and down his man tits flopping all over the place,

1049
01:01:49.890 --> 01:01:53.550
and then they just dragged this leather porn couch off guy. You fucking want it.

1050
01:01:53.551 --> 01:01:56.610
You want it all right? And then you look it up at the scoreboard. Like, oh,

1051
01:01:56.611 --> 01:02:00.930
wait a minute, I'm watching the fucking spurs. They're playing the clippers.

1052
01:02:00.931 --> 01:02:04.200
That's what's happening here. This is a critical part of the game.

1053
01:02:04.201 --> 01:02:07.680
There's a timeout. Now I'm watching awkward dads dancing.

1054
01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:13.380
Who's the Best Awkward Dad Dancing? Other than that, it was fucking great.

1055
01:02:13.381 --> 01:02:15.000
I really enjoyed it and I'm,

1056
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:18.960
that was franchise number 118 that I've seen and I,

1057
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.010
I'm getting like the rain man

1058
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.380
<v 0>with this. I got eight left in until the next season.</v>

1059
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.890
You know when the La chargers in the Vegas nights start.

1060
01:02:25.891 --> 01:02:29.520
But I plan on knocking those guys out early, early.

1061
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:33.870
I might even go to that first charges game just for them having a Udacity.

1062
01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.720
The fucking move on me. You know,

1063
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.750
as of right now, in this moment,

1064
01:02:39.751 --> 01:02:44.610
I've seen every team fucking west of the Mississippi from fucking as far south

1065
01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:48.360
as San Antonio is far north is Edmonton and these two [inaudible] gonna come

1066
01:02:48.361 --> 01:02:52.080
along and fuck the whole thing up for me. I will not tolerate that.

1067
01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:55.770
I will avoid my family. I will take a trip and I will go see both of these.

1068
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:58.380
Fuck. Why don't take a trip for San Diego? I sound like a crazy person.

1069
01:02:58.381 --> 01:02:59.340
Go fuck yourselves.

1070
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:03.450
Thank you for listening and I'll check in on you on Thursday.
