00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.150
Okay. So it wants me to choose my field type. Okay, so

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.750
okay, I've got all these different choices of data type. What's going on?

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.410
&gt;&gt; So it's pretty overwhelming the different field types at first, because

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.220
there are so many. But really the most important thing to note

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.600
is that you just want to be able to pick the field

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.380
type that's closest to whatever type of field you're trying to track.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.760
&gt;&gt; Okay. So if we're doing start date, is date good?

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.670
&gt;&gt; Date sounds great.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.190
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.050
then Next, I guess. Okay, Field Label. I'm going to go with Start Date.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.860
&gt;&gt; Sounds good. This is what you're going to see on that page

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.270
that we were just on, as the little label for this field.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.370
&gt;&gt; Okay. And what's the difference between that and the name?

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.060
&gt;&gt; The Field Name is the actual API name that it stores

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.190
in the database. So that just needs to be a unique value.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.640
&gt;&gt; Is that for like if you're going to do some coding stuff?

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.490
&gt;&gt; Any sort of code or maybe some formulas

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.990
like we'll go build later.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.090
&gt;&gt; So description is, I guess I should fill this

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.020
out, right? The date the festival starts. What's help texter?

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.300
&gt;&gt; it's I guess a field that people don't really understand. You can

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.860
add the little help text so they can get more details about it.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.020
&gt;&gt; Pretty clear, okay. alright. No, I'm

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.240
not going to make this a required value.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.860
Sometimes you get festivals that maybe don't

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.030
know the date yet, or something, so.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.680
&gt;&gt; Okay, next. Oh my goodness. More

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.480
checkboxes.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this wizard really takes us through every sort of aspect

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.670
you might need to consider, around building a field. In this case, again, it's

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.860
asking us about security. So, if we were trying to build private fields, we

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.210
could then associate, hey we only want to make this visible to certain profiles.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.740
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.500
&gt;&gt; I know it's a lot of jargon to begin

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.390
with right now. But all you really need to know is

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.840
every user that lives within your Salesforce organization is associated with

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.060
some security profiles. You can turn fields on and off for

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.200
individual people if you want.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.090
&gt;&gt; And for now we can just.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.780
&gt;&gt; Just leave it at default. Yeah. It's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.660
just us. The last step of the process,

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.270
do we want to add it to a page layout? So really, all this means is, do

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.010
you want to put this field onto the page

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.000
automatically? So that form we were just on,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.070
where we saw cloud stock last modified by,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.000
created by, it's adding it into that layout.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.970
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I totally want that. Okay, okay. So check, save. Alright.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.270
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.479
&gt;&gt; And we've got our festival custom object,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.060
and we've got a custom field that's just empty.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.730
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.340
&gt;&gt; That's cool.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.110
&gt;&gt; What we're looking at right now is the setup screen for

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.910
our object itself. We can see the standard fields, so those are

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.150
the things that we saw automatically already. And then we add more

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.620
custom fields, or any sort of customization around our custom object here.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.350
&gt;&gt; 'Kay. I guess it makes sense to add an end date next?

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So let's just keep going down the line and adding more fields.
