00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.020
As the saying goes: if it ain't broke, don't
fix it - and the same goes for movie props.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.689
With dozens of blockbusters released every
year, it only makes sense for studios and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.090
producers to reuse sets, weapons, gadgets,
or props, but fans aren't usually meant to

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.090
notice them.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.210
You'd be surprised to see how many of your
favorite movies were filled with recycled

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.280
material, but more often than not, it only
makes watching them even better.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.140
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Movies That Stole
Their Props From other Films.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.140
The Avengers (Marvel/Disney)&nbsp;

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.250
When a blockbuster movie deals with the US
military and the men and women fighting overseas,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.920
it's not hard for a movie studio to negotiate
the use of actual vehicles and aircraft.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.000
But what do you do when the military in your
film is completely fictitious, based on Marvel

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.899
Comics top secret SHIELD?

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.079
It turns out full scale replicas of fighter
aircraft aren't all that common, and even

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.059
though most of the Jets seen in the first
Avengers are CGI, the one that Hulk destroys

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.450
in his fight with Thor isn't.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.310
It's the same prop Arnold Schwarzenegger piloted
in True Lies, with a new paint job and a less

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.830
glamorous role.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.830
Starship Troopers

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.220
Paul Verhoeven's futuristic war between humans
and alien "bugs" relied on relatively simple

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.329
body armor and helmets - but 20th century
Fox got more than their moneys worth out of

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:21.399
the space marine costumes.

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.929
Joss Whedon would turn to the exact same uniforms
for the Alliance soldiers of Firefly (Use

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.090
Still), and they even made a quick appearance
at the end of the 2001 reboot of Planet of

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.999
the Apes, Hidden under a new coat of shiny
black paint.

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.999
Back to the Future

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:38.729
There's a good chance that every environmentalist
fan of Back to the Future is still waiting

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.999
for the invention of Mr. Fusion, the home
energy device introduced at the end of the

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:43.209
trilogy's first movie.

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:47.789
In reality, Mr. Fusion was really a Krups
coffee grinder, but its sleek futuristic design

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.079
made it perfectly suited for the cutting edge
tech of 2015.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.310
But Doc Brown wasn't the first to put the
prop to a more impressive use: the production

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.530
team of Ridley Scott's Alien also found the
grinder to be a vision of the future, mounting

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.380
to a wall of the Nostromowsoace station in
the movies opening shots.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.119
And to think, some people only used it for
coffee!

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.439
Terminator 2: Judgment Day

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.930
There were lots of unforgettable moments in
T2, but the Terminator unleashing a storm

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.030
of lead from Cyberdyne headquarters - being
careful not to hurt any humans, as ordered

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.030
by John Connor.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.140
But that's no ordinary minigun he's firing:
it's the exact same one that he saw up close

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.400
in Predator years earlier.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.810
The original Terminator 2 script called for
a smaller gun, but James Cameron was clearly

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.470
a fan of the monstrous weapon, and gave Arnold
Schwarzenegger a turn instead.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.070
If you look close, you can even see where
the original handle and sling attached, meaning

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.160
Arnold had to hold the gun's entire weight
with only his arms.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.170
Somehow, we don't think that was a problem.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.920
Star Wars: The Phantom Menace

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.730
They say that one person's trash is another
person's treasure, and the first Star Wars

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.880
prequel supports the claim.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.170
When the Jedi are strolling through Watto's
scrapyard, you can clearly make out an EVA

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.590
pod from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey,
which is apparently the very same prop used

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.590
in filming.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.370
Kubrick actually demanded every one of his
props be destroyed to keep other studios and

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.150
films from copying his success, so either
the hidden Star Wars pod was overlooked, or

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.310
it was just one of the hundreds of props rebuilt
for the sequel, 2010.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.790
Star Trek: The Motion Picture

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.970
We explained how Star Trek movies have used
the exact same footage from one to the next,

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.150
but this one is almost too good to be true.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.640
In Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the modelling
team went all out, making an impressive orbital

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.850
office complex as complex as any project before.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.800
Apparently, the team was too proud of the
model to give it just one big screen appearance.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.370
Assuming fans would recognize the structure
if it was used in the sequel, Wrath of Khan,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.650
they did what any reasonable person would
do: turn it upside down, and the transformation

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.660
from offices to the Regula One space station
was complete.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.040
Alien

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.580
Physical props are one thing, but what about
digital ones?

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.400
Fans of Ridley Scott have imagined that both
Blade Runner and the Alien series exist in

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.180
the same universe, but it's a reused prop
that proves the director's two greatest sci-fi

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.460
stories have more in common than you'd think.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.340
When Deckard is picked up by a police spinner,
the launch sequence screen is identical to

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.100
the one used on Alien when the escape pod
leaves the ship.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.160
It's not the only reused footage, and even
if it was only meant to cut down costs, it

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.180
provided an in-universe link that's hard to
ignore.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.180
Spider-Man

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.970
Every director has their good luck charm,
from clothing, to supporting actors, and even

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.009
camera tricks.

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.240
But for Sam Raimi, it's the 1973 Oldsmobile
Delta 88 that he drove during his college

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.240
days.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.070
The large yellow car - nicknamed "The Classic"
- has appeared in nearly all of his films,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.850
from Spider-Man to Drag Me To Hell and Army
of Darkness.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.080
The car also made an appearance as a broken
down wreck in the modern Evil Dead remake,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.969
but it's the western The Quick and the Dead
that takes the cake.

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.620
Raimi made sure his car would fit into the
movie's Old West setting by hiding it under

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.819
a complex wagon chassis, making it sure it
still kept the tradition alive.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:47.979
The Empire Strikes Back

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.220
No matter how hard George Lucas and the Star
Wars producers tried, it always seemed that

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.840
the smallest, most ignored characters and
roles are the ones most embraced by fans.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.550
So the lineup of bounty hunters Vader assembles
in Episode 5 have all earned fan followings,

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.220
but the slim droid known as IG-88 has been
adopted by more than almost any other.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.520
It's funny, since the characters creation
itself was clearly a bit of a joke.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.229
When a droid bounty hunter was called for,
crew just looked at the previous film's set,

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.439
and used their imagination.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:19.129
How else do you explain the droid's head being
made from a drink dispenser used in the Mos

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.139
Eisley cantina?

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.139
Harry Potter

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.319
The Room of Requirement was a pivotal location
in the final chapters of the movie series,

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:30.059
enchanted to appear as whatever room was needed
by the Witch or wizard to access it.

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:34.029
But when the filmmakers needed it to be filled
to the brim with everything imaginable, they

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.680
called on props from nearly every movie that
came before it.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.389
There's the Chinese lanterns from the Christmas
party in the Half-Blood Prince, the Harp Quirrell

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.270
used to keep the three headed dog sleeping
in the Philosopher's Stone, and a giant chess

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.740
piece from the same movie.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.620
Fans can dissect every inch of the frame to
find them all.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.779
Those are just some of the recycled props
we caught in hit movies, but which other ones

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:53.860
did we miss?

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.110
