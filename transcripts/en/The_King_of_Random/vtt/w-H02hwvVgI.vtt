00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.259
When 
experimenting with homemade pyrotechnics,
things go wrong, and you don't want to be

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.110
too close if your composition explodes. I
need some sort of a pyrotechnic time-delay, so for this

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.510
project I'm using items from around the house,
to make a simple form of a slow burning fuse.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.380
If you've seen my videos on making rocket
fuel and smoke flares, you'll probably recognize

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.420
these ingredients. This time I'm mixing up
36 grams of my stump remover with 24 grams

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.420
of white table sugar. This gives me a 60 gram
composition that needs to be shaken up vigorously.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.420
I have a pre-heated frying pan set at medium
heat, so that when I add 1/3 cup of water,

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.409
it boils instantly. At this point, I'll slowly
sprinkle in the 60g mixture because I want

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.370
this all to dissolve. I can stir that in with
a spatula and because the water is so hot,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.400
it dissolves completely. That'll need to sit
for a minute, to heat up and let the water

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.720
boil out, so it's a good time to prepare my
cord. This is 100% cotton yarn, and I'm gonna

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.940
be using about 12 feet of it. Ok, the water
has boiled down to the point where the slurry

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.650
is getting very frothy which means this solution
is super saturated. It's time to add the yarn

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.240
into the mix to soak up the chemicals. As
the last bit of water continues to evaporate

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.110
out, it's important that every bit of yarn
is absorbing an equal amount of the solution.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.740
Holding onto one end will help prevent the
yarn from knotting up when I pull it out.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.760
This gets transferred onto a cookie sheet
using a pattern resembling a sine wave, and

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.610
with about 6 turns on each side, the yarn
is evenly spaced and fits perfectly. Now this

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.440
goes into an oven set to 300ÂºC for about
20 minutes. And while the cord is still hot,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.500
I can nudge it slightly to prevent it from
sticking to the pan when it cools later on.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.310
Alright, the time is up and this cord has
a slightly golden tinge to it, and that's

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.770
a good sign, so I'll leave it out to cool
for about 5-10 minutes. When the cord has

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.280
fully cooled, you can see it's become stiff
and retains the shape from when it was baked.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.260
Now I can just cut these strands at the base
of the turns, using some scissors, and I've

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.700
got a nice piece of fuse cord ready to go.
The cord is easy to cut, and a few of these

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.870
strands will get cut down smaller to be used
in a batch of smoke flares I made in another

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.909
project. Look for how I built those in a different
video. Ok, testing out the fuse, the first

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.860
thing I notice is it lights off really quickly,
and continues a steady and progressive burn.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.079
Even with a little breeze, it's still got
a nice flame shooting off the back, and seems

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:44.599
to burn steady at about 3 seconds per inch.
Sweet. I tried making different fuses, this

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.840
time soaking a coffee filter in the solution
and laying it out for baking. I also tried

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.700
soaking some paper towel, then twisting pieces
of it into shorter but thicker fuses. After

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.189
they were baked, they were very dry, and very
rigid. I cut a strip of the coffee filter

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.219
first, and tested it with a rock on top, to
see if it would fizzle out when it lost contact

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:07.639
with the open air. Surprisingly, it continued
to burn on underneath the rock, and kept on

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.200
burning right out the other side. One of the
paper towel fuses was lit, but maybe twisting

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.040
it wasn't such a good idea, because when the
pressure built inside, it was gone in an instant.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.189
I tried another one, and got pretty much the
same result. When this one was lit without

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.840
anything holding it down, it went airborne
So as far as consistency, reliability and

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.349
aesthetics go, I'm pretty happy with the results
using the yarn. Well there's how I made some

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.700
cheap, but functional, slow burning fuses
with things around the house. If you liked

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.910
this project, perhaps you'll like some of
my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
