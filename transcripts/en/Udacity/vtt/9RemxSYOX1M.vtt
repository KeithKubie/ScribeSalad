00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.877
A little while ago, we saw these two equations. And even though they look

00:00:04.877 --> 00:00:09.200
really different, we mentioned that they are equivalent to one another. We also

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.560
saw that this equation over here on the right, written in this particular form,

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.910
became very useful when we looked at the quadratic equations that go along with

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.290
these equations for parabolas. These two equations are also equivalent. But

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.280
the equation 0 equals negative one-eighth times the quantity x minus 4,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.660
times the quantity x minus 28, is very useful to us because from it,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.340
we can just read off the locations of the x intercepts. We have one at x equals

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.530
4, and we have another at x equals 28. Now we were just looking at this equation

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.930
to help us deal with the expanding dimensions of Grant's growing floor space.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.213
We had 0 equals x squared plus 25x minus 150.

00:00:55.213 --> 00:01:00.640
What kind of equation is this, though? Is this a linear equation, or

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.410
is it an equation for a parabola? Or is it a quadratic equation?
