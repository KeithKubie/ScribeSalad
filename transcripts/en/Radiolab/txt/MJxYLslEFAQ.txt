Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio lab from [inaudible], w. N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich is this radio lab, the podcast today on the podcast, a story about death incarnate and incarnate incarnate, I think. I think incarnate and credit. If that was Tim Howard, our producer. Sorry, am I in here yet? No, you're not supposed to be come in. You got to wait a story about death incarnate and the man who no talking could beat down. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:38          Are you in? Yeah, let's me jumped in.

Speaker 1:          00:42          Comes from my producer Tim Howard. But you're already here. So just start. Okay, so late last year I took a trip out to Wisconsin guest one too. It was like that first weekend of November when we were out there for the, for the live show. And I met this woman, Ann Kez to talk about her daughter. Gina, do you want to tell me? Me just like where you're sitting, what room? Crazy story. I am sitting in the kitchen of my home and find the Lac Wisconsin and, all right. So anyway, back in 2004 and September of 2004, uh, her daughter Gina was 15 sophomore, I remember it was homecoming week. So they had all activities each day and dress up days and Jean as a volleyball player. And one morning she just starts to feel kind of crappy. She started getting a tingling in her left arm. Um, we thought maybe she had a pinched nerve or something, thought nothing of it.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Then she goes to a volleyball game with somebody, I guess sets the ball to her to spike and she looks up and she sees two of them and she doesn't know which is the volleyball double vision. Yeah. About a week later she started getting flu like symptoms. She has headaches, she feels really sluggish. And each day she just got more tired. One of those days she does go to school, take the PSA sats, but then the next day she can't even get out of bed. They go to the doctor and he says, wow, it's not the flu. So we went home and then she just kept getting worse. Her arm started to involuntarily jerk. Um, her speech started becoming real slurred. Um, she, her body kind of stiffened up. Like we'd get her up to go to the bathroom and she just,

Speaker 1:          02:26          just, it was just really scary, weird how her body was just stiffening up. Anne and her husband, John took her to a neurologist for some tests, just trying to get down to the bottom of this, you know, and what, what is going on with her because of meningitis came back negative. Everything else that you're testing for came back negative. Were they running out of things to test for? Yeah, they pretty much didn't know what else to do. And a day later on, a Saturday gene is hospitalized. And then on Monday when her pediatrician who had seen her on Friday, came in and saw her and saw how much worse she was in just two days. He was like frazzled, like what is going on here? And then something just made me tell him about the bat.

Speaker 1:          03:11          Pat. Yeah. So this was a month earlier, Gina and her family, they were a mess. It was St Patrick's Catholic church, you know, old, big church, um, and about was flying around and it was just kind of bothering everybody. It would just like land on behind the altar of the stained glass windows up high. It just seemed like it wanted to get outside and there are open windows. It's like go out there right there, go. But it just, and then it would swoop down and it started getting lower to the people's heads and stuff. And there was an usher, he hit it to the floor. I don't know what to use, but Gina kept looking back at it and being the animal of her, she is, she thought she had to help it. And so she jumps up, runs over to the bat, grabs it by the wings and takes it outside. And as she does the bat bites her on the index finger of her left hand.

Speaker 3:          04:05          So it breaks the skin. Yeah, they washed it and then thought nothing of it. But when Anne told the pediatrician about this, his face turned white. He walked out of that room, he says, I'll be right back. But he never told us what it was. They immediately rushed her to Milwaukee, to this other hospital, this hospital, Wisconsin, to be treated by this guy. I'm Rodney Bullet B. I am an infectious disease consultant. And at the point when Rodney met Gina, she was a, what we call stuporous. You mean like she couldn't talk? She could, but barely. She was talking only single sentences could only follow a one step command. She was in a wheelchair because she couldn't physically stand and her left arm with twitch and spasm. She would apologize, say sorry. And then try and get back into position for the exam. And she was literally getting worse by the minute. Within two or three hours, she had to have a breathing tube put in. She was essentially becoming comatose the way she looked. I wasn't sure if she was going to survive. Uh, and, and of course, if she had rabies, I pretty much knew she wasn't going to survive

Speaker 4:          05:11          rabies. Yeah. But if you, if you are diagnosed with rabies, then what happened? What do you do? Um, you, you die basically you die. Yeah. Well, like what? All of the time. Some of the time, all of the time. It's a really deadly disease in terms of the percentage of people who come down with the symptoms of rabies, um, who die. It is the deadliest disease in the world. The deadliest, yeah. Here's the bottom line. If we say there are 55,000 cases of babies a year, then you also have 55,000 rabies deaths a year. Meaning it's a a hundred percent fatal. Yeah. And by the way, this is Monica, Monica Murphy. I'm a public health veterinarian. And this is bill bill Wassick. Uh, I'm a senior editor at wired magazine and they wrote a book called Rabbit where they trace the history of rabies all the way back to the beginning.

Speaker 4:          05:59          There are references to rabies going back as far as we have human writing in the Samarian literature in the Acadian literature. So for thousands of years we have been throwing everything and anything we can think of at this disease and failing. I mean that one like real, I mean from the star, you see these very, very weird cures. Desperate. For example, in Roman and Greek times, if you're a gene and you got bit by a bat, you might've tried eating a Cox brain goose grease mixed with honey, the flesh of a mad dogs, salted skin or old slough of a serpent, a cloud from a swallow's nest applied with vinegar, and then we have the Dung of red poultry provided it as if a red color is very useful. If those didn't work, you could pull out the feathers from around the live rooster's anus and apply the anus to the bite wounds on the theory that said anus would suck the poison up out of the wound.

Speaker 4:          06:55          Wait a second. How would a rooster's anus cure ever catch on in the first place? I mean, it wouldn't work. Well, yeah, but if you think about it, not every rabid dog or bat bite is actually gonna transfer the virus in the sense that you know, the, the saliva just will fail to get the virus. Where it needs to be is every so often the healer is going to come along with his rooster's anus and you know, put it on your wound and sure enough it works. Case closed. We have our, our rabies cure. Ah, so you're saying that plenty's list is a lot of lucky accidents by sorcerers? Yeah. I think that lucky accidents were kind of probably what kept some of these things kicking around in long enough to become accepted. Well what do we know? But rabies for real and what do we actually know about the disease?

Speaker 4:          07:40          I mean not much. We know it's a very unusual virus. The way a typical virus travels is it has a port of entry. It replicates locally. It makes it into the bloodstream. It circulates widely. It finds its target tissues and then it replicates exactly. So you get a wound, it gets infected, that goes into the blood. But rabies, it enters the body at the bite wound site. Say, in Gina's case, the tip of her finger, it binds to a nerve right there to a particular receptor and then crawls its way up the nervous system, one to two centimeters per day. That's right to attack the brain. It literally grabs onto the nerve and climbs up. It's like hand over hand. Might take a few days, go the length of a finger maybe three weeks ago, the length of an entire arm. It's during that slow climb that we can administer vaccine and help the body mountain immune response. If you give a person the vaccine before they see symptoms, while the virus is still climbing its way up to the brain, they should be okay, but once the infection has taken root in the brain

Speaker 5:          08:48          [inaudible],

Speaker 4:          08:49          then it's too late for vaccination. The moment you have a twitchy finger at the moment, you have like the slightest flu like symptoms, which will later progress into rabies. That's the moment that you know you're going to die of that disease. What does the virus do when it gets to the brain? Well, it's very much not known specifically what happens in the brain. It might start shutting parts of your brain down in about 30% of the cases, the muscles might start to kind of get paralyzed. That's called paralytic rabies. Eventually their entire body will get paralyzed and they might just slump into a coma or more often it's that that cliche of the rabies death is, is what actually happens where people have these like spasms of rage.

Speaker 6:          09:38          [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          09:39          There are videos online where you can see people in this room. Yeah. Youtube, I find them im impossible to watch

Speaker 6:          09:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          09:51          you know, just screaming and writhing and convulsions.

Speaker 6:          09:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          09:57          and from the viruses perspective, it's trying to drive its host to be more aggressive so that bites somebody else and spreads more virus. Oh. The other thing that is, I find really perverse is that they will get this fear of water or really powerful fear of water. The human victim of rabies tries to drink, wants to drink, but then they'll bring the cup to their hands and digital shake and overflow the muscles in their throat seize up the gag reflex and they can't. They can't drink water. Yeah. You can imagine though, again, from the viruses perspective, why that would be advantageous. You are trying to transmit virus through biting. So an animal who can't swallow his, his virus filled saliva, you're going to be like a loaded gun. Right? And eventually after a few days in these late stages, person might lapse into a coma, have a heart attack. There's really any number of ways

Speaker 1:          10:56          you could die. That sounds awful. In a, it was a, it was.

Speaker 4:          11:02          So when the official results came back and Rodney took Gina's mom and dad and in John Keasy into a room and yeah,

Speaker 1:          11:08          told them we're sorry, but she has rabies and it's definitely too late for the vaccine. John and I both started crying, you know, is there anything that can be done? And one of the doctors said, there's nothing we can do. I can either put her in a dark room and let her die. You can take her home and let her die and we're just, this can't be happening. They said, uh, what else do you got? They said, well, we can do standard sense of care. Well, does that work? Well? No. What else do you have? And then Dr Willoughby said, OK, well, well, I do have an idea. I'd like to try this.

Speaker 4:          11:54          I don't even know what he called it. Okay. So the night before, while they were waiting for the test results, hoping it wasn't rabies, Rodney started calling around, you know, I, I should call the CDC asking if there was anything that was unpublished but promising they say no. And then I essentially headed to the library. And what I did is I pulled a, I don't know, about 20 years with the case reports, started readings on a pretty hopeless, but, but he does notice one thing he sees mentioned in this one kind of obscure paper. I read one article that said, well, this might be to sort of neurotransmission yet maybe what's happening in the brain during rabies is something called excited, toxicity. Excited, excited, toxicity. CYTO toxicity. Yeah. It sounds exciting and maybe toxic. What is it? Well, excited toxicity. And this is, this is tricky stuff.

Speaker 4:          12:47          Um, and it's controversial. Yeah. Is this the kind of thing that actually makes rabies or researchers at conferences get into fights with each other? Here's the basic idea. Um, you might think that, uh, a brain infection just physically destroys the brain. Yeah. But under this theory, the brain isn't physically destroyed. It's just that the neurons themselves are getting overstimulated overexcited and then that part of the brain is disrupted and it all just kind of shuts down. Just making it impossible for the brain to function properly. And so the sort of life sustaining functions of the brain, like breathing and you know, circulating blood, they stopped working because the neurons that control them are just overwhelmed. Right. In other words, [inaudible] doesn't destroy the brain. It disrupts the brain. The brain itself is spared. So it's like a software problem, not a hardware problem. Yeah. And what Rodney read is that people had died of rabies and in the autopsy their brains looked totally fine.

Speaker 4:          13:47          Entirely normal. Moreover, the virus was gone. You couldn't even detect the rabies virus in their brain. Brain no longer had rabies in it. Really? Yeah. It was like there was no weapon at the scene of the crime. So that was my clue. What that suggested to Rodney is that the immune system does eventually turn on right and it kicks in and it starts fighting the disease. But it just gets there too late. So the immune system had all the tools, but essentially this virus beat your immune system to the punch. It would kill you faster than immune response could eradicate it cause the virus moves what more quickly than the immune system? Way Faster. And to me it was like, well you know the solution there is obvious and if he could buy Jeanna's immune system some time, enough time, you could clear the brain and the brain would not be damaged. She might survive. So what he suggest to Anne is that he put Jeanna into a coma, put her into a coma, induced the coma. And if, if an anesthesiologist is controlling routine brainstem activities like breathing circulation, then no matter what the virus is actually doing inside her brain, he might be able to keep her alive

Speaker 3:          15:03          long enough for the immune system. Make a response, which would take normally about seven to 10 days. And this is still kind of a guess. This is, this is entirely improvised. Yeah. And lots of things can go wrong and when they go wrong, they typically go wrong badly.

Speaker 4:          15:16          He knows there's a huge risk that she's going to end up being brain dead or maybe locked in.

Speaker 3:          15:21          And that's worse than death, I think in everybody's eyes.

Speaker 1:          15:25          Were you nervous about the cost? Like he said she could end up being a vegetable just like she cried. I don't think I thought that far ahead. I thought more of um,

Speaker 4:          15:37          let's just keep her alive, get the disease out of her. So they put Jeanna into a coma.

Speaker 7:          15:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          15:48          Rodney figures, we'll give her a week and then we'll check to see

Speaker 1:          15:52          if she has an immune response. Um, and once they had her hooked up, so with the coma, she had, uh, the pole with all the Ivy Stefan and the different medications and stuff and stays with Gina in the hospital room and spends her time praying and calling people and asking them to pray. And she repeated this one prayer, psalm 91 over and over again. It talks about, you know, basically the devil not getting a hold of you. He is my refuge and my fortress, my god in whom I trust. Surely He will save you from the Fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence.

Speaker 4:          16:29          And so we were just waiting, we'll cover you with his feathers waiting and under his wings you will find refuge.

Speaker 3:          16:36          It was probably the most uncomfortable feeling I've ever had in medicine.

Speaker 4:          16:43          Seven days in, they sample her spinal fluid, send it in for testing, and then they get the results

Speaker 3:          16:49          which say, oh, her antibody responses, uh, is then and going up, uh, immune system is working. Yeah, it was working in, in fact, we now have rabies antibody and we had a fair amount of it and it was in the spinal fluid is the meaning of this around the brain. And so essentially plan worked. So we said, well, okay, let's start waking her up.

Speaker 4:          17:09          But as they're waking her up, she has a fever and they couldn't figure out what was causing the fever. So they put her back under for another week and then finally they start to wake her up again. And she gradually, you know, woke up,

Speaker 3:          17:24          the brand activity looked great and she had nice pupils, but physically she did not move a muscle.

Speaker 8:          17:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          17:33          it pins her, they'd poke her. She had no movement anywhere other than her pupils. So, so she was responding to light light. That's it. And this was the one thing that Rodney was most afraid of,

Speaker 8:          17:48          that

Speaker 3:          17:49          Gina was a lock in

Speaker 8:          17:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          17:55          essentially locked inside this box of a body. And it was the worst day of my life because it looked like she would progress survive and we'd actually done worse than death. And as Rodney drove back and forth from work

Speaker 8:          18:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          18:12          he kept repeating this one prayer. Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on me. A poor center. Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on me, a poor center. Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on me for center. And then, um, about two days later, Rodney's in the hospital and he's looking over Gina's charts. Yeah, just checking. Hello Sam. Uh, and another doctor was finishing up her shift and she comes over to Rodney said, oh, did you know that she had reflexes today? And I said, no.

Speaker 8:          18:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          18:42          Rodney grabs the reflex hammer and then sure enough she had knee reflexes. The next day

Speaker 4:          18:47          her eyes started flooding a little bit. Within a week she was back for a couple of weeks after I woke up. I still have no memory. This is gene and Keasy the first person to survive rabies without the vaccine. Um, my first memory was actually Thanksgiving Day, a couple of weeks after she woke up from the coma back in 2004. Um, I just remember being with my family and um, um, playing board games with my brothers and then just them being there and then going down to the cafeteria for dinner, having fish. I remember we had to fish. How long was she in the hospital? For? About two months. I had to learn how to stand and then Norwalk, um, turn around, move my toes. Um, I was really after reviews, you know, a newborn baby who couldn't do anything. And then I had to really learn that all. Do you remember that?

Speaker 4:          19:50          Do you remember that feeling? Yeah, I mentally I was there, you know, mentally I knew how to do stuff, but my body wouldn't cooperate with what I want it to do. And it was frustrating and it definitely took a toll on me psychologically. You know, I'm still recovering. I'm not completely back. Stuff like, like balance and um, I can't, you know, run normally she can't play volleyball anymore, but she finished high school, went to college. I graduated with a degree in just general biology and now Gina is really into bets. She's a bat lover. Yeah. If I ever go down to the zoo, you know, they always pay, let me go behind and in with the baths and I can pet them and stuff. Yeah, I'll feed them all. Panam I've been going to Belfast vols here in Wisconsin, so I have no fear of bets.

Speaker 4:          20:46          That would be the last person I would expect to go to a bat festival. Oh, this girl is this scene, that's all she is the poster child for what became known as the Milwaukee Protocol. That's the name of Rodney's, a thing that he did with her. Yeah. I mean this has been tried. Again, this has been tried all around the world by different people and different versions of it, but it's been tried to around 30 times with what result. So everything I'm about to say forward, there's debate about every single little bit of it, but he says, uh, five survivors. Five survivor. Yeah. Out of how many people of about 30 people, which on the one hand is, that seems like a, a terrible, you know, percentage, uh, for a treatment for a disease. Five out of 30. But on the other hand, this is rabies and you know, for all of human history it was zero out of 30. Um, was there anything about five that separates them from the others? Well, this, this, this brings us to, uh, the, the, the really murky territory.

Speaker 9:          21:47          You know, rapey suspend one of those, just really interesting pathogens to me. The more you think you know about it, the more you don't know about it. This is Amy, Dr. Amy Gilbert. I'm a research biologist at the National Wildlife Research Center here in Fort Collins.

Speaker 4:          22:05          So this gets to your question, Robert. A couple of years ago, Amy actually went to study rabies in Peru.

Speaker 10:         22:11          Oh,

Speaker 4:          22:12          with this guy [inaudible] the physician, but professional, just so happen. Sergio is also from Peru. I was born in Lima and he now works as an epidemiologist at the CDC. So going to, but in 2010 they traveled deep into the Amazon jungle. First one limo will have to travel to Tarapoto on Fronterra Potawatomi. We're talking remote hours from [inaudible] was to Sanlorenzo on deploy. They're looking for, well they were studying bat born diseases and in that part of the world, people have a lot of contact with vampire paths. So we choose two towns, Trina Kutcha and Santa Marta. So they arrive and have a pretty lengthy discussion with the community leaders, explain what they're up to and go door to door, household to household. We shit each house and talk with one member of the family. And they'll ask, you know, have you been bit by a Vamp [inaudible] Bat? Have you had any illnesses than they take a blood sample. And what they found is basically rabies front page news,

Speaker 9:          23:11          11%, um, of the blood sample

Speaker 4:          23:15          bells that were tested, seven people out of 63 had what we call evidence of virus neutralizing antibodies. They had rabies antibodies in their blood. Uh, okay. Well you know how I mentioned that sometimes the body will mount a response to rabies but it's just too late. Yeah. So you might see those antibodies, but only when somebody's dying. Right. And these people in Peru, they had the antibodies but we didn't have any evidence there was any neurological disease in any of the cases. They didn't seem to have rabies, but we're really very surprised. I'm sorry. Why? Well, think about it. The only way they could have gotten those antibodies in their blood was by contact. In some points with the virus, they'd come into contact with rabies and yet they were fine. It was almost as if they were immune to rabies. Huh?

Speaker 4:          24:10          Well, I had, Amy won't use that word immune because the data are sort of inconclusive as to whether there was any [inaudible] the tree into the brain, like they didn't know if the virus made it all the way into these people's brains. And so did they come down with full-blown rabies or not? They don't know. But it's possible that these people are special. Some people even argue that there are special individuals who are able to survive rabies and not just in Peru. Monica told me about another case. He, Texas wild child, your baby's case laboratory confirmed. Um, a girl in Texas, 17 year old girl, I've run away, she shows up in 2009 at a hospital in Houston. She has a headache. Her neck hurts and she's really agitated. They confirmed that it was rabies, but she didn't receive the Milwaukee Protocol or any critical care measures as far as we know. They just figured she would die.

Speaker 5:          25:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          25:08          but then three weeks later this girl went on, you know, to, to walk out of the hospital. She just got better. No drugs, no coma, nothing on her own. Huh. Wow.

Speaker 5:          25:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          25:22          and this actually brings us back to Gina. She's pretty close to normal because at the point when she arrived at the hospital to see Rodney, he asked, she was diagnosed as having small amounts of antibody in hers. She already had antibody in her blood. Like those people in Peru. She did not have recoverable virus. We could not isolate virus from her, which is unusual. It does seem that she is immunologically special. In fact, if you look at all of the people who have gotten the Milwaukee Protocol and survived, they all have that profile. Like the girl in Texas, like precious Reynolds, that's another girl who got the Milwaukee Protocol and survived. They have had similar elaborate comeback though. Those patients, you know, have, have extraordinary lab work and extraordinary outcomes. And so some researchers in Canada and Thailand, I've argued that Rodney's protocol actually had very little effect, nothing to do with, and [inaudible] surviving. They would say she survived despite Dr Willoughby's treatment rather than, because I've talked to [inaudible] treatment. Oh. So they're accusing him of basically pulling a rooster's anus kind of number. Uh, I don't think they would. You know, really put it that way. Exactly.

Speaker 5:          26:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          26:33          they say that the Milwaukee Protocol should be discontinued and that we shouldn't be wasting time and money on it. You know, they in bank are acutely aware of the fact that to do one Milwaukee Protocol case, you could vaccinate, I think it was all of the kids in Bangkok preventatively against rabies, tens of thousands of slum kids in Bangkok could be preventatively vaccinated against rabies. So these credits would say, you know, give people a vaccines but don't induce the coma and don't use these untested drugs that Rodney administers. And if somebody comes in with an advanced case of rabies, well, unless you have evidence that they're one of these immunologically special people, you just need to accept the fact that they're going to die. I think. No calling not to do anything. I will definitely disagree. We'll have to do something. According to Sergio, the idea that Rodney somehow just got incredibly lucky when he was treating Gina. Geasey does very unlikely. Gina was basically at death's door. And there are some things might not be fully understanding you in that use case. But it was obvious that itchy was no given this alternative. She might not have survived. And you could argue that if Jean is part of this immunologically special group of people who can just survive rabies without the vaccine, and how come nobody did before Rodney came along?

Speaker 3:          27:55          You know, this is really not science. This is right now, storytelling does something right, but we still don't know. And we won't know until we figure out which parts work and don't work. You know, for now, Rodney's for us to evaluate and try to improve the protocol. Just one patient at a time without the funding or research that he wants. So you know, no clinical trials, no animal models. So we're, we're left learning the hard way, which is an awful way to learn. But he says, you can't just give up hope. You know, in the early days of cancer treatment, they weren't having any success, but they didn't just stop. And I've seen treatments for cancer evolve over my professional career from being 0% survival to being 85% survival. And now he puts the success rate of his protocol at about 20% that's a lot better than zero.

Speaker 3:          28:44          And it could go up, might not go up. It's true. So if you're a doctor now though, and a kid comes into the hospital, hasn't had the vaccine, has a full blown case of rabies, what do you do? Do you just derp your hands say sorry. It's not going to make it. Do you check and see if maybe he's immunologically special, put him in Tacoma. You put him into a coma that you don't know who's going to work, whatever the case. You've actually gotta be glad that Rodney gave Gina shot because whether or not you think that he saved her life or she saved her own life, the fact is that at least now we know that rabies isn't quite the killer that we once thought it was. He took it off of its throne of death. Even if you know, just a little bit.

Speaker 4:          29:32          And when we say, you know, maybe he's just coming off, it's a hundred percent thrown it, it's, you know, down to 99.999, you know, like, it's, it might, it

Speaker 3:          29:42          might be that it was never quite on that throne. Exactly. Ever. Right.

Speaker 5:          29:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          29:56          all right. Well, uh, we've certainly clear things up. Thank you, Tim. Yeah, sure thing. Thanks also to Ashvin Shaw for research help and, uh, you guys for listening.
