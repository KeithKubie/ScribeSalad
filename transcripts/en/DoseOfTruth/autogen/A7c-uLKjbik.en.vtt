00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.210
 
it seems we are bound to repeat history

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220
it seems we are bound to repeat history
 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.070
it seems we are bound to repeat history
and what as old becomes new again why is

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080
and what as old becomes new again why is
 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.539
and what as old becomes new again why is
it that we can't seem to find

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549
it that we can't seem to find
 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.660
it that we can't seem to find
equilibrium within a society ideas begin

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670
equilibrium within a society ideas begin
 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.370
equilibrium within a society ideas begin
with good intentions but lead towards

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380
with good intentions but lead towards
 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.039
with good intentions but lead towards
the extreme yeah well the reason we

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049
the extreme yeah well the reason we
 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.379
the extreme yeah well the reason we
can't find equilibrium is because the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
can't find equilibrium is because the
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.060
can't find equilibrium is because the
environment that we live in isn't an

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
environment that we live in isn't an
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.060
environment that we live in isn't an
equilibrium and so I I kind of imagined

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
equilibrium and so I I kind of imagined
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.160
equilibrium and so I I kind of imagined
it this way it's like we're we're

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170
it this way it's like we're we're
 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.470
it this way it's like we're we're
traversing the back of a giant this is

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
traversing the back of a giant this is
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.269
traversing the back of a giant this is
obviously a symbolic reference of the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
obviously a symbolic reference of the
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.269
obviously a symbolic reference of the
giant serpent and it's it weaves back

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
giant serpent and it's it weaves back
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.220
giant serpent and it's it weaves back
and forth and you don't know at any

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230
and forth and you don't know at any
 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.049
and forth and you don't know at any
moment which way it's gonna curve and

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059
moment which way it's gonna curve and
 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.360
moment which way it's gonna curve and
turn and so sometimes it turns to the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
turn and so sometimes it turns to the
 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.130
turn and so sometimes it turns to the
right and sometimes it turns to the left

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
right and sometimes it turns to the left
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020
right and sometimes it turns to the left
and what that means politically is that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030
and what that means politically is that
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.340
and what that means politically is that
sometimes we have to turn to the right

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
sometimes we have to turn to the right
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.959
sometimes we have to turn to the right
and sometimes we have to turn to the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
and sometimes we have to turn to the
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.970
and sometimes we have to turn to the
left and we don't know exactly Windows

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980
left and we don't know exactly Windows
 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.440
left and we don't know exactly Windows
what would you call we don't know

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450
what would you call we don't know
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.930
what would you call we don't know
exactly how to time that and so what we

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
exactly how to time that and so what we
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790
exactly how to time that and so what we
all have to do is keep our eyes open and

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
all have to do is keep our eyes open and
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.380
all have to do is keep our eyes open and
tell the truth and discuss things with

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390
tell the truth and discuss things with
 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.270
tell the truth and discuss things with
each other especially with people who

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
each other especially with people who
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.439
each other especially with people who
have political beliefs that are

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
have political beliefs that are
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.540
have political beliefs that are
different than us so that we can ensure

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
different than us so that we can ensure
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.760
different than us so that we can ensure
that we haven't tilted too far one way

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
that we haven't tilted too far one way
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.549
that we haven't tilted too far one way
or the other and that's why I'm an

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559
or the other and that's why I'm an
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350
or the other and that's why I'm an
advocate of free speech or one of the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
advocate of free speech or one of the
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.700
advocate of free speech or one of the
many reasons I'm an advocate of free

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
many reasons I'm an advocate of free
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.250
many reasons I'm an advocate of free
speech is because it's the continual

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
speech is because it's the continual
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.800
speech is because it's the continual
dialogue between people of different

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810
dialogue between people of different
 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.210
dialogue between people of different
temperamental types that keeps us

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
temperamental types that keeps us
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219
temperamental types that keeps us
oriented as close as we can to the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
oriented as close as we can to the
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.499
oriented as close as we can to the
center of the Serpent's back and so

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
center of the Serpent's back and so
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.300
center of the Serpent's back and so
there is no permanent equilibrium

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
there is no permanent equilibrium
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.740
there is no permanent equilibrium
there's only the equilibrium that's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
there's only the equilibrium that's
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.050
there's only the equilibrium that's
produced by continual negotiation and a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
produced by continual negotiation and a
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.020
produced by continual negotiation and a
democracy is a formalized negotiation

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
democracy is a formalized negotiation
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.069
democracy is a formalized negotiation
and so and and and it's free speech that

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
and so and and and it's free speech that
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.550
and so and and and it's free speech that
keeps it healthy and alive so there's no

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
keeps it healthy and alive so there's no
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.770
keeps it healthy and alive so there's no
permanent equivalent equilibrium state

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
permanent equivalent equilibrium state
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.399
permanent equivalent equilibrium state
except death no and it's always

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409
except death no and it's always
 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.899
except death no and it's always
negotiation in relationships to like if

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
negotiation in relationships to like if
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.580
negotiation in relationships to like if
you have an intimate relationship or a

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
you have an intimate relationship or a
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.440
you have an intimate relationship or a
familial relationship or even a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
familial relationship or even a
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.389
familial relationship or even a
friendship there's no final equilibrium

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
friendship there's no final equilibrium
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.219
friendship there's no final equilibrium
state you have to communicate with each

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
state you have to communicate with each
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.920
state you have to communicate with each
other honestly all the time and keep the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
other honestly all the time and keep the
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.200
other honestly all the time and keep the
relationship moving to adjust the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
relationship moving to adjust the
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.760
relationship moving to adjust the
environment that the relationship is

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
environment that the relationship is
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.039
environment that the relationship is
operating in that's how it stays alive

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
operating in that's how it stays alive
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.200
operating in that's how it stays alive
in an intimate long-term intimate

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
in an intimate long-term intimate
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.789
in an intimate long-term intimate
relationship like a marriage it's a

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799
relationship like a marriage it's a
 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.179
relationship like a marriage it's a
continual it takes continual effort

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189
continual it takes continual effort
 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.280
continual it takes continual effort
I mean it's worthwhile effort and that

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290
I mean it's worthwhile effort and that
 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.900
I mean it's worthwhile effort and that
but you have to be conscious in a way to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
but you have to be conscious in a way to
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.089
but you have to be conscious in a way to
keep your relationship alive and you

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
keep your relationship alive and you
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.630
keep your relationship alive and you
have to be

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640
have to be
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.670
have to be
communicating all the time well maybe

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
communicating all the time well maybe
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.410
communicating all the time well maybe
not all the time because you can over

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420
not all the time because you can over
 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.920
not all the time because you can over
communicate too but so well so that's

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
communicate too but so well so that's
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.570
communicate too but so well so that's
why we can't reach a state of permanent

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
why we can't reach a state of permanent
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.480
why we can't reach a state of permanent
equilibrium
