00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.730
What we're going to do in this
video is, through a bunch of

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.710
examples, familiarize
ourselves with the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.670
x,y-coordinate plane.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.810
And first we're going to just
look at some points that are

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.500
already plotted and figure
out their coordinates.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.390
Then we're going to look at some
coordinates and figure

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.290
out where those points are.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.395
Then we'll do one
more problem.

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:19.700
So let's figure out
what are the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.890
coordinates of these points?

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.550
So you have this point
right here, A.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.680
So its x-coordinate, you
can see it right there.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.600
You just drop down.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.800
Where does it intersect
the x-axis?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.346
x is equal to 5.

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:36.960
So it's the point 5 comma and
y is going to be equal to 6.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.990
5 comma 6.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.920
Now this point B here, what's
the x-coordinate?

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.920
It is 5 to the left.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.940
5 to the left of the x-axis.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.496
This is negative 5.

00:00:47.496 --> 00:00:50.590
Its x-coordinate
is negative 5.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.340
y-coordinate is, if you just
go straight to the right,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.210
you're going to hit
y is equal to 5.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.620
y is equal 5.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.190
Let me switch colors.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.050
C.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.750
I think you're getting
the hang of this.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.040
Let's do the y-coordinate first.
The y-coordinate is 3.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.760
You see that right there.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.440
And then the x-coordinate
is negative 2.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.130
Negative 2.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.850
You always put the x-coordinate
first. That's

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.800
just the convention we use.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.660
D, x-coordinate negative 2.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.210
You see that right there.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.750
y-coordinate negative
2, as well.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.040
Let me get another color.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.170
E, let's do the y-coordinate.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.650
We'll figure it out first,
but you always

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.450
have to write it second.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.780
It's negative 4.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.510
You see that right there,
the y-coordinate.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.420
The x-coordinate is 3.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.820
And then finally, F.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.046
The x-coordinate is 2.

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:46.000
And the y-coordinate
is negative 6.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.550
Hopefully that gives you a sense
of at least figuring out

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.570
the coordinates.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.550
Now let's go the other way.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.190
Let's start with coordinates
and figure out where those

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.600
points are.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.900
So you have this first one.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.560
I'll do it lowercase case a in
parentheses to differentiate

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200
it from this uppercase A.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.190
So it's at 4 comma 2.
x is equal to 4.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.500
y is equal to 2.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.360
So that's that point
right there.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.855
Let's do the next one.

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:15.850
Let me do it in a color that
you'll be able to read.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.150
b.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.680
x is equal to negative 3.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.190
y is equal to 5.5.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.480
So you go all the
way up to 5.5.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.440
y is equal to 5.5.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.100
So that is the point lowercase
b with parentheses around it.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.050
Then c, 4 negative 4.
x is equal to 4.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.300
y is equal to negative 4.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.190
Right over there.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.610
And then one last one.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.230
I'll do it in orange.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.915
d, x is negative 2,
y is negative 3.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.140
Right there.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.180
That's the d with parentheses.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.980
And you could have gone
the other way.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.790
You could have said, hey, y
is equal to negative 3.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.690
x is equal to negative 2.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.360
So you could go to the
left and down.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.070
Or you could go down
and to the left.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.610
And you're still going to
get to the same point.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.400
So hopefully that gives you a
good sense of how to figure

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.160
out coordinates.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.160
Or if you're given coordinates,
how to figure out

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.550
where to plot something on
the x,y-coordinate plane.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.480
Now let's do a slightly
more involved problem.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.100
So it says the following 3
points are 3 vertices of

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.000
square A, B, C, D.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.440
Plot them on a graph.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.180
Then determine what the
coordinates of the fourth

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.030
point, D, would be.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.210
All right, let's plot
these on a graph, as

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.230
they tell us to do.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.860
All right.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.890
That'll be my y-axis.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.410
That's my y-axis.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.910
The vertical axis.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.160
That'll be my x-axis.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.750
And let me put some--
let me mark it.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.800
So that's x equals 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.700
This is x is equal to negative
1, negative 2, negative 3,

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.460
negative 4.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.000
That's y is equal
to 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.270
This is y is equal to negative
1, negative 2, negative 3,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.590
negative 4.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.350
I could write that
this y equals 4.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.530
This y equals negative
4. x is equal to 4.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.950
x is equal to negative 4.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.180
And let's see.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.649
Let's plot these points.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.970
So first, we have the point
A is equal to negative 4,

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.730
negative 4.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.230
So we go x is negative 4.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.810
And then y is negative 4.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.040
So we drop down 4 right there.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.790
And that is our point A.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.080
Negative 4, negative 4.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.350
And just to familiarize yourself
with a labeling

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.790
scheme that you may or may not
have seen before, is that

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.600
people label these sections
of the coordinate plane.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.440
They call this the
first quadrant.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.510
They call this the
second quadrant.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.850
They call this the
third quadrant.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.950
And they call this the
fourth quadrant.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.290
And these are just the Roman
numerals for I, II, III, and

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.570
IV, So this point is in
the third quadrant.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.480
When we looked up at this stuff
over here, these points

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.840
are in the fourth quadrant.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.160
These are in the third,
second, first. Just an

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.430
interesting thing to know.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.920
Sometimes someone might
ask you, what quadrant

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.540
is that point in?

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.990
And you just say, OK, I see.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.850
If they're both negative,
they're going to be in the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.000
third quadrant.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.100
If just the y is negative, but
the x is positive, you're

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.640
going to be in the fourth.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.560
If they're both positive, you're
in the first. If y is

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.760
positive, but x is negative,
you're in the second.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.150
And we'll talk a little
bit about that as

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.480
we plot these points.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.880
So point B, x is positive.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.730
It's 1, 2, 3.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.430
And y is negative 4.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.710
So we drop down here into
the fourth quadrant.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.580
That is the point B.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.620
It's 3, negative 4.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.280
So we can already see the bottom
of our rectangle that

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.920
they're talking about,
right there.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.700
And notice, both of these
have the exact same y.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.080
They're both at the same
level below the x-axis.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.600
And then what's the
next point?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.880
Point C is 3 comma 3.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.880
So 3 comma 3.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.100
It's in the first quadrant.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.600
Both of its coordinates
are positive.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.490
3 comma 3.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.910
Both x and y are positive.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.620
And notice, it's on the
same vertical as B.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.690
It has the same x value.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.460
They both have an
x value of 3.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.220
So it's right above it.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.910
Right above it.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.210
Now we have to figure out
the last point here.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.740
Well, the point is going to
have to be on the same

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.760
vertical as this point.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.690
It's going to have to be on
the same vertical as this

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.290
point, which means it's going
to have the same x value as

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.250
this point.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.320
So its x value is going
to be negative 4.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.360
And then it's going to have to
be on the same horizontal as

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.660
this point.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.680
It's going to have
to be on the same

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.020
horizontal as that point.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.560
So it's going to have to have
the same y value at the same

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.320
height above the x-axis.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.270
So it's going to have to be 3.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.570
So that is our point D.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.850
Notice it's at negative
4, right above A.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.230
And it's at y is equal to 3.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.210
Right to the left of point C.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.980
And we are done.
