00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
I was thinking about the issue of

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580
I was thinking about the issue of
 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.490
I was thinking about the issue of
discrimination in relationship to sex

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500
discrimination in relationship to sex
 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.170
discrimination in relationship to sex
because I've been thinking a lot about

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180
because I've been thinking a lot about
 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.000
because I've been thinking a lot about
discrimination lately because everybody

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010
discrimination lately because everybody
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.290
discrimination lately because everybody
thinks discrimination is a bad idea

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300
thinks discrimination is a bad idea
 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.720
thinks discrimination is a bad idea
which is a very stupid proposition

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730
which is a very stupid proposition
 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.669
which is a very stupid proposition
because you're discriminating all the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
because you're discriminating all the
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.189
because you're discriminating all the
time and the most fundamental form of

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
time and the most fundamental form of
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.019
time and the most fundamental form of
discrimination is choice of sexual

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
discrimination is choice of sexual
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.000
discrimination is choice of sexual
partner and so you might say well why

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010
partner and so you might say well why
 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.279
partner and so you might say well why
should that even be allowed because it

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
should that even be allowed because it
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.689
should that even be allowed because it
is the most fundamental form of

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
is the most fundamental form of
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.670
is the most fundamental form of
discrimination so for example almost

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
discrimination so for example almost
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.220
discrimination so for example almost
everyone is racially prejudiced when it

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
everyone is racially prejudiced when it
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.500
everyone is racially prejudiced when it
comes to sexual partners so you think

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510

could get away with it roughly speaking
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.060
could get away with it roughly speaking
