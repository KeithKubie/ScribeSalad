00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
can we evolve that and add a new thing

as well was like really simple you
didn't<00:10:53.399><c> have</c><00:10:53.699><c> to</c><00:10:53.880><c> draw</c><00:10:54.149><c> a</c><00:10:54.180><c> lot</c><00:10:54.449><c> but</c><00:10:55.019><c> the</c><00:10:55.470><c> app</c>

00:10:55.549 --> 00:10:55.559 align:start position:0%
didn't have to draw a lot but the app
 

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:58.130 align:start position:0%
didn't have to draw a lot but the app
under<00:10:55.740><c> stood</c><00:10:56.100><c> like</c><00:10:56.279><c> signal</c><00:10:57.120><c> so</c><00:10:57.269><c> if</c><00:10:57.420><c> you--if</c>

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
under stood like signal so if you--if
 

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.870 align:start position:0%
under stood like signal so if you--if
you'll<00:10:58.230><c> design</c><00:10:58.740><c> like</c><00:10:59.010><c> a</c><00:10:59.040><c> plus</c><00:10:59.340><c> sign</c><00:10:59.580><c> on</c><00:10:59.850><c> a</c>

00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
you'll design like a plus sign on a
 

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.490 align:start position:0%
you'll design like a plus sign on a

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
sheet of paper it would understand like
 

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
sheet of paper it would understand like
okay<00:11:01.770><c> this</c><00:11:01.920><c> plus</c><00:11:02.160><c> sign</c><00:11:02.340><c> is</c><00:11:02.520><c> a</c><00:11:02.550><c> coin</c><00:11:02.910><c> so</c><00:11:03.540><c> it</c>

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:03.810 align:start position:0%
okay this plus sign is a coin so it
 

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.300 align:start position:0%
okay this plus sign is a coin so it
would<00:11:03.960><c> read</c><00:11:04.200><c> that</c><00:11:04.350><c> and</c><00:11:04.590><c> it</c><00:11:04.740><c> would</c><00:11:04.890><c> throw</c><00:11:05.160><c> that</c>

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:05.310 align:start position:0%
would read that and it would throw that
 

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
would read that and it would throw that
in<00:11:05.370><c> in</c><00:11:05.880><c> the</c><00:11:06.180><c> in</c><00:11:06.210><c> the</c><00:11:06.630><c> app</c><00:11:06.750><c> so</c><00:11:07.410><c> for</c><00:11:08.040><c> us</c><00:11:08.160><c> this</c><00:11:08.340><c> is</c>
