you look up no trees up there which is

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 align:start position:0%
great it's hilarious but if you look
 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.150 align:start position:0%
great it's hilarious but if you look

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 align:start position:0%
well pie is close to 3 so the gradient
 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
well pie is close to 3 so the gradient

upgrade than the model you could say
 

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.270 align:start position:0%
upgrade than the model you could say

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
well what if the trees are a little bit
 

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
well what if the trees are a little bit
thick<00:08:44.460><c> or</c><00:08:45.090><c> maybe</c><00:08:45.480><c> if</c><00:08:45.690><c> you</c><00:08:45.810><c> if</c><00:08:46.080><c> you</c><00:08:46.170><c> think</c><00:08:46.350><c> about</c>

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:46.410 align:start position:0%
thick or maybe if you if you think about
 

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
thick or maybe if you if you think about
this<00:08:46.620><c> is</c><00:08:46.710><c> firing</c><00:08:47.070><c> a</c><00:08:47.130><c> laser</c><00:08:47.310><c> beam</c><00:08:47.670><c> and</c><00:08:47.700><c> the</c>

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:47.970 align:start position:0%
this is firing a laser beam and the
 

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.650 align:start position:0%
this is firing a laser beam and the
order

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
order
 

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
order
then<00:08:49.170><c> you</c><00:08:49.260><c> could</c><00:08:49.380><c> say</c><00:08:49.470><c> what</c><00:08:49.590><c> if</c><00:08:49.710><c> my</c><00:08:49.800><c> laser</c><00:08:49.980><c> beam</c>

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.130 align:start position:0%
then you could say what if my laser beam
 

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.010 align:start position:0%
then you could say what if my laser beam
is<00:08:50.220><c> a</c><00:08:50.250><c> little</c><00:08:50.460><c> bit</c><00:08:50.550><c> thick</c><00:08:50.760><c> and</c><00:08:51.480><c> it's</c><00:08:51.780><c> very</c><00:08:51.960><c> easy</c>

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
is a little bit thick and it's very easy
 

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
is a little bit thick and it's very easy
to<00:08:52.500><c> start</c><00:08:52.560><c> realizing</c><00:08:52.980><c> that</c><00:08:53.190><c> eventually</c><00:08:53.940><c> when</c>

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:54.330 align:start position:0%
to start realizing that eventually when
 

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.180 align:start position:0%
to start realizing that eventually when
the<00:08:54.480><c> thickness</c><00:08:54.750><c> comes</c><00:08:54.900><c> in</c><00:08:55.110><c> you</c><00:08:55.560><c> do</c><00:08:55.800><c> get</c><00:08:55.950><c> trees</c>

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:56.190 align:start position:0%
the thickness comes in you do get trees
 

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.890 align:start position:0%
the thickness comes in you do get trees
blocking<00:08:56.430><c> away</c><00:08:56.670><c> and</c><00:08:56.880><c> you're</c><00:08:56.970><c> going</c><00:08:57.510><c> to</c><00:08:57.600><c> forest</c>

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
blocking away and you're going to forest
 

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
blocking away and you're going to forest
or<00:08:58.530><c> you</c><00:08:58.650><c> see</c><00:08:58.740><c> is</c><00:08:58.860><c> trees</c><00:08:59.100><c> which</c><00:08:59.460><c> is</c><00:08:59.580><c> different</c>

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.210 align:start position:0%
or you see is trees which is different
 

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.730 align:start position:0%
or you see is trees which is different

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
from what we just explained but the
 

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.930 align:start position:0%
from what we just explained but the

question is how far can you see into the

question is how far can you see into the

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:03.780 align:start position:0%
forest and there something we've got
 

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.540 align:start position:0%
forest and there something we've got
quite<00:09:04.050><c> a</c><00:09:04.110><c> real-life</c><00:09:04.830><c> question</c><00:09:05.160><c> of</c><00:09:05.250><c> like</c><00:09:05.370><c> what</c>

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:05.550 align:start position:0%
quite a real-life question of like what
 

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.980 align:start position:0%
quite a real-life question of like what
how<00:09:05.760><c> far</c><00:09:06.000><c> does</c><00:09:06.150><c> this</c><00:09:06.300><c> lay</c><00:09:06.510><c> they</c><00:09:06.660><c> actually</c><00:09:06.870><c> get</c>

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:06.990 align:start position:0%
how far does this lay they actually get
 

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.690 align:start position:0%
how far does this lay they actually get
