00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.813
What's one interview question 
you ask every prospective employee?

00:00:05.073 --> 00:00:07.472
I'm fortunate that 
a bunch of my founding team

00:00:07.472 --> 00:00:08.846
is still with me,

00:00:08.846 --> 00:00:12.250
and we were friends off the bat

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.625
so we can be very comfortable 
with each other.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.879
So, I'd say the first question 
I ask is actually,

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.429
"Tell me your story."

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.892
It may seem pretty simple,

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:23.431
but really what I'm looking for

00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:25.534
is creativity,

00:00:25.534 --> 00:00:26.704
honesty,

00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:28.937
and probably the most 
important characteristic

00:00:28.937 --> 00:00:30.522
that no one ever talks about

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:32.302
is sense of humor.

00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:34.867
If you can't roll with 
my existing team

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.112
and laugh at 
the same jokes as us

00:00:36.112 --> 00:00:38.490
and get it done at 
the same pace as us,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.782
then you can't 
contribute to the team,

00:00:40.782 --> 00:00:43.684
and that would be 
horrible for you, you know?

00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:45.278
You don't want to be
in an environment

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.602
where you don't really feel

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:48.492
like you're a part of the family.

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:49.942
So, I start from there.

00:00:49.942 --> 00:00:50.597
What's your story?

00:00:50.597 --> 00:00:52.347
Who are you?
