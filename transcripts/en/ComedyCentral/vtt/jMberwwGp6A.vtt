- He's just talking to me
the whole time in that super

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.610
porntastic way, he's like,
"I'm gonna make you come.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.213 align:start size:81% position:19%
"I'm gonna make
you come so hard."

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:15.949
And I'm just like, "Uh, yeah
buddy, whenever you want."

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.952
(suspenseful music)

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:55.154
(cheering)

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:57.290
- Hello everybody, welcome
to This is Not Happening.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.460
I'm your host, Ari Shaffir
and tonight it's all stories

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.894
about romance.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:04.263
(cheering)

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.832
Please help me welcome a
very, very funny woman,

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:08.835
Miss Kate Willett everybody.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.071
(cheering)

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.740
- So I'm gonna tell you guys
a story about burning man.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.077
So I went to Burning
Man this past year.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:21.013 align:start size:97% position:3%
Give it up if you've ever
been to Burning Man, anybody?

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:22.481
Okay, some people.

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:25.618 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was skeptical about it
because I've heard that it's

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:28.754 align:start size:97% position:3%
kinda lame now, a lot of tech
people, but it's actually

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:31.323
really cool, there's a lot of
neat stuff you can do there.

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.860 align:start size:97% position:3%
You can dance all night,
you can see really cool art,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.597 align:start size:94% position:6%
or you can have an
unplanned pregnancy scare.

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.466
That is what I did.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.970 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I went out there and I
ran into this guy that I know

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.108
from home, he's actually
one of my roommates and,

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.878
you know when you run into
somebody at Burning Man,

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:54.948
you basically have to fuck them.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:58.150 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's like the gift
economy thing out there.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.322
We decided we were gonna
have sex at Burning Man and

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:06.559 align:start size:84% position:16%
we wanted it to be
really spiritual,
really transformative,

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:09.796
really special, but there's
not a great place to have

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:11.464
sex at Burning Man.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.299
We were like, oh where
are we gonna do this?

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.568 align:start size:97% position:3%
Because my tent was
covered in dust and glitter

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:20.473
and his camp, they're having
a non-violent communication

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.208
circus arts workshop.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.478
We're like, where
can we do this?

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:29.482
So we decided on the orgy tent.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:32.352 align:start size:88% position:13%
'Cause we knew that
would be possible there.

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:36.523
So we go there, we wait in
line for a while, and I see

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.159
the wheels in my friend's
head turning, you know,

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.161
because he's like 24 and
I can tell that he's like

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:45.164
picturing this whole scenario
of a bunch of porn looking

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:47.666 align:start size:94% position:6%
ladies being like, "I'm
bisexual but mostly I just

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.068
"love your dick."

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:55.675 align:start size:97% position:3%
I knew it was gonna be a lot
more ren faire than that.

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:02.047
We walk in there, the first
thing we see is this giant,

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:03.949
bear looking guy.

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:08.621 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's wearing a leather
utility kilt and he is fisting

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:13.359 align:start size:94% position:6%
a woman, he's barking like
a dog, he's just like,

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.927
"Woof, woof, woof,
woof, woof, woof."

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:18.230 align:start size:97% position:3%
My friend looks at this
whole scenario and he's like,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.933
"I don't even know if I can
do this with you here, Kate,

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:22.868
"it's too weird."

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:26.372
And I was like, "You gotta
stop whining and put out."

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:30.910 align:start size:97% position:3%
Just to be clear, I don't
think that anybody is entitled

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.881
to sex with anybody, but at
the same time, we did wait

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.983
in line for half an hour.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:39.252
(laughter)

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:45.925 align:start position:0%
So we go in there, we look
around, we find a spot on a mat,

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:49.161
there's a bunch of people
doing sex yoga around,

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:52.498
and we start having sex and
pretty immediately I can

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.734
tell that it's some of the
worst sex that I've ever

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:55.969
had in my life.

00:03:56.936 --> 00:03:58.270
So bad.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.074 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like, this guy is making
no effort whatsoever.

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.343
It is like freshman
dorm kinda stuff.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:06.579
He's not even trying because
he's super cute, you know,

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.914 align:start size:94% position:6%
and sometimes cute people,
they don't really make

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:10.983
that effort for you in bed.

00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:13.919 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you want someone to really
kill it in bed, you gotta

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.289 align:start size:84% position:16%
go for the short,
the fat and the ugly.

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.994 align:start size:94% position:6%
Those people are striving
to be invited back.

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:23.095 align:start size:94% position:6%
If you sleep with someone
cute, it's just like,

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:26.499 align:start size:88% position:13%
"Hey I've got this dick,
so congratulations."

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:28.634
And the whole time they're
just thinking about how lucky

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:30.503
you are and it's just like ugh.

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:33.639
But this guy, he's like,
he's just talking to me

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.141
the whole time in that
super porntastic way.

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:38.778 align:start size:84% position:16%
He's like, "I'm
gonna make you come.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.180
"I'm gonna make
you come so hard.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.616 align:start size:81% position:19%
"I'm gonna make
you come so hard."

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:48.354
And I'm just like, "Uh yeah
buddy, whenever you want."

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:51.957 align:start size:97% position:3%
He's like, "Have you ever
been fucked like this before?"

00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:54.627
I was just like, "Honestly, no."

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:00.633
He was fucking me like he
did not know that I was

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.302
a stand-up comedian.

00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:09.575 align:start size:84% position:16%
As a quick little side
note, he knows now.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:14.747
So then a few minutes go by
and he finishes and I also

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:17.383
finish but not because he
was good at it, just 'cause

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:19.718
I'm a feminist and.

00:05:19.718 --> 00:05:23.890
He says to me, he's like,
"Oh Kate, I gotta tell you

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:29.862 align:start size:88% position:13%
"something, it is gonna
be a real bummer."

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.766
And I'm thinking, yeah, I
know what this is because

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.502 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm a lady that's had casual
sex before and the bummer

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:39.438
is always like, "I'm really
sorry that I can't have a

00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:41.574
"relationship with you."

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.676
And it's always from
the worst guy too.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:46.511
Like women are just sitting
in their rooms being like,

00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:48.848
"Pleas God, give me a
terrible boyfriend."

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.784
So like, "Sorry I don't
see anything long-term."

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:54.087
It's like, dude, no, it's
cool, I just wanna, like,

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:57.055
fuck four more times and,
if we're being honest,

00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:59.191
probably loan you some money.

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:01.427
I am not in this to win it.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.231
So I start getting up and
leaving and he's like,

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:07.366
"No, no, no, no, no, Kate,
this is a serious thing,

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.235
"this is really serious."

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:11.036
So I'm like, "Okay,
fine, what is it?"

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:14.140
He's like, "The condom broke."

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.375
And I was like, "Oh shit."

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:19.745 align:start size:97% position:3%
That is a huge bummer
because I definitely cannot

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:22.548 align:start size:84% position:16%
have a kid with this
guy, like no way.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:25.384
No matter how many crystals
he sells in the spiritual

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:29.222 align:start size:88% position:13%
bookstore, we are not
gonna be able to pull it

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:33.225 align:start size:94% position:6%
together to support a
fam, and I for sure don't

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:35.261
wanna have an abortion with him.

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:37.964 align:start size:97% position:3%
I want you guys to understand,
I am not against abortion,

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.464
except with him.

00:06:39.464 --> 00:06:42.401
It'd be a huge pain in the ass.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.970
He for sure would not
pay for half, you know.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.474
He probably would give
me like 20 bucks which I

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.776
would know is a lot
for him financially,

00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:52.945
but also emotionally.

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:56.749
Then I'd have to be like,
"Oh you did really good."

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.984 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it's just like I
don't wanna get into that,

00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:00.485
you know?

00:07:00.485 --> 00:07:02.454
We'd go to Planned Parenthood
together and we'd be sitting

00:07:02.454 --> 00:07:04.423
in the waiting room and
he'd be like, "Oh man,

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.959
"this is some really
heavy karma, dude."

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:10.095
And I would just be like, "Oh
my God, how old am I gonna

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:14.267
"be before I start having sex
with men who call me dude?"

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:18.704
He'd be getting upset and so
I'd like feed him some chips

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:21.307 align:start size:88% position:13%
from the vending machine
to calm him down.

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:25.478
He'd be like, "I don't even
know if these are vegan."

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:30.282 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I'd just be like, "I
can't wait to kill your baby."

00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.485
(laughter)

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:37.456
But I'm thinking this will
be alright, it won't come

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:38.891
to that, you know.

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:41.060 align:start size:97% position:3%
Obviously they're gonna
have the morning after pill

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.628
at Burning Man.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:44.964
Of course they have Plan B
at Burning Man, like does

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.300 align:start size:94% position:6%
Burning Man seem like a
place that a lot of people

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.468
have a plan A?

00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:53.472 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I ask my friend if
he wants to come with me

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:56.508 align:start size:97% position:3%
to the medical tent and he's
like, "Yeah, I don't know

00:07:56.508 --> 00:07:59.144
"Kate, the vibes between
us are just really not

00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:00.646
"chill right now."

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.682 align:start size:81% position:19%
So I was like,
alright, whatever.

00:08:03.682 --> 00:08:05.651
And then I just decide for
myself, I'm gonna handle

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:09.087 align:start size:97% position:3%
this situation like the
mature adult woman that I am,

00:08:09.087 --> 00:08:13.025
so I just put on my tutu
and got on my bicycle.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:19.398
I ride to the medical tent
and I get there and there's

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:22.902 align:start size:97% position:3%
dehydrated hippies everywhere,
super dusty, coming

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:27.873 align:start size:97% position:3%
down from every single drug,
and the lady at the desk,

00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:30.376
the triage nurse, she has
purple hair and I go up to

00:08:30.376 --> 00:08:33.512
her and I was like, "Hey,
excuse me, do you have

00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:34.913
"any Plan B?"

00:08:34.913 --> 00:08:36.882 align:start size:84% position:16%
And she's like,
"Oh, what happened?"

00:08:36.882 --> 00:08:40.519
And I was like, "Well, I
was having sex with this

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.688
"guy and the condom broke."

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:45.190 align:start size:94% position:6%
And she's like, "Oh no,
I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.593
"Are you concerned about STDs?"

00:08:48.593 --> 00:08:50.228
And I was like, "You know what?

00:08:50.228 --> 00:08:52.697
"I'm not really, I don't
think a lot of other people

00:08:52.697 --> 00:08:55.201
"would have sex with this guy.

00:08:57.303 --> 00:09:00.039 align:start size:84% position:16%
"I'm a pretty
special snowflake."

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:02.475
I really am though.

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:03.876
I've let people in my body
that I would not let inside

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:04.977
my apartment.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.482
Don't get judgy.

00:09:10.482 --> 00:09:14.386 align:start size:88% position:13%
Look, love is blind,
but theft is real, okay?

00:09:14.386 --> 00:09:16.656
(laughter)

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.393
She's like, "I'm so sorry
to tell you this, but we

00:09:21.393 --> 00:09:25.397
"actually don't have Plan
B because this is only an

00:09:25.397 --> 00:09:28.334
"emergency medical clinic
and this isn't technically

00:09:28.334 --> 00:09:30.135
"considered an emergency."

00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:33.305
I'm like, "Oh lady, we have
a huge misunderstanding.

00:09:33.305 --> 00:09:35.741 align:start position:0%
"It's an emergency that I
don't have a kid with this guy,

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:37.276
"emergency.

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:39.244
"To put it into perspective
for you, before we had sex,

00:09:39.244 --> 00:09:41.647
"I had to loan him my hair
scrunchy so that he could

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:43.448
"pull back his man bun.

00:09:43.448 --> 00:09:44.450
"Emergency."

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:48.019
She's like, "Okay, okay.

00:09:48.019 --> 00:09:50.855
"Well, I have an idea for you."

00:09:50.855 --> 00:09:52.325
I'm like, "Great, what's that?"

00:09:52.325 --> 00:09:56.628 align:start size:94% position:6%
She's like, "There is
this woman back at my camp

00:09:56.628 --> 00:09:58.130
"who has a spell."

00:10:02.434 --> 00:10:06.172
So then I just started
crying and she's like,

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:09.942 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Okay, okay, here's
another thing.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:12.778
"You could go up to one
of the rangers and see if

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:15.647
"there are any feminist
camps that are giving out

00:10:15.647 --> 00:10:19.318 align:start size:97% position:3%
"tampons or birth control,
maybe they would have Plan B."

00:10:19.318 --> 00:10:21.053 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I was like, "Great,
I'll try it out."

00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:24.156 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I leave and I walk
around until I see a ranger,

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:26.325 align:start size:97% position:3%
he's a guy with a
walkie-talkie and a clip board

00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:28.694
and I just go right up
to him and I was like,

00:10:28.694 --> 00:10:31.997 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Excuse me, sir, do you
happen to know of any feminist

00:10:31.997 --> 00:10:35.067
"camps that are giving out
tampons or birth control

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:37.669
"or especially Plan B?"

00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:40.539
And then he's like,
"Uh, what's Plan B?"

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:43.208
I was like, "You know,
the morning after pill?"

00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:46.144
And he was like, "Oh, I'm
really sorry sweetheart,

00:10:46.144 --> 00:10:50.516 align:start size:88% position:13%
"I don't know about a
lot of that lady stuff."

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:54.553
So I was like, "Okay, well I
guess that's understandable.

00:10:54.553 --> 00:10:58.924
"Just to break it down for
ya, the basics of what's

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:03.028
"going on here is that I
am ovulating and I am full

00:11:03.028 --> 00:11:07.166
"of semen and we have got
to turn this ship around."

00:11:10.368 --> 00:11:14.105
He's like, "Oh, I think I
understand what you need.

00:11:14.105 --> 00:11:16.041
"You know who might be
able to help you out is

00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:19.011
"camp Beaverton,
the lesbian camp."

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:24.383
I was like, "I don't think
these lesbians are gonna

00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:28.054
"have birth control,
they are birth control.

00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:31.056
"I'm not just gonna roll up
there on my bike and be like,

00:11:31.056 --> 00:11:33.092
"'My sisters, I repent.

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:36.028
"'I promise to write a slam
poem about what I learned

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:38.230
"'from this experience.'

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.065
"No way."

00:11:40.465 --> 00:11:42.134
So I was starting to panic,
I didn't know what I was

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:43.702
gonna do.

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:45.237 align:start size:97% position:3%
I didn't know if I was gonna
get off the playa in time

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:48.074 align:start size:94% position:6%
to get home in that narrow
window of time you have

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.575
to take Plan B.

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:51.644 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I go back to my own
camp and then this amazing

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.145
thing happens.

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:57.048 align:start size:97% position:3%
There's this woman there,
she's bisexual, but the night

00:11:57.048 --> 00:11:59.919
before, she had tripped on
acid and on her acid trip

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:04.757 align:start position:0%
she decided that she only
wanted to be intimate with women

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:08.060 align:start size:84% position:16%
from now on, for the
rest of the year.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.231 align:start position:0%
So she gave me her entire
unopened packet of birth control

00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:17.002
for the month and then I
just took it and I ate the

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:18.104
entire thing.

00:12:20.172 --> 00:12:21.607
Which was plan C.

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.443
I'm not a mom, you guys.

00:12:25.443 --> 00:12:27.446
Alright, thank you guys so much.

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:30.015
(upbeat music)
