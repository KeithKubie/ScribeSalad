00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.520
Throughout our lives, we spend a lot of time and even more money engineering pleasant experiences.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.900
We book airline tickets, visit beaches, admire glaciers, say hello to penguins, watch elephants drinking,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.820
and so on.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.420
In all this, the emphasis is almost always on the experience itself,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.100
which lasts a certain amount of time and then is over.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.000
The idea of making a big deal of revisiting an experience in memory sounds a little strange or simply sad.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.840
We are not assiduous or devoted cultivators of our past experiences

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.040
We shove all the nice things that have happened to us at the back of the cupboard of our minds

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.280
and don't particularly expect to see them ever again.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.120
They happen, and then we're done with them.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.460
They do sometimes come back to us, unbidden.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.460
We may be on a boring train ride to work but suddenly, an image of a beach at dusk comes to life.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.160
Or, while we're having a bath we remember climbing a flower-covered mountain with a friend

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.200
a decade before.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.920
But little attention tends to get payed to such moments.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.060
We don't engineer regular encounters with them.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.300
We may feel we have to dismiss them as daydreaming or thinking about nothing.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.200
But what if we were to alter the hierarchy of prestige a little,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.640
and argue that regular immersion in our memories is a critical part of what can sustain and console us.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.540
And not least, is perhaps the cheapest and most flexible form of entertainment.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.640
We should learn, regularly, to travel around our minds and think it almost as prestigious to sit at home

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.480
and reflect on a trip we once took to an island as to trek to this island encased in our cumbersome bodies.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.320
In our neglect of our memories, we are spoiled children who squeeze only a portion of the pleasure

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.540
from our experiences, and then toss them aside to seek new thrills.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.580
Part of why we feel the need for so many new experiences may simply be

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.620
that we're so bad at absorbing the ones we've had.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.920
To help us focus more on our memories, we need nothing technical.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.980
We certainly don't need a camera.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.380
There is a camera in our minds already that is always on. It takes everything we've ever seen.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.780
Huge chunks of experience are still there in our heads, intact and vivid, just waiting for us to ask ourselves

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.100
leading questions like, 'Where did we go after we landed?' or, 'What was the first breakfast like?'

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.120
When we can't sleep, when there is no wifi, we should always think of going on memory journeys.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.280
Our experiences have not disappeared just because they're no longer unfolding right in-front of our eyes.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.120
We can remain in touch with so much of what made them pleasurable, simply through the art of evocation.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.160
We talk endlessly of virtual reality, yet we don't need gadgets

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.360
we have the finest virtual reality machines already in our own heads.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.300
We can, right now, shut our eyes and travel into and linger amongst the very best and most consoling

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.300
and life-enhancing bits of our past.
