00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.720
Almost 2000 years ago,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.447
the Roman philosopher Seneca peered 
at his book through a glass of water.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:18.504
Suddenly, the text below was transformed.

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:21.790
The words magically became clear.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.041
But it wasn't until a millennium later
that that same principle

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:30.143
would be used to create 
the earliest glasses.

00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:33.622
Today, glasses can help millions of people
with poor vision

00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:36.778
due to uncorrected refractive errors.

00:00:36.778 --> 00:00:40.987
The key to understanding what that means
lies with the term refraction,

00:00:40.987 --> 00:00:43.951
the ability of a transparent medium,
like glass,

00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:44.980
water,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.782
or the eye to change the direction
of light passing through it.

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:52.320
The eye has two main refractive surfaces:

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.800
the cornea and the lens.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.379
Ideally, these surfaces work together

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.137
to refract light in a way that accurately
focuses light onto the retina,

00:01:02.137 --> 00:01:05.749
the layer of light-sensitive tissue
at the back of the eye

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:08.903
that works with the brain
to give rise to vision.

00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:11.442
But many people develop refractive errors,

00:01:11.442 --> 00:01:14.213
either during childhood 
as their eyes are growing,

00:01:14.213 --> 00:01:17.402
or in later life as their eyes age.

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:19.527
Imperfections in the cornea and lens

00:01:19.527 --> 00:01:24.380
cause refracted light to be focused
in front of or behind the retina,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.377
making images appear blurry.

00:01:27.377 --> 00:01:29.888
People with refractive errors
can still see color,

00:01:29.888 --> 00:01:30.946
movement,

00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:32.072
and light,

00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:35.560
but the details of what they're looking at
are out of focus.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.840
People experience refractive 
errors in different ways,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.320
owing to differences in their eyes.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.666
In some, light refracts too much,

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.980
and in others, too little.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.461
Eyes with a focal point 
in front of the retina are called myopic,

00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:51.131
or short-sighted.

00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:53.066
They can see close objects clearly,

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:56.059
but those far away are out of focus.

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:58.345
But when the focus point 
is behind the retina,

00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:01.627
people are hyperopic,
or long-sighted.

00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:04.870
For them, objects close up
are unfocused,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.907
but distant objects are crystal clear.

00:02:07.907 --> 00:02:11.859
Finally, some people have a cornea
with a non-spherical shape

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.790
that causes astigmatism,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.040
a form of out-of-focus vision
that makes all objects seem blurred,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.356
whether close or far.

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:23.224
As we age, our eyes face new challenges.

00:02:23.224 --> 00:02:26.412
When we're young, the lens of the eye
is flexible

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:29.789
and can change shape to bring
images into focus,

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.981
something called accommodation.

00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:37.131
This keeps objects in focus when we
shift our gaze from far to near.

00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:40.444
But as we get older, the lens becomes
less flexible,

00:02:40.444 --> 00:02:44.313
and can't change shape when we want
to look at near objects.

00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:46.404
This is called presbyopia,

00:02:46.404 --> 00:02:51.040
and it affects adults starting
around the age of 40 years.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.849
Myopia,

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:52.776
hyperopia,

00:02:52.776 --> 00:02:53.834
astigmatism,

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:55.475
and presbyopia.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.926
Each of these is a refractive error.

00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:01.757
Nowadays we can fix them all with glasses
or contact lenses,

00:03:01.757 --> 00:03:07.200
which work by refocusing light
so it strikes the retina precisely.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.769
It's even possible to correct vision
with surgery

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.086
using lasers that change the shape
of the cornea

00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:15.656
and alter its refractive properties.

00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:17.913
But glasses remain the most popular.

00:03:17.913 --> 00:03:19.880
By using carefully crafted lenses

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.257
to steer light to exactly 
the right spot on the retina,

00:03:23.257 --> 00:03:27.060
a person's clear vision can be restored.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.635
We've come a long way 
since Seneca's discovery

00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:32.178
and the crude glasses of yesteryear.

00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:36.324
In 1727, a British optician named
Edward Scarlett

00:03:36.324 --> 00:03:39.132
developed the modern style of glasses

00:03:39.132 --> 00:03:42.697
which are kept in place with arms
which hook over each ear.

00:03:42.697 --> 00:03:46.046
Today's glasses take their inspiration
from that design,

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:49.753
but they're also much more precise
and personal.

00:03:49.753 --> 00:03:55.061
Each pair is tailored for an individual
to bring out their unique powers of sight.

00:03:55.061 --> 00:04:00.598
So if you're one of the 500 million people
with a problem with close or far vision,

00:04:00.598 --> 00:04:01.883
or both,

00:04:01.883 --> 00:04:05.589
there's a pair of glasses out there
waiting to reveal a whole new world

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:07.663
that's hiding in plain view.
