[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.274 --> 00:00:13.340
PAUL IRISH: Hi, and welcome back
to GDL Presents, wherein

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.800
we profile a developer, dive
into a little bit of their

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.770
code and theory behind the
process, and find out how

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.820
exactly they make the
really incredible

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.200
things that they do.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.770
Today we have with us
Hakim El Hattab.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.340
How's it going, Hakim?

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.790
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Hey, it's going
really good, thanks.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.830
Thanks for having me.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.510
PAUL IRISH: So Hakim, you are an
interactive developer based

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.110
in New York.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.120
You're from Sweden.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.220
You've made a bunch of
really cool labs.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.150
Originally you were a Flash
developer, is that correct?

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.145
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Right,
that's right.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:45.870
I used to work at Fantasy
Interactive.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.390
And worked on a lot of campaign
sites, like heavy on

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.220
animation for Nintendo, and
that sort of thing.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.830
A site that links for a short
time, but has the craziest

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.740
things you can think of.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.200
Tornadoes just thrown
across the screen,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.100
and all that stuff.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.400
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, you're kind of
you're one of this cadre of

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.920
Flash to JavaScript developers
that we saw, like, you, Mr.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.200
Dube, Seb Lee-Delisle,
Paul Lewis.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.800
Like this amazing talent when
it comes to visuals and

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.770
interactive design, and all
of a sudden, being in the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.200
JavaScript community, we saw
you and these other people

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.740
coming in and starting
to do these

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.300
really impressive things.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.000
And we're just like,
wow, thank you.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Yes, there's a lot to learn.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.180
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I think that's
really interesting.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.610
Coming from a Flash background,
you have that

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.000
animation way of thinking,
like you think about

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.420
everything in motion.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.190
And then just as JavaScript was
getting powerful enough to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.170
actually replicate some of the
things, that's where it got

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.960
interesting for myself and
a lot of the other names

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.690
mentioned as well, I think.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.886
When you could start producing
things that we already did in

00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:52.040
Flash, we could do it as
good in JavaScript.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.190
And that's been really
exciting.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.200
And I think just from working
on so many sites with heavy

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.550
animations, you get into the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.900
nitty-gritty of using equations.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.020
And that right perfect sensation
in UI should feel

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.860
fast here, to these in and out,
or to do, I don't know,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.070
you tweak numbers
indefinitely.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.245
That didn't really exist
in the typical

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:14.280
HTML developer community.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.210
And now it's starting to happen
more and more though,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.790
people are coming in learning
JavaScript and animation at

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.725
the same time, just because
they're seeing a lot of good

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:22.140
examples of it.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.320
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, absolutely I
think that, in your products

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.180
in particular, we've seen a lot
of detail when it comes to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.550
the subtlety of interaction,
that many people hadn't

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.720
realized that is worthwhile
to spend time on.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.850
But I've seen a lot of
your experiments.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.660
So I'm actually going to-- let's
bring up one of your

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.370
experiments now.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.290
Anyone can go visit these
at lab.hakim.se.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.870
But there's some great
stuff in here.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.500
More recently you've worked on
Avgrund and Meny, which are

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.890
pretty cool.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.320
Do you want talk about these?

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.850
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.675
So let's start with the names
which I find funny myself.

00:02:58.675 --> 00:03:01.370
I've gone for a full transition
into Swedish names

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.910
for everything I do.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.160
So I am Swedish originally,
I'm born and raised there.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.430
And Avgrund and Meny
are the two of the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.880
first Swedish names.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.100
Just kind of keep going,
kind of like Ikea.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.340
That's my plan for it.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.610
So Avgrund is a concept for--

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.260
well, I think Chris Coyier
expressed it the best way,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.220
it's receding modal.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.610
So it takes the typical pop-up
concept, but it also places

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.540
the page backwards in depth
and blurs is out, so you

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.650
really get that feeling of
content being de-emphasize and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.790
pop-up being emphasized.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.160
And here in Avgrund you're
using, I guess you're just

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.820
throwing a black background
around everything, you're

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.410
using a 2D transform to scale
the background, a CSS filter

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.100
for the blur.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.110
Is that how you're
doing things?

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.880
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That's exactly
it, you got it.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.517
The filter blur is kind of slow,
so I've disabled it when

00:03:56.517 --> 00:03:59.790
I've used it myself on
a couple of places.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.150
But it adds a nice effect.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.550
Still, it's just a heavy
operation to bl a

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.730
whole page like that.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.280
PAUL IRISH: It's really cool.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.640
And so Meny is a way to kind of
hide a menu but reveal it

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.970
in 3D space.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.790
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah,
that started out as--

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.709
I had an idea for a really
cool concept.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.970
I didn't really think it was
going to be very useful.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.590
But then, after having
built it out and

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.920
seeing that it actually--

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.535
I mean it added some
value to the page.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:32.230
Because you could hide a menu,
you could reveal it, without

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.140
losing all the contents
on the right side.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.400
So it was a hidden menu that
still kept all the content

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.250
visible, even if you
expanded it.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.740
A lot of other menus will expand
on top of the contents,

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.610
and you have to hide them to
see the content again.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.370
Plus it just really
looks cool.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.085
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:49.085 --> 00:04:50.880
PAUL IRISH: It totally
looks cool.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.105
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah, this is
the latest version where you

00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:54.985
can set it on any direction
as a page.

00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:57.240
First off, it was just
a concept for

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.120
coming in from the left.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.085
And then I revised it, and
open-sourced it, and packaged

00:05:02.085 --> 00:05:04.390
it up nicely, so then
anyone could use it.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.210
PAUL IRISH: That's
really nice.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.450
Yeah, this is great.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.460
I've actually--

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.460
we profiled Michael Deal earlier
on this program.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.990
And he's already using both of
these experiments in his work.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.330
So I'm seeing a lot of solid
adoption already for some of

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.560
these UI concepts.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.470
What kind of inspires
you to explore

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.650
these interaction ideas?

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.630
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I think that's
what's always inspired

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.700
me to work in the field
that I work.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.990
Just interfaces and interaction
has always been

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.530
what's exciting to me.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.040
I studied digital animation,
which got me into the Flash

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.590
scene, and animation
in general.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.100
Not even just interactively,
but video as well.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.630
And then got into Flash,
and did some very

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.800
heavy lifting in animation.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.170
But then, now lately, I'm mostly
interested in building

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.750
useful UI components.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.950
Nothing extreme anymore, I
want to go more to useful

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.960
utility instead of cosmetics.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.700
That's sort of where
I'm going.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.850
PAUL IRISH: I want to bring up
an experiment right now, which

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.220
might fall into the cosmetics
side of things, perhaps.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.570
This is stroll.js.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.490
And so stroll is a small little
library that applies

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.920
effects to a list as you
scroll through it.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.180
And so there's a number of
different 2D and 3D effects

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.690
that you can experience
as you're scrolling

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.630
through a big list.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.230
HAKIM EL HATTAB: There's
been a lot of

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.370
contributions as well.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.840
So I only started out with about
eight of them, and then

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.400
people start adding to
them like crazy.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.470
So there's a bunch of different
styles on there now,

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.780
that I didn't think of myself.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.980
But I built the framework for
it, I guess, and then it was

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.730
easy enough to add
other styles.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.270
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, and this
was a fun project.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.830
I noticed especially when it was
open sourced, I personally

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.670
got really excited.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.146
I hopped in there, I started
viewing the source, and I was

00:07:06.146 --> 00:07:10.850
like, I think we could maybe do
this a little bit faster.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.250
And so actually, I'll bring up
now what I did when I saw it

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.310
the first time.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.890
Which is, we had recently added
a feature to the Chrome

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.050
dev tools where you can
essentially get, more or less,

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.960
a rendering profile.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.720
So I'll do that now.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.460
So this is in Timeline
and Frames.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.170
And I'll record a little
session, and

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.640
scroll a little bit.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.810
And so what happens is, we're
able to capture a little area.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:48.710
And then I'm going to narrow
that down, and we can zoom in

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.860
to basically see the length
of all the frames.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:58.610
And in some of these cases, some
of these frames become

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.500
quite long.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:05.040
So the target length of a frame
is 16 milliseconds.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.370
But in some of these cases,
we have frames around 70

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.340
milliseconds.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.900
And so sometimes with this tool,
you get a good idea of

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.900
exactly what's taking so long.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:24.000
And in this case, there's a
recalculate style that takes a

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.020
full 20 milliseconds.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.460
And we can click over to see
exactly what line in our

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.980
script caused the recalc style
to happen, and see.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.750
So what I and a few other
developers did early on was

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.020
look at this and identify
where we

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.980
could optimize things.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.660
Maybe we could avoid hitting
this particular line of code

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.060
on all loops and do it
more infrequently.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.150
But there was, I think--

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.790
HAKIM EL HATTAB: And you pulled
it off really well.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.250
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.520
Yeah, and I think lately there's
been a few more tools

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.060
recently to get the browser
side prospective of how

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.800
exactly things are
happening, right?

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.430
So from a developer tools side,
we can get a better idea

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.570
of how to improve this work.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.900
Is there anything that--

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.700
is there any normal workflows
that you've gone through for

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:27.050
dealing with improving the
runtime performance of your

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.761
experiments?

00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:29.700
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Oh
yeah, absolutely.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.440
Not only my experiments, but
even my daytime work.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.430
It's all about optimization.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.050
Because now JavaScript and HTML
is being used for more

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.640
and more heavy production.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.020
What used to be Flash, these
really heavy interactive

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.230
productions, animation
productions, and then when we

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.450
do that in HTML, we need the
tools to analyze it and

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:47.980
profile it.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.990
And this is really starting
to pay off.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.110
The tools set is incredibly
good, short of seeing it as my

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.010
future editor for code
as well, I can do

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.350
everything in there.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.760
I've definitely been using
Timeline as well for some of

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.867
my projects, it's been
very helpful.

00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:04.430
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.940
Awesome.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.110
So we'll switch over--

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.685
HAKIM EL HATTAB: So it might be
worth mentioning though, on

00:10:08.685 --> 00:10:12.720
the scroll effects there, that
was also remade into a mobile

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.840
experiment.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.970
When Chrome Experiments opened
up for mobile submissions, I

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.540
rebuilt it, or did a
V2 on it, that does

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.940
support touch events.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.910
And I had to build my own
momentum scrolling.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:27.740
You know that kind of
feeling you get?

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.550
PAUL IRISH: Yeah

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.580
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Because
I couldn't use--

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.250
there's this overflow scroll
for mobile support,

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.030
specifically that does
momentum scrolling

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.000
automatically for you.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.850
But I couldn't do that, because
you can't read the

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.720
positions of the list
items then while it

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.560
scrolls with momentum.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.100
And so I wrote my own.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.230
Anyway, you should
check that out.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.120
It's pretty cool.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.275
It looks cool in iPhone.

00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:50.550
PAUL IRISH: Very cool.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.590
And I think that is that at
mobile.chromeexperiments.com?

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:55.670
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah,
that should be it.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.250
Actually, if you just hit
chromeexperiments.com on your

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.090
phone, you'll get there.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.340
PAUL IRISH: Ah, true, true.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.590
Yeah, there's a lot of really
powerful experiments there

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:13.800
that are optimized for
the touch experience.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.730
A lot of good stuff.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:15.990
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That was an

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.190
interesting performance change.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.130
PAUL IRISH: An interesting
performance

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.550
change, right, yeah.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:28.700
Dealing with slower hardware,
less memory, a bit of it is

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.590
trial and error to find out how
far you can push things.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.390
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Right, at the
time I didn't have a good

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.560
profiling tool for mobile.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.910
That's starting to get
better as well,

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.580
definitely very helpful.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.940
But it was sort of
like a black box.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.770
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.430
Do you use debugging tools
for mobile now?

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.910
Or what's your workflow there?

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.200
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I just started
using the-- because

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.600
they come built in now
to Safari 6.0.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.880
And it's really, really fast.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.190
I've started using that for
the mobile work that I do.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.760
And it's been helpful.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.870
PAUL IRISH: I've personally
experimented with the Safari 6

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:10.300
remote debugging, the Chrome on
Android remote debugging,

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.590
and also Adobe Shadow.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.180
It doesn't have all the
capabilities of your typical

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:19.980
web kit inspector, but
it's very convenient.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.350
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I tried
Adobe Shadow as well.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.080
I guess my only complaint there
was the response time is

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.650
little bit slow.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.040
Just communication in between.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.130
Maybe it was my set up.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:29.750
I don't know.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.370
It felt a lot slower.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.120
PAUL IRISH: OK, cool.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.020
I wanted to shift over to a
project that I think a lot of

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.140
people have seen.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:40.570
And that is reveal.js.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:46.460
So reveal.js is a
slide framework.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.220
HAKIM EL HATTAB: It's a HTML
presentation framework.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.010
PAUL IRISH: I like it.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:51.970
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That's what
I usually call it.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.700
It's just a presentation
framework built on top of HTML

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.680
and using your browser to
create fully fledged

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.920
presentations that
you'd typically

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.830
create in desktop software.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.820
It's pretty popular space
for HTML right now.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.480
There's a lot of similar
frameworks.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.970
I guess, over time reveal.js has
differentiated itself as a

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.720
really feature-rich framework.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.350
It's just happened over time.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.930
We've added many more features
since the original so simple.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.340
But now it has Markdown support,
it has PDF exports,

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.710
and themes, and transitions
styles.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.790
You name it, a lot of
things in there.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:28.410
PAUL IRISH: It's very nice.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.520
Yeah, I've used it a lot.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:36.390
And actually we had an internal
conference inside

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.790
Google a bit ago.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.300
And one of the engineers who
works on Chrome's rendering

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.960
path took a look.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.800
We were both sharing a

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.220
presentation, and using reveal.js.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:53.140
And so he actually dove into
some of the techniques that

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.960
were being used for reveal.js
and found a few

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.380
insufficiencies where you
could actually eek out

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.940
slightly better performance.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.230
And I think one of them
was my fault.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.620
I was applying a z-index to
some of the headlines.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.340
And when you apply a z-index, it
actually bumps that render

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.860
layer out of the rest
of the render layer.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.230
So let's say we have a slide
and we're transitioning it

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.760
with the transform, having a
z-index on one of the elements

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.940
inside that, brings it to
another thing, and so that has

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.780
to be made manipulated
separately.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.700
And so we were getting overall
a slower FPS number.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.250
And so--

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.910
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That's really
interesting because I use 3D

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.675
transforms inside of the slides
as well for these hover

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:38.920
effects on my links.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.130
They do a 3D roll, which
I thought looked nice.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.630
But that must suffer from
the same performance

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.230
limitations then so.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.960
PAUL IRISH: Probably,
yeah, yeah.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.240
And generally you want to
bring down the number of

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.045
render layers that you're
manipulating at the same time,

00:14:54.045 --> 00:14:55.630
and keep that to a minimum.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:15:00.010
But that was a small
optimization that we found.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:03.410
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I guess the
page gets caught or painted as

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.280
a bitmap as soon as it goes
in through GPU in 3D

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.490
transforming.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.125
So if you don't have to redraw
that bit map while it's in

00:15:10.125 --> 00:15:11.390
perspective, I assume it's
going to be a lot faster.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:19.860
PAUL IRISH: So yeah, reveal.js
has been great.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:26.570
And I particularly like editing
my slides in HTML,

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.690
bringing it out, and having
a great interface on it.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.380
And I know a lot of other
people, including Brendan

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.930
Eich, creator of JavaScript,
he's used it as framework.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.180
It's pretty rad.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.730
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah, that
was pretty amazing.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.330
I was really happy
to see that.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.360
I also watched, what was
that, it was Lisbon JS

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.620
conference last week.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.600
And some crazy number of people
were using reveal.js,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.240
like seven or so.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.280
It was a lot of fun.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.340
That's really rewarding.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.230
I think that inspires
me to keep going.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.190
Otherwise most my projects are
fairly short lived right now.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.740
Wrap them up, and placed
them on GitHub and not

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.970
touched them again.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:05.560
But with reveal.js I'm
definitely continuing on

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.420
developing and improving
on long term.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:10.560
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, and so
you've actually kind of

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:16.740
evolved the reveal.js scene more
recently with the release

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:22.500
of rvl.io, I guess you would
pronounce it that way.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.490
Pronunciation doesn't really
exist in the internet.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.610
HAKIM EL HATTAB: I tried to get
reveal.io actually spelled

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.350
out, but somebody
else took it.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:28.950
PAUL IRISH: OK, cool.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.480
Do you want to talk about what
the idea behind rvl.io is?

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:41.120
That worked out.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:17:04.290
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.960
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, the
break was perfect.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.780
Hey, what's up.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.329
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Oh, that
was a big break.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:20.450
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.275
PAUL IRISH: You look stark.

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:27.079
Sir, you are stuck
in molasses.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.329
Not rad.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.140
I am the internet, I am
opposed to this word.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.440
I will break for you.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.550
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That was
a very big break.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.310
Can you hear me now?

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:43.390
PAUL IRISH: Yes, can
hear you good now.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.020
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Doing good,
my connection not so much.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.500
PAUL IRISH: Yeah,
he's dropped.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:18:46.570
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:55.180
PAUL IRISH: Can I shoot like 20
seconds of each just when

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.010
we're done with Hakim, and then
you just throw it on?

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.940
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.340
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Oh,
I'm back now.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.930
Wow, and my quality
is good now too.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:08.490
That's weird.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:15.970
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.370
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, of all the
things that we've gone

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.440
through, those particular demos
would be easy to kind of

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.240
merge in later.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.160
There's a lot of sections we
are talking for awhile.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.140
And it would just like--

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:33.185
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:19:33.185 --> 00:19:35.270
PAUL IRISH: Our conversation
wasn't very specific about

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.340
what was happening on screen.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:20:05.840
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.800
PAUL IRISH: Great.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.840
HAKIM EL HATTAB: So we're
starting with rvl.io.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.090
PAUL IRISH: Yep.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:23.290
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:27.032
PAUL IRISH: So Hakim, tell me
a little bit about rvl.io.

00:20:27.032 --> 00:20:30.850
HAKIM EL HATTAB: So rvl.io is
the HTML or the online editing

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.370
suite for reveal.js.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.580
Where you don't have to write
plain HTML, which is what

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.260
reveal.js is.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.110
Instead, you can come in and
you can write it in WYSIWYG

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:41.680
editor, you see the--

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.495
well, you see what you're
going to get exactly.

00:20:48.495 --> 00:20:52.020
I'm to build out a bit of, not
a community around it, but a

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.420
hosting for your
presentations.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.940
So you don't even need to
download them to present them

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:57.990
elsewhere, you can keep
them online and

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.790
present then on the server.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.370
And it was launched three
weeks ago now,

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.690
three or four weeks.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.270
It's been under development
for a while though, at

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:11.540
collaboration, actually, with
a friend Hashad from India.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.010
He's doing the service
side work.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.210
And it's gained a pretty good
number of users so far.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.850
It's been like 3,000,
3,500 users in the

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.190
first couple of weeks.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.020
Most people are just playing
around with it though.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.950
But I think there's a definite
audience for it.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:31.490
I've seen a lot of good things
coming out as well.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.990
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.510
I mean, it's really nice.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:41.880
And it kind of collects a few of
your different experiments.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.500
The Avgrund I saw just
a moment ago.

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.940
There's Reveal, and
there's a lot of

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.440
other really nice additions.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.070
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah, I'm
trying to use my own stuff.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.890
Wherever I can, just to--

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.430
if I end up using something
or one of my previously

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.192
experiments, then it feels
like I've done

00:22:01.192 --> 00:22:03.750
something right I guess.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.620
That's sort of the thinking.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.770
Yeah, so you can save
your presentation.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.430
You publish the presentation, it
will land on the home page.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.670
And popular presentations
will group up there.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.990
Basically level of editing,
but still very much in

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.490
development.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:20.260
This is another project that I
expect to be working on for a

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.210
longer time.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.490
Not just something I put out
there and am done with.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.120
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, it's
really nice.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:35.100
So I don't have an
ability to--

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.240
so I know that I can author
and Markdown for reveal.js

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.090
Rvl.io I guess, because we have
WYSIWYG we don't really

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:42.790
need to edit in Markdown.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:45.315
HAKIM EL HATTAB: No, I guess
that's the thinking around it,

00:22:45.315 --> 00:22:46.180
you wouldn't need it.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.750
But there are some really
important core features which

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.200
aren't in it yet.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.820
But I really believe in
releasing it early, putting it

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.470
in front of people and seeing
what they do with it, and then

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.240
listening to feedback instead of
trying to solve every case

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.490
before release it, I guess.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:01.130
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.520
OK, question, this view right
here, where I can view my

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.520
presentations, we have
essentially this thumbnail.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.210
How are we making this here?

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.660
HAKIM EL HATTAB:
The thumbnail?

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.030
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.140
HAKIM EL HATTAB: The thumbnail
is a minified version of the

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:15.750
presentation.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.150
It's just the presentation
itself.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:20.080
The same markup, same
styles, everything.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.440
And then a scale is applied
to make it tiny.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.240
It's kind of like a
ghetto thumbnail.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.310
PAUL IRISH: 2D transform
scale?

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.620
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Yeah,
that's it.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.830
It actually has a little bit of
additional markup in there,

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.040
because it doesn't just the
first slide, it has the other

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.780
slides as well.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.280
Some optimization to be done.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.530
But it's an easy way to do a
thumbnail instead of having to

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.520
do image processing
on the server and

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.392
storing all of that.

00:23:45.392 --> 00:23:48.990
It makes the server side work
a little bit more likely.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.670
Which I'm always for.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.650
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:53.630
Great.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.860
And so the last thing I wanted
to talk about, real quick, is

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.560
this wonderful project that you
worked on while you were

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.610
at Fantasy Interactive.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:01.860
And this is the 20 Things
I Learned About The Web.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.050
e-book.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.580
It's a book on the web.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.600
But it's like the most book
on the web book there is.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.090
So the experience is very
similar to a real book.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.150
And there's a lot of techniques
in here that people

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.130
haven't really seen, especially

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.330
outside of Flash before.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.820
So you want to talk a little bit
about how you built this?

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:30.470
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Sure, I think
this came out early 2011.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.415
And I was working out of FI, so
we collaborated with Google

00:24:34.415 --> 00:24:37.260
and the Chrome team.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.000
The techniques about--
there's a lot of--

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.370
we tried to use everything we
could that was kind of leading

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:43.950
edge at the time.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.450
So we're using, for
instance, local

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:47.560
storage to keep a bookmark.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.690
If you go back to the book after
having visited it once,

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.490
and just dropped out at a page,
it will bring you back

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.190
into that page again.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.390
We're using offline or cache,
application cache.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:03.530
Since it's a very large book,
there's many illustrations in

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.150
there, it gets pretty
heavy in kilobytes.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.650
So there's a cache manifest,
which stores all that on your

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.410
computer for the next time.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.850
And we are using HTML5
History API.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.512
So every page has a unique
URL, and you

00:25:18.512 --> 00:25:21.700
can link into that.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.230
The book has been translated
into a bunch of

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.640
languages as well.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.950
I guess the most interesting
part, one thing that everybody

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.120
asks about is the page flip.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:35.460
So the page flip is one very big
canvas element on top of

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.750
the whole book.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.720
And then that in conjunction
with taking the page, which is

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.080
on the right side, and just
shrinking it downwards.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.760
By having the overflow
be hidden, it makes

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.310
it look like a mask.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.460
It's basically a magic trick.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:57.650
The page underneath does just
get covered but the paper

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:58.860
that's coming up on top.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.130
It gets covered, otherwise it
would be a hard cut where the

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.240
page is actually being masked.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.110
Instead there's a layer on
top with paper which

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.770
makes it look nice.

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:10.380
You pull it over there, and then
there's a lot of shading.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.640
I spent a good amount of time
figuring out the shadows, and

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.325
the highlights, and the
paper, and all that to

00:26:15.325 --> 00:26:17.950
get that just right.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.465
And we also--

00:26:19.465 --> 00:26:21.520
I wrote an article about
that it as well.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.880
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, so people
can check this out.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.870
This is on HTML5 rocks.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:31.000
So if you just look for HTML5
Rocks Page Flip, you should be

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.980
able to read this great article
by Hakim, all about

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.350
this particular effect, the
markup, the theory, the

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.390
science, the math behind it.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:47.060
And you know, steal the code and
use it on your own site.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.930
HAKIM EL HATTAB: Oh yeah,
definitely steal it.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:50.306
Steal everything I do.

00:26:50.306 --> 00:26:51.240
PAUL IRISH: I like that.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.490
I like it.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:55.030
Cool.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.040
Yeah, where do you use--

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.291
I mean there's a lot of
techniques in this 20 Things I

00:27:00.291 --> 00:27:04.200
Learned project, and that
was a while ago.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.610
And you always are staying up to
date with what's available

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:09.770
and browsers.

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:14.670
How do you manage to keeping
track of what's available and

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.043
the best way to do things?

00:27:16.043 --> 00:27:17.330
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That's
a good question.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:21.280
I think most of it is I get
really snowed into one

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.740
specific feature that I get
super excited about, and I try

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:25.950
to master it.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:27.990
So for very long period
of time that

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.010
was canvas, 2D canvas.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.220
Just drawing all kinds
of animations.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.980
And then recently it's been CSS,
and CSS transports and

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.640
transitions, in particular.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.160
I've been using a lot.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.960
I think I stay up to date with
it by seeing something that

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.920
excites me, and then just using
100 times over to see

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.740
what I can pull of with it.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.085
And then in the end it ends up
being a loop of inspiration, I

00:27:52.085 --> 00:27:53.710
guess, because you create
something that inspires

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.810
something else.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.560
A good example is what you're
looking at now.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.210
I had no idea what I was doing
when I started this.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.880
This is a good example because
it is one of those cases where

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.470
I sat down and I placed a bunch
of dots on the screen.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:14.270
And then, by doing that, I
started getting inspired into

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.590
connecting lights in between the
dots and moving the dots

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.870
around physically in a
relationship to each other.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.090
And you start getting visual
effect that's pleasing.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.110
And that's sort of where I land
on something like this.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:31.810
It's not much planning,
it's mostly duration.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.536
PAUL IRISH: Yeah,
it's very cool.

00:28:35.536 --> 00:28:37.520
I especially like--

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.160
I mean we saw this a little bit
with Bret Victor getting

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.620
immediate feedback ideas.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.260
But there's a lot, especially
inside of the creative JS

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.520
realm where you can just start
with an idea and just

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.800
experiment until you find
the visual you like, the

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.520
interaction style you like.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.850
There's a lot of flexibility
there that you normally don't

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.750
have in other parts of front-end
development.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:01.060
HAKIM EL HATTAB: That's true.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.660
It's also about doing it as a
personal experiment, which

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.410
means there's no pressure on
you doing a specific thing.

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:10.980
I think the scary part is having
a specific picture in

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.820
mind, and trying to achieve
that exact thing.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.540
Because then you limit yourself
from actually--

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.990
I don't know, it's more natural
to come up with the

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.680
thing you're doing.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.460
It has to do with, you can never
have a complete picture

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.675
and just execute on that idea.

00:29:24.675 --> 00:29:27.570
You have to be adaptive
throughout.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.000
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.800
Well there's a lot more
experiments that we could go

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.130
through that you've done that,
that are just totally change

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.970
at how people look at
experiencing the

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:39.330
front end of the web.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.140
But I guess we'll
cut it there.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.040
Hakim, thank you very
much for joining us.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.540
This has been fantastic
to dive into

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:45.790
some of these products.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.560
And thank you.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.490
People can check you out, your
blog and some of your

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.740
experiments at hakim.se.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.810
You're over on Twitter,
@hakimel.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.260
I think, GitHub,
too, @hakimel.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:02.770
Correct?

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:04.080
HAKIM EL HATTAB:
Yep, that's it.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.900
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.557
And definitely take
a poke around some

00:30:08.557 --> 00:30:09.700
of all these projects.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.250
View source pretty much all
of them are on GitHub.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:20.090
People can go fork them, make
tweaks, and then certainly

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.520
make use of some of them
in any upcoming

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.660
products, and stuff.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.080
So thanks again, thank you.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:34.233
