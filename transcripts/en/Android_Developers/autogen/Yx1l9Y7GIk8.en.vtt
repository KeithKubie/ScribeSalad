that we'll talk about today have been
 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.569
that we'll talk about today have been
covered in past episodes but we felt

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579
covered in past episodes but we felt
 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:40.770
covered in past episodes but we felt
that it was good to have kind of a recap

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780
that it was good to have kind of a recap
 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.260
that it was good to have kind of a recap

new things not necessarily new and
 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.979
new things not necessarily new and
Android but kind of new things you

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989
Android but kind of new things you
 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.590
Android but kind of new things you
should be thinking about when related to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600
should be thinking about when related to
 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.900
should be thinking about when related to
kind of showing photos and thumbnails

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910
kind of showing photos and thumbnails
 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.060
kind of showing photos and thumbnails
inside your apps so without further ado

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070
inside your apps so without further ado
 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.299

should we get started and let's Nick you

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309
should we get started and let's Nick you
 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.150
should we get started and let's Nick you
want to introduce the design principle

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
want to introduce the design principle
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.680
want to introduce the design principle
yeah absolutely and the images are such

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690
yeah absolutely and the images are such
 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.209
yeah absolutely and the images are such
an important part of your user interface

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219
an important part of your user interface
 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.860
an important part of your user interface
that they're explicitly called out in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870
that they're explicitly called out in
 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.410

androids design principles which say and

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420
androids design principles which say and
 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.450
androids design principles which say and
that pictures are faster than words and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460
that pictures are faster than words and
 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.429
that pictures are faster than words and
that you should use them to get people's

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439
that you should use them to get people's
 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.880
that you should use them to get people's
attention and be more efficient and so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890
attention and be more efficient and so
 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.940
attention and be more efficient and so
there's you know a much quicker way to

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950
there's you know a much quicker way to
 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.679
there's you know a much quicker way to
express your information in your user

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689
express your information in your user
 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.300
express your information in your user
interface by using imagery if you have a

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310
interface by using imagery if you have a
 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.819
interface by using imagery if you have a
screen full of images versus a screen

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829
screen full of images versus a screen
 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.530
screen full of images versus a screen
full of kind of text and labels and so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540
full of kind of text and labels and so
 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.539
full of kind of text and labels and so
forth one is going to be instantly a lot

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549
forth one is going to be instantly a lot
 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.580
forth one is going to be instantly a lot
quicker to kind of understand to kind of

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590
quicker to kind of understand to kind of
 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.190
quicker to kind of understand to kind of
drop what's going on and then the other

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200
drop what's going on and then the other
 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.749
drop what's going on and then the other
so you should really make you some

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759
so you should really make you some
 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.609
so you should really make you some
weight cap and the other thing I think

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619
weight cap and the other thing I think
 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.410
weight cap and the other thing I think
it's very important to about this kind

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420
it's very important to about this kind
 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.719
it's very important to about this kind
of principle is that a lot of these

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729
of principle is that a lot of these
 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:40.889
of principle is that a lot of these
kinds of vices out there these days

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899
kinds of vices out there these days
 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.350
kinds of vices out there these days
phones and tablets and so forth have a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360
phones and tablets and so forth have a
 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.179
phones and tablets and so forth have a
really kind of beautiful high high

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189
really kind of beautiful high high
 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.490
really kind of beautiful high high
resolution screens so it's a real missed

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500
resolution screens so it's a real missed
 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.020
resolution screens so it's a real missed
opportunity not to provide really

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030
opportunity not to provide really
 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.999
opportunity not to provide really
beautiful crisp imagery where you can to

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009
beautiful crisp imagery where you can to
 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.859
beautiful crisp imagery where you can to
enrich your user interfaces to actually

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869
enrich your user interfaces to actually
 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.719
enrich your user interfaces to actually
push on yep and so one of the most

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729
push on yep and so one of the most
 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.069
push on yep and so one of the most
important things when thinking about

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079
important things when thinking about
 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.020
important things when thinking about
using imagery in your application is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030
using imagery in your application is
 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.639
using imagery in your application is
bearing in mind that designing for

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649
bearing in mind that designing for
 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.040
bearing in mind that designing for
Android is designing the scale designing

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050
Android is designing the scale designing
 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.580
Android is designing the scale designing
for variety of devices out there and so

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590
for variety of devices out there and so
 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.780
for variety of devices out there and so
what that means is when you're thinking

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790
what that means is when you're thinking
 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.220
what that means is when you're thinking
about your images you think about how

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230
about your images you think about how
 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.110
about your images you think about how
they're going to play a user interface

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120
they're going to play a user interface
 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.850
they're going to play a user interface
you need to build in a level of

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860
you need to build in a level of
 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.610
you need to build in a level of
flexibility in there so that your your

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620
flexibility in there so that your your
 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.530
flexibility in there so that your your
user interface can work on a variety of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
user interface can work on a variety of
 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.530
user interface can work on a variety of
different screen sizes and shapes and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540
different screen sizes and shapes and
 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.880
different screen sizes and shapes and
then your imagery can stand up to that

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890
then your imagery can stand up to that
 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.430
then your imagery can stand up to that
and then still look good so this is a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440
and then still look good so this is a
 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.479
and then still look good so this is a
technique that we've covered a couple of

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489
technique that we've covered a couple of
 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.770
technique that we've covered a couple of
times in the show so I'll go quite

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780
times in the show so I'll go quite
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.780
times in the show so I'll go quite
quickly over it and but wanted technique

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790
quickly over it and but wanted technique
 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.309
quickly over it and but wanted technique
that works very well is to kind of

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319
that works very well is to kind of
 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.949
that works very well is to kind of
respect the aspect ratio of the image

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959
respect the aspect ratio of the image
 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.110
respect the aspect ratio of the image
you want to show but to be a little bit

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120
you want to show but to be a little bit
 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.699
you want to show but to be a little bit
more flexible about the exact balance in

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709
more flexible about the exact balance in
 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.319
more flexible about the exact balance in
which you show and one way you can do

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329
which you show and one way you can do
 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.750
which you show and one way you can do
this is using a center of crop technique

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760
this is using a center of crop technique
 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.330
this is using a center of crop technique
so what this will do is and depending on

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340
so what this will do is and depending on
 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.890
so what this will do is and depending on
how much space you have available to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900
how much space you have available to
 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.539
how much space you have available to
show the image it will kind of blow it

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549
show the image it will kind of blow it
 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.460
show the image it will kind of blow it
up or on crop off the sides or so forth

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470
up or on crop off the sides or so forth
 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.250
up or on crop off the sides or so forth
in order to maintain the aspect ratio

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260
in order to maintain the aspect ratio
 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.630
in order to maintain the aspect ratio
but to kind of fit in the amount of

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640
but to kind of fit in the amount of
 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.059
but to kind of fit in the amount of
space available to the image it's a very

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069
space available to the image it's a very
 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.110
space available to the image it's a very
important technique to kind of embrace

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120
important technique to kind of embrace
 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.149
important technique to kind of embrace
and I think as we've said before this

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159
and I think as we've said before this
 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.589
and I think as we've said before this
technique works really really well if

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599
technique works really really well if
 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.250
technique works really really well if
you have kind of images which don't have

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260
you have kind of images which don't have
 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.470
you have kind of images which don't have
a particular focal point so for example

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480
a particular focal point so for example
 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.809
a particular focal point so for example
you have this picture of some bacon

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819
you have this picture of some bacon
 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.039
you have this picture of some bacon
which we always seem to come back to you

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049
which we always seem to come back to you
 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.410
which we always seem to come back to you
here on Atia and then it works

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420
here on Atia and then it works
 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.759
here on Atia and then it works
particularly well for this kind of

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769
particularly well for this kind of
 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.559
particularly well for this kind of
content you have people's faces you

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569
content you have people's faces you
 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.150
content you have people's faces you
might risk kind of cropping off

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160
might risk kind of cropping off
 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.159
might risk kind of cropping off
something you might consider the focal

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169
something you might consider the focal
 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.720
something you might consider the focal
point of the of the picture so just bear

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730
point of the of the picture so just bear
 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.300
point of the of the picture so just bear
that in mind

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310
that in mind
 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.240
that in mind
cool true move on yeah so so and yeah

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250
cool true move on yeah so so and yeah
 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.240
cool true move on yeah so so and yeah
going next that we're going to talk

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250
going next that we're going to talk
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.400
going next that we're going to talk
about different ways that you can kind

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410
about different ways that you can kind
 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.580
about different ways that you can kind
of like decorate or kind of change the

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590
of like decorate or kind of change the
 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.650
of like decorate or kind of change the
imagery which you're looking at and the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660
imagery which you're looking at and the
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.939
imagery which you're looking at and the
first thing we're going to write here is

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949
first thing we're going to write here is
 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.860
first thing we're going to write here is
using different masks so Android has a

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870
using different masks so Android has a
 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.180
using different masks so Android has a
kind of a particular look and feel and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190
kind of a particular look and feel and
 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.979
kind of a particular look and feel and
when it comes to shapes so for example

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989
when it comes to shapes so for example
 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.569
when it comes to shapes so for example
you don't see many kind of cool shapes

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579
you don't see many kind of cool shapes
 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.610
you don't see many kind of cool shapes
or rounded rectangle shapes but what you

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620
or rounded rectangle shapes but what you
 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.229
or rounded rectangle shapes but what you
will see is lots of simple geometric

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239
will see is lots of simple geometric
 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.569
will see is lots of simple geometric
shapes like squares circles and so forth

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579
shapes like squares circles and so forth
 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.710
shapes like squares circles and so forth
and eyeballs maybe but one technique you

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720
and eyeballs maybe but one technique you
 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.240
and eyeballs maybe but one technique you
can use with your images in order to

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250
can use with your images in order to
 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.680
can use with your images in order to
kind of like break out of a rhythm and

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690
kind of like break out of a rhythm and
 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.960
kind of like break out of a rhythm and
make them pop or in order to kind of set

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970
make them pop or in order to kind of set
 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.849
make them pop or in order to kind of set
them up and out of your content somehow

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859
them up and out of your content somehow
 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.890
them up and out of your content somehow
is using a different kind of and

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900
is using a different kind of and
 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.170
is using a different kind of and
decorations like a circular mask in this

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180
decorations like a circular mask in this
 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.509
decorations like a circular mask in this
instance in order to kind of make it

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519
instance in order to kind of make it
 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.509
instance in order to kind of make it
stand out the nice thing about the mask

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519
stand out the nice thing about the mask
 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.240
stand out the nice thing about the mask
for Avatar photos too is that it's you

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250
for Avatar photos too is that it's you
 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.440
for Avatar photos too is that it's you
know it's a bit softer I guess in

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450
know it's a bit softer I guess in
 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.780
know it's a bit softer I guess in
general circles are a bit softer than

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790
general circles are a bit softer than
 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.210
general circles are a bit softer than
than squares or the things like that and

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220
than squares or the things like that and
 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.870
than squares or the things like that and
they kind of it's kind of nice to unify

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880
they kind of it's kind of nice to unify
 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.300
they kind of it's kind of nice to unify
or to tie this this visual element the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310
or to tie this this visual element the
 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.270
or to tie this this visual element the
circle to the idea of a person right so

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280
circle to the idea of a person right so
 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.130
circle to the idea of a person right so
not necessarily circles it could be

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140
not necessarily circles it could be
 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.930
not necessarily circles it could be
other things but kind of making sure

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940
other things but kind of making sure
 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.400
other things but kind of making sure
that throughout your app anytime you

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410
that throughout your app anytime you
 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.740
that throughout your app anytime you
show a type of single type of object if

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750
show a type of single type of object if
 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.540
show a type of single type of object if
there's visual consistency and using a

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550
there's visual consistency and using a
 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.010
there's visual consistency and using a
circle mask is one of the ways in which

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020
circle mask is one of the ways in which
 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.280
circle mask is one of the ways in which
to you can achieve that I guess yeah

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290
to you can achieve that I guess yeah
 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.540
to you can achieve that I guess yeah
definitely and moving on here is an

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550
definitely and moving on here is an
 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.600
definitely and moving on here is an
example from the path application which

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610
example from the path application which
 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.400
example from the path application which
combines that idea of using a circle

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410
combines that idea of using a circle
 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.070
combines that idea of using a circle
mask we're providing kind of a slight

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080
mask we're providing kind of a slight
 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.680
mask we're providing kind of a slight
white border and a drop shadow onto it

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690
white border and a drop shadow onto it
 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.360
white border and a drop shadow onto it
just in order to I think set it apart

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370
just in order to I think set it apart
 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.620
just in order to I think set it apart
from the content give a little bit of

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630
from the content give a little bit of
 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.900
from the content give a little bit of
kind of and content protection because

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910
kind of and content protection because
 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.670
kind of and content protection because
if you're not sure what the color of an

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680
if you're not sure what the color of an
 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.540
if you're not sure what the color of an
image is going to be if it's

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550
image is going to be if it's
 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.430
image is going to be if it's
user-provided you can probe you can stop

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440
user-provided you can probe you can stop
 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.990
user-provided you can probe you can stop
that from contrasting with your

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000
that from contrasting with your
 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that from contrasting with your
background elements for example and make

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010
background elements for example and make
 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.260
background elements for example and make
it stand out as well giving a little bit

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270
it stand out as well giving a little bit
 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.260
it stand out as well giving a little bit
of visual depth yeah should we move on

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270
of visual depth yeah should we move on
 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.800
of visual depth yeah should we move on
to text overlays all right so um so

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810
to text overlays all right so um so
 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.390
to text overlays all right so um so
anytime you show images and actually

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400
anytime you show images and actually
 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.980
anytime you show images and actually
this is something that we'll talk about

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990
this is something that we'll talk about
 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.020
this is something that we'll talk about
in a bit with full bleed imagery but

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030
in a bit with full bleed imagery but
 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.490
in a bit with full bleed imagery but
basically anytime you show images and

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500
basically anytime you show images and
 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.380
basically anytime you show images and
you want to show captions next to those

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390
you want to show captions next to those
 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.450
you want to show captions next to those
images you know there's a couple ways to

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460
images you know there's a couple ways to
 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.710
images you know there's a couple ways to
do that right so first of all you could

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720
do that right so first of all you could
 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.060
do that right so first of all you could
obviously you know you could have the

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070
obviously you know you could have the
 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.980
obviously you know you could have the
photo and you can show captions below it

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990
photo and you can show captions below it
 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.320
photo and you can show captions below it
if you have the space but one of the one

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330
if you have the space but one of the one
 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.580
if you have the space but one of the one
of the ways in which you can kind of

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590
of the ways in which you can kind of
 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.970
of the ways in which you can kind of
maximize the use of space maximize the

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980
maximize the use of space maximize the
 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.760
maximize the use of space maximize the
also I guess maximize the effectiveness

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770
also I guess maximize the effectiveness
 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.100
also I guess maximize the effectiveness
of the photo or of the image is to make

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110
of the photo or of the image is to make
 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.450
of the photo or of the image is to make
the image take up as much space as

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460
the image take up as much space as
 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.730
the image take up as much space as
possible and overlay any sort of

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740
possible and overlay any sort of
 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.370
possible and overlay any sort of
metadata or or titles or captions or

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380
metadata or or titles or captions or
 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.620
metadata or or titles or captions or
things like that on top of the image so

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630
things like that on top of the image so
 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.140
things like that on top of the image so
here's just a couple of examples of of

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150
here's just a couple of examples of of
 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.240
here's just a couple of examples of of
that in action I guess so this is from

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250
that in action I guess so this is from
 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.460
that in action I guess so this is from
the a dia app the Android design and

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470
the a dia app the Android design and
 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.340
the a dia app the Android design and
action app from Andreas and you can see

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350
action app from Andreas and you can see
 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.840
action app from Andreas and you can see
that you know the images take up as much

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850
that you know the images take up as much
 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.150
that you know the images take up as much
space as possible there aren't you know

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160
space as possible there aren't you know
 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.840
space as possible there aren't you know
big white gaps in between them and then

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850
big white gaps in between them and then
 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.940
big white gaps in between them and then
you know having text inside those gaps

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950
you know having text inside those gaps
 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.580
you know having text inside those gaps
this is purely kind of you know letting

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590
this is purely kind of you know letting
 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.780
this is purely kind of you know letting
the image take up as much space as

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790
the image take up as much space as
 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.880
the image take up as much space as
possible and using the space on top of

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:32.890
possible and using the space on top of
 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.980
possible and using the space on top of
the image as the as a space for the

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990
the image as the as a space for the
 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.240
the image as the as a space for the
metadata

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250
metadata
 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.129
metadata
so here's another example this is the

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139
so here's another example this is the
 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.469
so here's another example this is the
Circa app the circuit app is a is a

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479
Circa app the circuit app is a is a
 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:42.600
Circa app the circuit app is a is a
recently update or recently published

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610
recently update or recently published
 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.200
recently update or recently published
news app and here you know they also

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210
news app and here you know they also
 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.090
news app and here you know they also
have the the news article take up the

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100
have the the news article take up the
 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.520
have the the news article take up the
full or the the news thumbnail take up

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530
full or the the news thumbnail take up
 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.189
full or the the news thumbnail take up
almost you know half the entire screen

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199
almost you know half the entire screen
 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.020
almost you know half the entire screen
maybe even a little more and then the

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030
maybe even a little more and then the
 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.460
maybe even a little more and then the
title is just kind of an overlay and

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470
title is just kind of an overlay and
 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.689
title is just kind of an overlay and
here just a couple of other examples

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699
here just a couple of other examples
 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.850
here just a couple of other examples
from from google play music and the

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860
from from google play music and the
 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.310
from from google play music and the
people out but the you know the reason

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320
people out but the you know the reason
 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.900
people out but the you know the reason
we wanted to point these out is that you

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910
we wanted to point these out is that you
 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.890
we wanted to point these out is that you
know these are a couple of different

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:04.900
know these are a couple of different
 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.840
know these are a couple of different
examples but they each user use a

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850
examples but they each user use a
 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.700
examples but they each user use a
different form of background protection

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710
different form of background protection
 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.350
different form of background protection
and background protection is basically

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360
and background protection is basically
 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.580
and background protection is basically
the idea that you know if you just

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590
the idea that you know if you just
 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.490
the idea that you know if you just
overlay text of whichever color black

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500
overlay text of whichever color black
 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.560
overlay text of whichever color black
white whatever if you just overlay text

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570
white whatever if you just overlay text
 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.409
white whatever if you just overlay text
over an image very frequently the image

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:19.419
over an image very frequently the image
 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.629
over an image very frequently the image
itself is going to contrast too highly

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639
itself is going to contrast too highly
 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.700
itself is going to contrast too highly
with the text and the text won't be very

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:23.710
with the text and the text won't be very
 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.189
with the text and the text won't be very
readable won't be very legible so

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199
readable won't be very legible so
 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.779
readable won't be very legible so
background protection is is something

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:27.789
background protection is is something
 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:29.279
background protection is is something
that you place in the background or some

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:29.289
that you place in the background or some
 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:31.890
that you place in the background or some
effect that you provide that makes the

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:31.900
effect that you provide that makes the
 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.200
effect that you provide that makes the
text legible so here's an example in the

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.210
text legible so here's an example in the
 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.689
text legible so here's an example in the
in the Atia app there's a kind of a dark

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:36.699
in the Atia app there's a kind of a dark
 

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:41.040
in the Atia app there's a kind of a dark
a black drop or a black gradient that's

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.050
a black drop or a black gradient that's
 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.460
a black drop or a black gradient that's
a very very common form here in the top

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:44.470
a very very common form here in the top
 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.070
a very very common form here in the top
right there's the people app and instead

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080
right there's the people app and instead
 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.469
right there's the people app and instead
of a gradient they just use kind of a

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479
of a gradient they just use kind of a
 

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:51.060
of a gradient they just use kind of a
you know a a semi-transparent

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.070
you know a a semi-transparent
 

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.189
you know a a semi-transparent
black rectangle that's another common

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199
black rectangle that's another common
 

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:55.710
black rectangle that's another common
way of doing things and then here in the

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720
way of doing things and then here in the
 

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.469
way of doing things and then here in the
in the Google Play Music app the action

00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479
in the Google Play Music app the action
 

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:00.779
in the Google Play Music app the action
bar is also you know it's using a

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:00.789
bar is also you know it's using a
 

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:02.310
bar is also you know it's using a
gradient for background protection and

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:02.320
gradient for background protection and
 

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.899
gradient for background protection and
so whatever the background is whatever

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:03.909
so whatever the background is whatever
 

00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:05.790
so whatever the background is whatever
this photo is even if it's just pure

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800
this photo is even if it's just pure
 

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.680
this photo is even if it's just pure
white you'll still be able to read the

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:07.690
white you'll still be able to read the
 

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.460
white you'll still be able to read the
the title here and see the controls so

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:11.470
the title here and see the controls so
 

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.629
the title here and see the controls so
the one thing I didn't want to talk

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639
the one thing I didn't want to talk
 

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:13.890
the one thing I didn't want to talk
about is the way circuit does it is

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:13.900
about is the way circuit does it is
 

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.689
about is the way circuit does it is
actually very interesting it does a

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:15.699
actually very interesting it does a
 

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:17.580
actually very interesting it does a
combination of a slight drop shadow on

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:17.590
combination of a slight drop shadow on
 

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.670
combination of a slight drop shadow on
the text which it alone is you know is

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:20.680
the text which it alone is you know is
 

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.920
the text which it alone is you know is
usually enough to make it legible but it

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:22.930
usually enough to make it legible but it
 

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.260
usually enough to make it legible but it
also applies this blurring effect and

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:25.270
also applies this blurring effect and
 

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.939
also applies this blurring effect and
you know the actual execution here I

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:26.949
you know the actual execution here I
 

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:28.050
you know the actual execution here I
think could be a little better there

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.060
think could be a little better there
 

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.279
think could be a little better there
could be kind of a faded blur or

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:29.289
could be kind of a faded blur or
 

00:08:29.289 --> 00:08:30.839
could be kind of a faded blur or
something like that it's quite a sharp

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:30.849
something like that it's quite a sharp
 

00:08:30.849 --> 00:08:32.430
something like that it's quite a sharp
edge between the blurred and not blurred

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:32.440
edge between the blurred and not blurred
 

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.260
edge between the blurred and not blurred
image but the idea is that they're

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.270
image but the idea is that they're
 

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.420
image but the idea is that they're
blurring the background to provide as

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:36.430
blurring the background to provide as
 

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.300
blurring the background to provide as
much contrast on the text so anytime you

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:39.310
much contrast on the text so anytime you
 

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.370
much contrast on the text so anytime you
see edges for example you know in this

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:41.380
see edges for example you know in this
 

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.990
see edges for example you know in this
photo you have a turtle and you know

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.000
photo you have a turtle and you know
 

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.120
photo you have a turtle and you know
that that hard edge between the photo

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.130
that that hard edge between the photo
 

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.040
that that hard edge between the photo
between a turtle in the hand that's

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.050
between a turtle in the hand that's
 

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.500
between a turtle in the hand that's
actually visual distraction

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:48.510
actually visual distraction
 

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.240
actually visual distraction
now in this case when you're just

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:50.250
now in this case when you're just
 

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.009
now in this case when you're just
focusing on the image that's that's good

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:52.019
focusing on the image that's that's good
 

00:08:52.019 --> 00:08:53.420
focusing on the image that's that's good
thing right you want to focus on the

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:53.430
thing right you want to focus on the
 

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.550
thing right you want to focus on the
different details in the image but here

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560
different details in the image but here
 

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.560
different details in the image but here
where you just want kind of a kind of a

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:57.570
where you just want kind of a kind of a
 

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.269
where you just want kind of a kind of a
more vague sense of the image but you

00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279
more vague sense of the image but you
 

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:00.769
more vague sense of the image but you
really want to focus on the text they

00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779
really want to focus on the text they
 

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:02.329
really want to focus on the text they
kind of blur out the background make

00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:02.339
kind of blur out the background make
 

00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:05.210
kind of blur out the background make
those edges much much blurrier and make

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220
those edges much much blurrier and make
 

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.340
those edges much much blurrier and make
the text much easier to read so a couple

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:07.350
the text much easier to read so a couple
 

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.860
the text much easier to read so a couple
of different ways to to overlay text or

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:09.870
of different ways to to overlay text or
 

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.110
of different ways to to overlay text or
overlay metadata on top of your photos

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120
overlay metadata on top of your photos
 

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.699
overlay metadata on top of your photos
to maximize the amount of space

00:09:13.699 --> 00:09:13.709
to maximize the amount of space
 

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:16.850
to maximize the amount of space
dedicated to two images another great

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860
dedicated to two images another great
 

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.290
dedicated to two images another great
aspect of using these kind of overlay

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300
aspect of using these kind of overlay
 

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.280
aspect of using these kind of overlay
labels is that it lets you and kind of

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:21.290
labels is that it lets you and kind of
 

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.290
labels is that it lets you and kind of
say this whole item is the interface

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300
say this whole item is the interface
 

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.550
say this whole item is the interface
it's kind of the idea of putting your

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560
it's kind of the idea of putting your
 

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.610
it's kind of the idea of putting your
content first and then anything anything

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620
content first and then anything anything
 

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.259
content first and then anything anything
else is kind of within its contained

00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:30.269
else is kind of within its contained
 

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.210
else is kind of within its contained
within it so it's like saying on the

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220
within it so it's like saying on the
 

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.949
within it so it's like saying on the
people app on the example where you have

00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959
people app on the example where you have
 

00:09:33.959 --> 00:09:36.110
people app on the example where you have
a calling a contact now this is the

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120
a calling a contact now this is the
 

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.550
a calling a contact now this is the
thing that you can click on this is the

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560
thing that you can click on this is the
 

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.530
thing that you can click on this is the
person this is the data item I can

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540
person this is the data item I can
 

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.120
person this is the data item I can
interact with and there isn't another

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.130
interact with and there isn't another
 

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.680
interact with and there isn't another
label off slightly similar to the size

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:42.690
label off slightly similar to the size
 

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.509
label off slightly similar to the size
you have to kind of expand out the area

00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519
you have to kind of expand out the area
 

00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:46.430
you have to kind of expand out the area
like I click on a fourth it or whatever

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440
like I click on a fourth it or whatever
 

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.980
like I click on a fourth it or whatever
it might be it's completely contained so

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:48.990
it might be it's completely contained so
 

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.600
it might be it's completely contained so
this overlay label helps you to kind of

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:50.610
this overlay label helps you to kind of
 

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.059
this overlay label helps you to kind of
fill this kind of and data centric kind

00:09:53.059 --> 00:09:53.069
fill this kind of and data centric kind
 

00:09:53.069 --> 00:09:56.000
fill this kind of and data centric kind
of UI yeah it's really the image is the

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.010
of UI yeah it's really the image is the
 

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.620
of UI yeah it's really the image is the
touch target right and it's it's almost

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:57.630
touch target right and it's it's almost
 

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.439
touch target right and it's it's almost
like if you look at you know modern UI

00:10:00.439 --> 00:10:00.449
like if you look at you know modern UI
 

00:10:00.449 --> 00:10:02.960
like if you look at you know modern UI
is versus past you eyes really the

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:02.970
is versus past you eyes really the
 

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.329
is versus past you eyes really the
content is the chrome the content is the

00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339
content is the chrome the content is the
 

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:08.960
content is the chrome the content is the
is the interactive target and you know

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:08.970
is the interactive target and you know
 

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.960
is the interactive target and you know
here when you let the image kind of when

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:11.970
here when you let the image kind of when
 

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.970
here when you let the image kind of when
you let the image be the target I think

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:13.980
you let the image be the target I think
 

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.069
you let the image be the target I think
that you end up with a much more rich UI

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079
that you end up with a much more rich UI
 

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:21.920
that you end up with a much more rich UI
so okay sure you move on move on to full

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:21.930
so okay sure you move on move on to full
 

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.079
so okay sure you move on move on to full
bleed so this falls this is kind of

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:24.089
bleed so this falls this is kind of
 

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:28.340
bleed so this falls this is kind of
related to two text overlays and kind of

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:28.350
related to two text overlays and kind of
 

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.809
related to two text overlays and kind of
in a similar manner we have some similar

00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:29.819
in a similar manner we have some similar
 

00:10:29.819 --> 00:10:31.639
in a similar manner we have some similar
screenshots but here the idea is that

00:10:31.639 --> 00:10:31.649
screenshots but here the idea is that
 

00:10:31.649 --> 00:10:35.030
screenshots but here the idea is that
you know you want to so we keep hearing

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040
you know you want to so we keep hearing
 

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.590
you know you want to so we keep hearing
I am noises in art okay anyway um so you

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600
I am noises in art okay anyway um so you
 

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.150
I am noises in art okay anyway um so you
know here the ideas that you want the

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160
know here the ideas that you want the
 

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.340
know here the ideas that you want the
image to take as much physical you know

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:43.350
image to take as much physical you know
 

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.040
image to take as much physical you know
space as possible you want it as much

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.050
space as possible you want it as much
 

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.750
space as possible you want it as much
real estate as possible you want to you

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760
real estate as possible you want to you
 

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.579
real estate as possible you want to you
want your UI basically to be as

00:10:49.579 --> 00:10:49.589
want your UI basically to be as
 

00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:52.100
want your UI basically to be as
immersive as possible so here's an

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:52.110
immersive as possible so here's an
 

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.199
immersive as possible so here's an
example of that where basically rather

00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:54.209
example of that where basically rather
 

00:10:54.209 --> 00:10:56.660
example of that where basically rather
than having the the image start at the

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:56.670
than having the the image start at the
 

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.940
than having the the image start at the
bottom of the action bar

00:10:58.940 --> 00:10:58.950
bottom of the action bar
 

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.410
bottom of the action bar
maybe kind of pushing the rest of this

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:00.420
maybe kind of pushing the rest of this
 

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.480
maybe kind of pushing the rest of this
content down in google play music they

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:02.490
content down in google play music they
 

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.520
content down in google play music they
actually say decided that hey why can't

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:04.530
actually say decided that hey why can't
 

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.800
actually say decided that hey why can't
the image be part of the action bar so

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:06.810
the image be part of the action bar so
 

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.270
the image be part of the action bar so
here they use kind of a translucent

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:08.280
here they use kind of a translucent
 

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.860
here they use kind of a translucent
action bar with again that background

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:09.870
action bar with again that background
 

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.110
action bar with again that background
protection and let the image go as high

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120
protection and let the image go as high
 

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.580
protection and let the image go as high
up as possible and so here's basically

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:16.590
up as possible and so here's basically
 

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.740
up as possible and so here's basically
the concept of maximum space for content

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:18.750
the concept of maximum space for content
 

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.470
the concept of maximum space for content
maximum space for images when you have

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480
maximum space for images when you have
 

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.820
maximum space for images when you have
multiple images like in the case of

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:22.830
multiple images like in the case of
 

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.260
multiple images like in the case of
thumbnails what that means is you want

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:24.270
thumbnails what that means is you want
 

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.420
thumbnails what that means is you want
to minimize the gaps between images you

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:26.430
to minimize the gaps between images you
 

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.250
to minimize the gaps between images you
want to minimize the space between them

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260
want to minimize the space between them
 

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.500
want to minimize the space between them
and so here's again an example of the

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:30.510
and so here's again an example of the
 

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.480
and so here's again an example of the
people app where the space between each

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:32.490
people app where the space between each
 

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.510
people app where the space between each
image is only about one or two dips and

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:35.520
image is only about one or two dips and
 

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.060
image is only about one or two dips and
and the idea here is that if you had if

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:38.070
and the idea here is that if you had if
 

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.100
and the idea here is that if you had if
you had larger space you had larger gaps

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:40.110
you had larger space you had larger gaps
 

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.050
you had larger space you had larger gaps
whether they be white or black it would

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060
whether they be white or black it would
 

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.850
whether they be white or black it would
be extra visual distraction it would be

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860
be extra visual distraction it would be
 

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.350
be extra visual distraction it would be
kind of yeah it would it would

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360
kind of yeah it would it would
 

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.480
kind of yeah it would it would
potentially you know help further the

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:47.490
potentially you know help further the
 

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.100
potentially you know help further the
visual hierarchy but the hierarchy here

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:49.110
visual hierarchy but the hierarchy here
 

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.490
visual hierarchy but the hierarchy here
is well-established already and so extra

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.500
is well-established already and so extra
 

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.560
is well-established already and so extra
space there would be just kind of static

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:54.570
space there would be just kind of static
 

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.840
space there would be just kind of static
you know static space that's not being

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:56.850
you know static space that's not being
 

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.880
you know static space that's not being
used that's that's not really kind of

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:58.890
used that's that's not really kind of
 

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.490
used that's that's not really kind of
committed you know really assisting in

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500
committed you know really assisting in
 

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.770
committed you know really assisting in
presenting this content so I think that

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:03.780
presenting this content so I think that
 

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.270
presenting this content so I think that
you know the the fact that there are

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:05.280
you know the the fact that there are
 

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.430
you know the the fact that there are
small gaps here I think is you know it

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440
small gaps here I think is you know it
 

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.240
small gaps here I think is you know it
services the content really well and

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:11.250
services the content really well and
 

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.610
services the content really well and
then too quick other examples here's

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620
then too quick other examples here's
 

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.980
then too quick other examples here's
another example of a Flipboard again

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:15.990
another example of a Flipboard again
 

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.930
another example of a Flipboard again
with very minimal space between photos

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940
with very minimal space between photos
 

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.820
with very minimal space between photos
between the thumbnails and then here's

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:19.830
between the thumbnails and then here's
 

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.620
between the thumbnails and then here's
another example of going completely full

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:21.630
another example of going completely full
 

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.020
another example of going completely full
bleed we're basically the entire the

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:24.030
bleed we're basically the entire the
 

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.000
bleed we're basically the entire the
entire screen is a photo it's not a

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.010
entire screen is a photo it's not a
 

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.620
entire screen is a photo it's not a
static photo this is kind of an

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:27.630
static photo this is kind of an
 

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.930
static photo this is kind of an
important distinction to make it's not

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:29.940
important distinction to make it's not
 

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.490
important distinction to make it's not
just a static photo that is the same for

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500
just a static photo that is the same for
 

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.260
just a static photo that is the same for
you know every time you launch the app

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:33.270
you know every time you launch the app
 

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.480
you know every time you launch the app
it is a piece of content it's still very

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:35.490
it is a piece of content it's still very
 

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.630
it is a piece of content it's still very
very dynamic so the idea is here is that

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:38.640
very dynamic so the idea is here is that
 

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.850
very dynamic so the idea is here is that
they spent as much space as possible

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860
they spent as much space as possible
 

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.430
they spent as much space as possible
showing the the content and then

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440
showing the the content and then
 

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.380
showing the the content and then
overlaid things on top of it in a you

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:45.390
overlaid things on top of it in a you
 

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.970
overlaid things on top of it in a you
know in a background protected kind of

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:46.980
know in a background protected kind of
 

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.300
know in a background protected kind of
way the you know the app branding as

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:50.310
way the you know the app branding as
 

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.460
way the you know the app branding as
well as some of the kind of things that

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:52.470
well as some of the kind of things that
 

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.780
well as some of the kind of things that
you can look at once you've opened

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:53.790
you can look at once you've opened
 

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:56.720
you can look at once you've opened
magazine so that's full bleed imagery

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:56.730
magazine so that's full bleed imagery
 

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.650
magazine so that's full bleed imagery
sure you move on to touch feedback yeah

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660
sure you move on to touch feedback yeah
 

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.750
sure you move on to touch feedback yeah
so touch feedback if you've been

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760
so touch feedback if you've been
 

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.520
so touch feedback if you've been
watching our other episodes we tend to

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:04.530
watching our other episodes we tend to
 

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.860
watching our other episodes we tend to
mention this quite frequently and that's

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:06.870
mention this quite frequently and that's
 

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.360
mention this quite frequently and that's
one of the reasons for that is we

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:08.370
one of the reasons for that is we
 

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.680
one of the reasons for that is we
actually see many apps that don't

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:09.690
actually see many apps that don't
 

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.690
actually see many apps that don't
actually implement touch feedback

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:11.700
actually implement touch feedback
 

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.310
actually implement touch feedback
one of those one of the areas where

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320
one of those one of the areas where
 

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.800
one of those one of the areas where
people often forget is image touch

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:15.810
people often forget is image touch
 

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.840
people often forget is image touch
targets or touch targets that are made

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:17.850
targets or touch targets that are made
 

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.920
targets or touch targets that are made
made up largely of images and so one of

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:21.930
made up largely of images and so one of
 

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.210
made up largely of images and so one of
the one of the I guess one of the

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:23.220
the one of the I guess one of the
 

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.550
the one of the I guess one of the
problems with them with touch feedback

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560
problems with them with touch feedback
 

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.310
problems with them with touch feedback
where the touch target is largely made

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320
where the touch target is largely made
 

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.280
where the touch target is largely made
up of an image is that you can't really

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:30.290
up of an image is that you can't really
 

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.020
up of an image is that you can't really
engage the touch that the the touch

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:33.030
engage the touch that the the touch
 

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.580
engage the touch that the the touch
feedback on the background like you

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:34.590
feedback on the background like you
 

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.200
feedback on the background like you
normally could we say text or something

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:36.210
normally could we say text or something
 

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.900
normally could we say text or something
like that so if it touchable areas that

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:38.910
like that so if it touchable areas that
 

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.310
like that so if it touchable areas that
are largely made up with an image you

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320
are largely made up with an image you
 

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.450
are largely made up with an image you
should really use a sort of semi

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:41.460
should really use a sort of semi
 

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.400
should really use a sort of semi
transparent overlay that covers the full

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:43.410
transparent overlay that covers the full
 

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.850
transparent overlay that covers the full
touchable area in terms of like the

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:46.860
touchable area in terms of like the
 

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.930
touchable area in terms of like the
color that you should use it should

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940
color that you should use it should
 

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.490
color that you should use it should
really match well with whatever your

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:49.500
really match well with whatever your
 

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.290
really match well with whatever your
sort of highlight color is or your

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300
sort of highlight color is or your
 

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.520
sort of highlight color is or your
accent color is for your application and

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:54.530
accent color is for your application and
 

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.140
accent color is for your application and
the focused and check state should

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:57.150
the focused and check state should
 

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.270
the focused and check state should
really be about 50% of the press state

00:13:59.270 --> 00:13:59.280
really be about 50% of the press state
 

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.240
really be about 50% of the press state
in terms of opacity so actually let's

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:02.250
in terms of opacity so actually let's
 

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.160
in terms of opacity so actually let's
just jump across here and quickly look

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:04.170
just jump across here and quickly look
 

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.520
just jump across here and quickly look
at some examples so the two on the left

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:07.530
at some examples so the two on the left
 

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.250
at some examples so the two on the left
is sort of no nose you can see the very

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.260
is sort of no nose you can see the very
 

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:15.470
is sort of no nose you can see the very
left example here oops it's highlighting

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480
left example here oops it's highlighting
 

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.960
left example here oops it's highlighting
the background and I actually increase

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:17.970
the background and I actually increase
 

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.220
the background and I actually increase
the borders a little bit here so you

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:19.230
the borders a little bit here so you
 

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.770
the borders a little bit here so you
could even see it but so to the points

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:21.780
could even see it but so to the points
 

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.120
could even see it but so to the points
that Roman was talking about just before

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.130
that Roman was talking about just before
 

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.680
that Roman was talking about just before
the full bleed imagery and the text

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:24.690
the full bleed imagery and the text
 

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.140
the full bleed imagery and the text
overlays often you won't even have any

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:27.150
overlays often you won't even have any
 

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.820
overlays often you won't even have any
background to highlight in these cases

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:28.830
background to highlight in these cases
 

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.830
background to highlight in these cases
so that's that's just not really going

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:30.840
so that's that's just not really going
 

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.390
so that's that's just not really going
to work where the image makes up the

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:32.400
to work where the image makes up the
 

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.610
to work where the image makes up the
majority of the touch target the second

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.620
majority of the touch target the second
 

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.120
majority of the touch target the second
no-no example here is is not having any

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.130
no-no example here is is not having any
 

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.610
no-no example here is is not having any
transparency so not only does this not

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:40.620
transparency so not only does this not
 

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.440
transparency so not only does this not
look that great but you can actually see

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:42.450
look that great but you can actually see
 

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.700
look that great but you can actually see
sort of the content yet that you're

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:43.710
sort of the content yet that you're
 

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.850
sort of the content yet that you're
touching behind and here's an example of

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860
touching behind and here's an example of
 

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.160
touching behind and here's an example of
just sort of a good way to do a touch

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:49.170
just sort of a good way to do a touch
 

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:55.340
just sort of a good way to do a touch
feedback on a particular image

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:55.350
 
 

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.470
 
another couple of examples the press

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480
another couple of examples the press
 

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.660
another couple of examples the press
state and Czech state and actually this

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:00.670
state and Czech state and actually this
 

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.210
state and Czech state and actually this
is a little tricky to see here simply

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:03.220
is a little tricky to see here simply
 

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.419
is a little tricky to see here simply
because the opacity is you know it's

00:15:06.419 --> 00:15:06.429
because the opacity is you know it's
 

00:15:06.429 --> 00:15:09.419
because the opacity is you know it's
it's kind of a it's fifty percent but

00:15:09.419 --> 00:15:09.429
it's kind of a it's fifty percent but
 

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:11.189
it's kind of a it's fifty percent but
it's let's see if we can zoom in a bit

00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199
it's let's see if we can zoom in a bit
 

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:12.749
it's let's see if we can zoom in a bit
you can see it's quite it's slightly

00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759
you can see it's quite it's slightly
 

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:14.460
you can see it's quite it's slightly
darker here than it is here but it's

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:14.470
darker here than it is here but it's
 

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:19.499
darker here than it is here but it's
it's a little tricky to see so here's a

00:15:19.499 --> 00:15:19.509
it's a little tricky to see so here's a
 

00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:21.590
it's a little tricky to see so here's a
few good examples of touch feedback

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600
few good examples of touch feedback
 

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.269
few good examples of touch feedback
where you know where the where the image

00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279
where you know where the where the image
 

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:25.710
where you know where the where the image
is the majority of the touch targets so

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720
is the majority of the touch targets so
 

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.179
is the majority of the touch targets so
on the left here we have google play

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:27.189
on the left here we have google play
 

00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:31.919
on the left here we have google play
moves on the left here we have google

00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:31.929
moves on the left here we have google
 

00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:34.590
moves on the left here we have google
play music and you can see here they're

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:34.600
play music and you can see here they're
 

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.780
play music and you can see here they're
highlighting the entire card and they're

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:36.790
highlighting the entire card and they're
 

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.639
highlighting the entire card and they're
also using the accent color the sort of

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:38.649
also using the accent color the sort of
 

00:15:38.649 --> 00:15:40.559
also using the accent color the sort of
orange accent color that sort of matches

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:40.569
orange accent color that sort of matches
 

00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:45.480
orange accent color that sort of matches
with google play music the second

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:45.490
with google play music the second
 

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.119
with google play music the second
example here is a goo in Google Play the

00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:48.129
example here is a goo in Google Play the
 

00:15:48.129 --> 00:15:50.939
example here is a goo in Google Play the
App Store itself and this is one of the

00:15:50.939 --> 00:15:50.949
App Store itself and this is one of the
 

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:52.199
App Store itself and this is one of the
collections the beautiful apps

00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:52.209
collections the beautiful apps
 

00:15:52.209 --> 00:15:53.730
collections the beautiful apps
collections so you can see here the

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:53.740
collections so you can see here the
 

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.489
collections so you can see here the
cards are actually larger and again the

00:15:56.489 --> 00:15:56.499
cards are actually larger and again the
 

00:15:56.499 --> 00:15:58.410
cards are actually larger and again the
entire card is being highlighted here to

00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:58.420
entire card is being highlighted here to
 

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.689
entire card is being highlighted here to
indicate the touchable region and you

00:16:00.689 --> 00:16:00.699
indicate the touchable region and you
 

00:16:00.699 --> 00:16:02.189
indicate the touchable region and you
can see here the the text is not

00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:02.199
can see here the the text is not
 

00:16:02.199 --> 00:16:03.569
can see here the the text is not
overlaid the description of the

00:16:03.569 --> 00:16:03.579
overlaid the description of the
 

00:16:03.579 --> 00:16:05.970
overlaid the description of the
applications actually falls below the

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:05.980
applications actually falls below the
 

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.889
applications actually falls below the
main image but the entire touch target

00:16:07.889 --> 00:16:07.899
main image but the entire touch target
 

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:12.419
main image but the entire touch target
is being highlighted and then the last

00:16:12.419 --> 00:16:12.429
is being highlighted and then the last
 

00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:14.699
is being highlighted and then the last
example here is the Google i/o 2013

00:16:14.699 --> 00:16:14.709
example here is the Google i/o 2013
 

00:16:14.709 --> 00:16:17.910
example here is the Google i/o 2013
application and you can see the avatars

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920
application and you can see the avatars
 

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.489
application and you can see the avatars
that we were talking about before with

00:16:20.489 --> 00:16:20.499
that we were talking about before with
 

00:16:20.499 --> 00:16:22.829
that we were talking about before with
the rounded circle and in this case just

00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839
the rounded circle and in this case just
 

00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:24.629
the rounded circle and in this case just
the circle of the images being

00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639
the circle of the images being
 

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:28.499
the circle of the images being
highlighted and as you were saying

00:16:28.499 --> 00:16:28.509
highlighted and as you were saying
 

00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:30.030
highlighted and as you were saying
before I think this is an excellent

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040
before I think this is an excellent
 

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.710
before I think this is an excellent
opportunity to kind of really embed your

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720
opportunity to kind of really embed your
 

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.299
opportunity to kind of really embed your
branding in there so I think Google Play

00:16:33.299 --> 00:16:33.309
branding in there so I think Google Play
 

00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:35.160
branding in there so I think Google Play
Music is doing a great job there with

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:35.170
Music is doing a great job there with
 

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.019
Music is doing a great job there with
them you know extending his orange

00:16:37.019 --> 00:16:37.029
them you know extending his orange
 

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:40.739
them you know extending his orange
branding into the touch touch States you

00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:40.749
branding into the touch touch States you
 

00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:43.139
branding into the touch touch States you
know holo design language is in no way

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:43.149
know holo design language is in no way
 

00:16:43.149 --> 00:16:44.549
know holo design language is in no way
prescriptive about color and you should

00:16:44.549 --> 00:16:44.559
prescriptive about color and you should
 

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:45.749
prescriptive about color and you should
really see this as an opportunity to

00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759
really see this as an opportunity to
 

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:47.460
really see this as an opportunity to
play the break away from that default

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:47.470
play the break away from that default
 

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.350
play the break away from that default
holo blue and really kind of bring your

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360
holo blue and really kind of bring your
 

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.910
holo blue and really kind of bring your
own branding to the table yeah

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:50.920
own branding to the table yeah
 

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.680
own branding to the table yeah
definitely actually move on to focus

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:55.690
definitely actually move on to focus
 

00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:00.480
definitely actually move on to focus
yeah absolutely so what images are

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:00.490
yeah absolutely so what images are
 

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.950
yeah absolutely so what images are
beautiful and great for grabbing

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:01.960
beautiful and great for grabbing
 

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.630
beautiful and great for grabbing
attention sometimes that's not exactly

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:03.640
attention sometimes that's not exactly
 

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.510
attention sometimes that's not exactly
what you want and you want to be able to

taking a screenshot of the parents app I

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.480
taking a screenshot of the parents app I
 

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.930
taking a screenshot of the parents app I
noticed that the screenshot notification

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:03.940
noticed that the screenshot notification
 

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.460
noticed that the screenshot notification
in their vision buds is the same thing

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:05.470
in their vision buds is the same thing
 

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.660
in their vision buds is the same thing
and so the notification bar you're going

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:09.670
and so the notification bar you're going
 

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.010
and so the notification bar you're going
to be rubbing shoulders with all kinds

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:11.020
to be rubbing shoulders with all kinds
 

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.300

have a uniform look and feel so if you

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760
have a uniform look and feel so if you
 

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.820
have a uniform look and feel so if you
were to use kind of a full bleed like

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:17.830
were to use kind of a full bleed like
 

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.360
were to use kind of a full bleed like
very colorful image they might look

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:21.370
very colorful image they might look
 

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.160
very colorful image they might look
really out of place and they might kind

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:23.170
really out of place and they might kind
 

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.930
really out of place and they might kind
of be quite jarring experience it might

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:24.940
of be quite jarring experience it might
 

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.760
of be quite jarring experience it might
not look like a notification so they do

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:26.770
not look like a notification so they do
 

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.640
not look like a notification so they do
a nice job of desaturating me and the

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:29.650
a nice job of desaturating me and the
 

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.860

is have the touch target and the

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:36.790
is have the touch target and the
 

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:41.100
is have the touch target and the
secondary action to chair hey drew move

sometimes if you just apply a kind of

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:53.050
sometimes if you just apply a kind of
 

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.410
sometimes if you just apply a kind of
semi-transparent and I like over the top

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:55.420
semi-transparent and I like over the top
 

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.880

going to be and to apply slightly more

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:03.700
going to be and to apply slightly more
 

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.190

control to this you can actually combine

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:19.450
like grades these yellows but we're
 

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:20.730
like grades these yellows but we're
going to mute those colors and just

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:20.740
going to mute those colors and just
 

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.870

slightly more control effect yes I think

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:24.790
slightly more control effect yes I think
 

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:25.950

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.190
forth and you want to mute that
information so they do a great job

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200
information so they do a great job
 

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.680
information so they do a great job
they're applying the blur effect that

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:22.690
they're applying the blur effect that
 

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.740
they're applying the blur effect that
kind of really realized content shades

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:25.750
kind of really realized content shades
 

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.450
kind of really realized content shades
so the content is not prominent rather

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:27.460
so the content is not prominent rather
 

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.960
so the content is not prominent rather
than the imagery so a great technique

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:29.970
than the imagery so a great technique
 

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.950
than the imagery so a great technique
yep

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960
 
 

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.110
 
sure we might agree the last the last

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120
sure we might agree the last the last
 

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.250
sure we might agree the last the last
kind of focus technique we want to talk

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:38.260
kind of focus technique we want to talk
 

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.020
kind of focus technique we want to talk
about it's just really applying an

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.030
about it's just really applying an
 

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.130
about it's just really applying an
dimming effect so you can use this to

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140
dimming effect so you can use this to
 

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.360
dimming effect so you can use this to
great effects is to kind of you know

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:45.370
great effects is to kind of you know
 

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.640
great effects is to kind of you know
show show an imagery and then as you

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:47.650
show show an imagery and then as you
 

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.560
show show an imagery and then as you
scroll some text over topic in this

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:49.570
scroll some text over topic in this
 

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.330
scroll some text over topic in this
example from Grand Street then just

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:51.340
example from Grand Street then just
 

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.130
example from Grand Street then just
applies this kind of fade mask on top of

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:53.140
applies this kind of fade mask on top of
 

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.750
applies this kind of fade mask on top of
it in order to give some background

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760
it in order to give some background
 

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.880
it in order to give some background
protection to the text and bring the

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:56.890
protection to the text and bring the
 

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.890
protection to the text and bring the
text to the forefront of the attention

00:20:58.890 --> 00:20:58.900
text to the forefront of the attention
 

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.440
text to the forefront of the attention
as well and this to be really simply

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:01.450
as well and this to be really simply
 

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.880
as well and this to be really simply
achieved for developers just by setting

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:02.890
achieved for developers just by setting
 

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:08.160
achieved for developers just by setting
the kind of the same flag one image all

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:08.170
the kind of the same flag one image all
 

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:08.750
the kind of the same flag one image all
right

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760
right
 

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.510
right
Potato Head all right so let's talk a

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520
Potato Head all right so let's talk a
 

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.840
Potato Head all right so let's talk a
little bit about placeholders so I think

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:15.850
little bit about placeholders so I think
 

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:17.580
little bit about placeholders so I think
most apps actually do get this right for

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:17.590
most apps actually do get this right for
 

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.620
most apps actually do get this right for
the most part but any image that loads

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:19.630
the most part but any image that loads
 

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.330
the most part but any image that loads
in your UI that that has any sort of

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:21.340
in your UI that that has any sort of
 

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.120
in your UI that that has any sort of
load time any

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:22.130
load time any
 

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.070
load time any
time at all should really have some sort

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080
time at all should really have some sort
 

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.950
time at all should really have some sort
of place over there I was playing with

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960
of place over there I was playing with
 

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.300
of place over there I was playing with
an app the other day that had no

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:28.310
an app the other day that had no
 

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.800
an app the other day that had no
placeholders and I was just blindly

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:29.810
placeholders and I was just blindly
 

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.090
placeholders and I was just blindly
scrolling through a list not knowing

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:31.100
scrolling through a list not knowing
 

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.980
scrolling through a list not knowing
what was happening so it really gives a

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:32.990
what was happening so it really gives a
 

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:34.420
what was happening so it really gives a
good visual indication to the user that

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:34.430
good visual indication to the user that
 

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.430
good visual indication to the user that
something is going to load there once it

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440
something is going to load there once it
 

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.830
something is going to load there once it
gets around to loading ideally you

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:38.840
gets around to loading ideally you
 

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.020
gets around to loading ideally you
should try and tailor the placeholder to

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.030
should try and tailor the placeholder to
 

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.210
should try and tailor the placeholder to
the final image if you can if you have

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:43.220
the final image if you can if you have
 

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.830
the final image if you can if you have
any sort of additional information about

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840
any sort of additional information about
 

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.380
any sort of additional information about
the image maybe the dimensions the

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:47.390
the image maybe the dimensions the
 

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.240
the image maybe the dimensions the
colors things like that anything like a

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:49.250
colors things like that anything like a
 

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.370
colors things like that anything like a
low res cached version of its cache

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:51.380
low res cached version of its cache
 

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.170
low res cached version of its cache
version and I'll show you a couple

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:53.180
version and I'll show you a couple
 

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.290
version and I'll show you a couple
examples on the next slides about that

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:55.300
examples on the next slides about that
 

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.520
examples on the next slides about that
and then finally when the image actually

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:57.530
and then finally when the image actually
 

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.920
and then finally when the image actually
finishes loading a sort of subtle

00:21:59.920 --> 00:21:59.930
finishes loading a sort of subtle
 

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.780
finishes loading a sort of subtle
animation to transition to the final

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:01.790
animation to transition to the final
 

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.970
animation to transition to the final
image is definitely recommended normally

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:03.980
image is definitely recommended normally
 

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.280
image is definitely recommended normally
that just means a fade in or a crossfade

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:06.290
that just means a fade in or a crossfade
 

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.230
that just means a fade in or a crossfade
you could do something a little more

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240
you could do something a little more
 

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.180
you could do something a little more
fancy but I would just urge you not to

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:10.190
fancy but I would just urge you not to
 

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.730
fancy but I would just urge you not to
go to fancy really this should be quite

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:12.740
go to fancy really this should be quite
 

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.520
go to fancy really this should be quite
subtle yeah and then on the development

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:15.530
subtle yeah and then on the development
 

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.170
subtle yeah and then on the development
side you should just make sure that that

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:17.180
side you should just make sure that that
 

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.230
side you should just make sure that that
image that animation doesn't run every

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240
image that animation doesn't run every
 

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.250
image that animation doesn't run every
time the ListView scrolls up and down

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:23.260
time the ListView scrolls up and down
 

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:28.750
time the ListView scrolls up and down
getting kicked out Nick now you know the

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760
getting kicked out Nick now you know the
 

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.040
getting kicked out Nick now you know the
way that the ListView works it does

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:30.050
way that the ListView works it does
 

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.750
way that the ListView works it does
recycle views so you've got to make sure

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760
recycle views so you've got to make sure
 

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.730
recycle views so you've got to make sure
that the animation isn't running

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:33.740
that the animation isn't running
 

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.040
that the animation isn't running
constantly every time that the ListView

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:36.050
constantly every time that the ListView
 

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.990
constantly every time that the ListView
is scrolling up and down so let's have a

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000
is scrolling up and down so let's have a
 

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.110
is scrolling up and down so let's have a
look at some examples quickly so this is

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:41.120
look at some examples quickly so this is
 

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.590
look at some examples quickly so this is
the Google Play app again and you can

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600
the Google Play app again and you can
 

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.940
the Google Play app again and you can
see here and it's actually hard to get

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:45.950
see here and it's actually hard to get
 

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.830
see here and it's actually hard to get
these screenshots because they doesn't

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840
these screenshots because they doesn't
 

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.510
these screenshots because they doesn't
load pretty quickly I had to go into

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520
load pretty quickly I had to go into
 

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.400
load pretty quickly I had to go into
aeroplane mode but um because of the

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:51.410
aeroplane mode but um because of the
 

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:55.210
aeroplane mode but um because of the
sort of card based UI of Google Play you

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:55.220
sort of card based UI of Google Play you
 

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.380
sort of card based UI of Google Play you
don't even need sort of an additional

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:58.390
don't even need sort of an additional
 

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.730
don't even need sort of an additional
placeholder image here the sort of cards

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:00.740
placeholder image here the sort of cards
 

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.100
placeholder image here the sort of cards
and already conveys that something is

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:03.110
and already conveys that something is
 

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.740
and already conveys that something is
going to load it in that space so it's a

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:05.750
going to load it in that space so it's a
 

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.840
going to load it in that space so it's a
pretty nice example of sort of baking it

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:07.850
pretty nice example of sort of baking it
 

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:11.560
pretty nice example of sort of baking it
into the existing UI this is the system

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:11.570
into the existing UI this is the system
 

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.500
into the existing UI this is the system
gallery application and it's kind of

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:14.510
gallery application and it's kind of
 

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.110
gallery application and it's kind of
hard to notice here but actually they

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120
hard to notice here but actually they
 

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.180
hard to notice here but actually they
use the dimensions of the image that

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:19.190
use the dimensions of the image that
 

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.570
use the dimensions of the image that
will load to sort of show that I guess

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:22.580
will load to sort of show that I guess
 

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.440
will load to sort of show that I guess

against Shirley was I saying yes so as I

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:33.610
against Shirley was I saying yes so as I

against Shirley was I saying yes so as I
said it's kind of hard to see here but

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:34.950
said it's kind of hard to see here but
 

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.170
said it's kind of hard to see here but
the dimensions of the placeholder image

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:37.180
the dimensions of the placeholder image
 

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:39.240
the dimensions of the placeholder image
actually match the dimensions of the

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:39.250
actually match the dimensions of the
 

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.890
actually match the dimensions of the
final image so if you haven't get a long

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:40.900
final image so if you haven't get a long
 

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.590

panorama or something it'll be thinner
and if you have a sort of portrait photo

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:45.490
and if you have a sort of portrait photo
 

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.790
and if you have a sort of portrait photo
it'll be taller it's almost kind of like

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:47.800
it'll be taller it's almost kind of like
 

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.930
it'll be taller it's almost kind of like
you know at an airport when an airplane

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:48.940
you know at an airport when an airplane
 

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.310
you know at an airport when an airplane
is landing someone's like the landing

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320
is landing someone's like the landing
 

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.140
is landing someone's like the landing
strip for the airplane it means it's

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:52.150
strip for the airplane it means it's
 

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.580
strip for the airplane it means it's
kind of guiding it or it's not really

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:53.590
kind of guiding it or it's not really
 

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.350
kind of guiding it or it's not really
guiding the airplane well in that case

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360
guiding the airplane well in that case
 

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.760
guiding the airplane well in that case
guiding the airplane but here is guiding

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:56.770
guiding the airplane but here is guiding
 

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.770
guiding the airplane but here is guiding
the user like it's saying the thing that

00:23:58.770 --> 00:23:58.780
the user like it's saying the thing that
 

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:00.510
the user like it's saying the thing that
will load will be here it's almost like

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520
will load will be here it's almost like
 

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.760
will load will be here it's almost like
the helipad okay yeah obviously it's not

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:02.770
the helipad okay yeah obviously it's not
 

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.260
the helipad okay yeah obviously it's not
always possible to do this but you know

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:04.270
always possible to do this but you know
 

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.940
always possible to do this but you know
where you can we have the extra

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:05.950
where you can we have the extra
 

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:07.860
where you can we have the extra
information it's definitely a nice

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:07.870
information it's definitely a nice
 

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:12.720
information it's definitely a nice
enhancement seems like Nicky's joined

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:12.730
enhancement seems like Nicky's joined
 

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.490
enhancement seems like Nicky's joined
again that right back there is there is

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500
again that right back there is there is
 

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:21.360
again that right back there is there is
so that and then this place for example

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:21.370
so that and then this place for example
 

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.280
so that and then this place for example
we really like it's the pinterest

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:23.290
we really like it's the pinterest
 

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.440
we really like it's the pinterest
application and I'm actually not sure

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:25.450
application and I'm actually not sure
 

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.000
application and I'm actually not sure
exactly what they're doing it looks like

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.010
exactly what they're doing it looks like
 

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.100
exactly what they're doing it looks like
some sort of I guess average of the

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:29.110
some sort of I guess average of the
 

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.770
some sort of I guess average of the
colors in the in the final image to load

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:31.780
colors in the in the final image to load
 

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.230
colors in the in the final image to load
or something along those lines anyway

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240
or something along those lines anyway
 

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.870
or something along those lines anyway
but not only do they show the sort of

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880
but not only do they show the sort of
 

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.280
but not only do they show the sort of
dimensions of the image here in the

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:38.290
dimensions of the image here in the
 

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.870
dimensions of the image here in the
placeholder but they also approximate

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880
placeholder but they also approximate
 

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.220
placeholder but they also approximate
the color of the image that's going to

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:41.230
the color of the image that's going to
 

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.800
the color of the image that's going to
eventually load so again was kind of

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:43.810
eventually load so again was kind of
 

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.110
eventually load so again was kind of
hard to get these screenshots and you'll

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120
hard to get these screenshots and you'll
 

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.490
hard to get these screenshots and you'll
see the scroll is a little offset from

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:47.500
see the scroll is a little offset from
 

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.380
see the scroll is a little offset from
each other but you can see here that the

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:49.390
each other but you can see here that the
 

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.960
each other but you can see here that the
image is sort of roughly match up across

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:51.970
image is sort of roughly match up across
 

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.420
image is sort of roughly match up across
these two screenshots oops yeah it's

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:54.430
these two screenshots oops yeah it's
 

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.310
these two screenshots oops yeah it's
great I mean like all this is one extra

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320
great I mean like all this is one extra
 

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.780
great I mean like all this is one extra
database field right just one extra

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:57.790
database field right just one extra
 

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.030
database field right just one extra
database field that's computer that you

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:00.040
database field that's computer that you
 

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.550
database field that's computer that you
know at on the server side it just says

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:02.560
know at on the server side it just says
 

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.230
know at on the server side it just says
you know take the image maybe average

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240
you know take the image maybe average
 

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.180
you know take the image maybe average
the pixels in some way and and store

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.190
the pixels in some way and and store
 

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.430
the pixels in some way and and store
that hex color in this database row and

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440
that hex color in this database row and
 

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.860
that hex color in this database row and
you know with that you get this massive

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:10.870
you know with that you get this massive
 

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.350
you know with that you get this massive
improvement in the experience okay and

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360
improvement in the experience okay and
 

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:19.900
improvement in the experience okay and
Nick is gone again this taken all right

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:19.910
Nick is gone again this taken all right
 

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.550
Nick is gone again this taken all right
we'll just keep moving on and hopefully

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:21.560
we'll just keep moving on and hopefully
 

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:26.830
we'll just keep moving on and hopefully
you can join us again so the next topic

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840
you can join us again so the next topic
 

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.910
you can join us again so the next topic
is full screen galleries so you know the

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:30.920
is full screen galleries so you know the
 

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.260
is full screen galleries so you know the
biggest advice here is you should really

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:32.270
biggest advice here is you should really
 

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.720
biggest advice here is you should really
be using a lights-out mode which and

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:34.730
be using a lights-out mode which and
 

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.510
be using a lights-out mode which and
then hiding the system UI any sort of

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520
then hiding the system UI any sort of
 

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.430
then hiding the system UI any sort of
app you are you may have and the action

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440
app you are you may have and the action
 

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.740

that's engaged in sort of one of two

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.030
that's engaged in sort of one of two
 

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.570
that's engaged in sort of one of two
ways not only tapping anywhere on the

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:46.580
ways not only tapping anywhere on the
 

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.910
ways not only tapping anywhere on the
screen will will sort of engage

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:48.920
screen will will sort of engage
 

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.620
screen will will sort of engage
lights-out mode and then tapping again

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:50.630
lights-out mode and then tapping again
 

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.680
lights-out mode and then tapping again
will bring back all of the chrome and

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:53.690
will bring back all of the chrome and
 

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.510
will bring back all of the chrome and
then normally there's a timeout of some

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520
then normally there's a timeout of some
 

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.100
then normally there's a timeout of some
sort as well like maybe three four or

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:57.110
sort as well like maybe three four or
 

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:59.710
sort as well like maybe three four or
five seconds of inactivity of the user

00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720
five seconds of inactivity of the user
 

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.360
five seconds of inactivity of the user
not touching anything and the chrome

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:01.370
not touching anything and the chrome
 

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.940
not touching anything and the chrome
also just fade-out lights out lights out

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:03.950
also just fade-out lights out lights out
 

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:07.750
also just fade-out lights out lights out
mode will be engaged the other thing you

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760
mode will be engaged the other thing you
 

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.100
mode will be engaged the other thing you
should always make sure to do is support

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:09.110
should always make sure to do is support
 

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.260
should always make sure to do is support
the standard gestures so pinch open and

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:11.270
the standard gestures so pinch open and
 

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.550
the standard gestures so pinch open and
close to zoom in and out

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:14.560
close to zoom in and out
 

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.400
close to zoom in and out
keep moving boobs Nick yeah I think cuz

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:18.410
keep moving boobs Nick yeah I think cuz
 

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.650
keep moving boobs Nick yeah I think cuz
we're running late yeah that's what

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:20.660
we're running late yeah that's what
 

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.730
we're running late yeah that's what
happens when we do shows live yeah yeah

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:24.740
happens when we do shows live yeah yeah
 

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.220
happens when we do shows live yeah yeah
and then double touching to zoom in and

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:27.230
and then double touching to zoom in and
 

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.070
and then double touching to zoom in and
zoom out again you should always use the

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080
zoom out again you should always use the
 

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.320
zoom out again you should always use the
standard sort of paging physics as well

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:32.330
standard sort of paging physics as well
 

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.870
standard sort of paging physics as well
as the standard over scroll glow that

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880
as the standard over scroll glow that
 

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.300
as the standard over scroll glow that
appears when you reach the edge of a

appears when you reach the edge of a
 

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.370
appears when you reach the edge of a
gallery and then I guess on the

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:39.380
gallery and then I guess on the
 

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.050
gallery and then I guess on the
development side that normally means

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:41.060
development side that normally means
 

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.090
development side that normally means
just using the standard view pager class

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:43.100
just using the standard view pager class
 

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.210
just using the standard view pager class

really in this particular case touch

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200
really in this particular case touch
 

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.720
really in this particular case touch
feedback is not really required simply

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:01.730
feedback is not really required simply
 

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:03.700
feedback is not really required simply
because the entire screen is really the

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:03.710
because the entire screen is really the
 

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.680
because the entire screen is really the
touch target it does really make sense

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:05.690
touch target it does really make sense
 

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.290
touch target it does really make sense
to highlight the entire screen and also

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:08.300
to highlight the entire screen and also
 

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.330
to highlight the entire screen and also
the the UI really responds will respond

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:10.340
the the UI really responds will respond
 

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.130
the the UI really responds will respond
instantly to the users touch anyway

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:12.140
instantly to the users touch anyway
 

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.260
instantly to the users touch anyway
because the you know the the lights out

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:14.270
because the you know the the lights out
 

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.220
because the you know the the lights out
will be engaged and disengaged

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:15.230
will be engaged and disengaged
 

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:20.410

don't implement that kind of the pinch

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:24.470
don't implement that kind of the pinch
 

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.440
don't implement that kind of the pinch
physics right so like things like when

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:26.450
physics right so like things like when
 

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:28.240
physics right so like things like when

standard libraries like for any of you
 

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:34.600
standard libraries like for any of you
because they do it all right

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:34.610
because they do it all right

we talk about graphs I'll share a piece

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:41.660
we talk about graphs I'll share a piece
 

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.000
we talk about graphs I'll share a piece
of sample code that actually helps to do

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.010
of sample code that actually helps to do
 

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:47.350
of sample code that actually helps to do
that at all a quick very quick sample of

quickly mention is transition animations

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:26.860
quickly mention is transition animations
 

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.250
quickly mention is transition animations
so this is an example from tumblr and if

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:30.260
so this is an example from tumblr and if
 

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.590
so this is an example from tumblr and if
you're viewing a posts in screen on the

you're viewing a posts in screen on the
 

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.090
you're viewing a posts in screen on the
left and then you tap on one of the

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:34.100
left and then you tap on one of the
 

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.400
left and then you tap on one of the
images that image will actually zoom out

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:36.410
images that image will actually zoom out
 

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.710
images that image will actually zoom out
to be full screen and then when you tap

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720
to be full screen and then when you tap
 

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.500
to be full screen and then when you tap
it actually zooms back again and this is

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:41.510
it actually zooms back again and this is
 

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.970
it actually zooms back again and this is
quite nicely you're not sort of breaking

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:42.980
quite nicely you're not sort of breaking

activities but between different views
 

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.330
activities but between different views
for the developers out there there's

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:13.340
for the developers out there there's
 

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.680
for the developers out there there's
actually a training class developer

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:14.690
actually a training class developer
 

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:17.230
actually a training class developer
danger comm slash training one of the

training classes on animation
specifically shows you how to do these

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:20.810
specifically shows you how to do these
 

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:23.640
specifically shows you how to do these
kind of zoom zoom ups and zoom outs

alright alright so I think we were super

00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679
alright alright so I think we were super
 

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:31.260
alright alright so I think we were super
low on time so I'm going to quickly just

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:31.270
low on time so I'm going to quickly just
 

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:33.810
low on time so I'm going to quickly just
jump into a bonus topic which is graphs

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:33.820
jump into a bonus topic which is graphs
 

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.330
jump into a bonus topic which is graphs
so graphs aren't really you know images

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:36.340
so graphs aren't really you know images
 

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.460
so graphs aren't really you know images
they're really more interactive images

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:38.470
they're really more interactive images
 

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:40.200
they're really more interactive images
if you will but we wanted to show a

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:40.210
if you will but we wanted to show a
 

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.690
if you will but we wanted to show a
couple of quick examples of graphs done

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:42.700
couple of quick examples of graphs done
 

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.820
couple of quick examples of graphs done
right the first first I want to mention

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:44.830
right the first first I want to mention
 

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.290
right the first first I want to mention
that in general you know these are going

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:46.300
that in general you know these are going
 

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.730
that in general you know these are going
to be interactive graphs so it's almost

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:47.740
to be interactive graphs so it's almost
 

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.820
to be interactive graphs so it's almost
like an interactive image so I think the

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:50.830
like an interactive image so I think the
 

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.590
like an interactive image so I think the
anytime you look at interactivity or

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600
anytime you look at interactivity or
 

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.730
anytime you look at interactivity or
zooming or anything like that

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:53.740
zooming or anything like that
 

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.919
zooming or anything like that
the gallery app the system gallery app

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:55.929
the gallery app the system gallery app
 

00:29:55.929 --> 00:29:57.990
the gallery app the system gallery app
is generally a very good example that so

00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000
is generally a very good example that so
 

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.760
is generally a very good example that so
you see you know multiple fingers going

00:29:59.760 --> 00:29:59.770
you see you know multiple fingers going
 

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.450
you see you know multiple fingers going
on double-touch works and so on so I

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:03.460
on double-touch works and so on so I
 

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.680
on double-touch works and so on so I
just want to show a couple quick

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:04.690
just want to show a couple quick
 

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:09.210
just want to show a couple quick
examples of graphs and use as you can't

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:09.220
examples of graphs and use as you can't
 

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.880
examples of graphs and use as you can't
see that so the first is this

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:10.890
see that so the first is this
 

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:14.160
see that so the first is this
interactive chart demo and this is

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:14.170
interactive chart demo and this is
 

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.500
interactive chart demo and this is
available as a in the Android training

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:16.510
available as a in the Android training
 

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.650
available as a in the Android training
classes so here you'll notice that you

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:19.660
classes so here you'll notice that you
 

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.240
classes so here you'll notice that you
know you could do the same thing you can

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:21.250
know you could do the same thing you can
 

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.510
know you could do the same thing you can
with a full screen photo view you could

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:24.520
with a full screen photo view you could
 

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.810
with a full screen photo view you could
zoom you can double touch to zoom in and

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:27.820
zoom you can double touch to zoom in and
 

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.100
zoom you can double touch to zoom in and
then the other nice thing is that you

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:29.110
then the other nice thing is that you
 

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.990
then the other nice thing is that you
get edge effects right so if you're

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000
get edge effects right so if you're
 

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.150
get edge effects right so if you're
looking to do something like a graph or

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:33.160
looking to do something like a graph or
 

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.430
looking to do something like a graph or
basically an interactive information

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440
basically an interactive information
 

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.400
basically an interactive information
based image of some kind this is kind of

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:38.410
based image of some kind this is kind of
 

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.110
based image of some kind this is kind of
a good starting point another quick

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.120
a good starting point another quick
 

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.230
a good starting point another quick
example is the quotes app and we've

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.240
example is the quotes app and we've
 

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.490
example is the quotes app and we've
covered this one before it's by a

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:44.500
covered this one before it's by a
 

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.860
covered this one before it's by a
developer Michael Pardo I think there's

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:46.870
developer Michael Pardo I think there's
 

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.060
developer Michael Pardo I think there's
the publisher name is slightly different

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:48.070
the publisher name is slightly different
 

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.070
the publisher name is slightly different
but if you look at one of the graphs

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080
but if you look at one of the graphs
 

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.390
but if you look at one of the graphs
they actually do things a little

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:51.400
they actually do things a little
 

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.110
they actually do things a little
differently they have this kind of this

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120
differently they have this kind of this
 

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.580
differently they have this kind of this
zoom bar or whatever you want to call it

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:56.590
zoom bar or whatever you want to call it
 

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:57.720
zoom bar or whatever you want to call it
I guess and they have these little

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:57.730
I guess and they have these little
 

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.730
I guess and they have these little
handles you'll notice that these handles

handles you'll notice that these handles
 

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.350

should probably facing the opposite
direction but it is still kind of cool

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:09.730
direction but it is still kind of cool
 

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.460

know specific the specific values of
 

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.419
know specific the specific values of
those points so again those are just two

00:31:18.419 --> 00:31:18.429
those points so again those are just two
