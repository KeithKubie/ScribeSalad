00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.080
Hey there!

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.799
My name is Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course
Theater and Last time, we looked at how the

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:17.110
liturgical drama—specifically a call-and-response
section smuggled into the Easter liturgy—helped

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.460
bring theater back to the West.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.310
Today we’ll look at another way theater
got snuck back into the Christian world.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.850
Who did the sneaking?

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.030
A canoness!

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.070
What is a canoness?

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.330
It’s a fancy kind of nun!

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.150
Not often known for their sneaking, right?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.660
All those surprising sneaks took place in
an abbey, in an otherwise unremarkable spot

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.870
in Lower Saxony, Germany.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.960
You can still visit it today, if you want!

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.970
Enjoy the half-timbered houses, and if you’re
old enough, raise a beer stein to Hrotsvitha,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.770
the Loud Cry of Gandersheim—the queen of
medieval closet drama and the world’s first

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.770
female playwright.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.140
Well, the first we know about, anyway.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.670
I hear there was lots of sneaking!

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.650
INTRO
Hrotsvitha was born in Saxony around the 10th

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.650
century.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.170
We don’t know how she came to take the veil,
because record-keeping wasn’t really medieval

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.170
Saxony’s jam.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.700
We do know Hrotsvitha’s name literally means
“strong honor,” ... but she decided it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.650
meant something more like “the clarion call”
or “the loud cry.”

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.880
- which I mean, hey, all of these?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.650
Very STRONG CONTENDERS if you ask me.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.670
At some point, She joined the convent at Gandersheim
as a canoness, giving her the freedom to own

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.090
property, keep servants and wear whatever
kind of wimple she wanted.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.080
Yeah, it’s good to be the canoness.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.320
She studied under two women at the convent,
including the abbess, and became exceptionally

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.320
well-read.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.500
Moreover, she read diversely—the Bible,
sure, and the writings of the church fathers

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.370
and the noncanonical gospels, but also contemporary
histories and secular Latin greats, too, like

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.810
Ovid and Virgil.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.590
She even read our old friends Plautus and
Terence.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.709
But those comedies were a little troubling
for Hrotsvitha—so much lewd behavior—so

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.200
… she decided to write her own versions!

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.560
We’re going to talk about those in two shakes
of a saxon sheeps tail.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.560
In addition to plays, she also wrote verse
legends and histories–one about Otto I,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.510
the Holy Roman Emperor, and another about
her own convent–all of them in careful meter.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.569
She’s the first playwright of the Middle
Ages and if later woodcuts are anything to

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.410
go by, her taste in wimples was, in fact …. divine.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.950
Hrotsvitha’s plays are known as the Comaedia
Sacrae, or Sacred Comedies.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.630
Hrotsvitha loved comedy.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.480
I mean, she loved God, too, of course.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.160
But she also loved Terence, who you may remember
was a more polite writer than his contemporary

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.980
Plautus—fewer dirty jokes, less adultery.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.410
But still based on secular subjects, and that
made Hrotsvitha worry that her love for them

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.960
was somehow harmful to her faith and the faith
of others.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.569
She wrote in a preface that she knew a lot
of Catholics were “attracted by the polished

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:12.460
elegance of the style of pagan writers”—so
attracted that they might prefer Terence to

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.830
holy scripture.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.239
This is maybe selling short how much weird
violence and sex stuff persists in holy scripture,

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.360
but ok, that’s weird violence and sex stuff
that’s IN a holy text so point taken I guess?

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.409
.
Hrotsvitha warned that readers who were charmed

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:32.970
by polished pagan elegance, risked “being
corrupted by the wickedness of the matter.”

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.190
So she thought, “Hey, maybe I’ll use my
loud cry to write plays in the meter and style

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.190
of Terence.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.950
Maybe they can be funny.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.800
But also holy!”

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.230
We believe in you, Hrotsvitha!

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.560
Care to guess what theme might interest a
nun who has made herself a bride of Christ?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.230
That’s right.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.230
Chastity!

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.440
If Terence is going to write about “the
shameless acts of licentious women”, Hrotsvitha

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.180
is going to write about virgins, and also
~unchaste ladies~ who repent and embrace chastity.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.879
Basically: it’s just a little bit of medieval
slut shaming...

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.230
It’s clear that love and sex fascinate Hrotsvitha.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.500
In her preface, she blushes to admit her work
has forced her to think about “the dreadful

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:23.150
frenzy of those possessed by unlawful love,
and the insidious sweetness of passion—things

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.270
which should not even be named among us.”

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.720
Sister, please!

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.729
But she argues that only by coming to grips
with lust can she demonstrate how much more

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.249
wonderful “the divine succor” is of those
who resist it.

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.780
Whether or not Hrotsvitha’s works were performed
has been the subject of debate.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.330
Most scholars believe that Hrotsvitha wrote
her plays to be read, a genre we call closet

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.419
dramas.

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.449
After all, that’s how she encountered Terence’s
plays—in book form, not on stage.

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:56.389
It’s probable that her work was read aloud,
and remotely possible that it was performed

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.490
privately in the Medieval period.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.599
But since the late 19th-century, her plays
have been performed pretty often.

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.909
At one point the art collective the Guerrilla
Girls–who are rad as heck and if you don’t

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.849
know them, Sarah did an awesome Art Assignment
video on them–they offered a prize to any

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.470
theater who would switch out a Greek tragedy
written by a man for one of Hrotsvitha’s

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.470
comedies.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.699
One of those comedies is called Dulcitius.

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:27.279
Critics regard this as her funniest play,
even though it … describes the martyrdom

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:28.839
of three young women.

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:30.930
And yet: kind of a knee-slapper.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.740
Dulcitius is based on, and named after, an
historical figure: the Roman governor of Macedonia

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.289
in the late third and early fourth century,
known for persecuting Christian women.

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:47.289
And the young women in the play are actual
Christian martyrs, though IRL they died a

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.400
century before Dulcitius came to power.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.570
So Hrotsvitha has taken some liberties.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.369
Take us there, Thoughtbubble:
Emperor Diocletian wants to arrange marriages

00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:02.999
for three Virgin sisters: Agape, whose name
means love, Irena, whose name means peace

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.669
and Chionia, whose name means snow, which
basically means purity… but don’t worry

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:07.669
it’s about to get dark and rather randy.

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.039
Diocletian tells the sisters they have to
renounce Christianity.

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:15.629
They don’t wanna, so he locks them up and
sends Dulcitius to question them.

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:20.169
Dulcitius sees them through a window, decides
they’re all super hot, and asks them to

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.599
be locked up in the kitchen so that he can,
um, “visit” them.

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:29.069
Why he needed to assault them in a kitchen,
specifically?

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:30.069
Unclear.

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.960
The sisters understandably don’t want to
be perved on by Dulcitius, so they pray.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.699
And their prayers work.

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.669
When Dulcitius enters the kitchen, he thinks
that the pots and pans are the sisters.

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.639
So he starts hugging and kissing them, which
covers him in soot.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.659
When he leaves, the soldiers see his blackened
face and think he’s a demon.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.080
And so do the people at the palace.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.969
And I mean… in a sense, they’re not wrong?

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:56.709
He gets the snot beat out of him.

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:57.709
It’s not funny, but also because of how
pervy he is: it is funny.

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:58.709
Dulcitius goes home and finally realizes what
has happened.

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:01.539
Fuming, he orders the sisters be stripped.

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.369
But their clothes stick to them.

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:08.789
Diocletian sends the torturer Sisinnius who
orders Agape and Chionia to be burned at the

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:09.789
stake.

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:15.520
They die, though miraculously their clothes
and bodies are left intact.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.050
Sisinnius then orders Irena, the youngest,
to convert.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.590
She won’t, so he tells the soldiers to take
her to a brothel.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.069
Instead, she’s miraculously spirited away
to a mountaintop.

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:34.289
Sisinnius orders the soldiers to shoot her
with arrows, and she dies, but she dies secure

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:36.800
in her chastity and her faith.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.099
Thank you, Thoughtbubble.

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:39.099
So.

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:40.099
See what I mean?

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:41.349
It is a LAUGH RIOT!

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:47.709
Ok, it’s no What About Bob, but for a medieval
Christian, this is at least a happy ending.

00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:52.779
The three sisters all end up dead, but the
souls of Agape and Chionia are in heaven,

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:58.089
and as Irena is dying, she says, “I shall
receive the martyr’s palm and the crown

00:07:58.089 --> 00:08:04.599
of virginity; thus I will enter the heavenly
bridal chamber of the eternal King, Whose

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:08.029
is all honor and glory in all eternity.”

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:13.479
Listen, that’s at least half as funny as
like… a third of all SNL sketches.

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:17.889
ANYWAY - you could argue that the crown of
virginity isn’t worth dying over but because

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:22.770
the sisters haven’t been forced to compromise
their bodies or their beliefs, they will receive

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.139
eternal life.

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:27.419
For Hrotsvitha, and her audience, that’s
sweeter than anything.

00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:31.330
And it’s definitely sweeter than being raped
by a soot-smudged Roman dolt.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.000
It’s worth noting that this emphasis on
chastity suggests it was one of a very few

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.560
ways women could wield power in the middle
ages.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.810
But this is likely more of a concern for present-day
readers than for Hrotsvitha herself.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:48.480
And before we end today, we’re going to
look at one other medieval female playwright,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.480
Hildegarde of Bingen.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.820
Hildegarde, was born about a century and a
half after Hrotsvitha and also had a killer

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.759
nickname: “the Sibyl of the Rhine.”

00:08:57.759 --> 00:08:59.210
She was more than just a writer.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:04.180
She was also a composer, a philosopher, a
mystic and a scientist who took time off to

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.800
found and run a couple of monasteries.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.610
She also made up her own language.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.870
Basically, Hildegarde was a boss.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.810
One of her plays is the catchily titled Ordo
Virtutum, which is Latin for “The Order

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:18.810
of Virtues.”

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:24.720
It’s the only liturgical drama that survives
alongside its music, which Hildegarde also

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720
composed.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.720
It’s LOVELY!

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.720
Here’s a quick listen.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.259
[PAUSE]
The Order of Virtues is the first surviving

00:09:29.259 --> 00:09:34.589
example of the medieval morality play, a genre
we’ll look at more in depth in the next

00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:35.589
episode.

00:09:35.589 --> 00:09:40.199
It’s an allegorical drama in which Anima,
the human soul, has to choose between the

00:09:40.199 --> 00:09:42.060
Virtues and the Devil.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.079
Guess which side Hildegarde is on?

00:09:44.079 --> 00:09:46.080
Yeah, it’s kind of a no-brainer for Anima,
too.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.240
But the Virtues tell her that she has to go
live in a body first.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:58.829
Once she does, the Devil shows her how much
fun worldly stuff is; only later, old and

00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:03.820
thoroughly repentant about all that worldly
pleasure, is she allowed to return to the

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.820
Virtues.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:11.839
Who, by the way, are Hope, Chastity, Innocence,
Contempt of the World, Celestial Love, Modesty,

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:19.029
Mercy, Victory, Discretion, Patience, Knowledge
of God, Charity, Fear of God, Obedience, Faith,

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:22.050
and Discipline, though her name is scratched
out in the manuscript.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.040
But yeah, either way, big cast.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.769
Very tidy green room, though.

00:10:26.769 --> 00:10:28.060
Super lowkey wrap party.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:32.820
As we saw in the last episode, the usual explanation
for theater re-emerging in the West is through

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.370
the appearance of liturgical drama.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:40.430
But in the same century, a loud cry is heard
across Lower Saxony!

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.170
And a century and a half later, Hildegarde
answers the call!

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:49.070
Hrotsvitha and Hildegard of Bingen’s works
have a firmly Christian worldview and intention;

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:55.410
they create female characters with the power
and patience and faith to make brave, chaste

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.410
choices.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.889
So a round of applause for them.

00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:03.000
Next time, we take a look at the cycle plays,
which is what liturgical drama turns into

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.550
over a couple centuries.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:12:06.949
But until then… curtain!
