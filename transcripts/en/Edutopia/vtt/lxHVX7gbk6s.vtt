00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:07.376
&gt;&gt;Melanie: So today was really
about doing a wash-down of the room.

00:00:07.696 --> 00:00:09.496
We got everything out,
so now we washed it.

00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:13.016
We then went back with Steve and had
him reevaluate some of the storage.

00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:18.136
So looks like these are your cabinets
and storage unit out on the ground.

00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:20.956
&gt;&gt;Steve: That is, it looks
like my classroom threw up.

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:23.636
&gt;&gt;Melanie: It does look
like a little indigestion.

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:24.716
&gt;&gt;Steve: A little bit.

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:27.506
&gt;&gt;Melanie: So we're playing a little
game I like to call "Toss or Keep."

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:30.866
And we'll look at,
you know, first use.

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:34.046
Have you used it in the last
year, and was it useful for you?

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:38.286
If you haven't used it in
the last year, I'd toss it.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.676
&gt;&gt;Scott: We've got like the
ELMO station right here.

00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:43.296
My name is Scott Dorley,
I'm the Creative Director

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:44.416
at the Stanford D School.

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:47.136
And I do a lot of different
things, but one thing I work

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:50.556
on quite a bit is how to create
environments that open people up,

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.716
enhance creative collaboration,

00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:55.506
and help people share
learning experiences

00:00:55.506 --> 00:00:56.636
so they can teach each other.

00:00:56.636 --> 00:00:59.986
We're doing a few different
things in Steven's classroom

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:01.706
to enhance peer-to-peer learning.

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:05.526
One is to create these studio
situations in the corners,

00:01:05.526 --> 00:01:08.046
so that students have whiteboard
space that they can work on

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:10.216
and they can move over to
the corner of the classroom

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:11.656
and start working as a team.

00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:15.316
One other thing we're trying to do in
the classroom is create a situation

00:01:15.316 --> 00:01:18.796
where Steve can move throughout
the classroom much more easily,

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:22.356
so we're trying to create avenues
for Steve to navigate the classroom,

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:26.326
and inject into student
projects and student learning.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:30.276
&gt;&gt;Melanie: Carly and I went out
on the road and got some paint.

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:34.126
We ran into a painter who
said, "I love helping schools.

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:35.496
I live just down the street."

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:39.226
And so we just drove here to get drop
cloths, paint rollers, everything.

00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:39.976
That's perfect!

00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:49.036
&gt;&gt;Melanie: You can do it!

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:49.103
&gt;&gt;Carly: Yay!

00:01:49.103 --> 00:01:49.716
&gt;&gt;Scott: You got colors.

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:50.956
&gt;&gt;Melanie: We got colors.

00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:54.406
First coat of base paint is up.

00:01:55.026 --> 00:01:57.606
Trim is being painted.

00:01:57.606 --> 00:02:01.086
And hopefully that will all be
dried and set for tomorrow for us

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:02.466
to do additional detail work.

00:02:07.246 --> 00:02:10.586
&gt;&gt;Christian: We've come
incredible distances.

00:02:10.716 --> 00:02:13.706
Last night we closed up
here really at midnight.

00:02:13.856 --> 00:02:18.306
We kind of left pretty heavy,
and came in this morning,

00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:21.126
the light was here,
everybody started showing up.

00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:23.426
These bright cans of
paint started to open.

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:25.426
This room got full of
color, got full of life.

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:27.446
And we've got kids that
have been painting.

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:30.406
We've got incredible
volunteers been coming up.

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:34.716
We've got this unbelievable
construction crew that's just taken

00:02:34.716 --> 00:02:36.286
over and taken all of
our early drawings,

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:37.776
and they're bringing them to life.

00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:38.846
Everything's come together.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.136
We're incredibly close to done.

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:53.936
This is the first time
it feels absolutely

00:02:53.936 --> 00:02:54.706
that it's going to be done.

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:55.946
I know when we'll be cleaning.

00:02:56.206 --> 00:02:57.486
And I know we'll be locking the door.

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:59.166
This is for real.

00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:14.906
&gt;&gt;Melanie: It's 11:37, which
means we have 23 minutes

00:03:14.906 --> 00:03:16.026
and the doors will lock.

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:20.316
I'm feeling pretty amazed at
how much we got accomplished

00:03:20.986 --> 00:03:23.356
in such a short, short
period of time.

00:03:23.526 --> 00:03:26.176
There are a few projects that
will be something that the kids

00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:29.886
and Mr. Matise will have to
do once school gets back.
