00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.558
The answer is 22,339 days. The way that we would figure this out, is that we

00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:09.886
would open up Bluejay, and we would go into this days alive printer, and start

00:00:09.886 --> 00:00:14.586
editing it. And the main method right here, we would first create a variable

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:21.312
birthday. Initialize to Sally Ride's Birthday, and another variable, Last Day,

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:27.250
initialized to Sally Ride's Last Day. Then we do the calculation and put that

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.205
in another variable. Here you can see that the daysAlive is an int. And then we

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:38.725
print out the result. Which is in daysAlive. I compiled, and I got no syntax

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:45.413
errors, so let's try running this thing. I go to the daysAlive printer, run the

00:00:45.413 --> 00:00:52.775
main method, and I get my answer, 22,281. That doesn't match what I got before,

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:58.655
one second. Looks like there was a bug. This shouldn't be May 26th, it should

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:06.797
be July 23rd. Let's compile this again. Close it. Try running our main method

00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:13.943
again. And this time we got the answer I expected, 22,339.
