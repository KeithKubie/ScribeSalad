00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:02.049
- [Instructor] We've
already done multiple videos

00:00:02.049 --> 00:00:04.041
on the crusades but what
we're going to focus on

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:07.374
in this video is how the
crusades help catalyze

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:10.122
the start of what many historians consider

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:14.620
to be the first international
financial institution

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.503
and that is the Knights Templar.

00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:21.217
So let's just make sure we have
a good hold on the context.

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:23.390
So over here we have our timeline.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.700
It's occurring during
the high middle ages.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.688
In other videos we saw
the first crusades start

00:00:28.688 --> 00:00:32.099
at the end of the 11th
century, started really

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.189
by Pope Urban the second
with the purported reason

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:38.710
to help the Byzantines take land

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.150
from the Muslims,
especially the Holy Land.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.668
The first crusade is for
the most part successful

00:00:45.668 --> 00:00:48.671
but they don't return that
land to the Byzantines.

00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:51.340
They set up what are
known as Crusader States

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.327
or Crusader Kingdoms including
the Kingdom of Jerusalem

00:00:55.327 --> 00:00:59.236
and just to read this
timeline that I drew up here,

00:00:59.236 --> 00:01:02.025
green shows a time period when at least

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:05.168
Jerusalem is controlled by the Muslims.

00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:08.232
Red shows when Jerusalem is controlled

00:01:08.232 --> 00:01:11.280
by Western European powers or by these

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.355
Crusader Kingdoms which were
essentially Western European.

00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:18.434
These red parts on our timeline show

00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:21.480
when the actual crusades occurred.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.573
So you see the first crusade
causes the change of control

00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:28.092
of Jerusalem from the Muslims to

00:01:28.092 --> 00:01:31.007
the Western European Christians

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.241
and once Jerusalem was under their control

00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:35.248
and it would continue to
be under their control

00:01:35.248 --> 00:01:37.979
for roughly 90 years, you could imagine

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.462
that many pilgrims from
Europe went to the holy sites

00:01:42.462 --> 00:01:45.916
in the Holy Land especially in Jerusalem,

00:01:45.916 --> 00:01:48.375
but this was not an easy journey.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.473
Not only was it a long
journey, these are the paths

00:01:51.473 --> 00:01:54.159
that I showed in previous
videos that the crusaders took,

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.593
but this could also be the paths

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:59.108
that many of the pilgrims
took in order to go to

00:01:59.108 --> 00:02:01.857
the Holy Land and you
could imagine a journey

00:02:01.857 --> 00:02:05.175
of this distance going
through multiple kingdoms

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:09.162
in this time period could
be incredibly dangerous

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:12.090
and many of the pilgrims
actually were robbed

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.173
or sometimes worse on
their way to the Holy Land.

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:20.421
So in 1119 a small group of Knights

00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:22.421
led by Hughes de Payens,

00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:28.270
they go to King Baldwin the
second, King of Jerusalem.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.066
Remember they set up this crusader state,

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.615
the Kingdom of Jerusalem headquartered

00:02:32.615 --> 00:02:36.193
on the temple mount and these
knights tell King Baldwin

00:02:36.193 --> 00:02:39.332
the second and Warmund,
or Patriarch Warmund

00:02:39.332 --> 00:02:41.778
the Patriarch of Jerusalem, they say

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:43.813
we would like to protect these pilgrims

00:02:43.813 --> 00:02:46.140
on their way to Jerusalem.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.764
These guys think it is a good idea

00:02:48.764 --> 00:02:52.387
and so in 1120 they give them some space,

00:02:52.387 --> 00:02:54.833
a headquarters on the temple mount

00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:57.333
in order to start their group.

00:02:58.923 --> 00:03:01.882
If you translate the Latin
version of their name

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:05.820
it translates to Poor
Fellow-Soldiers of Christ

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.568
and the Temple of Solomon.

00:03:08.568 --> 00:03:12.567
Now the reason why it says
and the Temple of Solomon

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:15.375
is because they were
headquartered on the temple mount

00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:18.529
and the Al-Aqsa Mosque is believed by many

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:22.453
to be on the site of the
original Temple of Solomon,

00:03:22.453 --> 00:03:27.268
but this is often shortened
to the Knights Templar.

00:03:27.268 --> 00:03:30.947
This is their symbol, two
knights riding on a horse

00:03:30.947 --> 00:03:35.371
to show their poverty, but
they don't stay poor for long.

00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:38.872
They are shortly thereafter
recognized by the Pope

00:03:38.872 --> 00:03:43.081
and many people start
donating money to this order.

00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:47.219
Many more people volunteer
to be Knights Templar

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.373
and so over the remainder of the crusades

00:03:50.373 --> 00:03:54.540
they become an important
institution in Medieval Europe.

00:03:59.293 --> 00:04:02.626
Now most folks often
associate the Knights Templar

00:04:02.626 --> 00:04:03.862
with being Knights.

00:04:03.862 --> 00:04:07.374
You can see here one of
the Knights on horseback.

00:04:07.374 --> 00:04:10.300
Here you see the Knights
protecting pilgrims

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.591
on their way to Jerusalem
and they did do that.

00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:15.485
They did protect the pilgrims
and they were also active

00:04:15.485 --> 00:04:18.979
in battle during the crusades thereafter,

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.889
but it turns out that even
though on the peak there were

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.814
on the order of 20,000 Knights Templar,

00:04:24.814 --> 00:04:28.584
only about 10% of them
were actual soldiers,

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:30.893
were actually these warrior monks

00:04:30.893 --> 00:04:32.649
as they're sometimes called.

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:35.412
The rest of the Templars
created this fairly significant

00:04:35.412 --> 00:04:38.125
complex infrastructure
to do multiple things

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:41.979
to support the goal of the Knights Templar

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.603
and perhaps most
significantly they developed

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:49.878
a sprawling financial
enterprise of the time.

00:04:49.878 --> 00:04:53.308
If you were in London and
you wanted to do a pilgrimage

00:04:53.308 --> 00:04:55.908
to the Holy Land you would need resources

00:04:55.908 --> 00:04:59.013
in order to do that and you
would want to have access

00:04:59.013 --> 00:05:02.052
to your wealth once you got to Jerusalem

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.921
and so you could imagine
if you were traveling

00:05:03.921 --> 00:05:06.441
over a long journey to
take gold coins with you,

00:05:06.441 --> 00:05:07.562
not only would they be heavy

00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:09.399
but more importantly
it would be dangerous.

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:12.585
A lot of people might want
to take that gold from you

00:05:12.585 --> 00:05:15.884
and so one of the services
that the Knights Templar

00:05:15.884 --> 00:05:20.517
developed was that you
could go to their temple

00:05:20.517 --> 00:05:23.912
in London essentially deposit your money,

00:05:23.912 --> 00:05:26.235
they'll give you a note
of credit saying that,

00:05:26.235 --> 00:05:28.936
we the Knights owe you a
certain amount of money,

00:05:28.936 --> 00:05:30.543
and then you make your journey

00:05:30.543 --> 00:05:34.007
and when you get to Jerusalem
you can give that note

00:05:34.007 --> 00:05:38.038
to the Knights there and they
will give you your money.

00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:40.590
Now this is something that
we take for granted today.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.768
I can go to an ATM machine
anywhere in the world

00:05:42.768 --> 00:05:45.465
and for the most part I
can put in my ATM card

00:05:45.465 --> 00:05:48.701
and get access to money, but there's a lot

00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:50.993
of infrastructure that makes that happen.

00:05:50.993 --> 00:05:54.309
Today we have telecommunications,
we have satellites

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:56.194
that help information go back and forth,

00:05:56.194 --> 00:05:59.834
we have servers that keep
track of all of that data.

00:05:59.834 --> 00:06:01.721
They didn't have that in the middle ages

00:06:01.721 --> 00:06:04.850
and so you can imagine this
is a very powerful idea

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.693
that I could deposit money one place

00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:10.506
and then I could withdraw
it someplace else

00:06:10.506 --> 00:06:12.822
and we still don't fully understand

00:06:12.822 --> 00:06:15.472
how the knights were
able to pull this off.

00:06:15.472 --> 00:06:17.910
It requires a lot of trust
and how were they able

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.152
to authenticate the notes of
credit at any of these points?

00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:25.272
Not only did they do this type of deposit

00:06:25.272 --> 00:06:27.707
and withdrawal in multiple locations,

00:06:27.707 --> 00:06:30.278
they also because they
had all of these deposits

00:06:30.278 --> 00:06:32.586
and people were also
donating money to them

00:06:32.586 --> 00:06:34.114
just to support their cause,

00:06:34.114 --> 00:06:36.308
they were able to provide loans.

00:06:36.308 --> 00:06:38.047
Often times loans to very powerful

00:06:38.047 --> 00:06:41.450
individuals like kings and nobility.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.815
They were often brokers
in major transactions.

00:06:44.815 --> 00:06:47.364
This is the reason why
historians really do consider

00:06:47.364 --> 00:06:51.281
them perhaps the first
true international bank.

00:06:52.617 --> 00:06:56.729
In other videos we talk
about how in 1187 Saladin

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.927
is able to retake Jerusalem
but then in the Sixth Crusade

00:06:59.927 --> 00:07:02.999
and the Barons' Crusades it
goes back to Christian hands

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:06.266
but then 1244 it's retaken
again by the Muslims

00:07:06.266 --> 00:07:08.314
and it stays under Muslim
control all the way

00:07:08.314 --> 00:07:10.785
until the end of World War One

00:07:10.785 --> 00:07:14.621
and so with Jerusalem taken
in 1244 the whole goal

00:07:14.621 --> 00:07:17.238
of the Knights Templar, the whole purpose

00:07:17.238 --> 00:07:20.200
of their existence starts
to become less important.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.443
Although at this point
they are a significant

00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:25.385
and influential financial institution.

00:07:25.385 --> 00:07:28.132
As we go to the end of the 13th century

00:07:28.132 --> 00:07:31.171
the whole crusader mentality
starts to lose steam.

00:07:31.171 --> 00:07:33.268
You have the Eighth and Ninth Crusades

00:07:33.268 --> 00:07:36.242
but they aren't successful
and as we get into the early

00:07:36.242 --> 00:07:40.409
14th century you have this
character Philip the Fourth,

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:46.515
King of France and he has
incurred a lot of debt

00:07:46.515 --> 00:07:50.058
in order to have wars
especially with England

00:07:50.058 --> 00:07:51.732
and a good bit of this financing

00:07:51.732 --> 00:07:54.479
comes from the Knights Templar.

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:56.966
He is a powerful man looking for solutions

00:07:56.966 --> 00:08:00.542
to his debt situation and
he realizes one solution

00:08:00.542 --> 00:08:02.708
is maybe just to arrest the people

00:08:02.708 --> 00:08:05.261
who you owe money to and then not only

00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:06.819
do you not owe any money to them,

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.608
but you can seize their assets

00:08:08.608 --> 00:08:11.714
and Philip the fourth does exactly that.

00:08:11.714 --> 00:08:14.797
Famously on a Friday the 13th in 1307

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:21.142
he arrests many Knights Templars
including the Grand Master,

00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:26.553
the leader of the Knights
Templar, Jacques de Molay.

00:08:26.553 --> 00:08:27.692
He tortures them.

00:08:27.692 --> 00:08:30.227
They eventually confess
to a whole bunch of things

00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:32.537
but then they retract that confession

00:08:32.537 --> 00:08:35.511
and they're not willing
to retract the retraction

00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:36.678
and so in 1314

00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:41.934
Jacques de Molay as well as

00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:45.071
other Knights Templar,
especially in the leadership,

00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:48.127
who do not agree to those
confessions are burned

00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:51.816
at the stake in Paris
and this is considered

00:08:51.816 --> 00:08:54.352
the end of the Knights Templar

00:08:54.352 --> 00:08:56.447
although there are many legends of how

00:08:56.447 --> 00:09:00.281
they have continued on perhaps in secrecy.

00:09:00.281 --> 00:09:03.259
So the Knights Templar are to this day

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:05.681
are a subject of fascination.

00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:08.005
There's many legends associated with them,

00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:10.651
but one of their biggest
historical contributions

00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:13.759
that isn't often talked
about but we know happened,

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:16.652
is that they really laid
the foundation for what

00:09:16.652 --> 00:09:20.569
we today consider modern
international banking.
