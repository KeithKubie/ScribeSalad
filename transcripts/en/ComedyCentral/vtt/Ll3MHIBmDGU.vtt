00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.236
(compressing)

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:05.305
- My girlfriend Katie
came in from Maine,

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.875
so great to spend some
quality time with her.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.477
- Hi, my name is Katie.

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:13.046
- I know we're still young but,

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:17.350 align:start size:97% position:3%
I get the feeling that
Katie, she might be the one.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.222
(laughter)

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:24.858 align:start size:84% position:16%
Tyree made me really
uncomfortable,

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.826 align:start size:84% position:16%
the way he was looking
at me and Katie.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.830
Something in his eyes
that kinda scared me,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.999
and it wasn't appropriate.

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.839
(laughter)

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.877
- Just a couple minutes bro.

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.648 align:start size:94% position:6%
- And then there was that
one night in my room.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.254
(hip-hop beat)

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:02.729
- Hey, get your ass
up, I need that bed.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.498 align:start size:94% position:6%
I got company, my man
Lysol fresh out the joint.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:06.766
- [Lysol] Yeah.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:07.600
- Hello Lysol.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.802
- [Lysol] Sup.

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:12.138 align:start size:88% position:13%
- No problem Tyree,

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.542
- [Lysol] No, nah nah

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.811
- You know what Chad,
I'm gonna stay here.

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.848
Lysol and Tyree, they're
just genuinely nice guys.

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.216
- What you waitin' for man,
get your fat ass outta here

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:25.852 align:start size:84% position:16%
'fore I cut some
bacon off your back.

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:27.153
(laughter)

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.288
- Can we stop the tape?

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.958 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Tyree] Yeah, we gonna
send that back to the joint,

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:35.161
she don't know how we livin'
out here, you know what I mean?

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:39.199 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I saw Katie with
Tyree and Lysol

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:42.435
and, um, I worked
my way through it.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:47.207
- [Tyree] Yeah, do your
thing there, doggy, yeah.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.975
(crying)
(laughing)

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:51.177
- Yo, would you hold it down?

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.480 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're trying to
make love over here.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.582
(laughter)

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:59.385 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's good to be alone for a
minute in the confession room.

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.455
Niggas is wildin'.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.691
(chanting)

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.129
- I remember that we
were all joking around

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.132 align:start size:81% position:19%
and Tron got me
in a sleeper hold.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.668
(cheering)

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.513
I don't think he
meant to hurt me,

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:31.384 align:start position:0%
but I'll be honest I don't
remember a whole lot after that.

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:34.053
(sizzling)

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:36.322
(cheering)

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:45.198 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Tyree] We goin' to take
Chad upstairs and tuck him in.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.168
- Oh okay, that's nice yeah.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:50.036
- Be careful if you
get a sleeper hold,

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:53.206
because the next day your
anus will really hurt.

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:55.441
(laughter)

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.982
You know, I'll admit
it, when my dad came by

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.651
I was a little bit concerned.

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:08.388 align:start size:97% position:3%
Hey guys, I'd like to
introduce you all to my dad.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.991
- I brought some brownies.

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:13.092
- They got weed in 'em?

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:16.095
(laughter)

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.697
- I felt bad for that white boy,

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.133
but his daddy shouldn'ta
looked at her like that,

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.401
so you know.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.635
- 'Cause I don't like
how you looked at me,

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.137
why you gotta look
at me like that?

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:26.139
- Zondra, I apologize, I don't
know how I'm looking at you.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:26.973
- [Zondra] Like that.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.508
- Like what?

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:30.777
- Oh look, look he doin' it.
- [Dad] I'll look over here.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.011
- Don't look at me.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.279
- He don't know how
to talk to people.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.681 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Why you gotta be
lookin' at me white man?

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:36.783 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'm not looking at
anyone, if someone could...

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.953
(laughter)

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:43.489
I've been stabbed.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.024
- Blah, blah blah.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:48.728
- Zondra, I've been stabbed,
and I don't know what I did.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.364 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You came in a house with
six wild, that's what you did.

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.198
(laughter)

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:53.633
I, I'm bleeding.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.935 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Chad] Hey guys, what's
going on out there?

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:58.171
(laughter)
