00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.340
-So thank you, very
much for being here

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.800
and I'd really like to
obviously thank the Radcliffe

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.240
Institute for all that
they've done to facilitate

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.640
this strange adventure.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.559
And in particular, I'd like
to welcome those of you who

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:25.100
are from disciplines
other than mine,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.099
because I don't think
anybody from my discipline

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.630
is here which is fine.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.130
People in my discipline don't
usually do this sort of thing,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.680
and only a place
like the Radcliffe

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.000
can you expand your wings a bit
and try something different.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.980
This exploration-- which
is really at the beginning,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.200
we start in September,
and because it's

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.000
a late start this year
we've been at this

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.520
less than two months.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.070
--is outside, but
overlapping my direct area

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.160
of work and research.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.180
But, I did run a trial
balloon and ran it

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.440
by some others in
related fields.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.550
We did an exploratory
seminar about a year ago,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.960
and Radcliffe came to the
rescue to keep this idea going

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.020
to see what would come of it.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.446
I was surprised and gratified
to get this fellowship.

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:12.820
I'd like to give special thanks
to the Bradley family who

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.590
helped make this possible.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.659
And also, to say
that I was glad when

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.450
I was looking into the
Radcliffe fellowship

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.480
to look at a promotional video
for the Radcliffe Institute

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.070
and I saw a professor
Faust saying,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.310
not all these
projects go anywhere.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.160
So I felt relieved
that I would not

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.290
be totally on the hook to
actually necessarily make

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.720
it be a success, because
that's what exploration is,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.790
that's what exploration
is in science,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.180
and that's also what
exploration is in medicine.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.180
So what I hope to cover in
this talk are three themes,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.150
and I'm going to warn
you ahead of time,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.280
there are mixed metaphors.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.487
You're going to be
swimming in metaphors

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.070
and I hope you can
keep them straight,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.470
because I struggle
with it myself.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.500
There are many,
many, disciplines

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.430
upon which we will touch in this
exploration and in this talk,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.350
and I will tell you
upfront most of them

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.090
I know almost nothing about.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.860
So there may be those of
you who came to this talk

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.480
seeing it publicized,
and knowing

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.900
quite a bit about
the disciplines

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.211
that I'm going to be
skating on the surface of,

00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:17.710
and you're going
to say to yourself,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.460
she doesn't know what
she's talking about,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.900
and I'm telling you
right now, you're right.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.340
So what I would ask you
is, contribute, talk to me

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.650
afterwards, be part of this.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.710
If you think that the
idea has any worth,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.960
and even if you think the
idea doesn't have any worth,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.334
I'd still like
your contribution,

00:02:35.334 --> 00:02:38.360
because as a scientist you don't
want to have a theory that you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.070
then find evidence to support.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.490
You want to have a question,
which you then find evidence

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.901
to refute, or direct
further inquiry.

00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:47.650
There are three specific
things that we're

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.080
trying to accomplish this
year in this project,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.020
and I put the picture "books"
there, because in fact it's

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.820
all book research.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.130
People said, are you going to
put patients in an MRI scanner?

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.130
You're going to be put
deep brain electrodes in?

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.410
And no, we're basically
reading, and thinking,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.780
and asking questions,
and your input truly

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.230
is welcome any of you.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.810
My goal for this talk is modest.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.350
I hope that by the
end, you at least

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.433
know what the title means.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.210
So each of us brings
to our efforts

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.460
in life, our background.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.890
And I will say, that I
think the single thing that

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.940
has pushed this into
my effort sphere,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.880
has been a tendency that I
didn't know the word for,

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.440
until I started this project,
and the word is Biophilia,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.310
and I have it bad.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.230
This is a picture I took
hiking, two weeks ago on one

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.510
of those beautiful fall
days, and my whole life

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.930
has been spent
wallowing in Biophilia.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.450
And most of you maybe
have heard this term,

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.940
it was popularized here at
Harvard by Professor Wilson.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.320
It was actually coined by
the psychologist Erich Fromm,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.330
and it's the idea that we
inherently, genetically,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.480
have an affinity for things
that are natural and alive.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.770
And I'm not 100% convinced
that we know that this

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.170
is inherent in our genes.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.329
There's some suggestive
evidence that's quite good.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.730
But I also think it
may be imprinting,

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.060
and I sometimes think that
like little ducks following

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.320
Konrad Lorenz around
here, I imprinted on trees

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.350
and for that reason this
condition is the part

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.644
of my life for a long time.

00:04:31.644 --> 00:04:34.060
Now there's another thing I've
learned since starting down

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.390
this exploratory
pathway, which is

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.540
there's a flip side of
Biophilia and there's

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.090
a term for it which
I didn't know,

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.250
this is where Radcliffe
comes in useful,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.400
it's called eco-depression
and it almost

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.930
sounds like a joke,
Eco-depression.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.070
But in fact there is a study of
this topic of eco-depression,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.770
and I can tell you
that once I started

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.520
reading about this I
can say unequivocally,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.980
I suffer from this in a big way.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.500
Every time that I
see a forest that

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.040
used to be where I
grew up, now plowed

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.610
down to make another housing
development or strip mall.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.220
Every time I fly over the
United States and I look down,

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.280
and it's not being as far as
the eye can see but cultivated

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.190
land, I think of the fox
and what's that mother fox--

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.960
where are they going to go-- and
I have a nurse practitioner who

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.610
is southern, and she
taught me the expression,

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.030
it hurts my soul, and
that's how it feels.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.965
And I bet some of you who are,
are here because you feel some

00:05:31.965 --> 00:05:34.210
similarly.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.460
Since college, I was
in college at Brown

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.280
in the '70s it was liberal
era, and we were really

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.210
worried about overpopulation.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.500
And I still worry
about overpopulation.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.260
I worry about this
when I'm in crowds,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.280
when I travel around the
world and I see crowds,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.330
and you think what has
happened to all these people,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.390
and it's still going on.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.650
And when you see the effects
of what humans have done

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.210
and they can be very
emotion-grabbing effects,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.230
like the ones you see at
the bottom of the slide.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.230
So that's what we
call eco-depression.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.570
So that's the substrate on
which this project arose.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.230
And we're really going
to be pulling together,

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.140
attempting to pull
together threads

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.330
from many different sources.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.880
We may end up at the bottom
on the right, a big mess,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.510
and nothing may
come that's useful.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.580
We're looking to see if we
can find something that's

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.430
interesting, and maybe
even has utility,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.480
like you see on the left,
but it's still early.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.590
So we have three specific
aims for this year,

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.170
and thank heavens, the
Radcliffe Institute

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.690
lets you have research partners.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.400
So I have five brilliant
enthusiastic undergraduates,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.580
and I picked them for their
specialties, for their majors,

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.410
they're all upper
class students.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.782
And I have an environmental
psychology student,

00:06:54.782 --> 00:06:56.740
I have other psychology
students with interests

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.450
in public health, I have
basic neuroscience students,

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.000
I have environmental
science students,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.460
and people with
background in economics.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.350
So we have some
diversity on purpose

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.770
to try to have them be my-- as
we see in the immunology world,

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.650
effector arms-- go out
there, and to mix metaphors,

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.480
to go on safari and find
stuff and bring it back.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.940
So we're hoping
to write a thesis,

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.570
whether this becomes
a book or not, I'm

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.720
trying not to be too ambitious.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.835
We're designing an
interdisciplinary course

00:07:26.835 --> 00:07:29.360
to see if people are
interested in exploring this

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.280
across disciplines on
a more ongoing basis.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.510
And then the last thing
is also an ambitious part,

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.560
which I won't talk much
about, although anybody

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.809
that wants to talk more to
me about this I'd be happy.

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:44.510
To bring this back to my world
in neurosurgery in children,

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.550
to work towards an experimental
green children's hospital.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.360
Looking at whether the reward
system could be capitalized

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.270
upon to make work
even more rewarding,

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.280
because of the pro-social
aspect of this.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.860
So what are we
talking about here,

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.850
I just want to say thanks,
at this point for the trial

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.530
balloon that we put
out about a year ago,

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.870
when I got together
a few colleagues

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.740
in the clinical neurosciences.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.790
Alice Flaherty was
absolutely essential,

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.534
she's a brilliant
neurologists, and also has

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:15.700
an appointment in psychiatry,
and has written books,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.540
and was a Radcliffe fellow
which is kind of how I got here.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.460
And Zelime Elibol is a young,
ambitious, very bright, child

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.020
neurologist who
specializes in adolescence.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.140
And we came up with
this idea and we

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.460
want to put on a
seminar, and the person

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.100
who tipped the scales
for me was Dan Schrag

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.900
at the Harvard University
Center for The Environment, who

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.080
agree to sponsor this
exploratory effort.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.299
And we pulled together a variety
of willing, and incredibly

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.220
generous people from
different disciplines,

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.590
including environmental
science, behavioral economics,

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.845
neuroscience of various sorts,
psychology, and so forth.

00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:53.220
And we just got
together and went

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.960
through a series of questions
to explore, whether or not,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.590
this idea might have
teeth, as we say.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.151
And it was very, very, useful.

00:09:01.151 --> 00:09:03.150
So what are we talking
about with these threads,

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.649
and this metaphor, what we're
talking about pulling together

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:08.080
themes, and I'll elaborate
on this in a moment.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.010
And in addition we're
looking for data.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.890
So as a person
trained in science,

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.660
I don't want to
just have themes,

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.170
I want to see what data are
out there, that could support,

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.180
refute, or modify,
these ideas of how

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.460
things might be connected, this
is really about connections.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.850
So let's go on this journey
together, so Theme 1.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.580
Theme 1 is this,
there are big problems

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.290
beyond our daily
workplace, and maybe

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.480
they deserve our attention.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.794
And so you could argue that
this is a midlife crisis, this

00:09:39.794 --> 00:09:41.710
is Biophilia, why don't
you just quit your job

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.865
and go be an
environmental scientist.

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:45.060
And I will tell you that
about 15 years ago I

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.770
thought about that,
because I thought

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:51.170
that the environment was the
biggest problem facing us.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.820
I thought bar none, now we
might get hit by an asteroid,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.530
there might be a
pandemic, there might

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.860
be a nuclear annihilation,
but the one we can see,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.450
and the one that we
know about, is this one.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.460
And I actually went to the
head of environmental science

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.171
at Brown, and said, should I
change careers because I really

00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:10.670
think this is
important, and he said

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.120
no you should work
within your field.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.780
And that's sort of part
of the genesis of this.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.640
And here is my daily life, you
can see it, these are children.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.749
Here I am in surgery.

00:10:20.749 --> 00:10:22.290
These are children
with brain tumors,

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.400
with terrible traumas
to their brain,

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.070
with epilepsy, with
areas of the brain that

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.560
are causing abnormal
electrical activity that's

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.870
disabling the child, and happens
to be intersected perfectly

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.620
with the child
dominant hand cortex.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.240
These are children
with tumors that

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.980
will cause their death, if
they're not removed, and will

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.570
cause paralysis if
not removed today.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.150
These are children with
congenital problems,

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.900
the child in the bottom
right has a malformed skull

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.187
that needs to be taken apart
and put back together safely,

00:10:51.187 --> 00:10:52.270
without harming the brain.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:56.690
And this is what my day
consist of, and my life.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:59.370
And it's very easy
to get narrow,

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:04.010
and to get very caught up in
it, and to be quite satisfied,

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.900
but I was nagged because of
this disease of Biophilia

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.090
and eco-depression,
that there may

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.465
be something else to be done.

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:15.590
And I think the thing that
tipped the scales for me

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.230
was this particular article,
now those of you who

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.160
are in environmental science
are the true scientists,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.120
but then there are those
people who make this available

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.087
and bring it to the
attention of the public.

00:11:26.087 --> 00:11:28.170
This was an article not
in the scientific journal,

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.750
but it was in the Atlantic.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.315
It was part of a
millennial series

00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:34.000
that the Atlantic monthly
put out right around 2000,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.450
this came out in 1998,
they had a series of these,

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.920
of big ideas for the millennium.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.800
And Bill McKibben is one
of the most prominent

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.020
environmental writers
in the US today.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.450
And this was a three
part article, called

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.340
A Special Moment In History.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.170
And it changed the
way that I thought,

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.920
and I think it changed
my life trajectory.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.690
I kind of thought population was
the problem, and this article

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.060
whether those of you who
know more about this than I,

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.690
may disagree, so
I grant you that.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.500
But this was the
article that showed

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.820
that in historical
time, from 1750's

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.120
up to the current time
that this was written,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.720
there has been as we now know.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.710
But in 1998, I was
less aware of it,

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.130
I knew a little bit about
but it hadn't really sunk

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.450
in that this was my problem.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.500
And it shows this
dramatic change

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.349
in carbon in the atmosphere
due to different sources,

00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:30.140
and as for those of
you in the visual arts,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.059
I know a lot of my
fellow fellows are here,

00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:33.600
look at this beautiful
way of showing

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.680
this superimposed on that
eco-depressive smokestack

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.060
that lines up.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.370
Isn't that a beautiful way to
make you feel bad about it,

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.430
and effectively.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.850
In this graph, I've
changed this scale here,

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.030
so these are on the
same scale here.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.370
And this is global
carbon output,

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.080
carbon being the metric
we can study easily,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.320
and is the metric for
greenhouse gases in general,

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.610
although I recognize it's
not the whole problem.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.490
And this is the United
States, and you can just

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.760
see the difference between
where the whole world is,

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.420
and where the United States
is, this map of course

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.580
shows the high output countries
and we're right up there,

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.740
we're right up there
despite the fact

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.780
that our population
is much smaller.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.390
And the metaphor that Bill
McKibben in this article used,

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.190
that made a big impact on me,
was this one of the Macy's

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.220
Thanksgiving Day balloons.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.670
So he says that in the
United States, if you

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.350
talk about how much
carbon each of us

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.710
produces in our daily life,
through things we consume,

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.100
through the travel that
we do, through things that

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.600
are workplace,
through our houses,

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.170
and the heat that's wasted
through the food that we eat,

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:42.810
it gives us an amount.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.730
And we carry around an amount
like the biggest Macy's

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.030
Thanksgiving Day balloon,
whereas these places

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.820
with growing population
have much, much, smaller

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.660
kind of at the sidelines
on the parade balloons.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.870
And therefore, the point that
he made that made an effect on

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.400
is, this is us,
this is our problem,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.600
this is our responsibility,
which I had not really

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.730
felt prior to this.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.330
This the population
expected to grow over time,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.290
this is where the
United States is now,

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.150
these are the ones
that are up and coming,

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.830
and if those people
all live like we live,

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:20.830
we cannot stop that tie, is the
impression I came away with.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.387
So what are the fixes, well
technologic advances, carbon

00:14:24.387 --> 00:14:26.220
independent energy
sources, for those of you

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.220
who have not seen
it, this is a still

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.220
from the video that you
can get online that went

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.720
viral, called solar roads.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.100
People can complain whether
solar roads are practical,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.290
but it's a great video,
again it's a crowd sourcing

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:42.380
video, it's persuasive, although
those in the technical fields

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.730
have their criticisms of it.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.540
Geoengineering, many of you
know about this, many of you

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.490
are very interested in this,
some of you may do this.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.780
Population control
is critical, but I

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.330
don't need to tell anybody
here how difficult that is

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:00.340
and how many factors, economics,
religion, and other things

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.570
go into making that
difficult. And then there's

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.570
behavioral change, which we
think about, when we think

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.820
about it, about our own lives.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.520
Should I recycle, should I
do this, should I do that,

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.460
but if you really think about
it, all the things on that list

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.380
will involve behavioral change.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.140
It isn't just what
we individually do,

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.410
it's what we collectively value.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:24.760
And so, I think behavioral
change is a key ingredient that

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.700
cannot be ignored, whether
it's on the individual level,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.730
the societal level, or
the governmental level.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.890
This also came from
Bill McKibben's paper,

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.500
and at the time,
here was my reaction

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.320
which I've kept and was the
genesis for this project.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.200
And he says, one
would think offhand

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.600
that compared to changing the
number of children we bear,

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.970
changing consumption
patterns would be a breeze.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.000
Fertility, after all,
is biologic, hardwired,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.770
like Darwin said.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.310
But, he says in
his paper, I would

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.690
guess that is easier to change
fertility than lifestyle.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.660
And he concludes, based
on this population curve,

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.960
that we simply won't live
simply enough, soon enough,

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.010
to solve the problem.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:08.470
Talk about eco-depression,
nothing we can do about it.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.690
But at the time when
I read this in 1998

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.490
as a practicing neurosurgeon
who has an interest in behavior,

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.880
a background in
psychology, and interest

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.930
in those aspects
of neuro surgery

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.970
that have to do with
brain and behavior,

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.954
that didn't seem
surprising to me.

00:16:21.954 --> 00:16:23.620
And the reason it
didn't seem surprising

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.890
is that simplification is hard.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:31.000
And the reason simplification is
hard has to do with our brains.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.340
So that was theme one.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.400
This will pull together,
I hope, but now we're

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.320
going to move on to theme two,
which I'm calling our brains,

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:38.930
ourselves.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.470
For those of you who are old
enough, Our Bodies, Ourselves.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.130
We're in the right
place for that.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.250
So, here's the
principle, it's more fun

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.160
to get more than
to do with less.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.820
And another way
of saying that is,

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.770
that we'd like to get stuff.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.130
Now, when you illustrate
getting stuff,

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.080
you usually have women
with shopping bags,

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.630
but I have guys in a bike-shop.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.866
Because, in my family the
guys in the bike shop,

00:17:05.866 --> 00:17:07.990
spend as much as the women
with the shopping bags--

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.470
I'm being sexist
here, but I just

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.730
like to put guys jumping
on this picture--

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.050
And another way of saying
that is, it is more fun,

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:19.240
or you can say rewarding,
or you could say satisfying,

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.589
to get more, or to do more,
or to experience more,

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.140
than it is to simplify.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.524
And we know this
inherently, this

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:27.635
is a travel poster trying
to get you to travel,

00:17:27.635 --> 00:17:29.950
we love to travel,
get new experiences.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:34.330
This is a solitary
confinement, it's torture.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.370
And this is not
this is not made up,

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:40.530
this is explained by
how our brains work.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.600
So what do I need?

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.059
Our brains evolve for survival,
you all see those squirrels

00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:46.683
out there getting
those nuts right now,

00:17:46.683 --> 00:17:48.870
you step on those nuts
when you walking don't ya?

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.130
And, they're doing
it for a reason.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:55.530
Their brains and our brains have
this in common, early humans

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:58.810
had this in common, they stored
their fish, they had shelter,

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.220
this was survival.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.390
And people who are someone at
the extreme end of the belief

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.920
and behavior, and genetics,
write books like-- and get

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.790
these concepts across--
The Selfish Gene,

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.630
that says that our
bodies are basically

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.550
just the carriers for the
genes, which are really

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.420
the elements of importance,
and that we're just

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.130
carrying machines.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.290
Be that as it may, our
brains evolved for survival,

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.940
and some of the ways we
are, make perfect sense

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.630
from that point of view.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.260
And in order to accomplish
this, certain things

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.200
had to be rewarding.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.910
We needed to develop
a reward system, which

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:39.890
is present in virtually all
organisms, if you look for it

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.950
and think about it in that way.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.650
And in humans it's
exquisitely well developed

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.050
and it happens to be
at a time right now,

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.850
when this circuitry
and its interactions,

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:56.730
are being explosively
understood in new ways.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.740
And the reasons for that
is that the way we used

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.420
understand what does
what in the brain

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:03.000
is through lesions, accidental
or otherwise, some of you

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.739
have seen The Phineas Gage
exhibit here on the campus,

00:19:06.739 --> 00:19:09.030
and this was a tamping iron
that went through someone's

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.850
frontal lobe, and
changed his behavior,

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.869
and his reward system.

00:19:12.869 --> 00:19:15.160
Those were the kinds of clues
we used to have to go on,

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.870
to figure out
where things where,

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.400
and how they acted in the
brain; people with strokes,

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.080
people with tumors, people with
surgery, the kinds of things

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.580
I do.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.690
But now we have new tools to
see why this is rewarding,

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:31.480
and what happens, and why
this child so ecstatic

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.910
with figuring out that a
butterfly landed there and now

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.110
landed here.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:42.310
And it's being explored
at an increasing frequency

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.300
and sophistication,
by two techniques,

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.300
One is deep brain stimulation,
which was originally designed

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.260
to treat people with diseases.

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.770
And now even though people
have diseases that get these,

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.180
no people volunteer-- yeah,
I'll sign up for that study,

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.180
put a deep brain stimulator
in, just for fun.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.889
Using deep brain stimulation
in many different networks

00:20:00.889 --> 00:20:02.430
of the brain, for
various conditions,

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.750
has created enormous opportunity
to study how this system works.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.510
Functional MRI is
another type of study,

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:11.250
which also has
been revolutionized

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.740
in the last decade.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.019
It's task based,
sometimes you can do this,

00:20:15.019 --> 00:20:17.560
and this part of your brain will
change its blood flow enough

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.920
that a magnet can pick it up.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.190
There's resting state
fMRI, which picks up

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.510
what's connected to what.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.170
And now, my former
resident Kendall Lee

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.230
has figured out a way to do
deep brain stimulation in an MRI

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.140
scanner in a
magnetic environment,

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.260
it's kind of amazing using
carbon fibers and Bluetooth,

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.750
and figure out how to do
functional MRI and deep brain

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.230
stimulation at the same
time to actually see

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.490
how these networks
work, and are modulated.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.080
And it's really
quite extraordinary.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.170
So I'm not going to say that
I, or that the field knows

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.560
everything about
it, but what we know

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.540
is increasing in complexity
minute to minute.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.020
The problem is
perhaps as follows,

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.290
so our brains evolved with
this wonderful system,

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.420
but it doesn't
know when to stop.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:08.880
And so, now, you urges to
eat get you into trouble,

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.300
and your urges to get stuff
are getting the planet

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.900
into trouble, or both.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.980
And so, our brains
are still living

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.820
in some other era, when
this was not so problematic,

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.040
but it has become problematic.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.870
And what neuroscience
gives, in my mind,

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:32.020
is an arm's length
tool to not judge it,

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.910
to not say, you're a jerk for
having a house like that, don't

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.950
you know better than to eat
that, it's to hold it at arm's

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.630
length objectively,
and say, what

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.035
is it that makes good,
well intentioned,

00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:45.410
people who don't really want
to see the planet destroyed,

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:46.630
do this.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:52.250
What is it about our brains that
promotes this kind of behavior,

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.705
or makes it hard to change,
or hard to simplify.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.410
So as proof, what's more fun,
to look at the kind of car

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.180
you're going to get, pick out
the color, pick out the model,

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.890
or look at the gas mileage.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.995
And what's more fun,
to decorate your house,

00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:09.980
to get furniture
for that front porch

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.630
and think about what the
trim color is going to be,

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.630
or to put insulation
in your attic.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.330
So the reward system
for those behaviors,

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:21.520
that are increasing the
problem are just greater,

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.595
than those things that
tell you to contract,

00:22:23.595 --> 00:22:25.620
do-less be sensible.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.357
In many ways is the theory
that we're exploring.

00:22:28.357 --> 00:22:29.940
I'm not saying that
I know the answer,

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.890
I'm saying that
some of this seems

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.097
to be as one might
say common sense,

00:22:35.097 --> 00:22:36.930
but common sense from
a brain point of view.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.310
And what we've been exploring in
our project, my students and I,

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.030
is the evidence to support
or refute this idea.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.030
One interesting paradoxes
is that stuff doesn't even

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.820
make us happy.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.600
So, if you're starving, food
makes you happy of course,

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.229
if you're cold, a warm
sweater makes you happy.

00:22:54.229 --> 00:22:55.770
But there now are--
and many of these

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.564
came out of Harvard as well--
many happiness studies,

00:22:59.564 --> 00:23:00.980
there's a whole
field of happiness

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:05.260
that didn't exist when I was in
the beginning of my journeys.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.600
And it turns out that
relationships, and meaning

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.850
and experience, all make
you happier in the long term

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:15.520
then stuff, but stuff makes
you happy at the moment.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.390
And a former professor
of mine has come back

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.770
into my consciousness, and
I've been working with him

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.950
on this, neuroscientist
named Peter Sterling, who

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.580
study the visual system, but
also is interested in this,

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.250
and is his belief that evidence
suggested that the reward

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:34.350
system that we evolved with and
that we still have today, all

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:39.040
of us sitting here, is tuned to
small unexpected and variable

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:39.950
rewards.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.310
We're tuned because we evolved
at a time of relatively

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.070
consistent misery.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.580
We were pretty much always
hungry, and pretty much always

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.040
cold, and wet, and
physically uncomfortable.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.560
So the biggest rewards
come from a patch of sun,

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.200
that you stand in for
a minute, or 10 berries

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.790
that you find the wayside.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.350
And that his idea
is that the way

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:04.030
we live our lives,
our rewards, we

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.760
need more and more,
and more rewards.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.957
Because they're not like this
anymore, they're consistent,

00:24:08.957 --> 00:24:10.540
they're predictable,
and we need more,

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:11.664
and more, and more of them.

00:24:11.664 --> 00:24:13.590
It's his belief,
that this is part

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.990
of the explanation for
certain kinds of addiction,

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.010
and certain kinds of
alienation in modern life,

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.300
now I'm not saying I necessarily
I'm going to go all that way,

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.350
but it's an interesting theory.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.710
Now, I talked about rewards that
generally we think of as bad,

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.730
they're consumptive
rewards, we eat too much,

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:32.480
we have too much stuff,
our houses are to big,

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.160
our carbon footprint
is enormous.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.020
But, let's talk about
other kinds of rewards.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.470
Humans evolved to be
rewarded by new insights,

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.420
how many people have seen
a child with a puzzle?

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.830
With a new toy?
with a new playroom?

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.370
With-- and outside,
go and explore it.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:53.890
This is normal behavior from
rats, probably from paramecium,

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.350
all the way to human
children, and human children

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.830
in particular, are
rewarded by novelty.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.159
We take advantage of
this in the hospital.

00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:04.200
I know you would disagree,
many of you with this,

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.650
but kids actually
need a whole lot less

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.940
or no pain medicine
after procedures

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.190
if you give them a video game.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.807
I know, bad thing,
but you know what,

00:25:13.807 --> 00:25:15.390
in most children's
hospitals now, kids

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:17.120
get video games after surgery.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.560
Because they did much
less pain medication, why?

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.060
Because, novelty and stimulation
is extraordinarily rewarding,

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.780
and exploration
and puzzle solving.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.830
And, one of the wonderful
things about being at Radcliffe

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.600
is that you meet people from
all different disciplines,

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.700
and these are happen to be
three people I really admire,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.517
Esti Yeger-Lotem, and Karol
Armitage, and Phil Klein,

00:25:38.517 --> 00:25:41.100
all of who are on my floor, it's
kind of like being on a dorm,

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.900
you get to know them.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:47.410
And each of them has expressed
in talks that they've given,

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:52.180
that they love the problem
solving aspect of this,

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.010
and that solving a
problem, whether it's

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.590
3D spatial movement of
the physical bodies,

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:02.770
or whether it's
computational stuff,

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:07.340
is-- that I don't understand--
is really rewarding.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:11.790
And in fact, so rewarding,
that they call it beautiful,

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:16.740
they find beauty, in these
problems that they solve,

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.240
which tells you how
rewarding it really is.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.850
Now, I live in the
world of physicians,

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:26.840
and you know your colleagues,
you spend more time

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.110
with your colleagues
than your family,

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:33.000
my daughter's here so
she attest to that.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.090
What are doctors like?

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.100
I can tell you what
surgeons like, by in large

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.440
most of the surgeons I know.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.549
Let's leave out the
income part, and they

00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:42.090
like to have a good car, and
all that, let's leave that aside

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.670
for now because those
are sort of universal.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.086
But what the people
in my business

00:26:45.086 --> 00:26:47.870
really get a kick out
of is problem solving,

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:49.890
and they're reward by altruism.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.400
And I know myself if I'm honest.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.430
I get the biggest kick out
of doing a little extra work,

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.170
looking up a few other things,
making a few more phone calls,

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:02.140
doing a little bit of more
research, and being right,

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.920
and my residents didn't think
that was the right answer,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.020
and it was-- I love
that, I love that.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.987
So here we are operating
and solving a problem,

00:27:09.987 --> 00:27:11.320
and we're in the operating room.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.177
We're trying to figure out which
way to approach this child's

00:27:14.177 --> 00:27:16.510
brain lesion that needs to
come out, this is a big team,

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.310
this is all team efforts now.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.200
And it's so rewarding
to solve the problem

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.020
and have the child wake
up and not be paralyzed.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.690
And then when the parents
send you photographs,

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:30.170
fingers up, thumbs up, it is
so rewarding, is so rewarding,

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.970
how can you tear
yourself away from it.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.850
And now we can do fMRI's
of these kinds of rewards,

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.570
we can see them now, we
know where they live.

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.140
In they're part of the
same rewards network.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.360
So, doctors are--
at least my doctors

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.860
that I know-- are really
rewarded by problem solving,

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.010
and by altruism, and this is
part of our reward system.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:53.370
However, even this
can be overtaking.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:57.356
So, in 2007 I was chairman of
the ethics committee of one

00:27:57.356 --> 00:27:58.730
of our big national
organizations

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.313
of pediatric
neurosurgery, that happen

00:28:00.313 --> 00:28:01.990
because I missed
a meeting, so they

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.182
made me chairman of
the ethics committee.

00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:05.640
And I said, I'll
get you, I'm going

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.740
to do something as I'm chairman
of the ethics committee.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.420
And we're going to have a forum,
because this was globalization.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.660
There's a lot of interest
in international outreach,

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.196
with neurosurgery.

00:28:15.196 --> 00:28:16.570
On the other hand,
I had a mentor

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.420
who once said to all of
us when we were getting

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.360
a little big for our britches,
if all the neurosurgeons

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.984
in the world went up
in a puff of smoke

00:28:21.984 --> 00:28:25.480
tomorrow, the amount of human
suffering that would be changed

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.690
would be one drop
in the vast ocean.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.060
And that's true, neurosurgeons
are not so important,

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.560
despite what you hear.

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.686
And it kept a perspective
of mind, because he said,

00:28:34.686 --> 00:28:36.893
you know if you're really
going to make a difference,

00:28:36.893 --> 00:28:38.840
you're going to go
solve malnutrition

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.142
and infectious diseases, and
population, this what you do

00:28:43.142 --> 00:28:45.100
is not that important in
the scheme of things--

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.670
And I took to heart.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.920
But this was a survey that
I did as head of the ethics

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.470
committee, giving my
colleagues about 200

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:56.280
of us in the country, various
things to think about,

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.400
resource allocation,
should you do something

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.000
if somebody has to
pay out-of-pocket,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.200
should you do it if
the child probably

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.200
isn't gonna live even if
you help that suffering,

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.310
should you do it under
these circumstances.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.000
And here's what was
fascinating to me,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.950
they really believed that no
matter how hopeless it was,

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:16.140
they would be happy to help.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.120
This is a Likert scale, strongly
disagree, strongly agree,

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.080
this is number of responses.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.710
And they strongly
disagreed with the concept

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.680
that in a finite
resource situation

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.730
you can't help everybody
it's not justified,

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:32.710
they strongly
disagree with that.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.920
And I'm surprised
by this, I thought

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.475
that my colleagues
would have kind

00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:39.810
of a different view of
the big world pictures,

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.940
and they didn't,
because they actually

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.390
felt it was wrong to
think about this stuff.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:46.630
They said, it's not my shift
to think about resource

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.630
allocation, it's not my shift
to think about the planet,

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.172
it's my shift like a lawyer
taking care of a client,

00:29:52.172 --> 00:29:53.630
whether they're
guilty or not, it's

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.254
my shift to take care
of that suffering

00:29:55.254 --> 00:29:56.540
that I see in front of me.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.820
And I thought that
that was interesting,

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.340
it's how their brains work,
they're rewarded, by what,

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.060
problem solving, altruism.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.910
And this other stuff,
feeling like maybe we're

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.530
part of the problem,
because we spend

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.760
so much resources
on so few people,

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.660
is a conflict, so not my shift.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.935
I, on the other hand, still
felt like it was my shift,

00:30:17.935 --> 00:30:21.720
and I felt increasingly
distressed by the fact

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.600
that even in medicine,
which is 18 percent

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.800
of our gross domestic product.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.840
We have enormous waste, we
produce enormous carbon,

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.390
we do it and feel good about
it because it's helping people.

00:30:35.076 --> 00:30:37.450
One of the questions that was
asked when we did our trial

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.770
balloon last year at HUCE, at
the Center for the Environment

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.174
was this, just because
reward circuitry

00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:44.840
and the new understanding
of it, is neat

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.756
doesn't mean it's relevant
to these questions.

00:30:46.756 --> 00:30:49.420
And I think that's a
really valid question.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.554
Does neuroscience add value to
understanding these behaviors,

00:30:52.554 --> 00:30:53.970
just because I can
do a functional

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.620
MRI on the physician that
shows up their altruism center.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.894
Does this help us at all?

00:30:57.894 --> 00:31:00.060
Does it add any value to
what the psychologists, who

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.440
are very good at this and
looking at it carefully,

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.590
already do.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:06.350
And I think my answer
is, I don't know yet,

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:12.780
but I am intrigued by the
modulatability of the reward

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.960
system and all the inputs.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.940
An example that my students
and I have come up with

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.747
is the idea of
medieval cats-- now

00:31:19.747 --> 00:31:21.830
you're going to think I'm
crazy, she said threads,

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.640
but these are all
over the place.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.404
So, in the Middle
Ages, those of you

00:31:25.404 --> 00:31:27.070
who are Middle Ages
scholars, know this.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.010
Cats were considered
a sign of the devil,

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:30.680
that the devil
actually lived in cats.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.870
And so, in public squares,
there was a great glee

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.120
taken by rounding up
cats and torturing them,

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.310
burning them alive.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.220
And the more they
squealed and squawked,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.690
and writhe in agony,
the happier people were,

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:49.120
the more they thought the
devil was being squelched.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.810
You would probably, I
would say with confidence,

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.880
I think most of you
would be horrified.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.180
This would not
give you a reward.

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.080
That's your reward system
being modulated by context,

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.940
and there's a lot written about
that largely by psychologists.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.910
But, we are starting
to understand

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:08.120
how that modulation occurs,
because of these new insights

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.620
into how the reward system makes
these modulations possible.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:17.207
And it's an extraordinary, and
I will say beautiful, system.

00:32:17.207 --> 00:32:19.790
However, we also need to know,
does our individual consumption

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.090
matter, is it about what
we do individually or is

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.920
it mathematically
about the way we live,

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.750
or how corporations
work, and so forth.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.667
I would say that so far,
my students working on this

00:32:28.667 --> 00:32:30.250
have come up with
things that suggests

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.580
it's about half and half.

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.400
That it is our
individual behavior,

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.830
it's not like that
10% of the problem,

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:38.840
it's somewhere in the 40
to 60% of the range, what

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.840
we individually can control.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.240
And the rest of it we
would have to control

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.244
through political and other
means, to change big things.

00:32:46.244 --> 00:32:48.160
So how about the medical
field, that's the one

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.230
I live in, how about in
organizations like hospitals.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.734
So again, I'm not going to talk
a whole lot about that now,

00:32:53.734 --> 00:32:55.400
but I'd be happy to
talk to some of you,

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.280
I've been talking to people at
the school of public health.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.100
I will say that thinking
about brain and climate change

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.090
isn't new, I didn't know
others we're doing this

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:03.839
and that sort of
exploration is all about.

00:33:03.839 --> 00:33:05.440
The American
Psychological Association

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.410
had a task force on this,
but they were really focus

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:11.330
more on perception
of risk, and the fact

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.860
that it's a beautiful
day out today,

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.852
it's hard to perceive
that environmental decline

00:33:15.852 --> 00:33:17.060
and climate change is a risk.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.170
Like it is easy to perceive a
tiger about to pounce on you.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.150
And that also is the
way our brains evolved,

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:23.700
and how we perceived risk.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.200
There's something called the
Garrison Institute, some of you

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.550
may be familiar with, and
they have a climate mind

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:32.000
and behavior seminar, and this
is a quote from their program

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.920
rationale for this climate
minded behavior seminar,

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.250
their idea is that if we
apply a behavioral lens

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.790
to environmental
policy and regulation,

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:44.700
and taken into account the way
the human wiring has evolved,

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.324
it'll be more effect.

00:33:46.324 --> 00:33:48.490
So I would say knowing what
we know about the brain,

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.060
does this make sense, is our
wiring getting us into trouble?

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:56.970
If so, can it be modified,
and is it changing over time.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:59.765
So that's the set
up for theme three.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.170
All along the time that I've
been interested in this topic,

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:10.090
I've also been amazed at
how things are changing

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.219
for our young children.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:15.739
And when I started in my
practice 30 years ago,

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:18.409
a baby would be brought into
the office by its parents,

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:21.219
with a teething toy
and a stuffed animal.

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:22.969
And now the most common
thing that a baby

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:27.989
is brought into the office with,
even very young babies three,

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:30.280
four, five months
of age, is an iPad.

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.800
And at first when
they start happening

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.045
I was, sort of
bummed out about it,

00:34:39.045 --> 00:34:40.670
but it happen more,
and more, and more.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.684
And even if they
don't have an iPad,

00:34:41.684 --> 00:34:43.397
the parent, when the
baby starts to cry,

00:34:43.397 --> 00:34:45.730
will pull out the phone, and
put something on the phone.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:49.130
And you see, extraordinarily
young children knowing how

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.750
to swipe and point.

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.530
Now, the initial reaction of
those of us, who are my age,

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.300
is to think this is bad.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.160
But it isn't necessarily
bad, and that's

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.660
what neuroscience
does, it gives you

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.670
that arm's length, is
that modern life probably,

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:06.330
in my opinion, is going to
change our blank brains.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:10.800
And that's because plasticity
is so robust early in life,

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.860
this is one of the
things I do study,

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.920
some of my lab colleagues
are here today.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.180
And I study because it
happens in front of my eyes,

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.430
one of things about being a
neurosurgeon in pediatrics

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.180
is, it's a front row seat.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.020
This little boy had a 200 pound
tractor tire fall on his head,

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.300
and crush his head, and
had a severe brain injury.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.594
Here he is still comatose,
but his eyes are awake,

00:35:31.594 --> 00:35:33.760
he's in that form of comma
were your eyes are awake.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.020
And here the lights
have come back on,

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.728
his brother's is
fooling around with him.

00:35:36.728 --> 00:35:37.730
And here's the recovery.

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:40.730
This is what we see every
day, this is our currency.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:42.650
We count on this
and we observe it,

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:45.520
and I had never ever
got at least bit tired

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.730
of seeing the brain
recover in a child,

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:49.580
whether it's something
I did to that child,

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.820
or something mother
nature or accident did.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.190
And we study this
in my lab, we study

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.040
how you can injure an area,
there's an area of function

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.780
before, after an
injury goes away

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.530
and it starts to come
back somewhere else.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.670
And my colleague, Dr.
[? Costeen, ?] studies

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:07.860
how these cells try to
reorganize, new cells are made,

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.540
and at what age this occurs.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.390
But what I can tell you is,
all the evidence points to this

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:15.390
is really maximal,
early in life.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:17.672
And we know this, we know
this from anthropology.

00:36:17.672 --> 00:36:19.880
This slide on the left, came
from a colleague of mine

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.740
who's a pediatrician, and
a cultural anthropologist.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.690
Who showed me that toddlers,
in certain cultures,

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.540
can learn very early
to use dangerous

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.680
sharp implements
to cut open fruits,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.960
because they do, because
they practice it,

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.880
because they do, just
like Suzuki violin.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.410
You don't have a kid off
the street play the violin,

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.630
but you can because
of that plasticity,

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.690
and this is the same
kind of plasticity.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.490
And in fact, this new
plasticity is so appealing,

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:49.090
because it appeals
to so many things

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.840
in our attention getting
mechanisms and our reward

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.210
system, all at once that
it's like nothing in nature.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.270
And that's why this
violin doesn't have

00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:59.770
a chance, next to that iPad.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.880
And again, I'm not
saying it's evil or bad,

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.912
I'm just saying it
appeals to everything

00:37:04.912 --> 00:37:06.620
that we evolve to find
attention-getting,

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.800
and that's why it's so
appealing to children.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.220
So theme three is about
plasticity in modern life.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.385
Are our brains changing,
I think it's unequivocal

00:37:15.385 --> 00:37:18.870
that our brains are changing,
due to this kind of exposure.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.100
Is it good or bad, I'm
not here to say that.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.334
It maybe good and bad, it
may depend on the child,

00:37:23.334 --> 00:37:25.000
it may depend on many
things and I'm not

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.666
going to solve that problem, but
there are people working on it.

00:37:27.666 --> 00:37:30.070
But, I am curious about
whether it has implications

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.130
for consumption, if you are
stimulated to a high level,

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:36.230
we know your attention
system can't upregulate.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.990
Does it mean you
need more novelty,

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.185
does more novelty
translate to more stuff?

00:37:40.185 --> 00:37:41.530
Do you need more stuff?

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:42.765
Do you need more stimulation?

00:37:42.765 --> 00:37:44.140
Are there ways to
get stimulation

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.000
that don't require stuff?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.980
And I've had people
say, iPads are great,

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.880
because now you
could have one device

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.680
and the kid is
stimulated forever,

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.180
and you don't have to buy
any more stuff, that's

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.500
one argument, could be true.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.800
So then we'll start
to wrap this together,

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.230
is any of this relevant,
are any of these themes

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:07.245
relevant, how might using a
neurological science brain-lens

00:38:07.245 --> 00:38:09.300
be useful in changing
behavior, and these

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:13.310
are suggestions that other have
floated, people we've studied.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:15.830
There's a wonderful
writer, Per Stoknes,

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:19.722
who's a Swedish psychologist,
who has written an entire book,

00:38:19.722 --> 00:38:21.180
it's at the Harvard
bookstore, What

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.680
We Think About When
We're Trying Not

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.030
To Think About Global Warming.

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.340
His focus really
is on our reaction

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:30.280
to the idea of global warming,
not our daily behavior,

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:34.140
but his point is, you have to
frame the argument differently.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.900
So,-- what I think--
we've come up with,

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.660
and others have come up with,
and again we're early on, that

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.240
we can't depend on people doing
with less and simplifying,

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.270
that's not the way it works.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:47.940
But you can facilitate getting
select stuff, and the rewards

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.120
of experience, relationships,
and even the rewards of nature,

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.640
if you believe that Biophilia is
a real thing that we all have.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.800
And if you add stuff
in, with a bargain,

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.220
it's even more rewarding.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.877
So, Alice Flaherty who was
one of my collaborators

00:39:01.877 --> 00:39:03.460
on the beginning of
this project said,

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.490
I get my kicks for
shopping out at eBay,

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:08.360
I can get something for
$2, I get a good new thing

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.720
and I feel great about eco-side
of it because it's recycled.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.450
You know, that's
getting a reward,

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.750
and the reward
get double reward.

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:17.210
You can play into
socially rewards,

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:18.822
this is a lot of
what Stoknes says,

00:39:18.822 --> 00:39:21.030
you can change behavior
because the neighbors do it--

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.500
you all get your electricity
bill, or your oil bill

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:26.600
and it says your neighbors use
less or more, that turns out--

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:31.660
that stuff in the hotel, about
75% of people rooms like yours,

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.522
didn't through their
towels on the floor--

00:39:33.522 --> 00:39:35.480
that stuff turns out to
be quite effective when

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.500
the social scientists
have studied it.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.450
You can enhance community,
look at California

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:40.576
with the water savings.

00:39:40.576 --> 00:39:41.950
Nobody thought
that would happen,

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:43.410
but they're almost
in competition

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:45.400
with the next community
about who can do best.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.947
So these are the
kinds of rewards

00:39:46.947 --> 00:39:48.530
you're playing into
the reward system,

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:52.500
instead of telling
people, just do it less.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.500
You can appeal to Biophilia,
something positive to get,

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.860
that's a Stoknes idea, and also
it's very prevalent right now

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.110
in the movement
for green buildings

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.580
and Biophilic buildings.

00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:04.400
So, you get a
positive thing, plus

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.630
it turns out that, the
next bullet point down, you

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.120
can incentivize
health, economic,

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.620
and aesthetic benefits, because
it turns out green buildings

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.020
actually are better
for your health.

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.686
And the folks here
at the Harvard School

00:40:14.686 --> 00:40:16.970
of Public Health, whom I
been communicating with,

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.680
have shown that with definitive
data, which is a great thing.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.780
You can capitalize on the
reward system, quirks,

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.530
small, variable, unexpected,
how about if every,

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:31.750
5th to 10th electricity bill,
you get a bonus just for fun,

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:36.170
you probably push that
button like the rats do.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:38.290
Recognize the power of
contextual plasticity,

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:40.020
like the cat story.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.187
If the thing is
framed differently,

00:40:42.187 --> 00:40:44.020
the reward something,
that's very rewarding,

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.894
can be horrifying
and vice versa,

00:40:45.894 --> 00:40:47.310
that's our nervous
system at work,

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:49.880
it's because of all the
input from different parts

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.700
of our nervous
system that modulate

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.709
how the rewards are valued.

00:40:54.709 --> 00:40:56.250
And really the bottom
line that we're

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.470
learning, as we slog through
some of this really interesting

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:00.920
stuff, I don't
like the word slog,

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:04.650
as we have the opportunity
to expose ourselves

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:06.480
to this stuff-- there's
a lot of it, that's

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.160
where the word slog popped
through my unconscious--

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.890
is to do more research,
there's so much

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.190
that could be done
about plasticity.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:14.780
We're also interested
in adolescence,

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:18.125
this idea of the prolonged
adolescence, from 18 to 25

00:41:18.125 --> 00:41:19.400
that folks are studying.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.914
What about the consumptive
behavior at that time?

00:41:21.914 --> 00:41:24.330
And I'm interested bringing
this back to the medical field

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:27.850
to see if I can incentivize my
colleagues, as an experiment,

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:30.920
to add in sustainability
as an additional rewards

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.230
to that altruism
and problem-solving.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:37.050
Finally, I want to wrap up by
saying that, somebody said this

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:40.185
to me once, not knowing
that this is what I do,

00:41:40.185 --> 00:41:42.060
people do interdisciplinary
work because they

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.370
failed at their primary job.

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:49.330
But I would say, we evolved
to be different from one

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:52.610
another, that was a survival
technique, the mixing of genes,

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:55.160
the mixing of experience,
makes each of us unique,

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.570
and some people have brains
that like to connect dots,

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:59.510
and I would say
that's the way I have

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.390
worked throughout my career.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.390
I'm going to end
with this story.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:10.790
This little boy
had epilepsy, that

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.810
was from a disease
that is progressive.

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:15.540
And it's an interesting
disease, it's

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.560
called Rasmussen's Encephalitis,
and the only known cure

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.940
is to take out, or
disable half the brain.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.690
This, as luck would have
it, was on the dominant side

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:28.170
of his brain, such that
if we disabled that half

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:31.434
of his brain, he had a high
risk of losing speech forever,

00:42:31.434 --> 00:42:33.350
never be able to understand
or produce speech,

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.560
and he would become paralyzed
on his dominant side.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.080
So planning this survey, people
think surgery, neurosurgery,

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:40.190
is all about being
in the operating,

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.814
it's actually all
the planning, and all

00:42:41.814 --> 00:42:44.680
the counseling, and all the
thinking about alternatives,

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.410
making sure families
know what you're doing.

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:51.740
And, it took about a year
to get this boy ultimately

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.950
to the point where his
parents, and the boy himself,

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.480
wanted surgery for his
epilepsy, which was progressing,

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.630
and ultimately untreated would
have disabled him totally.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:04.660
So the parents went through
surgery, that period of time,

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.326
the hardest thing--
the minutes you

00:43:06.326 --> 00:43:07.700
lose of your life
in my business,

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.970
is the time you
finish the operation,

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:11.560
to the time the
patient wakes up,

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:15.050
and you find out if they can
still recognize their mother.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:17.680
That's where you
lose off your life,

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.640
and he did wake up and
recognize his mother,

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:23.080
he had to relearn to
speak, although he did.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.940
And mom sent me this
photograph of him,

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.250
climbing up to a rocky hiking
area, in New Hampshire,

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:34.120
and climbing to the top of
this observation fire tower.

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.920
And she liked this one, because
he was determined to do,

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.570
and two, because she likes this
picture because he was looking

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.285
out over his future--
into his future--

00:43:42.285 --> 00:43:44.399
it was symbolic to
her that he did this,

00:43:44.399 --> 00:43:46.690
and she took that photograph
and sent it to those of us

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.600
on the team.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.472
And I will say, that tweaks
your altruism reward, right?

00:43:52.472 --> 00:43:53.930
That's tweaks your
problem-solving.

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:56.430
We did a really
innovative thing to decide

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:58.454
what to do this child,
and this big team

00:43:58.454 --> 00:44:00.620
in the operating room,
trying to figure out and make

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.760
the right choices
as we were doing it.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.340
It got written up in the New
England Journal of Medicine,

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.950
it's very satisfying.

00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:12.040
And I could quit there, and we
could have the violins play,

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.646
and it would be a great
story, and you might even

00:44:14.646 --> 00:44:15.520
get out your Kleenex.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.870
but, I don't think
I'm done, I don't

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:22.710
think that's the future--
that's the only future that's

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:26.370
my responsibility, I think the
rest of the future out there,

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:31.010
of all the other kids is
also my responsibility.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:36.930
And I hope, that through this
exploration maybe our team,

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.850
and others like you, can
contribute a little bit

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:41.610
to connecting those dots.

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:43.460
So, thank you.
