00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.110
&gt;&gt; I would say that it would be the comparison where the shared

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.140
pieces of chromosomes are just these segments,

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.710
not the whole length of the chromosome?

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.650
&gt;&gt; That's right, Matt. Because you got a whole chromosome from each parent,

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.400
and therefore you should see sharing along the whole chromosome. But you and

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.070
your sibling got different pieces of

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.410
chromosome from parents, and therefore if you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.690
share anything, it's just going to be the segments, and not the whole thing.
