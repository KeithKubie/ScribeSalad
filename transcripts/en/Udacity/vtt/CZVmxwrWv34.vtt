Before we talk about specific drugs and their physiological, behavioral and

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.414
psychological effects. It's important to review some of the material that we

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:12.921
learned in lesson three, the Biology of Behavior. First, remember that the

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:17.956
central nervous system is comprised of the brain and the spinal cord. You

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:21.284
should also review the autonomic nervous system as many drugs effect both of

00:00:21.284 --> 00:00:27.010
these nervous systems as well as their functioning. In addition, review the

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.253
material on neurons, neurotransmission, neurotransmitters, and receptors. And

00:00:33.253 --> 00:00:36.466
then finally, be sure to look at the brain structures as well as the dopamine

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.090
reward pathway.
