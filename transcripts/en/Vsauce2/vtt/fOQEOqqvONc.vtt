00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.339
A Pacman-shaped ukelele, and heavy metal t-shirt.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:11.190
It's episode 13 of LÃ¼t.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.460
This is a ticking time bomb.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.930
The longer you wait, the more pieces will
wind up soggy- except, with the Obol, you

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.560
decide what pieces get wet, and when.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.820
And these wine glasses let you control wet
stuff, musically.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.330
The markings on the side tell you where to
fill for a specific note when running your

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.619
finger over the rim.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.270
Luna and Curious offer Bonny tights with a
hidden gun, and socks that make you look like

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.270
a duck.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.570
But, for you men, if you want to look classy
and upcycled, check out these ties.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.750
They're made out of wood from demolished barns.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.929
They're also a perfect companion to these
No-Wash underpants.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.870
The front's yellow, the back's brown.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.870
No worries.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.729
But if you do plan on practicing some hygiene,
do it in the dark with this glow-in-the-dark

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:56.260
toilet paper from Firebox.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.559
Now, if things get smelly but you want to
maintain manliness, use a Man Can.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.640
These candles smell like bacon, sawdust, new
york style pizza, a new leather baseball mitt,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.670
and more.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.700
Ok, the classic Coca-Cola bottle shape- please.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.700
I prefer the original Hutchinson can.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.840
As part of their 125th anniversary you can
own the bottle's entire history.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.359
Now, if you like heat and sweet, drizzle spicy,
chili pepper-infused Hot Honey on your pizza.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.340
They even say it goes well in tea.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.020
Stay fancy with Think Geek's science jewelry:
A pendant that is also a functioning sun dial,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.530
and this 8-bit hair bow.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.170
Then play a game of poker with some toast
playing cards, the Joker's are eaten and burnt.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.119
Japan Trend Shop also carries this desk desk
lamp suspended by its spill.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.770
Then, relax in this replica Big Lebowski "The
Dude" cardigan.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.520
The one used in the movie auctioned for more
than $10,000, but, now, the company that originally

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.409
made it is offering a replica for $188.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.259
You can wear it and lounge around listening
to your iPhone or iPod in a nice, loud gramophone

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.259
station.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.259
Not sticky enough?

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.830
Well, try out NeatoShop's phone stand that
looks like bubble gum, and be sure to use

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.210
the Kick To Pick app that balances on a pregnant
belly, cycles through possible baby names,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.610
and uses the phone's accelerometer to detect
baby kicks so that your baby can choose its

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.500
own name before it's even born.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.140
Transfer files with these fried shrimp USB
memory sticks, or a super-slim bookmark that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.140
is also a 2 GB flashdrive.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.760
Now it's time for something free: The font
that Coca-Cola is written in.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.950
It's just the way people used to be taught
how to do cursive back at the turn of the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.950
century.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.500
It's called Spencerian Handwriting, and it
was replaced later on by the Palmer Method

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.310
which, for instance, Mickey Mantle used.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.880
And, today, we learn the D'Nealian Method.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.820
But, anyway, what that means is that Coca-Cola
obviously owns the trademark to their brand

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.730
name, "Coca-Cola", but they don't own the
copyright on the specific script it's written

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.730
in.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.260
I mean, for crying out loud, the Ford Motor
Company used the same script.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.450
So, there you go.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.879
Have fun using your free, public domain ancient-cursive
style, and, as always, thanks for watching.
