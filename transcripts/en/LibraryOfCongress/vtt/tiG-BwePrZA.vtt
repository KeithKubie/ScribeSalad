&gt;&gt; Monica Valentine:
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.310
My name is Monica
Valentine and I work here

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.370
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.410
All day here at the Library of
Congress National Book Festival,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.320
we are recognizing and
celebrating the importance

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.570
of reading and authors
and books.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.950
The Library of Congress makes it
seem easy to do this every year,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.800
but the truth is the
National Book Festival is a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.750
huge undertaking.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.080
It is a huge financial
undertaking.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.690
And it is free for everyone
because of the generous support

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.550
from our sponsors
and supporters.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.000
Spread the joy of reading
with your gift online

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.420
Now onto the main event...

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.800
It is my pleasure to
introduce the author of one

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.660
of the most popular book
series in our Library

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.260
of Congress young readers'
center, "The Dork Diaries."

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.080
[ Cheering &amp; Applause ]

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.780
We first met everyone's favorite
dork, Nikki Maxwell, in 2009.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.700
Since then, Rachel Renee Russell
has published 12 Nikki Maxwell

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.670
tales, and the 13th, "Tales
of a Not-So-Happy Birthday,"

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.570
is due out on October 16th.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.700
She sold over 30 million copies

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.180
of this New York Times
bestselling series

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.190
and the Max Crumbly series.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.210
Be sure to visit the
book sales area today

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.050
where you can pick up her books.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.980
Here to share more with
us about dork world,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.560
we welcome Rachel Renee
Russell and Nikki Russell.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.510
And Nikki Russell.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.010
[ Applause ]

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.310
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.130
Good afternoon everyone,
I'm happy to be here!

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.270
Yay! We'd like to welcome you
to the National Book Festival,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.900
and this is I think our fourth,
fourth or fifth time here.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.550
And we love coming and you
know, seeing all you guys.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.590
And it's a fantastic book
festival, one of our favorite.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.690
So standing next to me is the
namesake for Dork Diaries,

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.360
her name is Nikki Maxwell.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.510
This is my daughter,
Nikki Russell!

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.560
[ Applause ]

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.890
And not only was Nikki

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.160
and my older daughter Erin the
inspiration for Dork Diaries,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.510
but Nikki illustrates it now.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.340
So we're going to start off

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.510
by talking a little
bit about Dork Diaries.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.490
We're going to do a dramatic
reading of my favorite chapter

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.010
in Dork Diaries Book 12,
and then at the end of that,

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.450
we're going to have a Q&amp;A.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.750
So if there's any
questions you'd

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.690
like to ask, we'll
take questions.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.500
And then Nikki's going
to try to squeeze

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.160
in a couple of Dork-a-fications.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.450
And the Dork-a-fications is

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.680
when she will actually draw a
few people out of the audience

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.030
as a Dork Diaries or
Max Crumbly character.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.990
So we'll be doing that
at the very, very end.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.210
So we have a lot to try to
get into our presentation.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.840
So I'm going to have a seat.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.980
And Nikki, you going to sit
down or you going to draw?

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.280
&gt;&gt; Draw.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.580
&gt;&gt; Draw, okay.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.880
Nikki's going to draw.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.640
Okay, what you're seeing now
is the Dork Diaries series

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.940
at the bottom right is
Dork Diaries Book 1,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.180
and then we've gone all the way
since 2009 to our newest book,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.580
and that's Dork Diaries Book 12.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.890
And this one came out
in October of 2017.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.210
And our newest book will
be coming out October 2016

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.920
in just a few more months.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.920
The brand new series that we
launched a couple years ago is

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.550
the Misadventures
of Max Crumbly.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.570
And there's a video that...

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.910
&gt;&gt; Let's try that again.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.570
This is Max Crumbly!

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.680
Super-powered eighth grader
at Southridge Middle School.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.920
Alright, fine, Max
doesn't have super powers,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:33.970
but if he could give
himself super powers

00:04:33.970 --> 00:05:03.400
with weird glowing potions, the
first person he'd rescue is...

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.240
Himself. Because the truth
is, Max Crumbly's life stinks!

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.540
We're talking stinks
worse than Doug Thirsten.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.840
And that's gas mask level stink.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.140
In just two weeks,
Max has the record

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.440
for most tardy slips
in a single hour.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.740
I earned the nickname "Barf"

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.040
after a rope climbing
mishap in PE.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.340
And has been crammed into
his locker by Doug Thirsten

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.640
about 8 bajillion times.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.940
The thing is, Max
could be a hero!

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.240
He'd go around saving the
world with his wicked raps.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.540
&gt;&gt; What's up.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.840
&gt;&gt; Rescue Erin Madison
in the school play

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.140
with his awesome art skills.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.440
And maybe, just maybe, even
hone his serious bladder control

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.740
issues for good.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.040
Yep, Max Crumbly
could be a hero!

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.340
But first, he'll need to survive
a three day weekend crammed

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.640
in his locker.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.940
Find out what happens in "The
Misadventures of Max Crumbly,"

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.240
a new series by Rachel
Renee Russell,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.540
author of the number
one best-selling series

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.840
"Dork Diaries," out now.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.140
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Thank you!

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.660
So just a little bit
about Max Crumbly.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.620
Max is about to face the
scariest place he's ever been,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.480
Southridge Middle School.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.720
There's a lot that's great
about his new school,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.600
but there's also
one big problem.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.380
Doug Thirsten, also
known as Thug.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.650
The school bully whose hobby is
stuffing Max inside his locker.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.240
If only Max could be like the
hero of his favorite comics.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.570
Read "The Misadventures of Max
Crumbly 1, Locker Hero" just

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.100
to see how much of
a hero Max can be.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.720
So this was our first book
in the Max Crumbly series.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.970
We also have written and
released a second one.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.100
And that's "Max Crumbly book
2, Middle School Mayhem."

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.150
And we have a little
mini video for that one.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.180
&gt;&gt; Nooo! Aaaahhh!

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.040
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Alright, so my
job is to tell you a little bit

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.270
about "Max Crumbly book
2, Middle School Mayhem."

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.260
When we last left our hero, Max
Crumbly, he had crash landed

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.540
on top of a mighty
meat monster pizza

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.650
after taking a late-night
tumble through the bin

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.810
at Southridge Middle School.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.710
And he was completely surrounded
by three ruthless criminals!

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.600
Will Max be shredded to
bits like mozzarella cheese

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.460
on the hard and crunchy
pizza crust of doom?

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.360
Or, can his friend and sidekick
computer whiz Erin help get him

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.660
out of this sticky
situation alive?

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.480
Find out in "The
Misadventures of Max Crumbly 2,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.510
Middle School Mayhem."

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.240
[ Applause ]

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.920
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: And
our new book, which is coming

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.490
out on October 16th,
is "Dork Diaries,

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.520
Tales of a Not-So-Happy
Birthday!"

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:51.780
Nikki Maxwell is finally getting
ready to celebrate her birthday.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.380
So again, this book will
be coming out October 16th

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.710
and you can preorder it.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.010
Otherwise, you can buy it

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.310
on October 16th on
the release date.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.050
And again, it will be released
on October 16th and we're back

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.090
with the normal cast
of characters.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.860
We have Nikki, and of
course her two BFFs Zoe

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.380
and Chloe will be helping
her to plan the party.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.990
Mackenzie will be there
trying to ruin her birthday.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.690
And then of course we
have her crush Brandon,

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.700
and then there's wacky
Brianna, her little sister.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.560
So we'll have the entire cast
back for "Dork Diaries Book 13,

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.630
Tales from a Not-So-Happy
Birthday."

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.130
[ Applause ]

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.170
Okay the next thing I'm
really excited about,

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.280
this is our first
time trying this,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.780
we're going to do a short
reading from my favorite chapter

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.580
of "Dork Diaries Book 12."

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.260
It's this book here.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.120
And it's the diary
entry of Nikki Maxwell

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.590
which is Sunday, May 25th.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.670
And if you have the book and
you'd like to follow along,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.190
it's going to start
at about page 67.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.410
Nikki's going to be, I'm
going to be Nikki Maxwell

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.040
and I'll read her parts.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.200
Nikki is going to do a
dramatic interpretation

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.530
of Brianna, Mom, and Dad.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.520
So I'm going to set
things up a little bit.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.260
Nikki and her family are
eating lunch together.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.410
And Nikki's favorite television
show is a reality show called

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.230
"My Rich and Trashy Life."

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:52.390
And it's about these sisters
that are very, very wealthy

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.700
and they always have drama
going on in their lives.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.590
And again, it's based off
of a real-life reality show.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.830
But in "Dork Diaries,"
Nikki is really

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:04.360
into watching that reality show.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.100
So as soon as she finishes
lunch, she wants to rush off

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.990
and watch her favorite
reality show,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.530
but her mother has other plans.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:17.030
Her mother has decided that it's
family game board afternoon.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.020
So she wants the entire
family to sit down

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.030
and play a game board.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.970
So we'll start with that.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.950
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Is everybody
ready for fun, fun, fun?

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.310
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.790
I wanted to watch my
favorite reality show.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:42.220
But no, mom wanted us to
have family game time.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.090
Brianna came skipping
into the room

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.520
with a small bag behind her back
and an old pizza box covered

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.930
in finger paint and glitter.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.120
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Look at this!

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.350
I made my own game, and it's
called Brianna's Funnest

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.650
Game Ever!

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.270
You're going to love it!

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.870
Can we play it?

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.170
Can we, Mommy?

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.470
Please?

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.770
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Briana pleaded.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.350
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: We'd love
to play your game, sweetheart.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.650
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Mom smiled.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.520
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell:
It's going to be fun.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.840
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Briana opened her pizza box.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.430
Inside was a handmade game
board with random squares

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.690
and colorful crayon scribbles
that made no sense whatsoever.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:24.430
I couldn't tell which
direction to move

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.350
or where the finish line was.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.050
It look like Brianna had
just chewed up some crayons

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.120
and spit them out on the
paper with her eyes closed.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.080
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Okay,
I'm going to be the boss.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.340
Daddy, you can be the paperclip.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.680
And mommy, you can be the penny.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.400
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: She
handed them their game pieces.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.720
Cool, I get to be the cute
Barbie shoe, I smiled.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.150
I picked up the tiny
pink sparkly high heel.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.450
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Nuh-uh.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.750
That's mine.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.410
Remember, it's my game.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.790
I made it so I'm the boss of it.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.640
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: Then
she stuck her tongue out at me.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.130
I folded my arms
and glared at her.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.610
Then what am I supposed
to use to play your game?

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.910
There's nothing left!

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.660
I grumbled.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.170
Brianna checked inside
the box and sure enough,

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.730
there weren't any
more game pieces.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.550
But she just shrugged
her shoulders at me

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.030
like it wasn't her problem.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.670
That's when I got
a brilliant idea.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.910
Oh no, Brianna, it looks like I
won't be able to play your game!

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.070
I'm so disappointed!

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.720
I pretend pouted, like
I was about the cry.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.210
I guess I'll just have to
go and watch the finale

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.990
of "My Very Rich and Trashy
Life" while you guys have all

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.290
the fun.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.840
But I'll get over it, bye!

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.590
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell:
Hey, wait a minute!

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.890
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Brianna grinned

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.290
as she peeled off a moldy piece
of pepperoni that was stuck

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.420
to the bottom of the pizza box.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.140
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Here Nikki,
this is your game piece!

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.790
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: Ewww!

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.370
I shrieked.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.350
I don't want that nasty thing!

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.220
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: But
it's the best one!

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.450
If you get hungry and want
a snack, you can chew on it!

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.150
Then when it's your
turn to move again,

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.420
you just put the pepperoni
back on the game board.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:19.060
I bet you can chew it
for just hours like gum!

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.360
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
That's when I threw

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.520
up in my mouth a little.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.480
Mom! I whined, waiting
for her to intervene.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.630
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Nikki,
you're spoiling the fun.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.280
Brianna worked really hard
on this game, so simmer down!

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.870
Just take the pepperoni and
try to be a good sport, okay?

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.170
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
I begrudgingly picked

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.870
up my nasty pepperoni, trying
to avoid the fuzzy mold

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.310
and dropped it on the start box.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.750
It was misspelled "Stat."

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.550
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell:
Mommy, you go first.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.850
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Mom rolled the die

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.150
and moved four spaced.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.270
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Now
this is the fun part.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:02.210
You have to do whatever the card
I choose during the game says.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.510
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: Brianna
squealed and pulled out a stack

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.560
of index cards written
in block marker

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.970
in her sloppy handwriting.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.980
However, instead of taking a
card from the top of the stack,

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.660
Brianna quickly sorted
through them

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.350
until she found one she liked.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.270
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Here
Mommy, this is your card.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.630
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Mom read the card.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:25.770
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: You are nice
and pretty like sugar plum.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.160
Move forward seven spaces!

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.600
How sweet, this game is fun.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.390
Okay, Daddy, your turn!

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.690
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Dad rolled the die

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.260
and moved five spaces.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.850
Then Brianna selected
a card for him.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.150
Dad read.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.390
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Today is your
lucky day, do the hokey pokey

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.630
and then move ahead six spaces.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.010
Woo-hoo!

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.310
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Dad exclaimed.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.780
He hopped to his feet and did
a rendition of the hokey pokey

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:56.040
that included the chicken
dance and some moves he stole

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.640
from a Justin Bieber video.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.410
Ugh. Now I'll never be able
to watch that video again

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.890
without thinking of
Dad's hokey pokey!

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.970
Next it was my turn.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.880
I tossed the die and
moved three spaces.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.180
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Uh-oh.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.480
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Brianna said,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.320
reading the card she
had selected to me.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.400
She handed it to me and
then read it out loud.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.390
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: You
are ugly and eat boogers.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.690
You lose a turn, sorry!

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:24.990
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: What?

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.290
I shouted.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.590
That's not fair!

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.310
Why do I have to be the
ugly, booger-eating loser?

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.010
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Because it's
my game and I make the rules!

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.740
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Brianna said all snotty-like

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.570
with her hand on her hip.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.870
Okay, fine.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.170
I grumped.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.280
I thought this was
supposed to be fun.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.800
I was so over Brianna's
stupid game.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.930
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Yay,
everybody, it's my turn!

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.230
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Brianna giggled.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:55.090
She rolled the die and moved
her Barbie shoe three spaces.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.290
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell:
Now I get a card.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.830
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: She
said as she quickly sorted

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:00.690
through the stack until
she found one she liked.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:01.990
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Oh goody,

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.000
my card says "You are the
bestest player and get

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.200
to have three pieces of candy
from the jackpot candy stash!

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.500
Congratulations!"

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.800
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: What?

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.630
What do you mean, what
jackpot candy stash?

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.040
I exclaimed.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.380
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: This one.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.680
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Brianna answered

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.130
as she grabbed the
plastic bag and opened it.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:29.480
I almost had a heart attack.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.300
Inside was my precious
candy stash.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.940
That bratty little thief
has snuck into my room

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.800
and stolen my entire
stash of candy!

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.520
No way, I protested.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.240
I hate this cruddy game.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.270
Give me back my candy
stash, Brianna.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.820
Give it back now.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.120
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell:
Aw, come on Nikki.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.420
It's just candy.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.190
You could always get more.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.260
Let's just try to have
fun playing your little

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.630
sister's game.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.710
I agree, this is an
opportunity for you

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.210
to be an excellent
role model for Brianna.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.400
So try not to be a sore loser.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.930
Listen to your father
and your mother.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.760
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
My mom admonished me.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.790
There's no wonder I had
a really bad attitude

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.300
about the whole thing.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.440
Every time it was my turn, I
ended up with a stupid card

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.750
that said something like.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.180
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: You got
cooties without a cooties shot!

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.650
Go to jail!

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:23.950
Sorry!

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.250
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: Or.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.100
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: You stink
really bad and need a bath!

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.060
Go back to start.

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.470
And then lose a turn.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:33.770
Sorry!

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.070
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: And
whenever it was Brianna's turn,

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.870
she got to eat several
more pieces of my candy.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.030
I just sat there
glaring at the three

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.330
of them in complete disgust.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.370
I couldn't believe I was being
forced by my very own parents

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:51.400
to watch my bratty little sister
eat my entire candy stash during

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.600
the finale of my
favorite reality show

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.130
"My Very Rich and Trashy Life!"

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.170
I was very tempted to
call the authorities

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.400
and report them for child abuse.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.110
Finally Brianna had
an ingenious plan

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.500
to get her grubby little
hands on my property.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.510
My candy stash.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.710
But by the end of the game,

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.450
my sister had eaten
almost half of my candy.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.770
She had chocolate all
over her face and hands

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:25.190
and was looking a little queasy.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:26.490
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: My tummy.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:31.720
Mommy I don't feel so-- so good.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.330
Goodness, I think this game has
gotten completely out of hand.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.970
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: My mom
said, looking a bit flustered.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.460
Dad scooped Brianna
up off of the floor.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.920
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: You've had
way too many sweets, young lady.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.540
I think you need to go get some
rest to cure that tummyache.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.970
But I want to keep playing!

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.690
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
She whined in a weak voice.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:59.290
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: I
never get to eat as much

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.340
of Nikki's candy as I want!

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.640
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: A-ha!

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.940
Just as I had expected!

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.610
The whole point of
Brianna's stupid game was

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.830
to get into my candy stash.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.780
And my mom and dad
had fallen for it.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.820
I'll give Brianna points for
being a pig-tailed evil genius

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.920
and pink My Little
Pony sneakers.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.560
But I refuse to feel
sorry for her.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.080
The next time we have a
board game madness night,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.400
we're going to play
a rigged game my way.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.500
My board game is going to
be called "Brocolli-opoli"

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.120
and it'll feature all of the
foods that Brianna hates.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.070
Watch your back, little sister.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.770
You're going to get a
big, green, nasty payback

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:41.010
and it's going to be healthy.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.830
I can't wait to give
Brianna a special card

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:50.030
from my game that's
going to say--

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.590
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Today
is your lucky day.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:59.890
You get to drink a
gallon of green smoothie?

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.280
Sorry? Ah, Nikki
I hate your game.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.580
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
And who knows?

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.880
If I'm feeling really
vengeful, I might just toss

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.330
in some moldy pepperoni
for extra flavor.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:15.250
[ Applause ]

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.490
Okay, now we're going to
do a really quick Q&amp;A.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:21.750
So if you have a
question, you can line up,

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.050
I think there's microphones
back there.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.330
Okay. We'll go back
and forth, okay?

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.020
&gt;&gt; What was your inspiration
for the Brandon crush?

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.320
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
The inspiration

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.630
for Brandon crush was
actually my daughter Erin.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.710
When she was in middle school
she had a tremendous crush

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.360
on a guy, but the entire year
she never said one single word

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.660
to him.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.920
So the relationship between
Brandon and Nikki is kind

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.630
of a fantasy of if she was
able to talk to her crush,

00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.930
what it may have been like.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.280
So Brandon is inspired
by a real-life person.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:09.150
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite Dork
Diaries book that you've wrote?

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.450
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.700
My favorite Dork Diaries book
is always the newest one.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.640
So right now it's this one.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.490
"Dork Diaries book 12"
and more than likely,

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:21.040
once we release "Dork
Diaries book 13"

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.340
that will probably
be my favorite.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.320
And I think it's because I
spend a year writing them.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.830
And then you just
kind of get attached

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.130
to it since you're working.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.850
And you can ask Nikki
a question, too.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.890
&gt;&gt; How many more books do you
think you're going to write?

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.690
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: I
will keep writing Dork Diaries

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.210
as long as you guys
keep reading them.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:42.310
So. At this point, I
see no end in sight.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.390
And we're working on
Dork Diaries book 14 now

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.020
and 13 will come out in October.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.940
So I'll be at it for many
more years to come as long

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.380
as you guys keep reading.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.210
&gt;&gt; How many books are
you planning on having?

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.550
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: I'm
going to keep writing forever.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.460
And ever and ever.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:05.590
So yeah, at this point
there's no end in sight.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:14.050
&gt;&gt; Where did you get the
inspiration for Brianna?

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:15.660
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
For Brianna?

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:20.950
The inspiration for
Brianna was actually Nikki.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:25.680
When Nikki was a little
kid, she was very active.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.980
I'll put it that way.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.090
And she was like taking
apart the television

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.770
and writing on the walls.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.730
And she was very, very busy.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.170
And she was very curious and
she had a wacky sense of humor.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.330
So definitely Nikki is the
inspiration for Brianna.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.030
&gt;&gt; Why did Nikki
have the crushes?

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.200
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: Nikki
had crushes because a lot

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.470
of times, by the time
you get in middle school

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.800
and you start high school, you
start noticing guys and girls

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.360
in your classroom and
you start having crushes.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.090
So we decided to give
Nikki Maxwell a crush

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.690
because that's kind
of what happens

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.050
when you're in middle school.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.120
&gt;&gt; What's your inspiration
for each story you write?

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.970
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: A
lot of each book has a theme.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.670
Like for example "Dork Diaries
book 1" was Nikki entering an

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:12.970
art show.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.410
And that actually
happened because Nikki

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:19.100
and Erin have both
entered art competitions.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.930
The one with the
music was inspired

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.830
because when I was a little
girl, we had a girl band.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.210
My sisters and I.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.880
And we actually performed
at the Apollo Theatre.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.480
So "Dork Diaries 3"
was based on that.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.800
And so anyway, all of the
books are based on things

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.610
that have happened to either
myself or my daughters.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.790
So they're kind of
based on real life.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:42.590
So we'll just take
one more question.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:46.640
&gt;&gt; What was your inspiration
for the first Dork Diary?

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.940
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
The inspiration

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.440
for the first Dork Diaries
was, I would say was inspired

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.580
by my two daughters,
Erin and Nikki.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.760
And growing, they
were really tall

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:57.890
because their dad is like 6'4.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.650
So they were really tall and
kids gave them a hard time

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.110
and teased them and bullied
them because they were so tall.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:07.510
And a lot of times, like if
a parent came in to visit,

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:09.780
they would mistake Erin or Nikki

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.760
for a teacher's aide
or another adult.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.270
And they were like
only 5th or 6th grade.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.340
They just were really,
really tall for their age.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.010
And since they got teased,

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.920
I thought if I ever
wrote a children's book,

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.610
I would try to talk about
bullying and dealing

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:28.020
with mean girls and
how to cope with them

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.800
and I would make it really
funny and inspire kids to hang

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.770
in there and deal
with the situations

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.610
in case they're experiencing
that same type of thing.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.550
So I think we're all done now.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:46.240
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Alright, so
I have two pictures I was able

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.020
to do during this very short
sweet time we had together.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.690
The first is a Dork-i-fication
of a young lady seated front

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:58.790
and center with the most
adorable red headband

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:01.370
on and bow.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.610
Would you like to get up and
get your Dork-i-fication?

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:10.040
[ Applause ]

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.920
And the next artwork we
have, thank you Mommy.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.100
The next artwork is
a Crumb-i-fication

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.560
of a gentleman here
to the far left

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.660
in a grey American flag t-shirt.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.900
Come on up and get
your Crumb-i-fication!

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.700
Come on!

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:35.050
[ Applause ]

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:36.470
There you go.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.640
I wish I could draw all of you!

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.710
But I'm afraid we ran
out of time for that.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:46.130
So please give these
two a round of applause.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.430
Thank you.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:48.730
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
You can have a seat.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.030
You can have a seat, dear.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.540
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Okay,
you can have a seat.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.450
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: Okay,
we're going to be signing books.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.790
Is it, what time?

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:00.900
Is it 1 o'clock?

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.050
What time are we signing?

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.050
Anyway, we're going to be
signing books shortly after this

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:11.400
and we have lots of free stuff
because we love you guys!

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.690
So we have a Dork Diaries
book 12 gumball machine

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:19.640
and it has colorful gumballs
and a Dork Diaries sticker

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.160
and it matches our cover.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.260
And we have stickers
and bookmarks

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.620
and Max Crumply Stickers and a
lot of lot of lot of fun stuff.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.930
So we're looking forward

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.830
to seeing you guys
when you sign books.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.810
Love you guys!

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.070
&gt;&gt; Nikki Russell: Hope to see
you soon at the book signing!

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.370
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: Yep!

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.960
Always remember to let your
inner dork shine through

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.210
and be the hero you've
always admired!
