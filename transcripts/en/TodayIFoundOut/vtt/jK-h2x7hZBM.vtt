00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:12.360
Have you 
ever cracked your knuckles and had someone

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.259
yell at you to stop because it causes arthritis?

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.660
25-54% of the world’s population cracks
their knuckles, men more so than women.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.930
Does this mean up to 54% of us will get arthritis?

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.270
The short answer is no.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.840
There are different types of arthritis and
no study has ever shown a link between cracking

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.580
your knuckles and it causing any type of arthritis.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.460
Let’s talk about why and what is actually
causing the “cracking” noise when you

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.010
crack you’re knuckles.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.700
The knuckles are the joints formed by the
bones in our fingers.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.390
Each finger consists of three bones (phalanges).

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.379
They’re named based on where they are in
relation to the palm of your hand.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.180
There’s the proximal phalange (closest to
the palm), the middle phalange, and the distal

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.329
phalange (farthest from the palm).

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.300
The first knuckle is called the metacarpophalangeal
joint (MCP).

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.539
(Say that after drinking 3 beers and watch
the laughter ensue!)

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.210
The second knuckle is the proximal inter-phalangeal
joint (PIP) and the last knuckle is the distal

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.210
inter-phalangeal joint (DIP).

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.960
The fingers, and thus the joints, are held
in place by ligaments and tendons.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.970
There are no muscles in the fingers and movement
is controlled by forearm muscles pulling on

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.730
your finger tendons.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.180
Your knuckles are also covered by a joint
capsule known as your synovial capsule.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.380
There’s fluid within this capsule known
as synovial fluid.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.810
This fluid provides the lubrication and nutrients
needed for the joint and surrounding bone.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.750
This fluid also contains several gases (oxygen,
nitrogen and carbon dioxide).

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.500
When you crack your knuckles, you stretch
out the synovial capsule creating a negative

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.420
pressure within the joint.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.180
This pulls the gasses out of the fluid in
the form of a bubble which bursts to create

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.430
the popping sound.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.370
To crack the same knuckle again, you have
to wait for more gases to build up in the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.780
synovial fluid.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.610
There are over 100 different types of arthritis.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.280
Generically, arthritis is simply inflammation
of your joints.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.220
It can be caused by everything from autoimmune
problems (rheumatoid arthritis), bacterial

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.909
infections (nongonococcal bacterial arthritis),
to sexually transmitted diseases (gonococcal

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:14.909
arthritis).

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.959
In the case of cracking knuckles, the type
of arthritis often thought to be caused by

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.189
it is the most common, osteoarthritis.

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.260
Osteoarthritis can be a normal result of the
aging process.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.109
It can also be caused by excessive wear and
tear on the joint.

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.659
The result is cartilage breaking down and
wearing away.

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.159
The bones can begin to rub together and sometimes
cause spurs to develop.

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.299
Pain, swelling, and stiffness are the most
common symptoms.

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.730
So does the constant “popping” of the
gases within the synovial fluid cause the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.959
“excessive wear and tear” that can cause
osteoarthritis?

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.230
There have been several studies that looked
at this question, and none have shown that

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.280
habitual knuckle cracking causes wear and
tear.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.889
One study looked at 300 patients over 45 years
old and found that among the worst knuckle

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.989
crackers there was no increase in the incidence
of arthritis.

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.609
They did find, however, that the more you
cracked, the lower your grip strength was

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:10.640
over time.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.480
So the next time you feel like cracking your
knuckles, do so with the knowledge you won’t

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.060
get arthritis from it.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.969
You might, however, have damage to your ligaments
and tendons that reduces your grip strength,

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:42.920
but hey, what vice doesn’t come with 
a little risk!
