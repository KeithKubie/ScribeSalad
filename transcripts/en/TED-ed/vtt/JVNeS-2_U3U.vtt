00:00:05.503 --> 00:00:08.150
I would like to think of it as a social programmer.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.160
I think society is going to be a lot more technological.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.904
We're going to have augmented reality interfaces.

00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:14.759
We're going to have interfaces to government,

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.163
to civic institutions,

00:00:16.163 --> 00:00:18.781
and I think programmers aren't going to be sitting

00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:20.246
in front of screens so much

00:00:20.246 --> 00:00:22.604
as walking in and around people

00:00:22.604 --> 00:00:24.421
and adjusting that interface on the fly

00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.713
to suit, sort of,

00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:27.965
as it happens,

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:30.557
interfaces that people need at events,

00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:31.777
government.

00:00:31.777 --> 00:00:33.357
And I like the idea of a programmer

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:34.778
who talks to people

00:00:34.778 --> 00:00:36.107
and then makes those interfaces

00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:38.953
sort of become instantiated.

00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:40.371
That would be a cool job.

00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:42.524
That would be a job I'd want.
