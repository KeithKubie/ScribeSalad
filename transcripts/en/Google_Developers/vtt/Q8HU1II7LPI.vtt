TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.953
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:07.400
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.970
Now this week during
our annual Developer Day

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.770
at the Game
Developers Conference,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.530
we introduced new tools to
improve the overall discovery

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.180
on Google Play,
especially supporting

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.940
developers who build
high-quality and engaging

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.720
games.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.910
This includes more curation
of high-quality games

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.100
through editorial
pages and promoting

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.770
high-quality experiences
based on engagement,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.540
not just installs.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.690
More details, as well as a
peek at some upcoming games,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.650
are on the post linked
in the description below.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.460
The official Firebase SDKs for
Unity and C++ are now generally

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.890
available to help you
supercharge your games.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.380
This means that they're both
primary supported platforms

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.265
that Firebase is committed
to supporting in the future.

00:00:47.265 --> 00:00:48.640
Check out the post
for everything

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.190
you can take advantage of,
a Getting Started guide,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.010
and a set of new samples.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.170
We recently announced
the launch of a new way

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.770
to publish apps on Google
Play with some new features.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.360
The changes will
give you the ability

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.700
to manage your app releases
with more confidence

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.730
via a new Manage Releases
page in Google Play Developer

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.390
Console.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.800
Screenshots and a
video are on the post.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.690
tf.Transform is a new
library for TensorFlow

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.930
that allows users to define
pre-processing pipelines

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.510
and run these using
large-scale data

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.159
processing frameworks,
while also exporting

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.700
the pipeline in a way that can
be run as part of a TensorFlow

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.950
graph.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.830
You'll want the flowchart for
this one, and it's on the post.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.410
Google Cloud Platform is
the first cloud provider

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.780
to offer the next
generation Intel Xeon

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.000
processor, code-named Skylake.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.940
Skylake includes Intel
Advanced Vector Extensions,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.040
which make it ideal for
scientific modeling,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.910
genomic research, 3D-rendering,
data analytics, and engineering

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.620
simulations.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.560
