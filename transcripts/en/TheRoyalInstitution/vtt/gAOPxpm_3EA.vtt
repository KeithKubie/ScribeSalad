00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.189
Each branch of science attempts unifying
theories. Physics, for example, has

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.439
thermodynamics to bring together mechanics
and heat. Einstein’s relativity added to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.540
the
unification of ideas, underscoring how

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.620
fundamental quantities like matter and energy
are just two sides of the same coin. We now

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.300
have wave-particle duality and a common
framework for understanding special relativity

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.510
in
the context of quantum mechanics. Yet the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.160
ultimate grand unified “theory of everything”
– a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.760
theory of quantum gravity - remains elusive.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.240
Biology, on the other hand, has its “grand
unifying theory”, thanks

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:06.430
to Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural
selection, published in 1859, combined with

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.030
the theory of
heredity pioneered by Mendel, published a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.280
few years later.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.110
It is the story of this theory of heredity
that this lecture concerns,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.770
made up, as you shall see, of a series of
revolutionary ideas

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.649
pioneered by some of the greatest scientists
the world has ever

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.869
known. It is an exciting story because it
concerns the revolution in

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.369
our molecular understanding of the very nature
of life itself, and it

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.959
is a very exciting time to be telling this
story, because we are

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.759
entering a period when we do not only understand
the ultimate

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.021
influence of genetics on everything about
life, but we are

00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:49.950
developing the power to intervene in our genetic
destiny. Now is

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.209
the time to understand how this has come about,
what it means,

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:59.909
and how we should move forward, not just as
scientists, but as a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.909
society.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.700
Darwin’s big idea was that the variation
amongst creatures in their

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.649
natural environment results in the struggle
for life in which only the

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.030
most suitably adapted are preserved.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.790
Evolution basically means gradual change over
time and natural

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.950
selection provides a mechanism for evolution.
Some change will be

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.680
favoured – it will make the organism more
likely to survive in a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.780
particular environment and reproduce, producing
progeny with the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.100
same traits. So you see, ultimately one type
of creature can be

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.090
transformed into something completely different.
In illustrating his

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.900
theory of evolution by natural selection,
Darwin realized that all

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.970
species are connected – indeed they share
a common origin – he

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:58.400
thought of the concept of the tree of life.
Darwin’s tree

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:12.420
was a simple one, and we now know it to be
more complex , but nonetheless Darwin was

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.390
right. Simple life forms
evolved 4 billion years ago, and natural selection

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.040
has sent organisms
off in a myriad of different directions to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.459
make the extraordinary
diversity we have around us today.

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:37.970
– over 9 million species! Darwin talked
passionately about the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.120
“Grandeur”, in his view of life, with
its “endless forms most beautiful

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.110
and most wonderful”. Darwin’s theory of
natural selection works so

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.270
well as a unifying theory in biology that
Theodosius Dobzhansky was

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.090
prompted to write, around 100 years later,
that “Nothing in biology

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.420
makes sense, except in the light of evolution”

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:15.329
The 
problem with Darwin’s great idea, though,

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.400
was that Darwin had
no robust mechanism to explain inheritance,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.789
and this rendered his
logic incomplete – his unifying theory failed

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.340
in this respect. Darwin
knew, of course, that traits run in families,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.860
otherwise natural
selection wouldn’t work at all, but he had

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.610
no decent mechanism to
explain HOW inheritance works, despite recognizing

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.759
the supreme
importance of heredity, of “modification

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.960
by descent” in his
hypothesis.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.000
So what were the prevailing theories of heredity
in Darwin’s day?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.870
Among the earliest known writings on the subject
of

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:02.050
heredity are those of Hippocrates in 400 BC.
He believed that reproductive material

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.949
came from all parts of an organism and hence
that

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.240
characters were directly handed down to the
progeny.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.509
As evidence in support of this hypothesis
he referred to a

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:17.120
race of mankind called the Macrocephali. Immediately
after a child was born, the Macrocephali fashioned

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.590
its
head by hand to give it an elongated shape.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.379
At a later
period, the elongated head would form naturally,

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:29.680
without
the necessity for moulding it after birth,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.240
in much the
same way that baldness and blue eyes are inherited.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.029
If
reproductive material came from all parts

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:39.789
of an organism,
then it would come from the moulded head.

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:49.969
50 years or so later Aristotle questioned
this view. He

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.050
couldn’t understand how certain characteristics
such as voice, nails and

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.229
hair could contribute to the reproductive
material, since they were

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.289
intangible, or concerned dead tissue. He also
observed that children

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.520
sometimes looked more like their grandparents
than their parents. He

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.900
was puzzled, too, about plants.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.280
How could parts which may be absent at the
time of reproduction (eg

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.199
leaves) be inherited? And how could it be
that parents could each

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.330
contribute something from all their parts,
yet their progeny have only

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.969
one and not two of each part? Aristotle modified
Hippocrates’ theory

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:32.860
by postulating that the reproductive material
is made up of

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.830
substances that have been diverted from various
parts to the

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:43.219
reproductive path. This was a really important
idea. He went on to

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.529
argue, however, that the contributions to
the progeny from the two

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:50.449
parents were not the same, and held the contribution
of the father in

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:57.479
somewhat higher regard (no surprises there!),
contributing shape and

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.889
form to the embryo, as opposed to the mothers
contribution of “inner

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.770
material” (in other words, all the dull
stuff).

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.669
Many variations of these “transmission theories”
were

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:10.830
proposed over the subsequent centuries. The
only

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.869
theory of heredity that has perhaps rivaled
it is the so-

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:21.120
called preformation theory, which can be followed
back to Saint Augustine.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.460
This theory held that, in the creation of
the first

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.530
woman, all following generations were pre-formed,
and the theory gave rise to the idea of the

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.789
homunculus in the sixteenth century, although
Nicolas

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:39.550
Hartsoeker, who drew this homunculus in 1695
was

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:45.080
definitely a “spermist” in his view of
heredity.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.629
Transmission theories, however, dominated
during

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:58.439
Darwin’s time. Thus Darwin, writing
in 1868 about his theory of pangenesis, suggested

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:01.550
that
all the cells and tissues of an organism threw

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:07.189
off
minute granules, called gemmules, which circulated

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:09.229
through the organism, multiplied, and were
passed

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:12.030
down to the reproductive cells, which thus
contained a

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:17.319
multitude of components thrown off from each
individual part of the organism. He also thought

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:19.490
gemmules were capable of transmission in a
dormant

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.560
state to future generations.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.499
So Darwin had a way of explaining the non-expression
of parental characteristics as well as the

00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:29.889
direct
transmission of characteristics from parent

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:32.490
to
offspring that was so important for natural

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.750
selection
to work.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.919
He felt that Pangenesis, which he described
as a

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:41.210
“provisional hypothesis” in this 1868
work brought

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.590
together, in his words “a multitude of facts
which are

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.941
at present left disconnected by any cause”.
His

00:08:47.941 --> 00:08:51.190
theory was not however so very different from
that of

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.450
Hippocrates over 2000 years previously.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:01.310
It is remarkable that the Hippocratic view
remained essentially unchallenged for 23

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.900
centuries. It is not as though no-one did
any

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.990
breeding experiments during this time, especially
in the 18th and 19th centuries, it is more

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.460
the case
that, although these experiments did not support

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:17.890
the classical view, they did not present any
alternative hypothesis.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.000
Until Mendel.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.770
It is noteworthy that, several decades before
Mendel

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.940
published his work, at least two other plant
breeders

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.350
made very similar observations to Mendel.
Knight,

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:36.430
working in England in 1799, crossed unpigmented
and pigmented edible peas together.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:41.780
He was surprised to find only pigmented plants
the

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.080
following year (the first filial generation),
but that

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.010
these, on self-pollination, produced both
pigmented

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:54.870
and unpigmented plants in the following generation.
From this he deduced that there was a “stronger

00:09:54.870 --> 00:10:00.720
tendency” to produce coloured than colourless
plants.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:06.350
Goss, also working in England, in 1824, made
similar discoveries,

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:14.640
but took the analysis slightly further: He
pollinated green seeded peas from a yellow

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:20.160
seeded variety, found
all yellow seeded plants in the first filial

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.880
generation, then on selfing
these, got pods with all green, all yellow,

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.270
or a mixture of both
green and yellow seeded plants the following

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.270
year.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.270
But then he went for a further generation,
and discovered that

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:35.140
while the green peas bred true, only giving
green progeny, the

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.910
yellow yielded a mixture – some pods all
yellow and some with

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.780
both green and yellow peas intermixed.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:49.850
Their problem? They didn’t count the numbers
of the two kinds of

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.890
peas (or if they did count them, they failed
to see the significance

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.400
of the numbers), and in doing so they both
failed to discover the

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.840
hereditary mechanism which Mendel found.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.140
Forty-two years later, in 1866, Mendel had
been

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.560
doing similar experiments to those of Knight
and

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:13.230
Goss. His thoroughness in
recording the minutiae of his data enabled

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.450
him, by
a stroke of genius, to detect the underlying

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.360
mechanism and so to put forward an entirely
new

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.690
hypothesis for heredity.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.670
The “Grandeur” in Mendel’s work is easily
obscured by

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.470
seemingly obscure facts and figures about
pea breeding

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.380
schemes. But on the contrary, the devil is
absolutely in the

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.540
detail – the grandeur is revealed by the
seemingly

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.990
mundane.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.280
Working with the pigmented and unpigmented
peas, just

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.580
like Knight, Mendel also noted only pigmented
plants in the

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.940
F1 generation, and that, on self-pollination,
these plants

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.150
yielded both pigmented and unpigmented varieties
in the

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.800
F2 generation.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:12:00.780
But he counted the numbers of each kind, finding
705 pigmented plants and 224

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.540
unpigmented plants among 929 plants. He observed
that

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:12.750
these frequencies were close to ¾ and ¼
of the total.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.630
He called the pigmented character – present
in all the

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.890
immediate progeny of the cross and ¾ of the
following

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:22.780
generation – dominant, and the unpigmented
trait

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:28.470
recessive. In other words, inheritance is
particulate, it

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.920
is not a case of blending parental characteristics,
like

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.010
mixing paint.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:36.060
Mendel also worked on the yellow/green seed
colour

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.120
characteristic first explored by Goss, confirming
that

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.060
yellow is dominant to green and that both
kinds

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.500
appear in the second generation after crossing.
But

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.190
again, he counted his peas, and out of 8023
plants,

00:12:49.190 --> 00:13:00.480
6022 were yellow and 2001 green, again a close
approximation to ¾:1/4, or 3:1.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.700
Mendel confirmed Goss’s observation that
the green peas bred true,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:12.180
but he went much further. He found that
of 519 yellow pods, 166 bred true whereas

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.430
353 did not, instead
giving yellow and green seeds in the same

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.460
3:1 ratio as in the
previous generation. Mendel figured that 166

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:27.570
true breeding : 353
impure breeding was a close fit with 1/3:2/3

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:33.930
of the total. In other
words the F2 ratio of 3 dominant to 1 recessive

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:39.980
was really a ratio of
1 pure-breeding dominant to 2 impure dominant

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.470
to 1 recessive
(which always breeds true).

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.440
He pursued these plants for several generations
and showed that

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.830
the pure-breeding types always remained pure-breeding
and the

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.840
impure-breeding ones gave the same 1:2:1 ratio
in each subsequent

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:58.290
generation. Mendel was very cautious about
his data, and went on

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:02.340
to repeat his experiments with a total of
7 different character

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.790
differences: one character was always dominant
to its alternative,

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.100
and the second generation always gave a 3:1
ratio, which on closer

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.640
inspection turned out to be a disguised 1:2:1
ratio.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:27.040
What did all this mean? Mendel built a
hypothesis to account for his data in which

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.180
he used symbols for his
traits – “Y” for the dominant one and

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:44.840
“y” for the recessive character. It
is clear from this that he was thinking about

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.980
“factors” or
“determinants” responsible for the manifestation

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:53.990
of the character. This
is absolutely crucial: his characters were

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.410
not transmitted directly from
generation to generation according to the

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:02.550
classical theory, but rather
there are discrete particles responsible for

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.360
the appearance of
particular characters.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.960
Furthermore, each individual receives one
particle from each of its

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.400
two parents in respect of a particular character,
and these two

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.800
particles separate uncontaminated when the
reproductive cells are

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:24.540
generated. So if Y denotes the particle that
determines yellow seeds,

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:32.410
and y green, then the parents YY and yy give
rise to offspring Yy (yellow

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:39.810
because this character is dominant). Self-pollination
of Yy will yield YY,

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:49.750
Yy, Yy and yy, ie 3 yellow to 1 green at the
phenotypic ratio, which is

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:55.200
really a disguised 1:2:1 ratio when you consider
the factors themselves.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.550
A further point which didn’t escape Mendel’s
reasoning was that

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:05.100
egg cells carrying Y were as equally likely
to be fertilized by pollen

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:11.880
carrying Y or y. In other words, fertilization
was random between

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.760
egg cells and pollen cells (egg cells and
sperm cells for animals!),

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.310
regardless of what factors they carried. This
later became known as

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.380
his law of equal segregation.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.511
Mendel was sitting on a revolution of incalculable
proportion, but

00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:38.530
nobody noticed. He published his work in
1866, two years BEFORE Darwin published his

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.350
pangenesis theory of
blending inheritance based on his gemmules

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:46.500
made from all parts of
the organism. It seems extraordinary in these

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.370
days of instant
communication that Darwin never came into

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:58.320
contact with this work
– what would have happened if Darwin and

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.770
Mendel had met and
discussed Mendel’s results? Darwin would

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.290
surely have been
perplexed that Mendel’s F1 peas weren’t

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.549
yellowish green, and that
he didn’t observe blending characteristics,

00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:09.050
but rather that the
mode of inheritance suggested by Mendel’s

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.829
work was most
definitely particulate. I wonder what he would

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.130
have said?

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:18.010
As it happened, Mendel’s work was almost
entirely

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:22.780
overlooked for 34 years, being rediscovered
in 1900

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:29.851
coincidentally by three different scientists,
De Vries, Correns and von Tschermak, working

00:17:29.851 --> 00:17:32.970
on a
variety of different plant species. Correns

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:37.200
introduced the
term “Mendels Regel”, or “Mendel’s

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.660
Law) for the basic
principle, namely the segregation of the discrete

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.470
particulate determinants of alternative characters
when

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.960
reproductive cells (we would now call these
gametes) are

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.630
formed, and their re-association at fertilization.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.700
De Vries is credited with introducing the
term “mutation”

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.280
to describe suddenly appearing variations,
which could

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.620
provide the raw material for natural selection.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.840
Bateson and Saunders, working in 1902, were
the first to apply

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.500
Mendelian Law to an animal species, the domestic
fowl Gallus

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:13.720
domesticus, finding for example that an extra
toe was dominant to

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.309
the normal foot. Bateson and Saunders also
applied Mendelian

00:18:17.309 --> 00:18:21.880
theory to earlier, unexplained data, and even
re-examined Darwin’s

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.080
1868 work on the snapdragon Antirrhinum majus.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.580
One form of the snapdragon, the peloric form,
differs in having a

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.750
regular radially-symmetrical flower instead
of the normal irregular

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.630
two-lipped variety. Darwin interpreted the
results of his crosses as

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.890
indicating that the tendency to produce normal
flowers prevailed

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.790
in the F1 generation, but that “the tendency
to pelorism appeared

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:50.370
to gain strength by the intermission of a
generation”. With

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:52.930
Mendel’s theory it was only necessary to
postulate that the peloric

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:57.630
trait was recessive – it disappeared in
the F1 generation and re-

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.940
appeared in F2 in the 1:3 ratio.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.180
Thus the classical and Mendelian theories
of heredity can be very

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:11.000
clearly teased apart: In the classical theory,
something is transmitted

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.240
directly from each part of the organism (eg
the snapdragon flower)

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.630
to the corresponding part in the progeny,
whereas in the Mendelian

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:24.180
world, inheritance is indirect through the
agency of particulate

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.180
determinants.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.790
It is these determinants that are transmitted
from generation to

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:33.340
generation, and the character of the flowers
(or whatever) that

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:37.110
develop is simply the fortuitous combination
of the set of

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.550
determinants that it happens to receive at
fertilization.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:44.430
The contributions of each parent retain their
integrity rather than

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:48.480
blending with the contribution of the other
parent. And crucially, the

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:55.100
determinant is not modified by its presence
in an organism. Thus the

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.620
inheritance of the remodeled head in the Hippocratic
example given

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.620
in support of the classical theory, is impossible.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.080
The major problem in biology in the early
1900s, following

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.080
the re-discovery of Mendel’s work was that
its relevance to

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.350
evolution was unclear and hotly debated. Variation
in wild

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:24.050
populations looked continuous. – like
the product of blending inheritance, not the

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.520
discrete
model proposed by Mendel. And how could you

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.120
account
for large jumps and new species?

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.510
Crucial to solving this problem was the study
of

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.760
populations in the field (an area we would
now call

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.270
population genetics). RA Fisher was the major
figure in the

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.230
development of the so-called Modern Synthesis,
producing

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:52.030
in 1918 his seminal paper “The
correlation between relatives on the supposition

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:56.330
of
Mendelian inheritance”. Sounds really dull,

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.320
but it was very
far from that.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.940
What Fisher did crucially in this paper was
show that

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.860
continuous variation could be the result of
the action of

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.690
many discrete determinants (we would now call
these

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.500
genetic loci) – therefore Mendelian genetics
was in fact

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.270
completely consistent with the idea of evolution
driven by

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.559
natural selection.

00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:19.890
The application of Mendelian principles to
populations

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.870
was furthered in the 1920s, 30s and 40s by
Fisher along

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.520
with JBS Haldane (after whom this lecture
is named),

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.580
Sewall Wright, Dobzhansky, EB Ford, Ernst
Mayr and

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.300
others, but time does not allow me to give
due credit to

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.430
their crucial work on the maintenance of genetic
diversity,

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.840
genetic polymorphism and the mechanism by
which new

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.980
species become reproductively isolated.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.740
This new work on population genetics is my
second

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:51.990
revolution in Genetics, following Mendel’s
great theory of

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:56.780
heredity in 1866 and its rediscovery in 1900.
This second

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.830
revolution resulted in the grand unifying
theory of

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.890
biology – the paradigm of evolution by natural
selection

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:08.150
with an integrated mechanism of heredity that
could be

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:13.559
applied to populations. Variation at the genetic
level, or

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:16.420
mutation, provides the raw material required
for natural

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:21.720
selection to sculpt evolution through many
generations.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.630
The third revolution has to be the chromosomal
theory.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:28.850
It’s all well and good talking about factors
and particles of

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.660
inheritance, but what are they, and where
are they? Well,

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:40.500
the “where” was answered by Thomas Hunt
Morgan at about the same time that the Modern

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.860
Synthesis was being developed. The “what”
had to wait a

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.860
few years.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:49.210
Bizzarely, Thomas Hunt Morgan was born in
Kentucky in

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:55.210
1866, the same year that Mendel published
his work. By

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.360
the time that Morgan began his work on the
fruit fly

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.370
Drosophila in 1910, Mendel’s discoveries
were codified

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.210
into two main laws.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.800
The first rule we have already come across,
the law of equal

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.230
segregation, The second rule was known as
the rule of free

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.670
combinations (we would now call this the law
of

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.480
independent assortment), and this states that
when new

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.100
generations arise, the different hereditary
factors can form

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.450
new combinations, independently of each other.
Mendel

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.590
found this out when he did his so-called dihybrid
crosses.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:30.250
For example, if a tall, purple flowered plant
is crossed with a

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:35.140
short, white flowered variety, the factors
purple and white

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.230
can be inherited independently of the factors
tall and short

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.450
– you’ll end up with tall, white flowered
plants and so on, in

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.530
precisely predictable ratios.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.290
Morgan’s particular genius was that he spotted
some

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.840
inconsistencies in this second law, and then
had the

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.549
confidence to seek an explanation for them.

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:57.070
Morgan found the first discrepancy when he
crossed flies

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:02.330
that had purple eyes and short wings with
those that had

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:06.060
red eyes and normal wings.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:22.750
Now, under Mendel’s second law, he 
expected to get

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.540
purple eyed flies with normal wings out of
his crossing

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.760
scheme at the same frequency as getting his
red eyed,

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.930
normal winged flies back again, because the
factors should

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:34.440
assort independently from one another, but
this was not

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.760
the case at all.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.380
He got the purple eyed, normal winged flies
out only very

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.141
rarely. Morgan’s great leap forward was
to figure that the

00:24:44.141 --> 00:24:48.250
eye colour trait and the wing size traits
must be physically

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:53.600
connected together in some way.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.700
He called this phenomenom linkage, and found
that there

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.660
were many examples of this in his fly crosses,
but,

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.720
importantly, that the linkage relationships
were confined to

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.860
4 combination groups.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:09.820
Now, in parallel to all this work with fly
crosses, the early

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.640
cell biologists were also busy in the late
19th and early 20th

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.250
centuries, and the importance of their work
was not lost on

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.200
Morgan. The mechanism of fertilization had
been

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:27.370
discovered by Hertwig in 1875 and
Weissmann took to the microscope in the 1880s,

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:31.250
having
distinguished between the hereditary material,

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:34.190
the germ
plasm (or germline, giving rise to the gametes),

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.550
and the
rest of the body, the soma, to propose that

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.610
the nucleus of
the male and female germ cells must be the

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:45.080
bearers of
hereditary qualities. Much earlier than this,

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.850
several
disciples of the new “cell biology” had

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:54.750
observed threadlike
structures in cells named chromosomes (meaning

00:25:54.750 --> 00:26:02.100
“coloured body”) in 1888 by Heinrich von
Waldeyer-Hartz

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:17.880
.
But nobody knew what they were for.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.940
On the rediscovery of Mendel’s work in the
early 1900s,

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.260
Sutton and Boveri independently suggested
that

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:30.640
chromosomes were good candidates for the exact
distribution of hereditary factors at the

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.410
genesis of a new
individual, simply because of the proportion

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.410
of the
chromosomes in germ cells before and after

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:42.610
fertilization –
in the chromosomes, factors could be combined

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.429
or could
come apart, because there were double the

00:26:45.429 --> 00:26:48.170
number of
chromosomes in the somatic cells compared

00:26:48.170 --> 00:27:54.350
with the sex
cells. The process of halving the

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.090
number of chromosomes during the generation
of the sex

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.260
cells, or gametes, is known as meiosis, a
reductional

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:05.440
division. Sutton and Boveri’s idea of chromosomes
distributing hereditary factors during the

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:09.490
formation of
gametes had huge resonance with Mendel’s

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.480
first law of
equal segregation.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.090
So the ground was well prepared for Morgan
to link cell

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:19.169
biology to heredity – his linkage groups
of connected

00:28:19.169 --> 00:28:22.890
hereditary factors turned out to be chromosomes,
and the

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.280
number of such combination groups, or linkage
groups, in an

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.670
organism, turned out to be the same as the
number of

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:32.060
chromosomes in an organism – 4 in the case
of the fruit fly,

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:33.360
23 in us.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.690
Morgan’s discovery of linkage completed
proved, and greatly

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:40.390
extended, the chromosomal theory of inheritance
proposed

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:45.980
by Sutton and Boveri. Morgan’s linkage rule
limited to a large

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.290
extent Mendel’s second law as being more
applicable to

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:55.691
hereditary factors residing on different chromosomes.
Morgan published his chromosome map, with

00:28:55.691 --> 00:28:58.650
different
hereditary factors lined up in chromosomes

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:01.260
like beads in a
necklace.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.570
However, there was more. Morgan found inconsistency
in his

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.309
own linkage theory. He found that even when
his factors were

00:29:09.309 --> 00:29:11.701
connected on the same chromosome, he could
still see some

00:29:11.701 --> 00:29:15.250
degree of what looked like “independent
assortment”, even

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:18.410
though it was rare (remember the purple-eyed,
normal-

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:22.880
winged flies? – he did get some of them).
He called this

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.740
phenomenon “crossing over” and he envisaged
the physical

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.440
exchange of parts between chromosomes occurring
at the

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:49.169
cross-over points, or chiasmata.
This 

00:29:49.169 --> 00:29:52.419
theory of crossing-over was greeted by much
skepticism

00:29:52.419 --> 00:29:56.190
at the time, until 1931 when Harriet Creighton
and Barbara

00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:00.040
McClintock were able to visualize reciprocal
exchange of

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.600
genetic material at much higher resolution.
Nowadays, of

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:09.970
course, we call this process of genetic exchange
recombination, and it is an extremely important

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:14.840
mechanism
for generating genetic diversity during reproduction.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:18.370
So the third revolution is the chromosomal
theory of inheritance –

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:22.820
linking Mendelian ideas of heredity into the
physical structure of

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:27.309
chromosomes, which behave so as to obey Mendel’s
first law, and

00:30:27.309 --> 00:30:32.140
disobey his second where factors are linked
on the same chromosome.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.390
Morgan’s work was utterly extraordinary.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:38.970
Who would have thought it would be possible
to localize in these

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:42.030
chromosomes, which are only a micrometer or
so long (that’s one

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:47.070
thousandth of a mm), thousands of hereditary
factors, accounting for all

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:51.419
of the characters that makes every organism
what it is, and do it all by

00:30:51.419 --> 00:30:57.400
analyzing the results of fruit fly crosses!
When Morgan got the Nobel

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.410
Prize in 1933, his work was likened to the
astronomical calculation of

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:07.760
celestial bodies still unseen but later on
found by the telescope, but

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:13.190
more so. It was said that Morgan’s predictions
exceed this by far,

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.940
because they mean something principally new,
something that has not

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.840
been observed before.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.510
In Morgan’s own words “That the fundamental
aspects of

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:29.179
heredity should have turned out to be so extraordinarily
simple supports us in the hope that nature

00:31:29.179 --> 00:31:34.049
may, after all, be
entirely approachable. Her much-advertised

00:31:34.049 --> 00:31:37.309
inscrutability
has once more been found to be an illusion

00:31:37.309 --> 00:31:41.220
due to our
ignorance. This is encouraging, for, if the

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.890
world in which we
live were as complicated as some of our friends

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.090
would have
us believe we might well despair that biology

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:51.690
could ever
become an exact science”.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:56.280
The term “gene” was first coined in 1909
by Johanssen

00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:03.950
to describe physical and functional units
of heredity, but the role of genes wasn’t

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:07.750
clarified until the
1940s in a landmark study by George Beadle

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:11.340
and Edward
Tatum that takes us to the start of our 4th

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.640
revolution, the
molecular biology revolution.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.650
This major revolution actually consists of
several sub-

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:20.640
revolutions, some of which seem to get more
air-time than

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.600
others, but for simplicity, and in the interests
of time I have

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.669
lumped together about 40 years of work and
several of

00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:31.010
these sub-revolutions and will now attempt
a whistle-stop

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.860
tour which takes us up to the 1980s.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:37.740
Beadle and Tatum were working on the haploid
fungus

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:44.740
Neurospora. They irradiated Neurospora
cells to induce mutations and then tested

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.600
cultures for
interesting mutant phenotypes. They found

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.400
numerous
mutants that had defective nutrition, for

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:54.470
example in the
biosynthetic pathway by which arginine is

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:58.280
made in the cell.
They were able to block the pathway at different

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.630
steps with
different mutants, eventually figuring that

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:06.480
each gene
controlled one specific enzyme in a series

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.530
of interconnected
steps in a biochemical pathway – the one

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.820
gene-one enzyme
hypothesis. Beadle and Tatum’s hypothesis

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.360
was a significant
unifying concept, because it provided a bridge

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.250
that brought
together the two major research areas of genetics

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:28.090
and
biochemistry. So sub-revolution number 1:

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.570
one gene-one
enzyme (or protein).

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:34.460
What were genes made of? To answer this question
we need

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.960
to start with Frederick Griffith in 1928,
performing

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.670
experiments on the bacterium streptococcus
pneumonia.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:44.440
Some strains of this bacterium are lethal
when injected into

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.610
mice while other non-virulent strains are
not.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:52.670
Griffith made the puzzling observation that
if he injected the

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:56.240
non-virulent strain into mice together with
a heat-killed

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.010
virulent strain (which on its own would not
be lethal), the

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:04.110
mice died. Live bacterial cells could be recovered
from the

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:08.040
dead mice, which were virulent when injected
into live mice.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.599
Somehow, the cell debris of the heat-killed
virulent cells had

00:34:11.599 --> 00:34:16.020
converted the non-virulent live cells into
virulent ones – in

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.049
other words the cells had become transformed.

00:34:20.049 --> 00:34:23.730
Now we fast forward to 1944 when Oswald Avery
working

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:26.570
with two colleagues MacLeod and McCarty, set
out to

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.090
chemically destroy all the major chemical
components of the

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:33.899
dead cells one by one, and test if the extract
had lost the

00:34:33.899 --> 00:34:40.290
ability to transform. You can guess what they
found – DNA –

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:44.599
not polysaccharides or proteins or fats or
RNA – just DNA,

00:34:44.599 --> 00:34:49.300
plain and simple. DNA is the transforming
principle and this

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:54.330
was the first demonstration that genes are
composed of DNA.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.919
Sub-revolution number 2: DNA is the genetic
material

00:34:56.919 --> 00:35:01.420
contained in genes which confer characteristics.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.870
Between you and me, this was a bit of a let
down. How could such a

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:11.150
low-complexity molecule as DNA encode the
diversity of all life on the

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:15.880
planet? DNA was already known, you see, because
it was first isolated as

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:32.810
nuclein, by Meischer in 1869. Following Meischer’s
discovery of DNA, the Russian biochemist Levene

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:37.400
worked out that DNA
was a polynucleotide in 1919, by doing what

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:41.880
biochemists tend to do –
chopping things up (using hydrolysis in this

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:47.840
case), with each nucleotide
being composed of just one of four nucleotide

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.619
bases, a sugar molecule
and a phosphate group.

00:35:51.619 --> 00:35:55.800
Sub-revolution number 3: DNA is composed of
four nucleotide bases, a

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.660
sugar molecule and a phosphate group. Levene
proposed what he

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:03.450
called a tetranucleotide structure, in which
nucleotides were always

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:11.800
linked in the same order G-C-T-A-G-C-T-A,
but scientists eventually realized that this

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:16.070
was oversimplistic, and that
the order of nucleotides is in fact highly

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:22.940
variable. Sub-revolution
number 4: the order of bases in a DNA molecule

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:29.240
is variable (perhaps it
acts as a code).

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:34.030
It was Chargaff, who worked out that the amount
of adenine (A) is usually similar to the amount

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.010
of
thymine (T), and the amount of guanine (G)

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:40.849
usually approximates the amount of cytosine
(C) . Chargaff was very inspired

00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:44.340
by Avery’s 1944 paper. He wrote “Avery
gave us

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.550
the first text of a new language, or rather
he

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:51.869
showed us where to look for it. I resolved
to search

00:36:51.869 --> 00:36:57.160
for this text.” Sub-revolution number 5:
A=T, C=G.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.140
Chargaff’s work, together with some crucially
important X-

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.070
ray crystallography work by English researchers
Rosalind

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:08.510
Franklin and Maurice Wilkins,
paved the way for Watson and Crick’s derivation

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.180
of the
three-dimensional, double helical model for

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.640
the structure of
DNA in 1953.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:17.790
In their Nature paper Watson and Crick began
“we wish to

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:23.860
suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribonucleic
acid

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.890
(DNA). This structure has novel features,
which are of

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:34.220
considerable biological interest.” This
was no mean feat –

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:38.920
you could fit 25,000 strands of DNA, side
by side, in the

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.960
width of a single adult hair. And this is
sub-revolution

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.770
number 6, one of the biggies: DNA structure
.

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:53.500
One long molecule spiraling around in a double
helix. Equisite, simple, ordered and regular.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.200
2
strands, each with a strong backbone made

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.100
of
sugar and phosphate, with the bases on the

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:04.850
inside, A pairing with T and C with G. Watson
and Crick’s discovery of the structure of

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:07.099
DNA is
considered by some to be the most important

00:38:07.099 --> 00:38:09.920
biological discovery of the 20th century.
The

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.240
reason for this is that the double helix
structure fulfilled the three requirements

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.300
for a
hereditary substance:

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:22.369
Firstly - sequence. The 4 bases make up an
alphabet of four letters – a genetic code

00:38:22.369 --> 00:38:26.330
to specify
the sequence of amino acids in proteins – known

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.890
to
be crucial for cellular functions. Fred Sanger

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.331
had
determined the first protein amino acid sequence

00:38:31.331 --> 00:38:35.250
of insulin in 1951, so the amino acid sequence
was

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:40.050
begging for some kind of genetic code. Perhaps
the

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:42.700
genetic code could write information in DNA
as a

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.980
sequence of nucleotides and then translate
it into a

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:48.070
different language of amino acid sequences
in a

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.340
protein.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:55.950
Secondly - if the base sequence of DNA specifies
the amino acid sequence in proteins, then

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:59.609
change,
or mutation, is possible by the substitution

00:38:59.609 --> 00:39:03.170
of one
type of base for another at one or more positions

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:06.270
–
giving rise to altered proteins and likely

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:11.369
altered
cellular function. This is heavy stuff – mutation

00:39:11.369 --> 00:39:16.660
would account for the genetic variation investigated
by Mendel, and the driving force of natural

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:22.440
selection in Darwinian evolution. No wonder
Francis Crick burst into the Eagle pub in

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:27.520
Cambridge
on Feb 28th 1953 and said “we have discovered

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.930
the
secret of life”

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:34.390
Thirdly - copying. As Watson and Crick stated
in the

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:36.920
concluding words of their paper “it has
not

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.780
escaped our notice that the specific pairing
we

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:46.400
have postulated immediately suggests a possible
copying mechanism for the genetic material”

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.850
. If you have pairing, and
free nucleotides in the cell, and enzymes,

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:54.990
then you
have DNA replication. And here’s an extraordinary

00:39:54.990 --> 00:40:05.111
fact: everyday we each produce around 60 billion
new cells, replicating in excess of 100 billion

00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:10.460
metres
of DNA in the process. That is the distance

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.120
to Mars
and back!

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:18.100
So DNA is a code, a code that holds all the
information to make all living things, an

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.580
instruction
manual to make a worm or a cat, or a fly or

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.710
a
human or a dinosaur. Its regularity, stability

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.950
and
predictability make it the perfect system

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:30.180
for storing
the vast amount of information necessary for

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.280
building life. The information is passed to
every cell

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.690
of an organism because perfect copies are
made

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.359
prior to each cell division, and one copy
of

00:40:38.359 --> 00:40:41.710
everything is distributed to each reproductive
cell

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:49.570
or gamete in the germ line and thence passed
through the generations.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.660
Sub-revolution number 7 is the cracking of
the

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.870
code. Convincing proof that a codon (a sequence
of

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:59.430
nucleotides that code for one amino acid)
is, in fact,

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:05.320
3 letters long, came from extremely elegant
experiments in 1961 by Francis Crick, Sydney

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.859
Brenner and co-workers using mutations in
viruses

00:41:07.859 --> 00:41:13.700
that infect bacteria, called bacteriophage.
Essentially, they found that combinations

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:17.310
of three
nucleotide additions or three deletions were

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:21.230
okay,
suggesting a triplet code. The code was cracked

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:23.760
later that same year by Nirenberg, Matthaei
and

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.520
colleagues, so that individual amino acids
could be

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.160
associated with particular codons.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:34.830
The next thing that exercised the molecular
biologists was the business of gene regulation,

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:37.071
sub-
revolution number 8. The

00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:41.240
problem was that if DNA codes for proteins
that

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.650
give cells their particular characteristics,
and all the

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:46.580
cells of an organism of a particular species
contain

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:50.750
the same DNA sequence (because the DNA
sequence is of course the thing that defines

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:54.060
the
particular species), then how come cells can

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.369
do
different things at different times in different

00:41:56.369 --> 00:41:59.690
parts
of the body and so on?

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:04.000
The breakthrough involved Jacques Monod, a
young Parisian molecular

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.040
biologist and Francois Jacob, a medical student
intent on becoming a

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:17.430
surgeon. After the invasion of France, Jacob
served as a medic in the

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:21.420
free French forces before he was badly wounded,
Monod joined the

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:25.961
resistance where he met another molecular
biologist Andre Lwoff. After

00:42:25.961 --> 00:42:30.300
the liberation of Paris Monod served in the
French army, and happened

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:38.080
upon, in a mobile US army library, Avery’s
article suggesting that DNA is

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:47.260
the hereditary material (!).

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:51.050
With his interest in genetics rekindled, he
joined Lwoff after the war to

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:54.330
work on phage and bacteria, as did Jacob,
whose injuries were too

00:42:54.330 --> 00:43:01.820
severe for him to pursue a career in surgery.
The cast of three was set . Over the next

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.010
decade one of the most
creative and productive collaborations in

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:10.780
the history of genetics worked
out how genes are turned on and off with a

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:22.330
toggle switch, how they
can make a protein, or not. Essentially, they

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:25.820
found that genes govern the
formation of proteins that can block the expression

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:31.109
of other genes by
binding to and acting on the DNA itself.

00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:35.310
Their findings were deduced entirely from
genetic evidence,

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:39.869
from studying the effects of mutations. In
Horace Freeland

00:43:39.869 --> 00:43:45.330
Judson’s wonderful book “The Eighth Day
of Creation”, which

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.369
describes the ferment of the whole molecular
biology

00:43:47.369 --> 00:43:50.910
revolution, Jacob and Monod’s work is described
as making

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:55.960
“things that were utterly dark, very simple”.
The concept of

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.520
the genetic switch went far beyond bacterial
enzymes and

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.810
viruses. They understood, and were able to
articulate with

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:06.200
exceptional eloquence, how their discoveries
about gene

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.260
regulation pertained to the general mysteries
of cell

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.560
differentiation and embryonic development
in animals, where

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.359
the problem of the common set of genetic instructions
in

00:44:15.359 --> 00:44:20.560
every cell is particularly acute. “what
is true for E. coli is also

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.200
true for the elephant”, quipped Monod.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.330
And that brings us to the end of the molecular
biology

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:30.250
revolution, which culminated in a molecular
understanding

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:34.160
of the nature of the gene, including a copying
mechanism for

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:37.619
DNA through organisms and through generations
that meant

00:44:37.619 --> 00:44:40.420
that heredity and the flow of genetic information
could

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:44.620
finally be understood in a much more tangible
way, involving

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:48.490
real molecules behaving in a way that is entirely
in keeping

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:52.620
with their structure. Thus the grand unifying
theory of

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.140
genetics and evolution could now be understood
at

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.880
molecular resolution.

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:05.310
What next? My 5th major revolution is forward
genetics –

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:08.010
using the genetic approach to understand not
just hereditary

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:10.380
mechanisms, but many other problems in biology.

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:16.839
It had been discovered by Muller in 1927 that
bombarding an organism (in his

00:45:16.839 --> 00:45:20.260
case a fly) with X rays or treating it with
particular

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:26.090
chemicals could induce large numbers of inherited
mutations with clear effects on the morphology

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:29.660
–
the phenotype - of an organism. That of course

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.940
is
because the mutations cause a change in the

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.180
DNA
sequence, stopping the particular proteins

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:37.920
encoded by that DNA from working properly.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.920
Biologists started to use the genetic approach
(ie the study

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:45.030
of mutants) to try to understand how genes
influenced other

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:48.220
hitherto mysterious bits of biology, one of
the most

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:51.230
important of these being development.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:54.520
How does an organism develop from an egg to
an adult –

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.240
how does it end up the right size, with the
right number of

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:00.130
cells, all in the right place, doing the right
thing, at the right

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:04.380
time. It seemed like a problem of staggering
complexity, but

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.710
the problem could be reduced with the use
of model

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:10.530
organisms like Drosophila and others newer
on the scene like

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:14.970
the nematode worm C. elegans, introduced in
the 1970s.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:17.710
You can see the power of this work by looking
at the

00:46:17.710 --> 00:47:31.960
phenotypes of 

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:49.869
some 

00:47:49.869 --> 00:47:57.080
of the mutants.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:02.550
Although this approach had been used since
the 1920s it

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:06.420
took on a new vigour in the 1970s and 1980s,
firstly because

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.730
biologists now understood the nature of the
gene and could

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:12.220
map mutants using Morgan’s discovery of
linkage and the

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.890
chromosome theory, secondly because techniques
became

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.820
established for working out the sequence of
DNA, and

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:20.160
thirdly because it became possible to make
transgenic

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.240
animals.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.090
That meant that the precise gene that had
gone wrong in

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:27.890
the mutant could be pinpointed, and also that
DNA could be

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:31.349
isolated in vitro, mucked about with and then
introduced

00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:35.010
into an organism like a fly or a worm, or
a yeast cell or even

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.070
a mouse.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:40.310
This approach has now blown apart much of
biology. We now

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:43.900
understand, for example, much of the molecular
details of how cell

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.560
division is controlled, how cells in embryos
take on the correct identity,

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:53.180
how cells and axons migrate to the right destination,
how gender is

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:58.610
determined, how some cells undergo programmed
cell death – the list is

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:03.290
extremely long and I could name examples for
several hours. What is

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:06.320
more, because of the techniques of transgenesis,
it was possible to

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:09.060
introduce DNA from one species into another.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:16.230
Paul Nurse pioneered this work in the
1980s, showing that the human counterpart

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:22.349
of the yeast cdc2 gene was
able to “rescue” yeast mutants that were

00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:27.741
unable to divide properly
because of a defect in their cdc2 gene. In

00:49:27.741 --> 00:49:33.491
other words the human genes
and yeast genes were very similar, their function

00:49:33.491 --> 00:49:38.180
was said to be
conserved. This was crucially important, because

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:41.750
it meant that, as had
been suspected previously, work on simple

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:46.589
organisms ultimately informs
our knowledge of human biology and disease;

00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:50.260
model organisms
became biomedically significant.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:56.130
Using the genetic approach we have even begun
to understand how lifespan is genetically

00:49:56.130 --> 00:50:53.710
programmed and how
behavior may be controlled.

00:50:53.710 --> 00:51:00.610
The really revolutionary thing about forward
genetics is its unbiased approach. The

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:03.740
investigator observes a bunch of mutants until
he

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:07.200
or she finds one that displays a defect in
the

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:12.140
process of choice, thus revealing an important
mechanism, and one that can be understood

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.010
at
the biochemical level once the sequence of

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:18.500
the
mutant gene is revealed.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.930
The work is unbiased because no assumptions
are made

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:23.500
about the biochemistry of the process under
investigation

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.880
– phenotypic analysis leads the geneticist
to the important

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.300
genes. A geneticist cannot be fussy about
what kinds of

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:35.089
genes and proteins they want to work on because
the

00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:38.910
genetics could lead them anywhere, they are
lead purely

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:41.540
and simply by phenotype.

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.740
The work is still going on, of course, but
we have made

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.600
massive progress in the last 40 years in using
genetics to

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:50.280
understand how life works, and this extraordinary
effort is

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.550
my 5th major revolution in genetics – using
mutants to

00:51:53.550 --> 00:52:00.109
understand anything in biology that is genetically
programmed (which is pretty much everything

00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:01.510
in biology!).

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:04.970
My 6th and penultimate revolution in genetics
is

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:08.590
genome sequencing and genomics. This work
was

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:14.860
started by Fred Sanger in 1977, who had already
developed a method for

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:23.810
determining the amino acid sequence of proteins
– hence the two Nobel prizes he ended up

00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:24.810
with.

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:27.020
Once the technique for sequencing small stretches
of DNA

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:29.750
was worked out, the next thing was to scale
up and sequence

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:33.000
a whole genome, ushering in the field of genomics
– the

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:41.300
study of whole genomes. The bacterium Hemophilus
influenza was the first free-living organism

00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:45.400
to be sequenced in
1995, followed by yeast in 1996, the first

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:49.810
multicellular animal,
C. elegans in 1998, the fruit fly in 2000

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:55.280
and human genome,
first draft in 2001 and completion in 2003.

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:59.090
This was an extraordinary
achievement, involving many hundreds of different

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:02.290
workers
from all over the world over a period of around

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:07.230
13 years, and
costing around 2.7 billion dollars. If you

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:12.109
typed the whole
genetic code out (typing at 200 letters per

00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:17.200
minute) it would
take 29 years, without taking any breaks!

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:22.660
And yet we’ve got
that inside every single one of our 40 trillion

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:26.390
cells, and our
enzymatic machines can copy it in a matter

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:27.390
of minutes.

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:34.369
“We’ve now got to the point in human history”,
said John Sulston, who spearheaded the project

00:53:34.369 --> 00:53:38.130
in the UK, and also worked
tirelessly to ensure that the data remained

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:44.180
in the public domain “Where
for the first time we are going to hold in

00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:47.890
our hands the set of
instructions to make a human being”. What

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:52.119
is even more extraordinary
than this, though, is what has happened since.

00:53:52.119 --> 00:53:55.570
The technology has
developed so fast that it is now possible

00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:59.670
to sequence the human
genome for under a thousand dollars in a matter

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:02.680
of hours.

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:05.110
Thousands of different kinds of organisms
have had their genome

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:11.040
sequenced. The tsunami of data is so huge
that this is, of itself, a huge

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:16.250
problem, in terms of storage alone, let alone
analysis. It was estimated

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:24.270
back in 2013 that biologists around the world
churn out 13 petabases of

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:31.079
sequence a year (1 Pb = 1 million Gigabases,
which is a thousand

00:54:31.079 --> 00:54:35.260
megabases). If this were stored on regular
DVDs, the resulting stack

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:49.270
would be 2.2 miles tall! So this 6th revolution
provides challenges, as we

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:53.160
shall see is also the case for the 7th and
last revolution.

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:56.800
It is easy to be dazzled by the possible uses
of

00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.810
genome information. Sequencing
the genome of your cancer cells may allow

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:03.840
oncologists to tailor-make your treatment
to

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.280
increase the chances of success. The speculation
is

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.990
that health care professionals will eventually
be

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:14.829
able to use genomic information to predict
what

00:55:14.829 --> 00:55:20.230
diseases a person may get in the future and
attempt to minimize the risk, or even eliminate

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:22.370
it
all together through the implementation of

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:25.150
personalized, preventative medicine.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:29.680
This is not at all straightforward though,
largely because

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:33.860
human disease is rarely caused by mutations
in a single gene

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:38.140
that can be easily traced, such as cystic
fibrosis. Most disease

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:41.600
such as heart disease or cancer, or mental
illness, will result

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.819
from an extremely complex interaction of many
different

00:55:44.819 --> 00:55:48.280
genes with each other and with the environment.
There is a

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.510
public misconception that scientists are discovering
“the

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:55.840
genes for” disease on a daily basis, not
to mention “the genes

00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:00.680
for” characteristics, such as binge-drinking
or forgetfulness, or

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:02.710
intelligence, or beauty.

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:09.290
Very little in human biology is straightforwardly
deterministic at the genetic level. Genomics

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:14.089
is better
understood as probabilistic: a whole host

00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:18.260
of genetic factors
contribute to the odds, but the outcome is

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:22.130
decided by an
even greater range of genetic, biological

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:24.000
and environmental
influences.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.720
Thus, I do not think we need to take too gloomy
and dystopian a view of medical genomics.

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:31.820
It is
true that there are ethical debates to be

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:34.680
had
around single gene disorders. What about late-

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.840
onset disease with no cure? Would you want
to

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.510
know? If you do decide to know, then what
about

00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:42.260
your family – doesn’t your diagnosis affect
them,

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:44.349
too? Supposing they don’t want to know?
What

00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:47.250
are the psychological impacts? Could there
be

00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:48.690
genetic discrimination?

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:52.150
But it is simply just not going to be possible
to devise

00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:58.000
simple genetic tests for intelligence or
creativity, thank goodness, or even heart

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.050
disease,
diabetes, or schizophrenia. It is just too

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:02.970
complicated, and
never let anyone tell you any different. I’m

00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:07.829
sure there will
be an explosion in internet companies offering

00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:12.280
such tests
in the future. They should probably be banned,

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.810
not
because they might give you devastating information,

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:17.089
but
because they will almost certainly give you

00:57:17.089 --> 00:57:19.500
misleading
information.

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.970
A probabilistic view, on the other hand, might
tell you how

00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:26.140
best to avoid your own personal risks. Part
of me thinks,

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:29.360
however, that the advice will boil down to
needing to eat

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:34.180
less fat, drink less alcohol and take more
exercise. Now

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.720
where have we heard that before?

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:38.490
I do not want to give you the impression that
genomics poses

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:41.310
no social or ethical challenges: there are
questions of

00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:45.190
ownership, privacy and access, and certainly
need for debate.

00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:50.250
The debate needs to be had between well-informed
stakeholders who understand the science - not

00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:52.740
lobby groups
with a particular agenda.

00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:56.220
So that is the 6th revolution in genetics
– the genomic

00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:59.869
revolution. The outcome of this revolution
is as yet unclear.

00:57:59.869 --> 00:58:03.300
But one thing that is certain is that genome
sequence

00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:07.700
information brings all of life closer together
than was ever

00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:15.480
thought possible. Literally thousands
of genome sequences are now available, and

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.890
comparative
genomics allows us to interrogate evolutionary

00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:21.810
relationships
between different species with more resolution

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:23.520
than ever
before.

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:26.250
DNA is not just an instruction manual for
the

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:27.830
making of an organism – a human, a bat or
a

00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:33.050
mouse – it is also a history book, a historical
record of all the genetic mutations that have

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:38.050
happened, by chance, to make us what we are,
and to make everything else what it is. We

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:41.420
are all
related through an unbroken chain of many

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:47.660
billions of copyings through 4 billion years.
Imagine how excited Darwin and Mendel would

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:51.450
have been if they had known all this.

00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:56.560
My final revolution in genetics, the 7th revolution,
also takes us into the

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:01.000
future, but this revolution, unlike the genomics
revolution, has only just

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.950
begun. It is genome editing using what is
called the CRISPR-Cas9

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:10.079
system. Geneticists have developed several
techniques for genome

00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:13.819
editing – ie changing the genetic makeup
of organisms by causing

00:59:13.819 --> 00:59:20.470
targeted change in the nucleotide sequence
- in the past. But the revolutionary thing

00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:25.230
about CRISPR-Cas9 is that it works
with extremely high efficiency and is very

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:26.230
versatile.

00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:30.630
So what on earth is it? The technique makes
use of the natural immune

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:34.320
defences of bacteria, which have come up with
“molecular scissors” to

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:38.210
remove unwanted DNA, for example DNA transferred
by an infecting

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:44.569
virus. These molecular scissors, or nucleases
– the Cas9 - can cut out

00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:49.820
sections of DNA with extreme precision. They
are guided to cut the

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:57.900
precise bit of DNA to be modified by a synthetically
made guide RNA

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:01.200
that directs the cut through hybridization
with its matching genomic

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.160
sequence. When the cell repairs the break,
errors can occur to generate

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.480
a knockout of that gene or additional modifications
can be introduced.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.730
This technology therefore has the potential
to re-write the

01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:17.900
genetic code. Genetic conditions could therefore
be treated

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.910
by modifying the DNA of affected cells, like
rubbing out so

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.110
many typos.

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:27.829
There is the possibility of radical new therapies
for a range of

01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:31.640
diseases. Although single gene disorders are
rare, if you add

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.960
them up they affect an awful lot of people,
so collectively

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:41.790
they are not rare. Genetic Alliance UK estimates
that 5.5% of

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:44.600
the UK population suffer from one of 6000
Mendelian

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:51.290
(caused by a mutation in just one gene) diseases
by age 25 –

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:56.260
that is 3.5 million people. So the impact
of genome editing in

01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.770
these patients and their families could be
enormous.

01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:07.760
Human embryos could also be modified, such
that the disease-causing

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.609
mutation is over-ridden, not just in that
individual,

01:01:11.609 --> 01:01:13.700
but in their children, their children’s
children, and

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:21.240
so on. Is this a good plan? Research institutions,
funders and scientists have called for a renewed

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:28.310
debate on the ethics of modifying human embryos,
before the science gets ahead of public opinion.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.950
The overwhelming view of scientists at present
is

01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:33.859
that the procedure is too new to know how
safe it

01:01:33.859 --> 01:01:36.869
is. One big concern is that a public backlash
could

01:01:36.869 --> 01:01:39.780
impact on the race to develop new and safe
therapies.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:45.500
So do we go out to bravely meet this vision,
as Thucydides

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:50.660
would have said, glory and danger alike? Is
this playing God?

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:54.010
Is editing the human germline a “line that
should never be

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:58.869
crossed”? Is it the first step on the road
to designer babies?

01:01:58.869 --> 01:02:01.680
Whatever we may think about the answer to
this question,

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.200
one thing is resoundingly clear. Talking about
it is essential,

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.930
like for genomic-based diagnosis. Public debate
must be at a

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:14.510
high level, with all parties understanding
the science, such

01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:18.119
that rhetoric doesn’t get to replace fact.

01:02:18.119 --> 01:02:22.240
Public trust in science depends on openness,
transparency

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.470
and effective regulation, and this is the
approach that must

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:29.790
be taken. There is no scientific answer to
what is the “right”

01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:33.560
response to the potential use of technology.
That answer has

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.900
to be provided by society

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.859
The amazing thing for me about the CRISPR-
Cas9 system is that once again, evolution

01:02:40.859 --> 01:02:44.079
shows
us the way. Evolution has come up with these

01:02:44.079 --> 01:02:49.240
remarkable enzymes and we have the privilege
of being intelligent enough to make use of

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:53.180
them. So this brings me full circle, from
Darwin

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:59.940
and his lack of a theory of heredity, through
Mendel, Morgan, the DNA folk, to genomics

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:02.010
and
genome editing.

01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:05.079
This has been a whistle-stop tour and I have
left

01:03:05.079 --> 01:03:07.819
out countless important revolutions on the
way, including

01:03:07.819 --> 01:03:11.530
Barbara McClintock’s work on jumping genes,
or transposable

01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:13.680
elements, showing that genomes are not static
at all but

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.700
highly dynamic, technological revolutions
such as PCR and

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.480
gene cloning, that paved the way for the revolution
in

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.950
genome editing, newish ideas about epigenetics
and

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:30.280
revolutions in the RNA world…in fact Genetics
is so exciting

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.740
and revolutionary that it is hardly possible
to say anything at

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.430
all in an hour.

01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:40.030
If I were to sum up what I’ve said in one
sentence, it would be

01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:44.460
to note the extraordinary counterpoint in
biology between

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:52.170
astonishing variety on the one hand, yet astonishing
constancy in fundamental mechanisms on the

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:53.170
other.

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:55.670
I’m sure that you will agree with me that
the revolutions

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:59.170
are, if anything, gaining in momentum, so
we are in for

01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:00.430
exciting times...

01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:06.619
If you were to ask JBS Haldane about the
future of biology he would say the following:

01:04:06.619 --> 01:04:10.100
“In forecasting
the future of scientific research there is

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:16.190
one quite general law
to be noted. The unexpected always happens.

01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:19.160
So one can be
quite sure that the future will make any detailed

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.369
predictions
look silly. Yet an actual research worker

01:04:23.369 --> 01:04:27.410
can perhaps see a
little further than the intelligent onlooker.

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:33.040
Even so, it may
seem presumptious for any one man, especially

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.369
one who is
almost completely ignorant of botany, to attempt

01:04:36.369 --> 01:04:40.750
to cover,
however inadequately, the whole field of biological

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:41.750
investigation.”

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:49.040
I hope you will forgive me my terrible oversights
if I end with another quote from Haldane:

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:52.440
“My
own suspicion is that the universe is not

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.300
only
queerer than we suppose, but queerer than

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.680
we
CAN suppose”.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.260
Thank you!
