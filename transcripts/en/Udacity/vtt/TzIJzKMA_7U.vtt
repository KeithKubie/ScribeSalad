00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.420
There are three main types of mobile
ads that can be used in a game.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.570
Banner ads, interstitial ads,
and offer walls.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.370
The most commonly used ads are banner
ads, which are banners, at the top or

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.890
bottom of the screen.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.910
These are simple to place in your game
without obscuring the whole screen.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.400
And you can size them to
fit different devices.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.350
&gt;&gt; Another type of ad is interstitial
ads which take up the whole screen and

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.712
the user has to manually close them.

00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:31.160
They auto-fit the screen or
whatever device you're on.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.510
And so you want to put them at
natural pauses in the game.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.100
Because these ads take up more space,
and more of a player's attention than

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.930
banner ads, users are much
more likely to click on them.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.129
And this makes these ads a little
more profitable than banner ads.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.510
&gt;&gt; They take a lot of the screen
like interstitial ads,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.840
but also include videos to watch.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.470
And after you watch them, you can get
game power ups or in-game currency.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.790
These are all good ways of
integrating ads into your game.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.940
But it's important not
to have too many ads

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.390
because they may start
to seem like spam.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.050
So place your adds at points where
it seems natural to pause and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.080
keep your game experience a priority.
