00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.025
Recently, we've been predicting changes in graphs based on changes in

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:08.568
equations. So let's work the other way around for a second. Here's the graph of

00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:12.906
a function. I'm going to call this graph A. And I'd like us to consider this

00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:18.770
our original graph. Now, graph B over here is a transformed version of graph A.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.406
Now, I didn't size these graphs perfectly, so B's a little bit shrunk. But the

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:28.338
only thing that's happening. In order for graph A, to become graph B. Is first,

00:00:28.338 --> 00:00:33.322
it's shifted in some direction. Either right, left, up, or down. By some number

00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:38.658
of units. And then it's reflected. Either in the x axis. Or in the y axis. I

00:00:38.658 --> 00:00:41.912
would like you to feel in the sentence properly. To describe this

00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:44.039
transformation, from A to B.
