00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.260
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D. C.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.250
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: On behalf of
the library, I quickly wanted

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.090
to take a minute to
give my condolences

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.520
to all the Iranian women,
Persian-speaking audiences

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.810
in Afghanistan, Tajikistan
and elsewhere for the passing

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.410
of the poetess Simin Behbahani.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.410
It is with a heavy heart that
I say this in the exhibition.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.430
We have selected a whole section
on women who do Persian Poetry

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.970
and Persian language works from
Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.860
Simin is one of the
most important poetesses

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.770
of the current time,
the Lioness of Iran.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.650
And known as the national
poet of Iran.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.570
Dr. Billington and maybe Jane

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.710
when they visited Iran
in 2004 met with her.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.070
She was gracious enough
to give her time.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.400
And it is a matter of great
sadness to us all to see her pass.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.950
And with that I'm going to pass
the grand to Dr. Fatemeh Keshavarz

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.530
and ask her to introduce
our lovely speaker.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.830
Thank you very much.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.340
There you go.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.080
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz:
Farzaneh and I go way back.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.110
There has been no particularly
important turning point in my life

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.540
in which he hasn't been involved,
whether it was being out for tenure

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.200
or getting promoted or you know,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.730
going from institution
to institution.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.300
To actually reading each other's
work and also reading my manuscript

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.060
and always being a wonderful
reader and supporter.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.290
So it is with special
pleasure that I introduce.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.770 position:56%
Farzaneh did a Ph. D in
comparative literature in University

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.540
of California, UCLA,
and I believe she worked

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.410 position:56%
with Amin Benoni [spelling assumed].

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.960
I also know she worked closely

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.020
with many other scholars including
Ishmat Moyedin [spelling assumed]

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.320
and others.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.970
But I believe that Amin
Benoni was crucial.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.300
And we do indeed miss him.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.400
He's been a really important voice

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.650
in criticism and particularly
poetry.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.820
And in her thesis, Fazaneh
worked on Forough Farrokhzhad

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.760
from the feminist perspective.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.730
So this has been a topic
that's been very close

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.890
to her heart for a very long time.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.630
She's written close to 100
if not more I'm sure articles

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.460
and book chapters and op-eds and
just contributions that just range

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.280
from highly specialized
and scholarly to things

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.930
that would appear in New York
Times or Washington Post.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.170
And do that very important
job of reaching

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.660
out to the broader
interested public.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.850
Her first book, her first
major book actually in English,

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.870
Veils and Words is a classic.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:34.520
It's about wars that
women poets and writers,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.300
their journey within the Persian
culture and you know from 17, 18,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.350
19th century to the present time.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.860
And her latest book, which I
believe came out in 2011, yes,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.970
Words Not Swords, takes that
another step forward on what it is

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.640
that women and women's
literature, and looking at it

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.670 position:56%
from a gendered lens does to
understand the role of these voices,

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.710
rather than considering
them silent or censored.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.830
So that has been a
tremendous contribution.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.370
I believe you're working
on a biography of Forough,

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.870
so we are eagerly looking
forward to that and with

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.410
that I'm just going
to invite Fazaneh.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.510
Please join me in giving
her a very warm welcome.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.950
Farzanah Milani: Thank you for
taking the time in the middle

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.550
of a beautiful Wednesday
to come and hear

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.000
about Forough Farrokhzhad
and to listen to me.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.260
You honor me with your presence.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.490
Thank you again.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:54.050
I'm humbled to talk in the
presence of some giants

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.070
in this field of modern literature.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.730
I have my colleague Anna
Corinna Cook [spelling assumed]

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.600
for whose work I have
great admiration.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.310
I've written about it.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.160
So it's not only now that I say it.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.710
And of course my dear
friend Fatemeh Keshavarz

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.250
from whom I have learned
a great deal.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.530
And the rest of you for being here.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.760
With your permission I would like
to start with a short tribute

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.290
to a woman I love like a mother.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.140
To a poet I admired greatly.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:48.450
I think Iran and all of us Iranians
have lost an enlightened voice

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:54.670
of conscience, an elegant
voice of moderation,

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.200
an audacious voice of dissent.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.020
I really think she's irreplaceable.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.910
And there aren't too
many things in the world

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.470
that I think are irreplaceable.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.970
Samin Behbahani is irreplaceable.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:22.850
I hope her words and her advocacy
for nonviolence, which is central

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:30.810
to her work, will spread
to the four corners

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.510
of this troubled world we live in.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:07:56.040
[ Music ]

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:07.740
Naturally, even though our
government didn't announce much the

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:13.270
passing of this giant of Persian
literature, you saw all the people

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.770
of Iran pay tribute to their poet.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:25.530
In fact, they sang her poems
and these were her own words put

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:31.670
to music by one of our best
singers, Homayoun Shajarian.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.970
And you saw him.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:37.790
He was at the funeral crying.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:43.020
Let's switch now to
Forough Farrokhzhad.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.100
I will tell you a little bit

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.290
about my involvement
with Forough later on.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:55.080
But let me tell you
what I plan to do today.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.760
As Fatemeh mentioned, I've been
working on Forough Farrokhzhad

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:06.640
for 37 years and I am finally
finishing her biography.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:14.340
So it was really hard to condense
it in 45 minutes, in 50 minutes.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.800
So I had to make certain decisions.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.950
So I'm going to focus first
and foremost on the biography

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.370
of this iconoclastic icon.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.730
It's amazing that this woman

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:40.180
who chose the penname Iconoclastic
[inaudible] has herself become a

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.790
poet, an icon.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:52.370
But because there is so little
information about the first part

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:59.260 position:56%
of her life, we know a lot more
about the last 18 years of her life.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.560
In my talk I will focus on
that part and I think most

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.770
of that information
has not been available.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.120
And then in the Q&amp;A
I will be honored

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.830
to answer any questions you have
about the second part of her life.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:22.050
I want to tell you a little bit
about the trials and tribulations

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.970
of writing a biography in Iran.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.490
Of writing a woman's
biography in Iran.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:35.120
And in particular in writing
Forough Farrokhzhad's biography.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:41.410
I believe she is the most
talked-about Iranian woman.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:45.670
I Googled her about a month ago.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.310
I was going to do it last night.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.960
I didn't get a chance
to be up to date.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:57.750
But a month ago if you do a Scholar
Google, Forough Farrokhzhad has

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:04.960
about twice as many hits
as Mohammad Reza Pahlavi

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.610
who ruled Iran for 37 years.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:15.540
So it would be fair to say that
she has become quite popular

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.700
and she's talked about.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:23.590
And finally I would like
to share with you some

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.180
of her unpublished letters

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.490
that I have collected
over the last 37 years.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.620
And that it had taken me
so long to finally decide

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.840
that maybe I'm not invading
her privacy to publish them.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.980
I have been in possession
of some of these letters,

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.460
not all of them, for a long time.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.930
But because they were so personal,

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:54.980
I wasn't sure it's the
right thing to publish them.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:01.560
But given the fact that there is
so much misinformation about her.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:11.240
There is the fact that it's almost
a half a century after her death.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:18.040
I thought maybe it would be the
right thing to publish this,

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:24.630
about 100 pages of unpublished
letters along with the biography.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:30.150
So what do we know about
Farrokhzhad's early life?

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:39.000
You have probably as her
birthday January of 1935.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.700
It's not the right birthday.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.760
There is so many misinformation
about her.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.320
And I'm not sure I can figure
out why, but they're out there.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.980
I have seen her birth certificate.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.280
So with certainty I can
tell you that she was born

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:02.870
on Saturday the 29th
of December 1934.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:07.640
She was born to Turan Vezitabar

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.240
and Muhammad Farrokhzhad
Aroki [assumed spelling].

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:19.210
You will see again in Farrokhzhad's
document her name is Forough

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.480
Kazemoni Farrokhzhad
Aroki [assumed spelling].

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.720
That's her birth certificate.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:35.730
And I will get to why Aroki,
where does that come from.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:40.630
The child was born Forough
Kosimon [assumes spelling],

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:46.350
which significantly
means eternal light.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.750
And of course the occasion
of the birth

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.360
of a child is always
a jubilant occasion.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.530
And hers was too.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:03.110
Except that it was marred by
the absence of the father.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:15.520
Lieutenant Muhammed Farrokhzhad
at the time was in prison.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:23.090
And he was the head of Pahlavi
royal properties, [inaudible].

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:35.360
And for some reason he and a few
others had been put in prison.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.790
So when Forough was
born, he was not there

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:46.780
to welcome his daughter
who was his third child.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:53.300
So Mr. Farrokhzhad was released
from prison after a year.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.890
And like the paradoxical
country that Iran is,

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:03.110
after a year of imprisonment he
returned to his position in Yoshat

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:09.260 position:56%
as the head of the Pahlavi property.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:15.180
So Farrokhzhad was born in Tehran
but she spent the first six years

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:23.270 position:56%
of her life not in Tehran but in
Nowshahr, which is the northern part

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.310
of Tehran in the province
of Mazandaran.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.340 position:56%
They lived in a beautiful big house.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.000
In fact, in front of the
castle of [inaudible].

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.610
On one side was a forest.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:41.150
On the other side was
the Caspian Sea.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.580
And Forough loved the forest.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:50.980
And apparently she was constantly
running through the forest.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.240
What we might not know and
I didn't know for a while is

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:02.780
that Forough was stunningly
beautiful as a baby, as a girl.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:10.280
She had fair complexion, big
black eyes and curly hair.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.170
Blond, curly hair.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.670
Kind of unusual for Iran.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:22.900
And lovingly and I would say
ironically she was called

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.840
Out of Sight Fradanki.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:35.110 position:56%
Now I say ironically because this
little girl was anything but a doll.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:42.270
She refused to be commandeered
by strings like a marionette.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:49.770
Throughout her life and beginning
from her very early childhood,

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:57.230
the prospect of becoming
a puppet horrified her.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:00.090
She had a will of her own.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:07.260
She was willful, determined,
tenacious.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:13.200
I will tell you, I have interviewed
over 60 people, her family members,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.670
her close friends and
some of her colleagues.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:22.570
And most of the information
I give you today are things

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.190
that I have cross-referenced.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.830 position:56%
I've heard some things, if they
were not cross-referenced I've tried

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.970
to avoid saying them.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:37.300 position:56%
But almost any people who knew her
as a child told me that first of all

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.540
when they were in Nowshahr
she preferred the forest.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.850
And when they moved to Tehran
when she was six years old,

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.950
she preferred the street.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:55.990
She was constantly fighting boys
and often gave them a good beating.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:00.960
She scaled walls.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.820
I've heard from a couple of people

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.420
that she was like little
[inaudible].

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.760
Agile like a cat.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:18.770
Really nimble with
gravity-defying agility.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.360
She jumped.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.310
She climbed trees.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:32.250
This is not image of a young
girl in Iran of the '30's.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.120
She was fearless and daring.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:41.660
And these words basically
didn't exist in her lexicon.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.560
A little bit about
Forough's parents,

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:54.360
because they in their own right
are really fascinating people

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.440
and we don't hear about them.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.070
In particular, we barely
every hear about the mother

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:06.390
who was a fascinating woman.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:10.340
She too was a subversive woman.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.910
She was born in 1913.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:19.420
She was unveiled before
the Underling Act of 1936.

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:24.110
She went to the American
school in Tehran.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:31.270
She was not yet 16 when
at a party in the house

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:41.930
of her relative she met this young
Lieutenant Mohammed Farrokhzhad

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:46.330
who was 11 years older.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:52.400
She fell in love with him
and he fell in love with her.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:20:00.100
Turan had lost her father
before she was even born.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.480
Her mother, lovely mother, and in
fact Forough has a few references

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.920
to her grandmother in her poetry.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.820 position:56%
And the more I've learned about
[Foreign name], the more I have come

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.400
to appreciate those lines about the
grandmother in Forough's poetry.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:23.130
Both of them were very
opposed to this wedding.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:29.230
But she was adamant she
wanted to marry him.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.710
And they did.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:37.520
Turan was a very hardworking woman.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.140 position:56%
Everybody talks about her proclivity

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.250
for outspoken simplicity
and honesty.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:50.370
She had a hard time lying,
as her daughter will later.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:54.080
I think one of the most
beautiful characteristics

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:58.260
of Forough Farrakhzhad
is her incapacity to lie.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.150
I'm not saying she never lied.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.610
Such a person probably
doesn't exist.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:08.620
But in a culture of walls and
veils and masks and masquerades,

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:16.410
Forough Farrakhzhad was herself
as much as it was possible to be.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:21.440
Once she was chosen as
the mother of the year.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.430
This is her.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:27.270
This is before the age of 24.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.910
She had already four children.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:36.150
And by the age of 35
she had seven children.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:41.790
And she had a few pregnancies
that did not go to full term.

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.290
Now what about the father?

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.510
Let me tell you one
other thing that I find

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:51.910
so fascinating about
Turan Farrakhzhad.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.660
She was a doll collector.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.800
And because dolls are so
central again in Forough's life

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.690
and in Forough's poetry, one

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.370
of her most beautiful
poems is [foreign words],

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.420
"One Can Be Like a Doll."

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:12.290
To say, "Oh yes, I'm so very
lucky all the time," and be full

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:17.990
of pretenses all the time
-- she didn't like that.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:26.350
Turan Farrakhzhad was a doll
collector and she wanted

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:30.620
to be buried with her
favorite dolls.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:35.210
Unfortunately, due to
the laws of the land,

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:40.090
she was not granted
this last wish of hers.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.890
I have seen some of her dolls

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:46.300
and when they told me this
story it made me really sad

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:51.610
that they wouldn't even
allow her to do that.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:56.780
But her dolls were very
important in her life.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.580
You would think after
seven children -- yeah.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:03.500
Now just a little bit
about the father.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.650
Muhammad Farrokhzhad Aroki,
he was a self-made man.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.610
His last name actually was Rezohi.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:21.780
And when he was in prison earlier,
he had had a few experiences

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:29.190
in prison, he was reading
Persian literature, poetry.

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.430
He loved Persian poetry.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:38.610
And he came across the word
Farrokhzhad and loved it.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.180
So he decided to change
his last name.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.110
So he changed it from
Rezohi to Farrokhzhad.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:54.210
And because he was from Tajrish
in northern Iran and at the time

00:23:54.210 --> 00:24:00.420
in pre-Islamic Iran
Tajrish was called Araq.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.820
Some called it Arap Ijam.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:06.980
And then later on it
was called Araq.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.430
So you see in legal
documents, and I've seen --

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.830
at the beginning I would
see all these documents

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.900
about Forough Farrokhzhad,
Forough Farrokhzhad Aroki.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.900
What is this Aroki coming from?

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.860
So that's where it comes from.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.960
And later on of course
it was deleted

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.870
and rarely anybody knows
them as Farrokhzhad Aroki.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:37.270
But all their documents, and I
have seen many of them, the father,

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:40.660
the mother -- in all
of them it's Aroki.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.760
They have that.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:56.960
So he was 14 when he was going to
marry the widowed sister according

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.050
to the customs of Tajrish.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:03.910
The brother had passed
away and he was

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:07.510 position:56%
to marry the wife, the widowed wife.

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:12.040
So the day of the wedding
he decided to flee,

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:16.770
to leave Tajrish and
to go to Tehran.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.830
He did so.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:23.930
He went to Tehran with
very little cash

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:30.850
but an abundant supply
of energy and audacity.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:39.640
He was a very adventurous man,
audacious is the right word.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.920
He joined Reza Han.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.480
At the time Reza Shah
was not Reza Shah yet.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.240
He joined Reza Han's
Cossack Brigade.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:57.740
And then when Reza Han became Reza
Shah, soon he sent him to Nushsash

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.280
as the head of his properties.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.450
That's how they ended in Nushash.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:09.170
The first granddaughter --
I'm sorry, the first daughter,

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.650
was born in Nushash actually.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.510
After the abdication
time of Reza Shah,

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:24.340
the family moved back to Tehran.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:29.990
He joined Dejan Darmari
and he changed a few jobs.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:33.280
And then around the
revolution he retired.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:39.730
He stayed home and he died
in 1992 at the age of 90.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.300
Now what about Forough?

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:46.500
So at the age of six
they come back to Tehran.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.190
She first goes to [inaudible],
kindergarten.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:54.780
And then to Sarush,
educational elementary school,

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.420
which is a good educational school.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.990
It is interesting.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:03.460
At the time there weren't too
many coeducational schools.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.840
But that was a coeducational school

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.900
in their neighborhood
in [inaudible].

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.340
That's where they lived.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:16.360
Then she goes to [inaudible]
and eventually she decides to go

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:22.520
to a technical school
for her high school.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.110
Because she was interested
in painting and sewing.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:37.660
Before finishing high school she
fell madly in love with a neighbor,

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.560
literally door-to-door
neighbor who happened

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:51.100
to also be a distant relative,
a distant cousin of her mother.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:55.610
His name was Parviz Shapour.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:28:03.570
The parents were adamantly
opposed to the marriage,

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:15.060
but Forough attempted her first
suicide at that tender age.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:23.170
She was absolutely adamant that
that's the man she wants to marry.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:31.290
Eventually, on September
14th, 1950 they got married.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:35.790
Three or four months
earlier, the sister,

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:40.010
Puran had also been
married in the same house.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:44.600
Forough's marriage from all
accounts was quite different.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.630
It was very simple.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:53.570
There are absolutely no
pictures of that wedding

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:58.370
because they wanted to save money.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.900 position:56%
That was not an extravagant wedding.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:08.820
It was only for tea and sweets,
which usually is unusual in Iran.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.380 position:56%
The bride did not have her own gown.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.390 position:56%
She borrowed the gown of her sister.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:21.050
She borrowed the ring, the
emerald ring of her sister.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:29.290
Even the mirror and the
candleholders belonged to Puran.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:35.110
So this is one of the
earliest pictures that we have

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:38.180
of the bride and the groom.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.350
Just to tell you a little bit
about the groom, Parviz Shapour

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:48.470
who was also significantly 11 years
older than Forough Farrakhzhad,

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:52.520
exactly like the age difference
between the father and the mother.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:58.180
And throughout her life Forough
Farrakhzhad was consistently more

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:04.330
interested in men who were older.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:08.400
11, Mr. [Foreign name]
is even older.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.140
I will talk in a minute
about Nasir Hodajaj.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.280
He was even older.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.210
So she was interested in older men.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:23.380
Shapour was born in 1923.

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:26.070 position:56%
He graduated from Tehran University.

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:32.230
His field was economics and he was
working at the time of the wedding

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:37.340
in the ministry of
finance in Tehran.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:41.290
Soon after the wedding, the
couple moved to [Foreign name],

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:47.830
which is a southern part of Iran.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.620
Parviz Shapour was an artist.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.660
He was what [Foreign name] called
[Foreign words], which is a fusion

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.590
of caricature, airborne drawings
and dexterity with words.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:05.210 position:56%
In fact, many people have told me
one of the main reasons Forough fell

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:18.110
in love with him was because
he was so wonderful with words.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:25.550
And if you read his books and
his [inaudible] you see that it's

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:29.870
with perfect economy, and he
really says a lot in those.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:34.390
He was working for Thohir
Magazine for a while.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:40.660
And his drawings were exhibited
in Tehran twice that I know of.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:45.710
And recently even in New York.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:51.770
So you know, he was an
artist in his own right.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:59.550
Usually many of the
people who have lived

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:03.700
around Forough Farrokhzhad
have been overshadowed

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.460
by her iconic by her iconic status.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.210
And I think Parviz
Shapour is one of them.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:17.110
Their son Kamyar was born
two years, a year and a half

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:24.610
after their wedding
on June 19th, 1952.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:30.980
The mother was still
a teenage mother.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:40.230
And he was around two years old
when Forough published her first --

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:45.920
this is Forough before
she had nose surgery.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:52.400
And when she was still in [Foreign
name], early Forough Farrakhzhad.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:56.340
This is one of my most
precious pictures.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:00.970
This is after Kamyar was born.

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:07.120
The man in this corner is Parviz
Shapour and the first woman

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.580 position:56%
on the right is Forough Farrakhzhad.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:15.130
And this is Forough with Kamyar.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.240
Kamyar was about two.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.450
So when Kamyar was
about two years old,

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:26.080 position:56%
his mother started publishing poems.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:35.590
She wanted to publish in magazines
as it was customary at the time.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.000
You start in magazines in journals

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.290
and then you graduate
to your own collections.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:52.330
So you might have heard that
one day she went to the office

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:56.650
of [Foreign name], which
at the time was one

00:33:56.650 --> 00:34:01.520
of Iran's most popular magazines.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.560
We're talking about early '50's.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:14.840
Mr. Mushisi the poet was the person
in charge of the literary page.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.630
And he had never met her.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:21.790
And unannounced she
knocks at the door

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:26.000
and enters the room of Mr. Mushisi.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.980
She's very nervous.

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.260
Mr. Mushisi told us
before he passed away.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.190
Mr. Mushisi was also one

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:39.570
of our major literary figures
and a very kind person.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:49.360
She's kind of shy and shivering
and her fingers are ink stained.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.170
And in her early life,

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:55.570
Forough always wrote
with ink that was green.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:35:00.310
Green ink was the ink
she always used.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:03.650
So it was green.

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.510
So Mushisi didn't know
what she wanted.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:13.260
And she handed three poems to
Mushisi and said that she would

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.110
like him to publish these poems.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:22.380
Now please consider the audacity
of a woman who is barely 20

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:28.980
who goes unannounced, unknown
to the office of a magazine,

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.990
finds her way to the
office of the editor

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:35.070
in chief of the literary section.

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:48.460 position:56%
And Mushisi looks at the poems and
the first one he sees is called Sin.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:55.510
It's a beautiful poem,
short poem, 12-line poem.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:36:00.200
[ Speaking foreign language ]

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.780
"I sinned.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.560
I sinned voluptuously
in the arms of the man

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.600
that was fury," and
it goes on and on.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:14.070
It's a reversal of thousands
of years of Persian literature.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:19.440
It was always men who
talked about their love

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.210
for a woman or a feminized lover.

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:28.690
And here was this woman
singing her love for a man.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:34.190
It was quite clear that it
was a woman writing for a man.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:38.950
And Mushidi was quite taken.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:49.570
She said she had two others
and Mr. Mushidi told her,

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:53.880
"I would need to consult
with my editors."

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:59.330
He said he was concerned about
the safety of the magazine,

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:02.620
about the reaction of the people.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.590
And he consulted the
editorial board.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:10.560
And most of them wanted
the poem to be published.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.570
They thought it's a good
poem, it's interesting.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.930
It's a novelty.

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.300
One person, Mr. [Foreign name],

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:23.420
the editor in chief,
was the most adamant.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:24.790
He said, [foreign expression],
"Of course.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.090
Publish it."

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:33.640
I don't know, that was
not a good translation.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:39.350
How would you translate that?

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:41.420
"Sure, let's do it."

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:47.940
Let's do it and get
it over with, exactly.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.050
So as Mushidi said,
[foreign expression],

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:57.290
"We published it, but
it didn't go well."

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:05.300 position:56%
Because although some people loved
the poem, there were a lot of people

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:12.160
who were totally shocked
and aggravated by this poem.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.330
Love poems, adulterous
relationships,

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:21.200
are a dime a dozen in
Persian literature.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:26.830
We have plenty of adulterous
women in Persian literature.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:34.550
So what was it about this
poem that became so scandalous

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:39.660
that brought Forough immediately
to a level of notoriety,

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:45.180
of scandal that was
unheard of before her?

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:52.000
What was in this poem that
shocked and titillated the readers?

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.740
Because it really did
titillate a lot of people too.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:05.600
I have a few suggestions and
I'm sure there are plenty more.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:13.150
This woman calls herself a sinner.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.720
The poem is called Sin
and she begins with I,

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.550
which his very unusual,

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:22.540
an autobiographical
statement for a woman.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.140
In a culture where
autobiographical statements

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:29.310
and life narratives
are not quite allowed.

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:30.770
At least they were not allowed.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:33.540
Now everybody is writing a memoir.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.130
And my aunt too.

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.750
But back then it wasn't like that.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:42.730
We didn't have biographies
or autobiographies by women.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.480
So the poem starts with I.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.690
"I sinned."

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:54.890
But more importantly, she has
sinned but she is not repentful.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:59.360
In fact, throughout the poem
she is quite exhilarated.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.220
Something mysterious
has happened to her.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:07.580
The poem is about the awakening
of a woman to sexuality,

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.040
to the joy of physical union.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:15.020
She has never experienced it
before and she has at this time

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.160
and she's writing about it.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:23.500
So she's talking about it [Foreign
name], but she's also talking

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.660
about freedom of expression.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.030
"I committed a sin.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.740
Yes, it is a sin.

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.630
But eat your heart out.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:34.600
I am not repentful.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:39.140
And I'm going to tell
you all about it."

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:44.990
More importantly, this
adulterous woman, unlike the slew

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:48.410
of adulterous women
in Persian literature,

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:57.640
does not undergo a
religious awakening.

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:04.690
She is not taken to the
right path through marriage.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:11.930
She does not blame the man,
which is admirable in her poem.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:17.730
She takes full responsibility
for her act.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:23.180
Unlike most adulterous
women, and conveniently,

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.290
she does not commit suicide.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.170
She does not kill herself.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.950
And she's not killed by some
mysterious disease either.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:41.550
She stays alive and she's
well and she's going to go on.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:44.730
So but I think even
more important than all

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:50.440
of these things was the
layout of that first poem.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.860
Look at it.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:59.280
So this whole piece, most
of it is about her picture.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.640
I mean there are two pictures,
and a biographical stretch.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.720
And if you read the biographical
sketch, it's all about the fact

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.260
that this is a married woman.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.590
She has a child who
is two years old.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:16.250
She has beautiful disheveled hair.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:21.390
She has beautiful black
eyes that are penetrating.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:28.990
So the focus is on her body
and on her marital status.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:38.910 position:56%
So in other words, whoever wrote
that early piece wanted to make sure

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:47.710
that this woman committed
this pleasurable act of union

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:52.410
with a man who is not her husband.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:43:00.640
The layout of the magazine turns a
poem into a testimonial of sorts.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.090
It's almost like a report.

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:19.570
At the time, many Iranian
poets had chosen pseudonyms.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.760
Forough Farrakhzhad
could have done the same.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:30.270
In fact she did use
pseudonyms, pen names,

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.520 position:56%
later for some of her prose writing.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.680
Two very interesting pen names.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:43.320
[Foreign name], the Iconoclast, and
[Foreign name], Born of Fairies.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.620
That I know of.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:49.280
There might be others that
I'm not still aware of.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:44:00.180
Forough found herself at the
eye of the gathering storm.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.290
The father, Mr. Farrakhzhad,

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:06.980
was furious with the
publication of this Sin.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.670
And of course the husband
was as well.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:20.320
I have heard that when this poem
was published, and I don't say

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.670
that with joy -- my
heart goes to him --

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:26.380
Mr. Shapour, Parviz
Shapour the husband,

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.510 position:56%
did not leave home for a whole week.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:33.960
He just could not face the world.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.890
And you understand, in a
culture where the honor

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:44.540
of a man depends on
sexual acts of women.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:48.880
And to me that's the prison, but
that is nonetheless how it is,

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:53.550
how it was back then and how it
is to a certain extent today.

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.220
This is Nasir Quidiar
[spelling assumed].

00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:01.820
Not much usually is known about
him, which is interesting.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:06.840
I will tell you, he is the man
for whom Sin was published.

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.030
He is the beloved of Sin.

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:16.000
And I'm not intruding
upon Forough's privacy.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.220
In a minute you will see that.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:26.160
At the time in the '50's it
became the talk of town in Tehran.

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:30.580
It's often mentioned that Forough
Farrokhzhad published her first

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:35.350
poetry collection when she was 17.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:41.490
I have not come across any such
poems or poetry collection.

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:47.270
Her first collection
is called Captive.

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:54.670
And it was published in 1955.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:02.120
Most of the poems in it are in
fact written in 1953 and 1954.

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:06.110
So I don't know how she could have
published Asir when she was 17.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:09.640 position:56%
So I think that's a false statement.

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:19.720
Asir was by itself a novelty.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:24.560
For the first time in
Iranian literary history,

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:30.780
a woman from a non-literary
family was publishing a collection

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.930
of poems.

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:38.460
Prior to her, none of the poems,
none of the poetry collections

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:44.280
by our women writers have
been published by people

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.860
who were not in literary families.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.390
[Foreign names] and the
list goes on and on.

00:46:51.390 --> 00:47:01.940
Significantly, the poem Sin
which brought Forough to fame

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:08.900 position:56%
and notoriety was excised from Asir.

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.880
And apparently the relationship
with Quidiar had gone sour.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:24.710
So soon Asir became a
highly acclaimed poem

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.370
because it was unusual poetry.

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:29.770
It had 44 poems.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:34.440
And it had an introduction
by Mr. Chafa.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.830
So I asked Mr. Chafa.

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:47.580
I said, "How did you end up
writing this introduction to Asir?"

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:54.640
Again, the story is so important if
you want to put it in the context

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:59.420
of the difficulties women
confronted in becoming writers

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.150
or poets in Iran of the time.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:08.770
So apparently the publisher
had told Forough that in order

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:13.670
for her poetry collection to be
published, they would want her

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:21.550
to have a major writer write an
introduction to the collection.

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:28.290
So one afternoon, as Mr. Chafa told
me, there was a knock at the door.

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:34.560
He goes to open the door and
there is a young woman there

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.970
with a book in her hand.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:46.840
And she introduces herself and Mr.
Chafa immediately recognizes him

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:51.140 position:56%
because at the time many people,
definitely people in literature knew

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:54.690
of Forough Farrokhzhad,
the poet of Sin.

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:58.680
And she was invited in.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:03.090
And she tells him, "I'm
here because I want you

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.600 position:56%
to write an introduction to my book.

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:10.350
And that's the reason the
publisher wants you to do that.

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.420
Would you consider doing it?"

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.800
And Chafa says, "Of
course I will do it."

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.880
So that's how Chafa
wrote the introduction.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:29.120
So Asir was published without
Sin, but significantly also

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.670
without an afterword that
Forough had written to it.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:38.950
And that afterword, if you have not
read it, may I suggest you read it.

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:41.000
It's called Tozi.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.190
It is really a manifesto
for Forough Farrokhzhad.

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:46.360
I don't know why it was excised

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.840
and I don't know why it's
not reprinted anywhere.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.150
I will be happy to
send you a copy of it

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:54.990
if anybody is interested in it.

00:49:54.990 --> 00:50:00.450
I think we should all read what
a barely 20-year-old woman wrote

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:07.370
about poetry and about women's
lives in Iran at the time.

00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:15.270
In Asir and then later in the
[Foreign name], Walls, Rebellion

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:20.090
and Reborn, the other
four collections,

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:21.490
these are the four collections

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:24.260
that Forough published
during her lifetime.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:28.670
There are a few central themes
that are central to her life.

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:32.850
So I'm going to quickly
try to just enumerate them.

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:37.530
First of course is motherhood.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:43.480
Farrokhzhad was a teenage
mother and in the letters

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:48.080
that you will see published
in the biography

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.120
that hopefully will
be published soon,

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:57.010
the pain of being separated
from her son.

00:50:57.010 --> 00:51:02.130
And the love that she had for
her son is really central,

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:05.140
not only to her poetry but also

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:08.150
to all the letters, to
many of the letters.

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:14.880
And in fact, because she
chose poetry as a vocation,

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:21.660
as a profession, she was
denied her right of motherhood.

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:28.760
Fatherhood in Iran is a grant,
is a granted phenomenon.

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:36.960 position:56%
All you have to do is to contribute
physically to the act of conception.

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:42.630
A mother becomes a mother
with birth of the child,

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:47.780
but to remain a mother
she has to earn that.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:51.780
Motherhood is not a
right for Iranian women.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:54.360
Motherhood is a privilege.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:59.200
And because Forough
Farrokhzhad divorced her husband

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:06.040
and because she chose to be, as she
called it, she constantly said it

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:11.030
in the letters, in the poems,
"I want to become a great poet."

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:14.700
She said that since she was 19.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:16.540
"I want to become a great poet.

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.370
And I can't reconcile
that with a life

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:22.180
of domesticity and
raising children."

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.790
But that didn't mean
that she didn't want

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:29.820
to have her instinct
as a mother denied.

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:36.040
So that caused her great
pain as many of you know.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:47.830 position:56%
After Mr. Quidiar decided to publish
the detail of his relationship

00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:51.820
with Farrokhzhad in a serial
called [Foreign name],

00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:57.180
she was considered a
promiscuous woman now,

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:02.940
not only by her own admission but
also by the admission of the lover.

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:12.240 position:56%
And not only she was divorced, she
was denied custody rights of her son

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:15.660
and eventually visitation
rights with her son.

00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:20.260
That pain remained with her
for the rest of her life.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:27.960 position:56%
It's interesting to note that before
the Feminine Mystique was published

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.940
in the US and before Of Women
Born of [inaudible] was published

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.930
in the US, Forough
Farrokhzhad had talked

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:39.750
about both those issues
in her poetry.

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:43.350
In particular her first
two poetry collections

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:48.010
which for some reason is not
considered due recognition in Iran.

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:52.130
Everybody talks about
Reborn and nobody talks

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:57.190
about those three first poems
which are the pain of a woman

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:00.990
who is trying to break
free from these molds

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:03.730
that are imprisoning her.

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:07.010
Again, it's not that she
didn't want to be a mother.

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.810
She wanted to reconcile
it with being an artist.

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:15.440
And that right was
not granted to her.

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.600 position:56%
This is a picture of [Foreign name].

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:23.380
So after the publication
of [Foreign name],

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:29.070
Forough attempted another suicide.

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:38.970
She was taken to psychiatric
hospital.

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:43.920
She was hospitalized,
institutionalized for a month.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.670
She was given electric
shock therapy.

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:52.020
And when she left, this is
a picture soon after it.

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.840
She decided to leave Iran.

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:58.410
She left Iran on a cargo plane.

00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:01.320
And in some of the
letters that you will read

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:05.780
in the published letters you
see how she has to scramble

00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:09.490
to get the money to go to Europe.

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:11.290
She wanted to study.

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:14.970
She went to Italy and
then she went to Germany.

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:17.300
She worked while she was in Italy.

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:21.260
She did some dubbing,
she did some sewing.

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:25.430
And after 16 months
she decided to return.

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:31.010
She needed Iran and she needed
the language and the people.

00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:39.060
She went back to Iran and of course
not having high education it was

00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:40.910
hard to find a job.

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:46.040
So she was introduced
to Galistan Film Studio.

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:53.160
Mr. Galistan, a pioneer of Iranian
cinema and Iranian literature,

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:59.540
hired her as a filing clerk.

00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:06.810
So she started her position there
to be economically independent

00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:09.520
and to finally have
a room of her own.

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:19.340
She started working there, showing
afterward a very passionate,

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:26.000
lustful, loving relationship
developed between the two.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.440
And for the last eight
years of her life,

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:38.100
Farrokhzhad had a very intense
relationship with Galistan.

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:42.220
As you know, her fourth
poetry collection is dedicated

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.260
to EG, Ebrahim Golistan.

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:53.150
Some of the poems in [Foreign name]
I believe are the most beautiful

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:58.750
poems a woman has ever
written about a man.

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:02.410
I often tell Mr. Golistan I
think he's the prince charming

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:03.830
of Persian literature.

00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:07.920
No man, to the best of my
knowledge, has been loved

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:11.640
and adulated the way
Mr. Golistan has been

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:15.560
in Persian literature
in Forough's poetry.

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:20.100
Forough started travelling.

00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:26.220
Mr. Golistan recognized
that she is highly talented.

00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:29.700
She showed interest in film.

00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:38.690
And in 1962 she was
sent to a leprosarium.

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:41.880
Bhabubhaki Leprosarium.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:49.570
In which she made the movie -- I
assume most of you have seen it.

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:54.620
If not, please allow me to
recommend you watch that film.

00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:57.800
It's a 22-minute documentary.

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:05.550
It has been considered by many
Iranian and western film critics

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:09.610
as one of the best 10
documentaries made in the world.

00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:16.810
And this young woman in her
20's with minimal possibilities

00:58:16.810 --> 00:58:20.580
and resources made
this amazing movie.

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:25.820
My introduction to Forough
Farrokhzhad was actually

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.200
through that film.

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:31.930
I vividly recall the first
time I saw that film.

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:38.850
Images of disfigured
patients of leprosy.

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:42.200
It was a summer day in Tehran.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.760
The smell of jasmine everywhere.

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:50.170
I remember what I was
wearing, where I was sitting.

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:54.750
Certainly I saw these images on
the screen of the television.

00:58:54.750 --> 00:59:00.360 position:56%
I could neither look at these
images nor could I take my eyes off.

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:05.600
It was the most powerful
visual poetry I have ever seen.

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:10.010
Since then, Forough
Farrokhzhad became my companion.

00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:15.860
Her poetry became my
garden, my home.

00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:23.790
Every time I go to
it, it's welcoming.

00:59:23.790 --> 00:59:26.080
I smell my childhood.

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:29.850
I regain the lost time.

00:59:29.850 --> 00:59:35.950
It's beautiful poetry and it
has a special meaning for me.

00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:42.800
So I came to this country
in 1967, December of 1967.

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.360
I wanted to do my dissertation.

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:51.520 position:56%
My major was French literature and
I was going to write my dissertation

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:57.900
on Flaubert and his search for the
ideal woman and the perfect words.

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:01.790
My argument was that
neither will be possible

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:07.100
because they don't exist unless
you change your perspective.

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:15.120
But so thanks to Dr. Banani,
my teacher and my mentor,

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:20.740 position:56%
I switched major again and I decided
to write my dissertation on Forough.

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:25.730
But I was going to write my
dissertation on her biography.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:28.860
So that's in the '70's.

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:32.590
I went to Iran repeatedly
for my research.

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:37.210
And soon I realized that writing
her biography was impossible.

01:00:37.210 --> 01:00:45.120 position:56%
To give you quickly the reasons why,
many men were all too eager to share

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.520
with me their love affair
with Forough Farrokhzhad.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.130
I was not interested in that.

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:55.520
Those who knew the most will
tell me, what's the point

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.200
of talking about a dead person?

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.990
Many people made fun of me.

01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:08.010
So in America they give
a Ph. D for a woman

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:12.980
who barely got her
high school diploma.

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.570
And on and on.

01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:19.640
I have often told Mr. Golistan,
so I can tell you that.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.060
And when I finally met Mr.
Golistan and started asking him

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.390
about Forough Farrokhzhad,
he looked at me.

01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:31.930
He said, "Miss Milani, I have
heard you are a good cook."

01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:36.870 position:56%
And I thought he was trying to
compliment me, the idiot that I was.

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:40.360
And I said, "Who told you?"

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:44.190
He said, "Your teacher Dr. Banani
tells me you are a good cook."

01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:46.670
And Mr. Banani was a chef.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:49.750
I said, "If he says it,
maybe I am not a bad cook."

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:51.880
I was still clueless.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.390
He said, "I have a
suggestion for you.

01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:58.440
Why don't you write a cookbook?"

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:04.260
So that was the end of my
biographical enterprise.

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:08.980
But I promised myself I
will keep working at it.

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:11.320
And I have for 37 years.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:17.360
It has been a while, but I
have finally almost done it.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:22.830
And I will quickly tell you
before I finish where I got

01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:26.590
after all these years of
agony and not knowing what

01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:30.020
to do, where I found my model.

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:35.210
And how I'm trying
to do this biography.

01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:44.470
The film, The House is Black is
the biography of a leprosarium,

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:46.700
at least that's how I see it.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:51.280
It's about life of
patients in a leprosarium,

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:58.290 position:56%
a colony where lepers were
ostracized and literally imprisoned.

01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:07.200
The way she tells the truth, the
way she doesn't sugarcoat anything.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:13.070
The way she does not invade
privacy, the way she is devoted

01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:20.310
to imparting truth as she
saw it without judging,

01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:24.760
without moralizing,
was a lesson to me.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.830
This is a tall order
for any biographer.

01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:30.660
And I'm not sure I will succeed.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:36.720
But I can tell you with certainty
that it has been my model.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:42.970
You know, I would like to be
revealing but not voyeuristic.

01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:48.500
I would like to be
candid, but not judgmental.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:55.860
I would like to be informative
but respectful of someone

01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:01.390
who suffered all her life because
her privacy was not respected.

01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:06.140
So that's also the reason that
I have been sitting on some

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:08.710
of these letters for decades.

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:13.020
Because those letter were
not addressed to all of us.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.160
Those letters were
addressed to one person.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.780
And I was not sure, even though
the people that I have come

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:24.770
into contact, the people I have
interviewed, were kind enough,

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:28.820
generous enough to
give me those letters.

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:32.430
And I knew I have to
share it with people,

01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:34.790
but I wasn't sure I'm invading.

01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:37.000
I'm not invading her privacy.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.980
So finally after seeing that film,
and after seeing what she has done

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:51.320
to leprosy, which is a disease that
we always covered up, I said, "No,

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:54.480
she now belongs to
Iranian literature.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.850
She now belongs to Iran."

01:04:56.850 --> 01:05:02.310
And after 50 years, after
so many misinformation

01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:06.060
and so much information
and misinformation on her,

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:09.190
we need to hear her own voice.

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:14.540
So these are pictures of the son
she adopted at the leprosarium.

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:20.460
She came back with this son
Hossein Mansouri and again she is

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:27.250
to the best of my knowledge the
first woman who began this idea

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:31.700
of single parenthood
and adopting a child.

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:36.440
These are precious pictures that I
don't think you've ever seen before

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:41.300
of Forough at the leprosarium.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:48.240
And finally just to give you an
idea of the published letters.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:51.690
Altogether Forough has published
a little less than 80 letters

01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:53.840
that have been published so far.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:58.300
Most of them were published,
56 letters.

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:02.410
55 to Parviz Shapour
and one to his mother.

01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:07.090
So a total of 56 in a
collection [Foreign name],

01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:12.340
A Man the First Throb of My
Loving Heart, for her husband.

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:17.690
It is a very interesting,
fascinating book.

01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:21.680
And just a few other short poems.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:27.140
All of these letters have
been censored in a way.

01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:31.790
There are words missing, a sentence
missing, a paragraph missing.

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:34.630
I have chosen not to do that.

01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:39.270
Not a single word will be
deleted from the 30 letters.

01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:43.570
And I'm going to have her
own handwriting side-by-side

01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:50.050
with the transcribed version of it
so that you can read for yourself.

01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:58.030
As you see, the letters span
from her early teenage years

01:06:58.030 --> 01:07:06.180
to the last 15 letters she wrote
from Europe to Mr. Golistan.

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:12.050
And I think they are very
important literary documents.

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:15.510
Thank you very much for listening.

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:18.090
[ Applause ]

01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:21.460
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
