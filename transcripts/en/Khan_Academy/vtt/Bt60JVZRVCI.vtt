00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.180
Let's think about what
fraction of this grid

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.852
is actually shaded in pink.

00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:06.560
So the first thing we
want to think about

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.790
is how many equal
sections do we have here?

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.080
Well, this is a 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 by 1, 2, 3 grid.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.400
So there's 15 sections here.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.000
You could also count it-- 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.200
12, 13, 14, 15.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.900
So there are 15
equal sections here.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.510
And how many of
those equal sections

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.139
are actually shaded in
this kind of pinkish color?

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:37.610
Well, We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.480
So it's 6/15 is shaded in.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.100
But I want to
simplify this more.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.600
I have a feeling that there's
some equivalent fractions that

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.310
represent the exact
same thing as 6/15.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.100
And to get a sense of that, let
me redraw this a little bit,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.260
where I still shade in
six of these rectangles,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.230
but I'll shade them a
little bit in one chunk.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.570
So let me throw in another
grid right over here,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.459
and let me attempt to
shade in the rectangles

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.530
as fast as possible.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.055
So that is 1-- 1 rectangle.

00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:12.950
I'll even make my
thing even bigger.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.470
All right, 1 rectangle,
2 rectangles,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:28.090
3 rectangles-- halfway
there-- 4 rectangles,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:35.120
5 rectangles shaded in and
now 6 rectangles shaded in.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.810
So this right over
here, what I just

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.090
did, this is still 6
rectangles of the 15 rectangles

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.700
are shaded in.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.210
So this is still 6/15.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.230
These are representing
the same thing.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.175
But how can I simplify
this even more?

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:52.290
Well, when you look
at it numerically,

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.430
you see that both 6 and
15 are divisible by 3.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.120
In fact, their greatest
common factor is 3.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.289
So what happens if we divide the
numerator and denominator by 3?

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.830
If we do the same thing to the
numerator and the denominator,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.890
we're not going to be changing
the value of the fraction.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.060
So let's divide
the numerator by 3

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.800
and divide the denominator by 3.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.136
And what do we get?

00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:18.950
We get 2 over 5.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.700
Now how does this make sense
in the context of this diagram

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.900
right here?

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.030
Well, we started off
with 6 shaded in.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.134
You divide by 3, you
have 2 shaded in.

00:02:29.134 --> 00:02:31.300
So you're essentially saying,
hey, let's group these

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.960
into sections of 3.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.330
So let's say that this right
over here is one section of 3.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.520
This is one section
of 3 right over here.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.460
So that's one section of 3.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.100
And then this is another
section of 3 right over here.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.590
And so you have
two sections of 3.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.740
And actually let me color
it in a little bit better.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.580
So you have two sections of 3.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.120
And if you were to combine
them, it looks just like this.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.560
Notice this is covering
the exact same area

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.430
as your 6 smaller ones did.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.630
And then how many equal
sections of this size

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.960
do you have on
this entire thing?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.190
Well, you have 5 equal sections.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.500
Because this is one section
of 3 right over here,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.430
this is another section of 3.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.510
And then this is
another section of 3.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.220
So notice, you're covering
the exact same area

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.930
of the original thing.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.680
You're covering 2 out
of the 5 equal sections.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.669
So 2/5 and 6/15 are
equivalent fractions.

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.460
So if you want to say
what fraction of this

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.735
is covered in the simplest
form, you would say 2/5.
