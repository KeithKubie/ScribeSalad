1
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.350
What's going on with all the cigars? Uh, which cigars? Those are not cigars.

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.800
Those are marijuana. Oh, okay. I figured it might be something like that.

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.310
It's marijuana on the outside. It's called a blunt.

4
00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:15.630
That's what the younguns call it. It's not know the term bump. That looks like,

5
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.750
I thought it was like a young company. Of course you get, you know. Yeah.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.300
But I'm not as schooled as you. I'm not as schooled as you in the elicits,

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.570
even though that's not, it's not an elicit. Now speaking of elicit,

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.920
you've got some meat eat or bourbon, some elk shank bourbon. Yeah.

9
00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:34.410
Pairs with, it's a good name. Pairs of Beaver tail pairs with people.

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.590
Both of those things. Thanks to you. L shanks,

11
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:41.800
a great name for it because that is like one of the rare foods.

12
00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:44.860
Like if you talk to most hunters, like said, have you ever had it?

13
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.180
Elk shank also Buco they'd be like, what? Most,

14
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.680
most hunters have never eaten that. And it was regulatory to find out about it.

15
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.070
And then it's the thing that, uh, I became,

16
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.040
I started to proselytize, you know,

17
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.640
I found out about eating it cause my brother found out about eating it because

18
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:07.120
he has this old cookbook called the LL bean.

19
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.530
It's like the LL bean wild game cookbook, um,

20
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.040
by a guy named Angus first name Angus, if I remember right.

21
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.120
And he's got a shank. Like he's got a shank recipe in his book for

22
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.200
antelope shank. And so we started making it,

23
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.070
that's the funny thing about wild game cooking that you've probably picked up on

24
00:01:27.071 --> 00:01:31.120
is that you could, um,

25
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.280
you could have a thing or you can say like, Hey,

26
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:37.120
here's a recipe for a white tail deer heart. Right? And someone would be like,

27
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.160
but do you have one for a meal? Do your heart.

28
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.150
Have I explained this to you before? No. Well, they're going to change the ball,

29
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.540
aren't they? Yeah, that's thing. So obviously like when we did our cookbook,

30
00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:49.570
I tried really hard to steer away from things that would be elk grass recipes,

31
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.780
DRS bees, and just take it from a cut basis is excellent.

32
00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:55.180
But have you messed around with good times? That's great.

33
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.740
Quite a few things from it. It's really great.

34
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.540
We got away from saying that like here's an antelope recipe or whatever because

35
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:03.550
it's just like the cut is more important,

36
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.030
especially with all these ungulates like horned and antlered game.

37
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.610
What it is is more important than what it came from.

38
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.690
So by putting elk shank on that bottle,

39
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.350
I'm kinda like going against my own advice, but if I just put shank,

40
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.190
people might not know what you're talking about. Wow.

41
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.090
It could be like lamb shank, but it's just a cool name.

42
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.120
We're going to do a limited run of those where we write all kinds of weird stuff

43
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:27.730
in there that it pairs well with. Is it good? Does this good stuff?

44
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.120
Should we try it? And it's five years old so we get a taste. Yeah, let's get a,

45
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.550
let's get some ice and some glasses. You know, I took a long,

46
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.820
I took a long break from drinking. Woo. How long? Uh,

47
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.970
well I just slowed way down on it when my kids were born,

48
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.360
started to be born and then gradually me and my wife had gotten back into it

49
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.570
gradually. Yeah. No. You know, we haven't tested working together. Yeah.

50
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.010
Right. Which is really crazy.

51
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.270
I know we haven't toasted Yannas took a year off booze. Wow.

52
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.440
For no just for like whatever Yannis,

53
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.880
whatever. Yannis. I can't remember. He had some reason for it. Uh,

54
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.160
he had a birthday once and took a month off.

55
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.960
Then he had a birthday and took a year off.

56
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.400
He's got four months to go for the end of the year and then he's gonna drink.

57
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.630
Yeah. But he says his family, I think his wife was explaining to me, um,

58
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.260
there's a lot more disposable income around the house now cause she's like,

59
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.820
I never realized how much blues and takes up. Yeah.

60
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.710
What's all those fancy beers they had all else fancy beer. It adds up to you.

61
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:27.940
That's an interesting thing. Yeah.

62
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:32.080
People don't think about that when you run your tab at the end of the week and

63
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:36.250
then add that times four and then add that times 12. That's real money. Yeah.

64
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.480
And I don't know if you remember,

65
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.310
you probably like this when you were younger where like it was, it was just,

66
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.060
it was an impossible. You'd have leftover booze in your house.

67
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.840
Do you know, cause everybody's drank so much. Right, right, right.

68
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.810
Like now we're like such grownups in our pantry.

69
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.320
We have like a little liquor section. Right. And you have like, Oh there's,

70
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.750
you know, yeah, I have a wine fridge. Yeah.

71
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.110
But in the old days you couldn't because you just drank it and it was gone.

72
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.610
Right. You know? Yeah.

73
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.780
I want to interview you. I want to interview you for a minute. Okay. Go ahead.

74
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.370
How comfortable do you ever tell your listeners about, um,

75
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.760
about the comedy stuff you're working on? Or do you like to keep a big secret?

76
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.240
I tell him some things. I don't like to give up premises chair, sir.

77
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.000
You don't like to give up premises? I mean a punchlines and, Oh,

78
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.190
say like a subject I'm working on. You do or don't give up subjects. Well,

79
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.000
I want to engage you about a subject that we were texting about. Oh, about the,

80
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.930
uh, the missionary. Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Sure. I just don't understand.

81
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.610
This is good. I know that you will. I like it.

82
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.970
I know that you will have a knowing you and how good you are at what you do.

83
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:50.710
I know you'll have done it,

84
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.790
but I don't understand how you could have had a novel thought about the

85
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:58.570
missionary. Yes. He got killed just to, to, to refresh people's memories. Uh,

86
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.290
there's an Island East Sentinel. What's funny? By my fish shack,

87
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.760
there's an Island called Sentinel Island. Really? Yeah. No one lives on it. Um,

88
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.710
I've been past it many times and I've yet to been shot at.

89
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.930
It's North Sentinel Island nor, sorry.

90
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.200
Nordson allowance in the middle of the mind that my shack is East Sentinel.

91
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.280
Sorry, North Sentinel. [inaudible] better. So you should tell people what it is.

92
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.870
I want to go to your shack. I want to go. Yeah, let's, let's next one.

93
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:24.640
Instead of a hunting trip, let's do a fishing trip.

94
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.030
I would love to have you have down come out there and we'll catch some out.

95
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.470
But so you would, you're not interested bringing your family. Yeah,

96
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.490
we could do that too. We kind of take a family approach. Okay.

97
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.423
Are more and more now.

98
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.150
Well your kids like flipping over your kids like flipping rocks and seeing on

99
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.540
the rock. My youngest loves fishing. He loves it. Rock flipping.

100
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.480
She loves everything she does. She's really big.

101
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.370
And now young is the youngest nine. Oh yeah. Perfect. But uh,

102
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.370
no I want to get like, I just can't, I can't, I,

103
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.830
I S I've thought about and thought about it and I can't think,

104
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.290
not that I don't have faith in you.

105
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.180
I just can't think of what the take would be.

106
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.040
The problem is if I explained with the take

107
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.160
<v 1>is it would fuck up the bit for people that haven't seen the bit.</v>

108
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.090
I'll show you tonight. Tonight. Y'all going tonight. I can't wait to go see,

109
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.920
but I just wanted to explain off air. I'll explain off air. Okay.

110
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.920
Yeah. Are you feeling good about the Bay? Yeah. Yeah.

111
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.140
It's a fascinating subject. You know,

112
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:21.530
the guy commander Maurice of Adele Portman. You know who that guy is? No,

113
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.150
he was the, uh, the pervert that traveled around from Island to Island, uh,

114
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.960
measuring guys and taking weird photos with y'all,

115
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.430
dressing them up with the Roman soldiers. I read the,

116
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:32.690
I read a big piece about this,

117
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:35.630
which actually sent to you to see if you'd wrote it to, yeah, I'd read a,

118
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.310
you said you read everything about it. Yeah,

119
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:39.680
I'd read quite a few things about it because there was a guy on Twitter,

120
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:42.440
his name is respectable law at respectable law,

121
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.620
and he posted a whole series of things cause he, uh,

122
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.480
he had actually been studying this case or this,

123
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:52.150
this place before because of this pervert guy. And so when this man, uh,

124
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.320
this missionary showed up on an Island and got murdered,

125
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.660
like he knew all about the history of this Island.

126
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:59.510
So he made like a chain of posts on Twitter,

127
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.650
which were really interesting and formative. And then I started going deep into,

128
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.370
and I read the guy's journals. The journals were hilarious, man.

129
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.190
The kid that got killed. No, the guy goes to the pervert, the English,

130
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.370
the English pervert in the 18 hundreds probably wrecked like that whole area for

131
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:20.990
those people because they had this idea of what white men are.

132
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:22.970
I know these people don't have a written language and they,

133
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.260
they just have stories.

134
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.400
So they probably still have stories of these white men that come carrying

135
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:30.810
diseases and want to touch your Dick and measure them. Yeah.

136
00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:34.160
So this is the guy he was into. I just wanna make sure I remember this right.

137
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.390
He was in like skull morphology, but with sexual organs.

138
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.550
Well he was, it's hard to tell what he was into, but it was,

139
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.440
it's so obviously perverted, like it's,

140
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.530
it seems like he was doing sexual stuff with these people trying to legitimize

141
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:56.110
it by, yeah, I mean like, yeah, just measuring them and, and,

142
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.170
and doing detailed descriptions of their sex organs and he's really into that.

143
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.050
That seemed very important to him. And he's, he sir, he survived the Island.

144
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.020
I can't decide where to go with my new, uh, my new Laird Hamilton,

145
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.350
tumeric coffee or the whiskey, mix it up, back and forth.

146
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.330
It's really a nervous thing. It's like, it's like soup. Yes. With coffee in it.

147
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.040
It's very good for you to, like I said, that turmeric, you know,

148
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.000
people think of it as Curry cause it's a great spice for food, but it's a,

149
00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:27.030
it's a potent antiinflammatory. Very, very good for you. It's good. Uh,

150
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.410
so I'll have to wait and see what your take on it is. Yeah. Are you,

151
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.870
I'm almost done interviewing you. Are you drawn to that?

152
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.440
Uh, are you drawn to that idea? I certainly am.

153
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:43.610
The which idea do you get that you'd go and hang out and spend time with less on

154
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:48.500
contacted people? Well, you've done it in, um, what, what part of South America?

155
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:50.510
Where you at? Where you, well, yeah,

156
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.530
they're not uncontacted not seminar on contacted,

157
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.340
but uh,

158
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:57.841
<v 2>yeah,</v>

159
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:02.680
so some tribes that like the Chimani and the MACUSA,

160
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.760
she and Whopper, Shaun, um,

161
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.290
are all tribes in Northern South America who have long, long history of,

162
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.550
of contact and engagement with the outside world. But,

163
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:17.100
uh,

164
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.910
individuals who can still very much like hanging out with individuals who aren't

165
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:24.450
that old who in their youth were, uh,

166
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.250
very much like living a Hunter gatherer lifestyle with the,

167
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.850
with the mix of native materials and also some Western materials.

168
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.890
And this was Guyana, Guyana and Bolivia. Um, people that, you know,

169
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:42.600
people that would still make their bows from native materials,

170
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.230
people that, uh, grew up using canoes that were made like hand, you know,

171
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:50.730
hand dog dog outs using, uh, plant toxins to kill fish.

172
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.530
But also like, you know,

173
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:56.970
also other very modern stuff like one of these guys that I really appreciate

174
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.770
hanging out with. I mean, the guys got an email address,

175
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.240
but I might've told you this story before. He's got an email address,

176
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:06.660
but he also told us about, um,

177
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.900
we interviewed him on our show on our podcast and,

178
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.080
and he's telling me about how their packer E's,

179
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.510
their white lipped peccaries aren't around right now because there was a sham

180
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.730
and in another village who's jealous of their village for being so prosperous

181
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.390
and has locked their Packers up inside of a mountain and that they're training

182
00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:37.170
their own Sharmane to free the peccaries from the mountain.

183
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.120
And you can shoot this dude an email, so,

184
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.480
right. Explain a peccary to people. Oh,

185
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.660
people here are familiar with the have Alina. Yeah, yeah. I have,

186
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.280
Alina is a collared peccary and then there's a in no run in little troops of

187
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.410
[inaudible] you might see anywhere from one to 13 or 14 white lip Packers are a

188
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:02.100
bit bigger and they'll run in groups of 200.

189
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.910
Wow. Yeah, they'll ravage like, like these, um,

190
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:07.800
these people have a somewhat agrarian lifestyle.

191
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:12.801
They hunt fish and also have farms scattered throughout the the jungle and

192
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.590
they'll just come in and ravage farms in groups of, you know, like I said,

193
00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:17.850
groups of 100, 200,

194
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.700
I should be honest here and say I've never laid eyes on a white lip.

195
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.340
Packery there's a third pancrea Chaco in or chick Cohen,

196
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:30.170
a peccary that is much more rare than the collared and white lipped. Yeah.

197
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.470
Picture this Jamie. There is the white little fuckers. Yeah. Those schools,

198
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.000
those supposedly tastes a lot better than collared peccaries.

199
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.240
I've hunted collared peccaries in, uh,

200
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.250
in West taxes and in Sonora, Mexico.

201
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.910
Are they native to West Texas or did someone bring them in? No, no, no, no.

202
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.780
Collared peccaries or native. Oh, okay. Like portions in New Mexico,

203
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.330
Arizona and West Texas. So they look similar to [inaudible].

204
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.970
No, it is a Havoline in a collared peccary the same damn thing. Oh, okay.

205
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.870
They got you. You'd appreciate this because, uh,

206
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.430
just knowing your tastes,

207
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.240
they have a large breast with a nipple on the top of their back.

208
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:17.830
Like what would be the neck of your ass has a nipple. Whoa.

209
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.060
That's their scent gland. So it's an actual nipple that someone nurses from,

210
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.110
Nope, but just a scent gland. Oh, I'm sure your, your trustee,

211
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.900
um, Jamie, Jamie can find a nipple on the back of a page.

212
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.940
You'll find a picture, uh, somehow related to pigs. No, people like,

213
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:40.330
people like to think that they are, but they're not. Wow. Oh there it is. Yup.

214
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.890
See that? Yeah. Havalina tits. When you clean them, you need to cut that away.

215
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.970
Um, cause it really like stinks to high heaven. Is it like a Tulsa Glen?

216
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.030
Like that same sort of succinct gland. Very powerful smell.

217
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:55.900
And you usually smell them well ahead of seeing them and they're really, um,

218
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.500
they're, they're pugnacious, you know,

219
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:04.650
you can call at them with a mimic the sound of a distressed young one and they

220
00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:09.160
come in ready to kick your ass. I saw that on your show when you and Remy went.

221
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.700
Bohum they run at Remy has got a lot of experience messing around with these

222
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:16.720
things. Um, it's funny cause they're pretty popular. Like, you know,

223
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.070
they're good to eat, but they're,

224
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.020
they're much more popular South of the border and Mexico is much more common to

225
00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:26.350
eat heavily. Them, they make sausage out of 'em and stop, grind them up,

226
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.390
make sausage. I'm a cook. You just various things like you don't,

227
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:30.280
I don't know anybody.

228
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.700
Maybe someone's out there that like actually takes like a backstrap off of a

229
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.220
Havoline and throws it on the grill.

230
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.700
But you generally do like preparations with them. Where you,

231
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:44.140
where you cook them a fair bit. Yeah. You'd have to break down.

232
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.300
They gotta be tough right now. They are, you couldn't just grill one,

233
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.450
you couldn't just grill on their lien. You got to cook them down.

234
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.230
But you can see how uh, you see whether it be popular though. Look,

235
00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:59.710
to me it's a pretty, like, it's a nice little bundle like of meat. Right.

236
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.470
And I think that in some areas, like especially, you know,

237
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.600
in snore and elsewhere, um,

238
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.830
people aren't likely to like turn their nose up at good protein sources.

239
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:10.683
There's one thing that's like,

240
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:15.790
it's one thing that's like made for bow hunting because I think that, uh,

241
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.700
with rifle hunting and people do hunt with rifles and shotguns rifles, but it's,

242
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.270
uh, it's, it's a little bit,

243
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.080
it can be kind of feel like a little bit of a gimme because they're not,

244
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.760
you have to get very close to them before their concerned about your presence.

245
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.600
They're tough. They got tossed, you know, they,

246
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.150
they can kill stuff and rip stuff and they have like, uh, they're almost,

247
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.450
you know, you think of the most, like I would imagine of all the creatures,

248
00:14:40.451 --> 00:14:45.030
like a snapping turtle is least concerned with things that, like a Snagit,

249
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.820
patrol doesn't care about anything until it's within six inches of its face and

250
00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:51.740
have Aleena's car. There's not that exaggerated but of have this,

251
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:56.330
like their world sorta seems to end at 60 yards,

252
00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.680
but they don't care what's going on outside of that buffer.

253
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.810
And so, um, so you can kind of creep up to him,

254
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.710
kind of walk up to him when you see them. Did they see bad or they like pigs,

255
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.690
but they seem to have very poor eyesight.

256
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.400
They seem to have poor eyesight and having, uh, an amazingly varied diet. Um,

257
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.850
you know, they'll eat like, I mean, if you laid there long enough,

258
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:23.480
they would come up and eat you. Yeah. They ate my friend's dog. Oh

259
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.330
<v 1>yeah. Well my friend's friend Doug Stan home, my buddy, he lives in, uh,</v>

260
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.100
he lives in Arizona. Was he pretty tore up about it? Yeah. While they were,

261
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.320
you know, they hate those fucking things. They,

262
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.620
they S they just piled on this dog and ate the neighbor's dog and apparently

263
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:40.040
it's not too uncommon.

264
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.250
<v 2>Yeah. It happens. Flesh eaters. Yeah. They don't know, fuck up a dog.</v>

265
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.660
They're weird. You know, that's like one of the things,

266
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:53.610
I think it points to the certain amount of, uh, sociopathy that I have,

267
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:58.820
but when I hear about someone losing a cat or dog to wild creatures,

268
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.220
I don't like, my initial instinct isn't to be sad.

269
00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:06.893
<v 3>Mm.</v>

270
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.340
<v 2>I see what you're saying. You're like, wow, that's part of like,</v>

271
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:13.980
because you kind of view, you sort of, I have this view that,

272
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.540
yeah, I have this view of that, that,

273
00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.580
that sort of like settlement and development V wildlife

274
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.430
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

275
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.860
<v 2>[inaudible] is a global problem. Right. And one always wins.</v>

276
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.670
Like the destruction of wildlife habitat always wins. And then when you see it,

277
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.540
when you see it play out like that,

278
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.680
and in some ways you kind of like hope like Brian Kellyanne who, you know, yup.

279
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.750
Recently, uh, you know, the kid got a young kid,

280
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.140
it was like a nine or 10 year old girl got thrown up in the air by bison. Yeah.

281
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.130
Just see that in Yellowstone. Yeah.

282
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:55.800
And by no means is Cal hoped to see someone, you know,

283
00:16:55.801 --> 00:16:59.430
especially particularly a child get hurt, but he's like, you know,

284
00:16:59.431 --> 00:17:00.360
they still got it.

285
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:02.451
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

286
00:17:02.451 --> 00:17:07.370
You can't catch close in on a bison lead got within 15 yards of that thing,

287
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:08.450
which is just ridiculous.

288
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.130
<v 2>Yeah. I think I can think about making a shirt that says, um,</v>

289
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.870
Yellowstone national park, uh, habituating wildlife since 1877

290
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.280
<v 1>they do. It is weird. Uh, I've only been once, well,</v>

291
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:20.600
I went once when I was a kid,

292
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:24.230
but I went once recently with my family and it was a very weird that you can

293
00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:26.040
take selfies with elk. You know,

294
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.810
these big herds of elk are so confident that people won't shoot them when

295
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.560
they're in like the public tourism area that they just go and hang out near the

296
00:17:33.561 --> 00:17:34.400
vending machine.

297
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:39.290
If somebody's getting a diet Coke and there's an elk like 30 yards away from me.

298
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:40.640
And it's so strange.

299
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.150
<v 2>That's, that's a little bit in line with,</v>

300
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.490
that's a little bit loud with what I'm talking about when I talk about like that

301
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:50.760
when I hear someone's dog got killed by a coyote. Yeah.

302
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.090
Oh, you know, and again, man, I know that like,

303
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.150
like my brother has this little dog he just loves and they're inseparable. Um,

304
00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.780
and if that dog got carried off by a great horned owl in a healthy Grateheart,

305
00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.140
I'll could carry this dog off. It's like a little shit and dog.

306
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.270
I would feel real bad for them. Uh, so with that said,

307
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:17.330
I do have this thing where you kind of root and I do feel sad when I see like in

308
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:20.040
a place like Yellowstone,

309
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.020
this is where it gets a little bit weird when I see an wild animals,

310
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.580
especially animals that people hunt for,

311
00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:29.370
when I see that they've lost their fear of humans,

312
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.490
some people would look and be like, Oh, this is like what?

313
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.980
Naturally they should be like, okay,

314
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.330
so this is animals where they've had to give up their human that where they've

315
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:43.770
lost their human fear because we've given them this wild place.

316
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:49.100
I see old timey, old time, Steve Miller, man,

317
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.470
that's a good dude. Joe Farren auto call him. He's a good guy. Uh,

318
00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.320
people see in like Yellowstone park atmosphere.

319
00:19:01.321 --> 00:19:04.260
You see where wildlife becomes habituated to humans and they feel like they're

320
00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:08.700
seeing something more natural. Right? Because outside of human hunting,

321
00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:10.950
they all of a sudden don't have that feeling anymore.

322
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.180
I look at that and I see that. It's like, um,

323
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.890
to me it feels like something's been subverted and somethings wrong with that

324
00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:18.150
situation. Yeah.

325
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.970
Because it sort of depends on how fresh your perspective is because I mean

326
00:19:20.971 --> 00:19:25.830
people have been hunting, uh, you know, people have been hunting in that area,

327
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.980
I mean at least 10,000 years.

328
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:33.660
So then we take like a a hundred year break and the animals become very

329
00:19:33.661 --> 00:19:38.660
accustomed to people. It's, it's shocking how quickly they can get it back. And,

330
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.470
and oftentimes those same elk that live like the same elk that will spend their

331
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:44.303
summer in that park,

332
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.100
we'll migrate out of there and go into national forest and on ranch land or then

333
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.830
there'll be wherever they can be hunted and they know they cross that line so

334
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.810
that the same [inaudible] some dude could basically walk up and touch,

335
00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:01.250
there will just something in his head switches and he enters and they enter into

336
00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:05.160
a new mind space when they leave and they're still exposed to human predation

337
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.620
and if they wind you, they'll boat. Oh yeah. It's,

338
00:20:07.621 --> 00:20:11.880
it's shocking how it's shocking the degree to which they,

339
00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:15.480
the degree to which they can keep this together in their heads.

340
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:18.420
And it's also pretty surprising how quickly they adapt. Like,

341
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:23.421
I would imagine if you were to open up,

342
00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.360
this would be a pretty controversial idea, but throw it out there.

343
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.880
Let's say you were to open up hunting in Yellowstone national park,

344
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.710
I think that it would probably be less than a year. I think like us season,

345
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.270
Oh fall hunting season would have them right back into the same mindset that all

346
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:43.680
of the other animals that live with human predation,

347
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.300
their sort of attitude toward people,

348
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.830
I think they would very quickly get it back.

349
00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.390
<v 1>It makes sense. But yeah, people going up and petting stuff. Um,</v>

350
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.840
again, like referring to cow has ideas that like

351
00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.460
people have gotten to where they confuse national parks with amusement parks and

352
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:06.370
they feel that the animals are like on rails, you know,

353
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.900
they're on tray that it is and it's like they're programmed to do a certain

354
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:12.340
thing, but it's still wild.

355
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:17.460
It's one thing that I've discovered over the last seven years thanks to you and

356
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:20.950
thanks to you getting me hunting because it,

357
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:25.810
most people have no idea what it's like to be around actual wildlife to sneak up

358
00:21:25.811 --> 00:21:29.500
to them. Most people have no idea about their sense of smell,

359
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.330
like to see an animal wind you and then just fucking bounce that to see that.

360
00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:37.570
And to know that like you're dealing with some superhuman ability,

361
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:42.780
some like impossible to imagine with the confines of your own biology,

362
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.030
what these animals can do. And when you're,

363
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.870
when you're out amongst them and there's no cell phone service and there's,

364
00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.840
it's just footprints and

365
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:58.050
trekking your way through mountains. It's amazing. I mean it's,

366
00:21:58.051 --> 00:22:02.800
it's not Yellowstone what Yellowstone is and what anything like that.

367
00:22:02.801 --> 00:22:06.640
And zoos is the worst example, right? But when we think of animals,

368
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:11.320
like people always tell me like, like, cause you know, I have a famous dog,

369
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.460
I've run with them all the time and he's on my Instagram and it's like everybody

370
00:22:15.461 --> 00:22:17.800
loves him. He's the sweetest dog in the world. And they, they're like,

371
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.820
know that dog. If you love dogs, how could you, how could you hunt animals?

372
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:27.130
And I'm like, well no, that's not, he's not an animal. He's a dog. He's a pet.

373
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.900
[inaudible] is a science project and the animals, a Wolf,

374
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.770
an animal's a deer. That's an animal. What a dog is.

375
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.180
They don't survive outside of us. If you don't take care of them,

376
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.710
they won't know what to do.

377
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.100
They'll hope that the dog catcher comes and gets them than somebody rescues

378
00:22:45.101 --> 00:22:48.190
them. They're not wild animals. It's not. It has,

379
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:52.840
it almost has less to do with how they're raised and more to do with their

380
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:55.720
ancestors. Like their, their biology has changed.

381
00:22:55.721 --> 00:22:58.390
They've literally been bred to something different.

382
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.770
They're a fucking science project. Yeah. You see, my dog's got floppy ears.

383
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.840
He's a sweetheart. Everybody who meets him,

384
00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:06.880
he drops his back and wants you to rub his belly.

385
00:23:06.881 --> 00:23:09.670
He's just the sweetest dog in the world. That is not a dog. I mean,

386
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:10.623
it's not an animal.

387
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.660
There's not an animal like that that would ever exist out in the wild because if

388
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:16.390
he sees another dog, he's like, hello. Are you my friend?

389
00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.420
He's not like checking to see if the thing's gonna steal his food or,

390
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.200
or Rob him of his mates or your kill his babies. He's, it's,

391
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.680
it's the result of a 20,000 or whatever.

392
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.880
Your experimentation with the domestication of an animal. Yeah. So most people,

393
00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:34.480
when they say they love animals, they don't even fucking know any,

394
00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:39.580
they don't even know what they are. They see the caged animals at the zoo.

395
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.420
They see the animals on a rope that they, they take to the dog park.

396
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.880
They think they know what an is. They don't even have any experience with it.

397
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.890
We've been so domesticated and so isolated in cities.

398
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.090
Most people, especially most people that have opinions on this shit, you know,

399
00:23:56.091 --> 00:23:57.890
people that live in rural areas. I mean,

400
00:23:57.891 --> 00:24:00.870
you know that you live in Bozeman and Bozeman is, you know,

401
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.660
surrounded by these areas that are just fucking completely wild.

402
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:06.830
I mean, if you're in Bozeman,

403
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:11.831
you can drive an hour from your house and then you're around bears and di and

404
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.720
Eagles. I mean, it's a completely wild place.

405
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:19.820
But people that are in those areas, people around Boise, Idaho for example,

406
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.820
they have a totally different idea. People in Wyoming,

407
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:27.320
I have a totally different idea of what wildlife is versus somebody who lives in

408
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:31.520
Santa Monica. There's a video that just, somebody sent me today of, um,

409
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.150
a guy in thousand Oaks, uh,

410
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:39.500
is a on his street and he's filming a fucking enormous mountain lion. I mean,

411
00:24:39.501 --> 00:24:41.270
it is huge. It's a big boy.

412
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.020
It's like 150 pounds and they're in the car and they're looking at it through

413
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:46.250
the window and him and his son,

414
00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:48.950
it seems like our are filming this thing called Holy shit.

415
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:51.860
Look at this thing that's right there in the street, a big ass cat.

416
00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.080
And he was saying that like somebody was filmed,

417
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.860
somebody was feeding in apparently and there they're trying to figure out what

418
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.713
you want me to send it to you,

419
00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.220
<v 4>um,</v>

420
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.210
<v 1>I'll send it to you. But this, uh, you know, that's,</v>

421
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.080
that's super rare. I mean, that's a real wild animal. It's super,

422
00:25:07.081 --> 00:25:10.410
super rail that anybody would have any kind of experience with one of these

423
00:25:10.411 --> 00:25:11.244
things.

424
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.190
And most people that are talking about animals that would just really don't know

425
00:25:14.191 --> 00:25:16.050
what that even means. They're just saying it.

426
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.980
<v 2>Yeah. I think that there, there's developed a, like a,</v>

427
00:25:19.981 --> 00:25:24.450
a pretty big cultural division between people who,

428
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.470
um,

429
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.040
a pretty big cultural division between people who kind of like live around work

430
00:25:29.041 --> 00:25:33.840
around and deal with animals and people who view them or think of them as very

431
00:25:33.841 --> 00:25:36.600
other. Uh, a friend of mine who's a biologist.

432
00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.980
<v 1>Oh, there you go. Yeah. Nope, no, I'm sending you another one. I sent it to you.</v>

433
00:25:40.981 --> 00:25:45.750
It's, it's a from thousand Oaks. I just sent it to a friend of mine though.

434
00:25:45.751 --> 00:25:47.010
That's a, that's a recent one too.

435
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:51.750
<v 2>Oh, buddy of mine who was a biologist with the forest service guy named Carl</v>

436
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.060
Malcolm. He might've heard on our show. Uh,

437
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.720
he just sent me a paper that was about kids' attitudes to wildlife and it was

438
00:26:00.511 --> 00:26:04.890
comparing rural peoples attitude and knowledge of wildlife,

439
00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:10.250
the kids with urban and suburban attitudes about wildlife.

440
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.750
And you can see the input of media when you look at this thing because

441
00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.040
people who live in an urban or suburban environment,

442
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.430
when they tell you the top of mind wildlife,

443
00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:29.170
they know about this non-native stuff like lions. Yeah.

444
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:30.640
They're likely to know like what's,

445
00:26:30.641 --> 00:26:34.390
what's an animal right in an animal and be like, Oh, that'd be like a DRAF.

446
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.700
Right. And people who have a more, um,

447
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.850
rural or remote viewpoint would be,

448
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.670
are much more likely to like when they think of wildlife to think of things that

449
00:26:47.671 --> 00:26:49.800
they interact with, you know,

450
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:54.060
and not like the things that are on your mobile above your crib when you're a

451
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:58.800
little baby and it sort of points. And also there's a slight tendency,

452
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.000
I gotta look at this more carefully,

453
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:05.001
but as a slight tendency to have a negative feelings or things that are

454
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:07.290
dangerous or bad.

455
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.380
The more urban you are in terms of native wildlife to more recognize it as like

456
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:18.000
a negative or bad thing. And where they're pointing to is. Um, again,

457
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:19.530
I want to look at this much more carefully in, pardon me,

458
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.630
to the officers authors if I'm messing this up.

459
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:23.430
I was just looking at it this morning, um,

460
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.580
or they're pointing to is the, the,

461
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.050
the stirrings of there being a,

462
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.000
a greater acceptance of decreased biodiversity,

463
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.370
meaning that you're kind of like,

464
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.290
okay with the bad things having gone and we're focused on like what animals.

465
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:40.531
Well,

466
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:45.060
animals will be like a draft and hippopotamus and the things that that Disney

467
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.380
tells me about and not like possums and raccoons, which are kind of gross.

468
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.280
<v 0>Huh. You know, you had the video. Yeah.</v>

469
00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:55.550
<v 1>Look at this fat boy [inaudible]</v>

470
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.633
<v 0>play this thing.</v>

471
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.060
<v 1>It's collard isn't it? Yeah. It's got a collar on it. It's interesting.</v>

472
00:28:02.061 --> 00:28:05.510
I could see that better. There's a lot of them out here that have collars.

473
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.130
We got a photo that we just had, uh, commissioned and uh, should get here soon,

474
00:28:10.131 --> 00:28:12.920
right? Yeah. It's huge of a,

475
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.930
the big cat that they photograph near the Hollywood sign. Yeah.

476
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.210
It looks like it's staged.

477
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:21.890
I mean the cat is walking right by the trail camera in the hall. Those famous,

478
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:26.510
uh, yeah, it was in national geographic. Yes. Yeah. That's a good picture. Yeah.

479
00:28:26.511 --> 00:28:29.960
We got one a printed on stepdad picture right there. I mean, come on man.

480
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:33.110
That's crazy. That is a God damn crazy picture.

481
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.590
It's a John and cat like the forums on that motherfucker.

482
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.580
No sag you stomach. But it bums me out looking at that color.

483
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:44.350
There was a conversation that you had on your podcast. It's about shooting,

484
00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.140
about shooting a deer that's wearing a collar. And I'm with you.

485
00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.990
I'm with you 100%. I don't want to shoot a deer that's wearing a collar.

486
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.310
I don't care if it's wild as fuck.

487
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.450
They caught it when it was a baby and they just waited and measured it and then

488
00:28:56.451 --> 00:29:00.230
let it go and it didn't have a collar. And uh, I saw that deer,

489
00:29:00.231 --> 00:29:01.490
I wouldn't think twice about shooting it,

490
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.180
but if I saw it and it was wearing a collar, I'm like, I'm out. No, totally.

491
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.940
There's a really funny thing and you might've, you probably caught wind of this,

492
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.870
uh, or know about this, is that it's a big deal. Yeah.

493
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.860
To shoot a duck with a band on it. Everybody knows this coolest shit. Like,

494
00:29:15.861 --> 00:29:18.950
I know that everybody wants to shoot a band. Most people listen to this.

495
00:29:18.951 --> 00:29:23.780
Don't know that it's coolest shit if you get abandoned duck. Why is that?

496
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.200
Well,

497
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:29.200
it's a little bit social science because long ago like we used to not understand

498
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.420
<v 2>this cat a little bit tricky to explain.</v>

499
00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:41.760
We used to not understand how migrations worked because everyone only knew what

500
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:44.260
they saw. Okay.

501
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.370
And there wasn't someone who was sort of like coalescing all of this

502
00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:52.440
information. People would know very well, like you know, wherever you,

503
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:56.170
you live along the Mississippi river. Okay. Um,

504
00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.420
and you might know very well that like in November shitloads docs that you

505
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:03.430
haven't seen, they haven't been here all year,

506
00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:07.630
are coming from the North and going to the South.

507
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.780
And you knew that very well. You knew that dog's moved,

508
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:15.490
you knew that they move through here, but you didn't put all of the,

509
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.620
you had no way to put all the pieces together

510
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.033
over time.

511
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.860
We wanted to understand like animal migrations better and one of the earth,

512
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.720
this is way pre collars, like GPS collars and pit tags and shit. Uh,

513
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.360
we started this banding system where you could go and catch a dock and it's,

514
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.280
we're in this nesting area.

515
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.770
There's like times a year when it's really easy to catch dogs. One,

516
00:30:38.771 --> 00:30:40.810
you can catch them when they're young and you can catch them when they mold.

517
00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.450
So people would go out and put a band on a dock and you'd go,

518
00:30:43.451 --> 00:30:44.290
you could go up in the,

519
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.130
in the Arctic or the upper Midwest anywhere and throw a band on a baby duck.

520
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.320
And that band would have a phone number on it.

521
00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:56.560
And you were encouraged to, when you got abandoned doc,

522
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.230
it was like they made it be that it was a good thing.

523
00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:04.000
And you were encouraged to call that one 800 number or whatever the hell they

524
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:07.330
were before 1-800-NUMBERS and give them the, the, the, the band,

525
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:08.290
the band number.

526
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:13.740
And then we started to really with like great detail map out flyways how ducks

527
00:31:14.321 --> 00:31:17.430
migrated, like the docks in, uh,

528
00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:22.120
on the Arctic slope and Alaska tend to follow along this path and they tend to

529
00:31:22.121 --> 00:31:25.930
end up here at this date. And then they're down in, you know,

530
00:31:25.931 --> 00:31:27.610
whatever they're down in Texas all of a sudden,

531
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:30.730
or they're down in Southern California and they're there,

532
00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:33.400
they're hanging out in rice fields around Sacramento. Whatever it held is,

533
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:36.640
we started to put together this whole detailed picture and it was one of the

534
00:31:36.641 --> 00:31:40.930
great achievements in wildlife biology was what we learned from the duck banding

535
00:31:40.931 --> 00:31:45.850
system. So I think that over time it became, like I said,

536
00:31:45.851 --> 00:31:49.750
it was sort of like social engineering where people were taught to think it was

537
00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:54.670
cool and you would wear an a band. You would, if you had a lanyard, right?

538
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.040
You, you keep your dot calls on. This still goes on.

539
00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.700
If you've got a land your ever dot calls on any abandoned bird, you get,

540
00:32:00.701 --> 00:32:02.710
you put that band on your lanyard.

541
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.400
I haven't met these knuckleheads in North Dakota who have a lot of bands on

542
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:12.820
their lanyards from banded birds. They've shot. And you'd be like, dude,

543
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:16.690
that's a lot of bands. And he goes, yeah, not one of them is reported. Hmm.

544
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.033
They think that it,

545
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:22.980
that it remains more pure to do.

546
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.230
I don't know. That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. Dumb ass shit.

547
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:30.040
I wish you guys did like calling. Anybody want to contribute to, I don't know.

548
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:33.370
You'd have to have like a calling component to your show and we would call one

549
00:32:33.371 --> 00:32:36.010
of these dudes and have him explain in greater detail.

550
00:32:36.011 --> 00:32:37.360
But I remember thinking like that's the most,

551
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.410
that's the most fucked up thing I've ever heard. But yeah,

552
00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:42.010
I don't think you'd want to talk to that guy. And was like, he's like, yeah,

553
00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.220
they're all unreported anyways. I don't know if it's like an anti science thing,

554
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.900
but you love to argue. Did you talk to that guy about this? You know,

555
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:49.910
it was long ago. I could tell you where I was standing.

556
00:32:49.911 --> 00:32:53.390
I was in my brother's kitchen in miles city, Montana. Um, but neat.

557
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:56.300
This crazy chandelier. He bought it online and I remember everything about it,

558
00:32:56.301 --> 00:32:57.320
but I don't remember when I,

559
00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:02.350
if I challenged him on the sense of being proud of having not contributed to our

560
00:33:03.261 --> 00:33:07.820
scientific understanding of waterfowl migrations and why.

561
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.280
Maybe there's like a sort of anti-government sentiment,

562
00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.080
like some black helicopter stuff. Okay. Regardless. Yeah,

563
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.400
some malicious shit. It's cool to have bands and I have like in my sort of,

564
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:21.920
I have like a box where I put the important stuff to me,

565
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.570
but imagine if you had a box of dear collars. Dude, there's no way if I,

566
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:30.260
I wouldn't put into your car. That's what I'm getting at is like those are cool,

567
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:32.090
but collars are not. And we had a friend, there's a,

568
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:33.500
there's a friend of mine who's a,

569
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.400
she does a lot of carnival research and other research projects named

570
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.350
Carmen van Biyanki, which is a cool name. But she says that, you know,

571
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:47.351
I'm someone that collars animals and I even think that she's like,

572
00:33:47.571 --> 00:33:51.170
when you get one with a collar on it, she said it was cool.

573
00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:52.700
We talked about this the other day where she's like,

574
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.160
someone has already got the best of them.

575
00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.690
Did they become tainted when they've been held by someone else?

576
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.380
And that's a little bit how I view it. Where like a wild animal,

577
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:08.210
you want to imagine it being like the wildest wild animal and it has a collar.

578
00:34:08.211 --> 00:34:12.590
It's like someone, it's all sloppy seconds man. Yeah.

579
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:17.570
Well isn't that why the lure of Alaska so interesting because it's one of the

580
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:21.410
rare places where like if you run into a caribou in Alaska,

581
00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.770
there's a high probability that run counter to person never,

582
00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.940
it doesn't even know what you are.

583
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.120
Like you've seen videos of hunters walking towards caribou with like their bow

584
00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.970
on their head and the care of it was like, what in the fuck is this?

585
00:34:34.971 --> 00:34:38.090
They don't even know. They think that Bo is a rack.

586
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:42.200
Their assumption in areas where I've been, um,

587
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:47.240
particularly like look up on the Arctic slope. Uh, no, that's not true.

588
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.510
Cause I've seen it a lot in the mountain ranges too in South central Alaska.

589
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:53.000
When they see your movement,

590
00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:59.180
their assumption is you're a caribou. That's like,

591
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.610
it seems, I can't, you can't get in their head,

592
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.350
but their assumption is that like, Oh,

593
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:06.410
I better go check it out and then I'll circle down wind to make sure it's not a,

594
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.310
uh, make sure it's not a grizzly or a Wolf or whatever, but they're like,

595
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:14.510
you know, something the way a few hundred pounds, a couple of hundred pounds,

596
00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.580
whatever, walking around probably a care of him. And he was like, come on over.

597
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:23.290
They come to you until they can rule it out, but they're gregarious.

598
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.960
They want to find each other. Uh, and it, it,

599
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:30.860
that sort of thing like winds up giving you a little bit of a sense of, uh,

600
00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.240
it makes me feel a little bit bad for them. Right. They're, they're,

601
00:35:34.241 --> 00:35:38.100
they're not tuned in like a mule deer is, and then you realize it's just like

602
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.980
<v 0>living like that. I mean, these things are, these are things that could migrate,</v>

603
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:42.900
you know, they migrate hundreds, hundreds of miles.

604
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.030
Have you landed to access to your yet? Yeah.

605
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.980
Access deer in Hawaii is the most perverse, strange,

606
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.910
but necessary hunting that I've ever experienced.

607
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.090
And they don't have an app like on Hawaiian,

608
00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.050
they're not dealing with natural predators. It's just, it's all,

609
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.210
they're just like, they're just very intuned to that.

610
00:36:02.211 --> 00:36:06.690
Like their predator being people. Yeah. I imagine that they probably, um,

611
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.680
care the same way that we carry with us

612
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.160
and a sort of natural abhorrence of snakes, you know,

613
00:36:17.161 --> 00:36:21.830
a natural abhorrent of spiders. I would imagine that they come from a,

614
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.890
that you probably know a little bit better mixed. You spent more time with axes,

615
00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.550
deer. They probably come from a very predator rich environment, I'm guessing.

616
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:34.260
Oh, originally. Yeah. And, and, and carry with them a real high,

617
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:38.540
strong sense. I'm having dealt with like very efficient predators. Tigers. Yeah.

618
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.940
They evolved to get, get away from tigers. They gotta be high strong.

619
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.160
They're the fastest things I've ever seen in my life.

620
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:48.180
I have videos of one where I shot at this one from 55 yards,

621
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:53.040
15 yards away. He sees the arrow coming 15 yards away from him and he's like,

622
00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.280
yup, dogs is out of there. It's crazy.

623
00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:59.820
It's like they kind of understand that things coming towards them,

624
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:05.040
kill them because they are hunted 365 days a year because they have to.

625
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.330
There's so overrun.

626
00:37:06.331 --> 00:37:10.230
There's some somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30,000 deer on this one

627
00:37:10.231 --> 00:37:13.980
Island with 3000 people. And you've never seen herds like this before.

628
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:18.570
It's crazy. I want to bring you, it was when I ha I haunted them years ago.

629
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:24.150
Um, and I remember the area I had been had been hunted very, very heavily.

630
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.070
Uh, did they call them? They call them doles or Hines Hines.

631
00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:34.600
It had been hunted very heavily stags and my God was the, from my,

632
00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:37.720
from my very limited perspective,

633
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:41.980
from just a small set of experiences that happen over a couple of days.

634
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:45.370
It seemed like, um, the,

635
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.110
the pressure on the males had been extraordinary where it seemed like you would

636
00:37:50.111 --> 00:37:53.980
see a hundred Hines per stag.

637
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.800
And I don't know if that's common. There are not. No, it's not.

638
00:37:56.801 --> 00:37:59.710
It's all I remember remembering, like very surprised by that. It's almost 50,

639
00:37:59.711 --> 00:38:03.970
50 when you go to these areas, uh, that are, you know,

640
00:38:03.971 --> 00:38:07.300
in Lanai. And apparently the same thing with Maui. They're everywhere.

641
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:11.020
There's so many of them. Maui has a real, uh, eradication, uh,

642
00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:15.880
sort of a program underway, which is controversial, right? Very controversial.

643
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:19.650
But they're also selling it. There's a, they're selling, uh,

644
00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.870
venison sticks and venison jerky. And there,

645
00:38:22.871 --> 00:38:25.940
there's companies that are establishing these. They're,

646
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.560
they're establishing these a conservation efforts where they're going out and

647
00:38:29.561 --> 00:38:33.550
they're shooting X amount per year, like 6,000 per year, which is like,

648
00:38:33.551 --> 00:38:36.250
doesn't even put a dent on, is the goal of Radication

649
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.170
<v 2>or is the goal just to limit limit them?</v>

650
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:39.910
But they eradicated them from the big Island.

651
00:38:39.911 --> 00:38:41.290
Somebody had put them on the big Island.

652
00:38:41.291 --> 00:38:43.610
Somebody had taken them from one of the other islands and put them on the big

653
00:38:43.611 --> 00:38:47.950
Island and they had spent millions of dollars to eradicate them. Forgive me,

654
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.990
stop me if we spoke about this before,

655
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.730
but there's a kind of an interesting perspective that someone gave to me about

656
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:59.770
Hawaii where we have this list, you know,

657
00:38:59.771 --> 00:39:04.600
Hawaii just dominated by non-natives. Okay. Um,

658
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.360
I'm going to be wrong about somebody, but I don't think I am breadfruit,

659
00:39:07.361 --> 00:39:10.900
coconut, um, all these,

660
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.960
like all the major fruiting trees are non-native and so much of the wildlife is

661
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.320
not named. I mean they have like, like surprising shit. They have wild turkeys.

662
00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:23.640
There's wild cattle, pigs, acts, deer.

663
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.740
I mean just like BlackBuck antelope running around wild horses.

664
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.760
Chuckers pheasants. Just they hunt horses. Yeah. Yeah.

665
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.610
I will start a new guy one time that snares cattle.

666
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:35.783
<v 6>Wow.</v>

667
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:40.600
<v 2>I don't if he does it illegally or not, but he snares cattle. My mom's a,</v>

668
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.580
um, I guess I would call it, you know, technically he'd be my stepfather.

669
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.830
It feels funny. My mom, my stepfather, my mom's husband who,

670
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.900
who she married after my dad passed away, he grew up snare in white tail,

671
00:39:52.901 --> 00:39:56.710
deer with garage door cable. But they, they were like,

672
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:02.250
they were farmers and is eight and that was sort of his relationship was deer

673
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:05.980
set in snare at setting garage cable snares. Yeah.

674
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:10.600
And just using that as a source of food. There it is hungry, you know, poor. Um,

675
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.970
but uh, anyways, in Hawaii, right.

676
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.073
Those were con,

677
00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:21.110
those islands were colonized by humans like 1100 years ago and those in silver,

678
00:40:23.131 --> 00:40:26.670
now we have like native Hawaiians or Hawaiians. Right. Um,

679
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.760
and I've spoken with,

680
00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:32.010
with some native Hawaiians who feel that there's this uneasy relationship

681
00:40:32.011 --> 00:40:37.011
between what we're regarding and describing as non native wildlife,

682
00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:42.470
even down to pigs, even though their ancestors, you know,

683
00:40:42.471 --> 00:40:47.471
1100 years ago brought the pig to the Island and someone expressed me very

684
00:40:47.841 --> 00:40:51.320
simply, he's like, how can I be Hawaiian?

685
00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.500
Like I'm native Hawaiian, I damn sure am Hawaiian.

686
00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:00.050
Why is the thing that I hunt regarded as a non native and needs to be eradicated

687
00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:03.260
is like if we really want to talk about non-natives,

688
00:41:03.261 --> 00:41:06.950
I feel like that would be you. Right? Yeah.

689
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.940
And he was like, yeah. And he was kind of pissed about this,

690
00:41:10.941 --> 00:41:13.280
this attitude towards, cause these are guys that like to hunt,

691
00:41:13.281 --> 00:41:16.940
eat a lot of wild game about this attitude to access to your and his attitude to

692
00:41:16.941 --> 00:41:19.280
pigs. And you hear the same thing out of Australia.

693
00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.210
You to say anything out of New Zealand which has guys who have this,

694
00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:28.240
this difficult relationship with the things that they've come to hunt and the

695
00:41:28.761 --> 00:41:30.860
things that have sort of been culturally accepted,

696
00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:35.570
culturally accepted as as wildlife. Right. Um,

697
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:39.140
where people, you know, I don't want to use,

698
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.320
I don't want to use environmentalist here in a way that makes it be that the,

699
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:45.590
that the hunters aren't necessarily environmentalist but in ways where some

700
00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:49.430
people with what they would describe as an environmental agenda want to see

701
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:50.930
species eradicated.

702
00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.620
The people who have been interacting with for a hundred years in some cases

703
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.540
like, like in Hawaii in some cases,

704
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:59.720
perhaps a thousand years they've been interacting with it on the landscape,

705
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.290
but then someone wants to come and say we want to get rid of it cause it's not

706
00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:06.650
native. And it causes like a ton of tension.

707
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:10.990
Where it creates a weird situation for people in, in,

708
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
in some of these places is that hunters have long justified their actions to the

709
00:42:19.821 --> 00:42:23.060
public as being that we're controlling, right?

710
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:26.060
We're like controlling nonnatives so we're doing a good thing.

711
00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.550
But then someone says like, Oh, you know, I got in that better idea,

712
00:42:28.551 --> 00:42:29.660
let's just kill all of them.

713
00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.490
<v 1>And then the Hunter was like, Whoa, we know they did that off.</v>

714
00:42:33.491 --> 00:42:36.490
I don't mean like that was an Island off the California coast that was filled

715
00:42:36.491 --> 00:42:39.520
with elk and deer. Oh, what was it called? I don't forget.

716
00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:43.960
See if you find the Radikale it all of them, they just machine gun them. Yeah,

717
00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.930
just helicopters and just eradicate it. All of them.

718
00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.750
Are you familiar with the practice in those cases where they could have a Judas

719
00:42:49.751 --> 00:42:52.990
animal? Yes. Yeah, that's good. Shit is a great a article about,

720
00:42:52.991 --> 00:42:57.991
or a podcast about that from a radio lab where they kept sending this Judas goat

721
00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:03.090
toe at the Galapagos and he'd find the other NGOs and like [inaudible],

722
00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.950
they'd got them all down as Judas go and be like, where am I friends?

723
00:43:05.951 --> 00:43:08.530
Fuck and just keep, keep wandering off. And you know,

724
00:43:08.531 --> 00:43:10.700
he sterile so he can't breathe. Oh, Zara.

725
00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:13.810
And he'd go to find these other goats and they'd follow the collar,

726
00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:16.870
the GPS on the collar and find the new group of goats.

727
00:43:16.871 --> 00:43:20.620
And they'd gun them down too. That would begin to wear on a human.

728
00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.630
Yeah. I don't think goats entirely go. What's going on there day?

729
00:43:26.631 --> 00:43:30.050
We had a meeting with our kids. Okay. We had a meeting with our kids. Oh,

730
00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.990
Santa Rosa Island. Yeah, so Santa Rosa Island. Dude, I was just,

731
00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.120
that was there not long ago.

732
00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:39.180
It used to be filled with elk and deer and people had sort of set it up.

733
00:43:39.371 --> 00:43:41.950
Santa Rosa Island elk. They had set it up.

734
00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.670
Pro hunters hit Santa Rosa Island,

735
00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.540
[inaudible] nationals, and that case I would have used professional,

736
00:43:49.541 --> 00:43:52.390
not pro murders, deer murderers.

737
00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.580
This was in 2011 so it was a few earlier,

738
00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.520
fairly recent thing where they eradicated all these animals.

739
00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:01.570
I just not long ago fished off there. It's supposed to be amazing fishing.

740
00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.770
The Catalina apparently is like the greatest Maaco shark fishing in the world,

741
00:44:05.771 --> 00:44:08.410
which is here. Here's a weird one. Shark fishing.

742
00:44:08.411 --> 00:44:09.490
All of a sudden you're an asshole.

743
00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.030
They used to be with jaws like you caught a shark. Hey, good.

744
00:44:13.031 --> 00:44:15.180
Get that fucking thing outta here. They're going to kill people. Yeah.

745
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:19.860
Now it's like you monster shark's fin soup, don't you care about that?

746
00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:23.200
Don't you know this global warming, like everything is conflated.

747
00:44:23.201 --> 00:44:26.080
It's all like piled on together. Like you, what are you doing with a shark?

748
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.920
You used to be able to buy Maaco shark in a restaurant. Oh, you still see it?

749
00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:32.190
But there is a there. I saw a thresher shark

750
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.780
<v 2>the other day on a menu. I did a story, I did a magazine story about this long,</v>

751
00:44:36.781 --> 00:44:39.740
long ago. It was like, it was a road when I got out of school night,

752
00:44:39.741 --> 00:44:41.130
it was the first like assignment.

753
00:44:41.131 --> 00:44:45.660
I had to go write a article and I was wearing it for outside magazine. And um,

754
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.060
this is 19 years ago, man.

755
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.310
And there's a thing called Maaco madness and it was this thing in Montauk.

756
00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.580
Uh, you know what's funny about doing this,

757
00:44:56.581 --> 00:44:59.370
this is in 2000 and I got sent out there, had never,

758
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:01.560
ever been to New York and I didn't even go into the city.

759
00:45:01.561 --> 00:45:06.360
I just flew into wherever the hell I flew into and got a car and stupidly took a

760
00:45:06.361 --> 00:45:10.170
cab to, I didn't understand the, I was very young.

761
00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.920
I didn't understand like I took a cab from like the airport out to Montauk.

762
00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.580
Oh my God. Yeah. How much does that cost? I don't even remember if I remember,

763
00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:20.140
like when I had to turn in my expenses, people are like home. What? Nobody,

764
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:23.340
I just, I didn't know. But anyways, it was funny cause uh,

765
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:25.320
I remember driving along and seeing the,

766
00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.470
it was like the summer before and seeing the,

767
00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.120
when it was like a year before and seeing the twin towers, you know,

768
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:34.050
and I was like my first ever view and I never saw that place again.

769
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:37.680
I never saw it again until after. But there's this thing called, uh,

770
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.720
Maaco madness and I was like a shark tournament and traditionally had been like

771
00:45:42.721 --> 00:45:46.200
a contest to get the biggest shark and they would bet money on it.

772
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.290
And there was like the general registration fee.

773
00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:54.180
So all these captains who had charter boats would join Maaco madness and they'd

774
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:58.440
book clients on their boats for Maaco madness. And when you had to,

775
00:45:58.441 --> 00:46:01.020
you had to pay some amount of money. There's probably still goes on,

776
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:06.050
you have to pay some amount of money to register your boat to be in the contest.

777
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:09.890
But the real money was in all these side bets called cow cutters.

778
00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:11.220
And so you could,

779
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:15.000
there was enough side betting going on run all the various captains that the

780
00:46:15.001 --> 00:46:18.210
biggest Maiko could win 100,000,

781
00:46:18.211 --> 00:46:20.670
couple hundred thousand dollars to catch the biggest Maaco.

782
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
But the sort of the fatal flaw in this tournament from a public perception

783
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:30.630
standpoint would be that there was a category for just biggest shark.

784
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.870
And there's a category for like biggest Maiko.

785
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.880
So people going out like at a time, this is when,

786
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:44.070
at, this is when shark populations were still, you know,

787
00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:46.530
and globally they're still on the decline.

788
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.110
But there was still a lot of shark bycatch from swordfish,

789
00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:50.910
long lining and other things. And there was,

790
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:55.020
people were getting very worried about shark stocks and shark numbers. Um,

791
00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.910
and at one time Maaco madness.

792
00:46:56.911 --> 00:46:58.950
There's a lot more makos like people would be writers or makos.

793
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:02.430
But there had been some years where Maaco madness had no makos.

794
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.930
People weren't bringing in a Maaco so everyone would go out and just take,

795
00:47:06.931 --> 00:47:09.990
make damn sure that like, I don't want to come back empty.

796
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.930
So they would catch a blue shark.

797
00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:15.600
Cause if no one caught a Maaco,

798
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:18.900
you still might get biggest shark from catching a blue shark.

799
00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.090
And at the end of this thing, man, they had dumpsters. They were not dumpsters.

800
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:23.490
They had,

801
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:28.490
they would fill a dumpster with blue sharks and no one would eat it.

802
00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:33.010
Dude would, no, it would go into a dumpster. You can eat blue shark. Yeah.

803
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.520
Well you can, they're high and urea. And as you know, it's like everything else,

804
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:41.170
like yes, you can still pose the most edible Maaco thresher.

805
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.440
Um, can you eat a great white, you know, it's funny about great whites.

806
00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.120
There's a guy as a writer I love,

807
00:47:46.121 --> 00:47:48.520
and he does all of these fisheries guidebooks named Vick Dunaway.

808
00:47:48.521 --> 00:47:50.410
I don't know if he's dead or alive, but I got all of his books.

809
00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:54.010
He's got like Gulf coast, Pacific ocean land at coast. Um,

810
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.700
he does these books like it's like all the fish that you're likely to catch,

811
00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.330
kind of like how to catch them. Then what I like about it,

812
00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:06.331
he's got like a quality food quality section and his food quality sections are

813
00:48:06.521 --> 00:48:08.310
really funny. And like the,

814
00:48:08.311 --> 00:48:11.890
the highest praise you can give something like excellent or one of the best,

815
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:15.460
right? So if you look up snuck, it'd be like one of the best. Um, his,

816
00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:19.360
his headline for great. I lurked in great white shark. He says, don't even ask,

817
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.020
but people feel that they'd be good because salmon shark are good.

818
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.850
These come porbeagles like salmon shark have very good reputation and makos have

819
00:48:27.851 --> 00:48:30.400
a good reputation and threshers have market value.

820
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:34.000
And there's other sharks in other areas. They have market value,

821
00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:37.600
but those ones are like our ones that are popular table fair. Um,

822
00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.710
the assumption is that white, that great white sharks would probably be good.

823
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.540
It must be somebody who's eating one. Oh,

824
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:44.800
I'm sure there's plenty of people that are beating them.

825
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.070
But at this Maaco madness thing, I can't remember the point I was getting at.

826
00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.790
What the hell was I driving at? But talking about Maaco madness. Oh,

827
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:56.980
in this article I got into like the history of where like shark hunting and

828
00:48:56.981 --> 00:49:00.730
killing sharks came from is you're familiar with jaws, right? Well,

829
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:04.810
sorta the shark fishermen character and jaws is based on this like very real

830
00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:05.171
dude,

831
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:10.171
Frank Mundus and Frank Mundus used to fish out of Montauk and at a time Montauk

832
00:49:10.511 --> 00:49:14.440
was his premier destination for catching swordfish and big bluefin tuna.

833
00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:19.770
And as those big pelagic fisheries had claps from overfishing in the seventies

834
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:25.570
Frank Mundus, he'd go out and he'd just go out and find a, you know,

835
00:49:25.571 --> 00:49:28.810
he'd go out famously who'd go out and find a beach whale are not a beach whale,

836
00:49:28.811 --> 00:49:30.040
but a floating dead whale.

837
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:35.250
And he'd anchor up on that whale and catch big ass great whites and then come in

838
00:49:35.531 --> 00:49:38.830
and hang the bloody carcass up on the docks.

839
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.920
And he made necklaces with tooth sharks and shit.

840
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:45.370
And he became like the monster man or something of the monster Hunter and

841
00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:49.000
started to book all these crazy trips were tourists to come and be like,

842
00:49:49.001 --> 00:49:50.920
Holy shit, I want to go kill a big monster.

843
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:55.720
And he's credited with having created this like culture of like going out and

844
00:49:55.721 --> 00:49:59.590
getting yeah, that's Frank Mondo. You see that picture? Upper left dude.

845
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.110
So yeah,

846
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:06.970
he kinda like built this idea of like shark haunting and inlet shark bite in his

847
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:09.050
forearm. Go back to that. That'd be interesting.

848
00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.510
What's going on as I understood form. Ah,

849
00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:15.040
something took a bite out of that motherfucker. Yes. He's got the necklace.

850
00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:19.040
Yeah, the dead shark and Frank Mundus kinda like,

851
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:23.590
like spawned this sort of thing where you'd want to go out and catch a big shark

852
00:50:23.591 --> 00:50:28.130
and hang it up and then throw it in the dumpster. Wow. And people

853
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.940
<v 0>look at, like, when people look at that history, they look at it being is like,</v>

854
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:36.941
it's like in some ways Mundis and shark hunting was symptomatic of declining

855
00:50:38.661 --> 00:50:41.480
fisheries. Look at that picture of him and the dude from the movie.

856
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:43.040
They're so similar. Look at that.

857
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:46.160
The black and white in the color next to each other. Look at that. Oh yeah.

858
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:49.880
What was that guy's name? The guy in the movie. Can't remember.

859
00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:53.600
What was the actor's name? That guy was fucking awesome. What a great scene.

860
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:58.970
You know Moe Fallon. Yeah. That's still his favorite movie.

861
00:50:58.971 --> 00:51:01.630
I think it's great. Most dude, he loves jobs. Right?

862
00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:04.730
It's interesting that the narrative you could convince the next time you see

863
00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:08.060
him, have him convinced you the jaws is the greatest movie ever. Great movie.

864
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:11.930
It's a great movie. Richard Dreyfus. And come on, um,

865
00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:16.670
the narrative of a shark's fin soup and sharks being, you know,

866
00:51:16.671 --> 00:51:19.070
something that we need to protect that sort of,

867
00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:22.610
it's a new thing and something that only existed over the last decade or so.

868
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:25.830
I think so, yeah. Used to be if you caught a shark like good for you,

869
00:51:25.831 --> 00:51:29.750
you keeping it from killing someone who's swimming or someone who is surfing

870
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:32.450
the, the, the, the idea of sharks, fin soup.

871
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:37.240
And it's allure was driven home to me one time when we were in Berkeley and we

872
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:40.580
were at a boat launch and we'd come off fishing and we'd been out fishing for

873
00:51:40.581 --> 00:51:42.680
leopard sharks. Um,

874
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.530
remember all of the life aquatic [inaudible] that's a good movie.

875
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:48.320
Do you like his stuff or know bill Murray love him? I mean,

876
00:51:48.321 --> 00:51:50.060
like the director Anderson was saying, Oh,

877
00:51:50.061 --> 00:51:54.920
what has he done besides that fucking a Royal Tenenbaums. Oh,

878
00:51:54.921 --> 00:51:59.120
okay. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. Yeah. I think his masterpiece was life aquatic.

879
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.270
But uh, in there they got, you know, the,

880
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.480
the famous shark and is the Jaguar shark, which is a good idea for shark.

881
00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:07.360
I don't think it exists, but there are leopard sharks.

882
00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:08.420
We were fishing for leopard sharks.

883
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:12.830
We came back to the boat launch and there's a dumpster there and every cleans or

884
00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:15.110
fish and throws a fish guts and the dumpster.

885
00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:18.470
And I remember there's a gentleman digging through the dumpster

886
00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:23.800
getting out leopard shark fins and, and heads and stuff.

887
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.420
And I took pity on him.

888
00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:30.850
I thought that he was acting out of some sort of desperation and I said,

889
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:35.830
uh, Hey man, do you want like a nice filet?

890
00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:41.240
I'd be happy to give you a filet. And he's like, no, you just want it.

891
00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:46.330
Just the fins just to make soup. Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever had it?

892
00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:51.280
No. I've had it. Charfen zoo. Yeah. Did you enjoy it? It was weird.

893
00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:54.910
It was weird. It was like, it's okay. It's okay.

894
00:52:54.911 --> 00:52:58.750
It's definitely not worth eradicating a fucking entire species for no,

895
00:52:58.751 --> 00:53:03.660
it's a little disgusting. Uh, it's a little disgusting. And I,

896
00:53:03.661 --> 00:53:07.320
you know, I'm always reluctant, like I'm always reluctant to,

897
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:11.920
I'm a little bit reluctant to sort of, uh,

898
00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:18.600
over simplify things around, around harvest and,

899
00:53:18.601 --> 00:53:20.560
and animals and stuff because a,

900
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:26.100
I think people can take it too far, but if you've seen of people cut

901
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.150
<v 2>and fins and dumping the sharks in the water and kicking the sharks off the deck</v>

902
00:53:30.151 --> 00:53:32.070
into the water dark. And I think,

903
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:36.540
but it speaks to something I think that seeing like live Finless sharks going

904
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:40.830
into the water speaks to something about just your level of care.

905
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:45.660
Do you want me like whether you view something as as sacred or not,

906
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:50.690
it's hard to see that the individual engaging in that as viewing it as as sacred

907
00:53:50.761 --> 00:53:51.460
and there is like Aw,

908
00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:55.410
you know there's a lot of stories about even like swordfish captains, uh,

909
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:55.981
you know,

910
00:53:55.981 --> 00:53:59.580
burning blue sharks and stuff and AFA G cause they lose so much of their sword

911
00:53:59.581 --> 00:54:02.520
fish catch the blue sharks. But to see people kicking them off,

912
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:05.190
it speaks to something about animal suffering.

913
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:09.120
It speaks to something about like what does that person's view of the resource?

914
00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.240
Like to what boot, how do they respect it?

915
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:15.150
But it also speaks to like a general thing where you,

916
00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:17.110
you don't like to see things wasted. Yeah.

917
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:21.840
And my minor saying about like one of the things that slowed in U S waters,

918
00:54:21.841 --> 00:54:26.550
one of the things that slowed finning was just used to be able to go out and you

919
00:54:26.551 --> 00:54:29.400
could feel your hold full of just sharp parts.

920
00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:32.530
If you were a a fishing cap, then you could just be like, Oh,

921
00:54:32.531 --> 00:54:35.690
I'm just gonna keep the fins. And eventually they made it. Um,

922
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:38.550
I'm sure someone to correct me if I'm wrong here, I don't think I am.

923
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:43.380
They eventually made it that whatever you have for shark materials in your boat

924
00:54:43.381 --> 00:54:48.210
on a commercial operation, only a certain percentage can be comprised of fins.

925
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.440
And since when you're on a commercial vessel, your hold like your, your,

926
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:56.280
the air where you keep iced fish is finite. It's limited. Um,

927
00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:01.920
it want to be not worth it because let's say only like 30% of your shark parts

928
00:55:02.071 --> 00:55:04.680
could be shark fins and you had to keep the rest.

929
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.130
It wasn't worth it to fill your holed full of like shark meat.

930
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:12.960
And so it's sort of de-incentivize people to go out and fin in us waters. Mm,

931
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.690
that makes sense. I had it a long time ago.

932
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:20.990
I had it back in probably the 90s at a Chinese restaurant in the U S or

933
00:55:21.241 --> 00:55:22.320
overseas? Yes,

934
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.230
<v 5>pretty sure. Pretty sure it was us.</v>

935
00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:26.930
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

936
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:31.070
I don't think I'd ever traveled overseas in the 1990s I barely remember it.

937
00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.020
How old were you when you first went overseas?

938
00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:35.443
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

939
00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.980
<v 2>overseas. Sounded like, yeah, like old sailors. I'm trying to re [inaudible]</v>

940
00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:45.950
I think I was in my thirties so Canada doesn't count as overseas? No.

941
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:51.000
You can walk there no more because of like the Darien, you know, gap in,

942
00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:55.760
in central America. Like when you go to Argentina,

943
00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:56.683
is it overseas?

944
00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:02.150
It can be to video if you come from Florida, right.

945
00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:07.130
It depends on how you go. You can go the tumbler dead nuts over central America.

946
00:56:07.131 --> 00:56:09.390
Did you go overseas? It seems like it's kind of overseas.

947
00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:11.440
That seems like a bad term. But you didn't, you,

948
00:56:11.441 --> 00:56:14.750
you didn't have occasion to travel a lot. No. When you were young. Well,

949
00:56:14.751 --> 00:56:18.770
I traveled a lot from fighting all around the country when I was young and then

950
00:56:18.771 --> 00:56:21.800
I traveled a lot for comedy inside the country, the same thing.

951
00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:23.710
So there was a lot of traveling,

952
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:26.220
<v 1>but like traveling to another country was like, Ugh,</v>

953
00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:31.120
what am I doing going over there for them. Oh really? Yeah. It's just more,

954
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:33.100
more travel. Yeah. You know, that's the,

955
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:37.840
it took me a while to get used to the idea of traveling for a vacation,

956
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:41.890
let go when, you know, the idea of vacations,

957
00:56:41.891 --> 00:56:44.890
like going on vacation somewhere in Europe at like get the fuck outta here.

958
00:56:44.891 --> 00:56:48.820
I'm not traveling for fun. I don't like traveling. I want to sit, sit still.

959
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.310
Yeah. Guy. Whenever I get to vacation I just want to stay put.

960
00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.950
Then I realized that you just swallow it.

961
00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:56.770
Just deal with the flight and the next thing you know you're in this really cool

962
00:56:56.771 --> 00:57:01.510
place. It took a while for me to sort of adjust my, my, my view on that. Yeah.

963
00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:04.480
Well you have a hard time taking leisure. I used to,

964
00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:08.230
I used to have a hard time taking leisure now. Um, I look at it like,

965
00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:09.220
like sleep,

966
00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:12.940
like you need sleep and I think you need leisure and I think particularly for

967
00:57:12.941 --> 00:57:16.360
creative person, for person who writes and comes up with things,

968
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:19.390
you need downtime. I just had a buddy of mine,

969
00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:22.210
we were having this conversation about that where he was saying that, um,

970
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:25.610
he feels like he's just working too much, is doing too much comedy.

971
00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:28.840
He's not taking in enough. Just putting too much out and not taking enough.

972
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:32.920
Yeah, man, that's a pretty good point. Yeah, you have to,

973
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:34.720
it's almost like you have to think of it as a diet.

974
00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:37.450
Like what is your mental diet? You know,

975
00:57:37.451 --> 00:57:39.970
your physical diet is obviously very important if you're an athlete.

976
00:57:39.971 --> 00:57:41.080
But if you're a creative person,

977
00:57:41.081 --> 00:57:43.780
you have to have an awareness of your mental diet.

978
00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:46.660
If you're just taking in sugar all the time, just nonsense,

979
00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:49.230
junk food and bullshit like your,

980
00:57:49.231 --> 00:57:52.510
your brain is filled with uninteresting,

981
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.480
uninspiring thoughts and you know,

982
00:57:55.481 --> 00:57:58.840
the same sort of typical narrative over and over and over again.

983
00:57:59.170 --> 00:58:02.680
Whereas if you can figure out a way to go to Thailand or something like that,

984
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:05.050
you go, Whoa, these people are living a totally different life.

985
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.670
This is a totally different way to live. And it just, she just,

986
00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:11.020
even if it's ever so slightly, it broadens your perspective.

987
00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:16.060
I can only really relax when there's nothing I could possibly be doing.

988
00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:20.370
Hmm. And my kids aren't fighting. I was laying,

989
00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.500
I had to do this insurance policy thing. I've told this story a thousand times,

990
00:58:23.501 --> 00:58:27.340
but I haven't told you I'd do this insurance policy thing. And, and uh,

991
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:29.740
I like lay on my couch, this dude,

992
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:33.290
this dude comes over my house to take my heart rate and do a bunch of, Oh,

993
00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:35.980
no health tests. Anyways,

994
00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:39.220
I'm laying on my couch and he's got this monitor hooked up to me.

995
00:58:39.221 --> 00:58:41.530
He's got to do it for a long time. I can't remember how many minutes,

996
00:58:41.531 --> 00:58:44.080
but it's like a long, it's not like going into the doctor for a checkup or that.

997
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.190
It's like, take your polls from it.

998
00:58:45.191 --> 00:58:49.000
Like he's really like checking your shit out and I can hear my kids now and then

999
00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:54.220
like a little fight flare up upstairs. And I asked the dude,

1000
00:58:54.221 --> 00:58:58.570
I'm like, can you see that? He goes, Oh, I can see that. Me hearing it,

1001
00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:02.590
me hearing that like now. Right, right.

1002
00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:08.680
Yeah. But my, my older brother, Matt, who's, who's a very thoughtful,

1003
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:13.330
um, somewhat acentric person,

1004
00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:15.550
he's now says that he needs,

1005
00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:19.030
he's going to sleep nine hours a night,

1006
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:24.740
which seems like an but he's like done the math on it. And he says,

1007
00:59:24.741 --> 00:59:27.260
if you're going to measure me in terms of productivity,

1008
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.620
I'll actually do more a nine.

1009
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:36.700
Then let's say six and you give me all those extra hours,

1010
00:59:36.951 --> 00:59:39.110
but those extra hours aren't as productive. Anyways,

1011
00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:42.440
I had a podcast with a guy named Dr. Matthew Walker, who's a sleep expert,

1012
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:43.670
written books on sleeping,

1013
00:59:43.671 --> 00:59:48.671
and he talks about the vast amount of Americans that are under rested and,

1014
00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:51.920
and what an impact it has on your hormonal production,

1015
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:55.550
on your body's ability to recover on your happiness and your, your,

1016
00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:59.240
your body's ability to produce endorphins and all these different variables that

1017
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:03.860
are extremely important to happiness and to productivity. And he's like,

1018
01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:08.780
the vast majority of people are fucking themselves over vast majority in great

1019
01:00:08.781 --> 01:00:09.120
ways.

1020
01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.580
It increases the possibility of dementia and Alzheimer's and all these different

1021
01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:16.130
factors. If you go, you look at guys like, uh,

1022
01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:19.370
like Ronald Reagan like famously slept like four hours a night.

1023
01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.020
So we've got a fucking Alzheimer's.

1024
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:25.220
Like it's really common with people that have a very small amount of sleep and

1025
01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:27.500
they take pride in the fact they're always pushing the needle.

1026
01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.580
Those people eventually the, the fucking the bearings start going. Yeah.

1027
01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.250
Yeah. Do you take caution to sleep? I sleep a lot. I get good sleep.

1028
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.470
I'm very lucky. One of the things about,

1029
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:43.600
because I exercise so much is that I'm always tired. Like when,

1030
01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:46.310
when I hit the hay at night and I get home from the comic store,

1031
01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:48.650
I fucking crash. I go down hard,

1032
01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:53.180
I get a good solid eight hour sleep almost every night. That's good.

1033
01:00:53.410 --> 01:00:54.800
When not when I'm in the groove of like,

1034
01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:59.630
like being careful about taking care of myself and, and uh, yeah.

1035
01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.940
Doing like a lot of regular exercise.

1036
01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:05.300
How much your appetite for food and your appetite for sleep,

1037
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.540
your appetite for meat as the big increases. Great. Well,

1038
01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:11.780
my wife started lifting weights and one of the first thing she said, it's like,

1039
01:01:11.781 --> 01:01:15.530
God damn, I want meat like all the time she's doing squats and shit.

1040
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.190
She's got this crazy Russian lady who's our trainer. So the lady,

1041
01:01:19.191 --> 01:01:22.490
the fucking Savage and [inaudible] doing all these crazy squats,

1042
01:01:22.491 --> 01:01:26.330
box jumps and that kind of shit. And she's like that Russian in the Rocky movie,

1043
01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:30.860
but it's just that dude was on like that dude was on to, what's it called,

1044
01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:34.340
where the people go to like the club house and roll rocks and shit. Oh,

1045
01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:39.200
like a CrossFit [inaudible] trainer in Russia.

1046
01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:43.370
Machines in Rocky that I have out there. The versa climber,

1047
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.940
the first that I've found out about versa climbers watching that Rocky movie,

1048
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:50.990
when Drago was on that thing, I was like, man, he looks like he's working hard.

1049
01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.020
That fucking versa climbers. That's a bitch, man.

1050
01:01:54.021 --> 01:01:58.110
You ever do that thing like to do 32nd sprints in this, like

1051
01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:00.720
your legs and your arms,

1052
01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:04.760
you're just peddling and it's like your climate and you can increase the

1053
01:02:04.761 --> 01:02:09.680
resistance. So it's like for grappling, there's nothing like it.

1054
01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:12.540
It's an easy true, everybody hates it though. He,

1055
01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:17.250
most people they'll do gravitate towards the treadmill or elliptical machine or

1056
01:02:17.251 --> 01:02:18.890
other things. They look at that thing like no, no, no, no.

1057
01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:20.010
Yeah cause it's not fun.

1058
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.880
<v 2>You don't get [inaudible]. Yeah, you don't get lost in it. It's horrible.</v>

1059
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.660
It's horrible.

1060
01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.820
But it's amazing when you refer to like how you fill your head up,

1061
01:02:26.821 --> 01:02:29.880
like what you fill your head up if it's just like junk and sugar and how much

1062
01:02:29.881 --> 01:02:31.110
time you have to process stuff.

1063
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.360
One of the things that I've noticed and it's kind of started,

1064
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:38.390
it's begun to start on me a little bit is I used to find in social situations

1065
01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:45.020
that I would be very interested in letting people know what I thought about

1066
01:02:45.511 --> 01:02:49.440
stuff. Even shit I had no business talking about.

1067
01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:56.610
And I think that you see people like when you see like someone who is older and

1068
01:02:56.611 --> 01:02:58.230
we have this idea that like old, the older,

1069
01:02:58.231 --> 01:03:02.520
wiser person and they're just taking in everything and they've learned to be

1070
01:03:02.521 --> 01:03:03.780
quiet. Yeah.

1071
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.480
People don't really think about the fact that maybe they're just like sick of

1072
01:03:06.481 --> 01:03:10.830
hearing themselves talk that to the end of the saddest thing is those an old

1073
01:03:10.831 --> 01:03:15.110
moron, right?

1074
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.220
I want to say, yeah, but I mean, I think I [inaudible]

1075
01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.490
<v 1>you need to explain again,</v>

1076
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:23.990
it's old racist and old dummy old person who has like ridiculous,

1077
01:03:24.401 --> 01:03:29.401
archaic views of women or ridiculous archaic views of society and culture and

1078
01:03:30.011 --> 01:03:30.791
immigration,

1079
01:03:30.791 --> 01:03:34.300
all these different things like a person without nuance and old person who is

1080
01:03:34.301 --> 01:03:38.770
not learned from the humbling experiences of life and whose has not looked at

1081
01:03:38.771 --> 01:03:43.770
himself and his own folly and, and has a humorous take on it. The description.

1082
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:47.710
Yeah. You're painting a flattering portrait. Yeah, man, I think about it a lot.

1083
01:03:47.711 --> 01:03:49.830
I don't want to be that guy. You know, I encountered

1084
01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:53.680
<v 2>a dude like that not long ago where we decided that we're going to take our</v>

1085
01:03:53.681 --> 01:03:54.514
kids,

1086
01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.300
like we're gonna take our kids out to eat and I don't want to have to deal with

1087
01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:03.030
any kind of like added noise. And I was uh, trying to come. I wanted to go on.

1088
01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:05.350
There's like this, like truck sells tacos,

1089
01:04:05.351 --> 01:04:07.060
it's called like LRO day or something like that.

1090
01:04:07.061 --> 01:04:08.260
Let's go to that taco truck and eat,

1091
01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:10.360
cause I'm gonna talk to anybody and deal with anybody.

1092
01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:15.390
My wife convinced me to go to a brew pub so we go to of group home.

1093
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:18.820
I'm kind of like in a minority pissed off because I'm the kind of half mad at my

1094
01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:22.270
wife for making this be in a potentially social situation.

1095
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:23.351
And I'm sitting here in,

1096
01:04:23.351 --> 01:04:26.650
this old man walks past me on his way out of the restaurant and he's got a do

1097
01:04:26.651 --> 01:04:31.360
not resuscitate bracelet. Oooh, okay. He's like, he's got a little walk you,

1098
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.350
it was for pegged Keynes. He's got a four pegged cane,

1099
01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:39.850
it's probably a name for that and a do not resuscitate bracelet.

1100
01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:42.880
And he walks out what his wife, girlfriend, whatever,

1101
01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:47.230
and she wanders off and he's just standing outside the restaurant and it's just

1102
01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:50.260
killing me to know what that's all about.

1103
01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.800
So I grabbed my older boy and we walk out and I'm like,

1104
01:04:55.901 --> 01:04:58.240
you know, I couldn't help but notice that you have a bracelet. Says,

1105
01:04:58.241 --> 01:05:02.620
do not resuscitate a, what's that all about?

1106
01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.640
You know, and I said, do you just feel that if it's your time,

1107
01:05:06.641 --> 01:05:10.570
it's your time and you should and you don't want modern shit to like interfere

1108
01:05:10.571 --> 01:05:14.110
and sort of what you imagined to be like the way things go.

1109
01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:18.040
And he explains to me is like no, I goes, he's like pissed. He's

1110
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.880
<v 0>already pissed. He was probably pissed for, I talk to him, he's like,</v>

1111
01:05:21.881 --> 01:05:26.020
I don't want oxygen, I don't want CPR, I want nothing. And he goes,

1112
01:05:26.021 --> 01:05:31.021
cause I was having a heart attack and they resuscitated me and broke two of my

1113
01:05:31.121 --> 01:05:31.954
ribs,

1114
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:36.520
therefore I don't want to be resuscitated.

1115
01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:40.570
I remember thinking like [inaudible] but you were having a heart attack.

1116
01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:46.210
Like the tradeoff seems minor. Yeah, but just like he was,

1117
01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:50.770
he was so kind of just pissed that they broke his ribs.

1118
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:52.750
Did he couldn't even see.

1119
01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:56.140
I'm like another way of looking at it would be that they saved your life,

1120
01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:04.100
but he said he just wanted to suffer his heart attack with ribs and tact and at

1121
01:06:05.801 --> 01:06:10.000
this point we're just rather die than have broken ribs or something.

1122
01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:10.390
I don't even,

1123
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:13.060
I couldn't even begin and all of a sudden I thought he was interesting all

1124
01:06:13.061 --> 01:06:14.590
sudden. I didn't think he was interesting anymore.

1125
01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:19.150
That's such an unfortunate perspective because if he said like not a great

1126
01:06:19.151 --> 01:06:22.300
story, but you said, I'm saying no, it is a great story because it's like if he,

1127
01:06:22.301 --> 01:06:26.680
if he said, Hey, I had a good time. It's, you know,

1128
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.290
there's only enough room for so many people.

1129
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:31.540
That's what I thought I was going to get a, you know,

1130
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:34.840
that's what I thought I was going to get come forward to meet and Jesus. Yeah.

1131
01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:38.770
I thought I was going to get that. So much so that I brought my boy with me.

1132
01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:40.480
Oh boy. Because when I was a little kid,

1133
01:06:40.481 --> 01:06:44.210
my dad would go out of his way to have weird people over to the house. Yeah.

1134
01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:48.940
It was important to him to expose his kids, the weirdos. So I was like,

1135
01:06:48.941 --> 01:06:49.840
come on son,

1136
01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.920
we're going to talk to this crazy old man with a do not resuscitate bracelet and

1137
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:57.520
you're like, learn something about life. I'm like, no, never mind. Never mind.

1138
01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.513
Forget that guy.

1139
01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.640
I was hilarious to trade off of broken ribs for life and broken ribs takes like

1140
01:07:03.971 --> 01:07:06.210
a couple of months and you're fine. Hey, you want to be like, dude,

1141
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:09.010
you're at a brew pub with your girlfriend and she's going to get the car.

1142
01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.460
You didn't want to continue this fight like this. Not bad, not bad.

1143
01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:15.580
It's not bad. Bad. You just suffer for a little bit.

1144
01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:20.050
One of the things about growing up with martial arts is you're always injured so

1145
01:07:20.051 --> 01:07:22.450
you don't look at injuries the way some people look at injuries.

1146
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:25.060
You look at injuries like, ah, I've got to go get this fixed.

1147
01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.510
You gotta get it fixed. I've had both my knees reconstructed.

1148
01:07:28.511 --> 01:07:30.570
I've had a bunch of, she might have his reconstructed.

1149
01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.390
I've had a bunch of shit fixed. You just get it fixed. It's like, ah,

1150
01:07:34.391 --> 01:07:36.400
I fucking tore this thing. I'm going to go get it fixed.

1151
01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:40.850
I don't view it that way. Uh, John has had meniscus surgery on brutality,

1152
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:45.280
had meniscus surgery on his knee. And what's crazy you'll,

1153
01:07:45.281 --> 01:07:47.350
you'll have something to say about this cause this is kinda in your,

1154
01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:49.270
in your world a little bit. Uh,

1155
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:54.790
I developed a knee ache that I had for months left because of him. No,

1156
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:56.140
I don't know. Well, no, I don't know.

1157
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:58.690
Pregnancy with the game and the time I would've told you, you know,

1158
01:07:58.691 --> 01:08:03.160
after this at the time I would have told you that my knee absolutely hurt and my

1159
01:08:03.161 --> 01:08:07.840
knee hurt. Um, and the pain drifted around and it hurt all the time.

1160
01:08:07.841 --> 01:08:12.640
And I was acutely aware of the pain in my knee and I had it built up.

1161
01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:15.650
And then I had made the mistake of having like a passing conversation with an

1162
01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:16.220
orthopedic

1163
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:19.370
<v 2>surgeon was like, Oh, you know, it was probably this or that. It's,</v>

1164
01:08:19.371 --> 01:08:22.340
you can fix it. But then, then it got worse and worse and worse.

1165
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:27.200
And I finally go down to a doctor to do all the scans and shit.

1166
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:29.750
He's like, you know, you have some arthritis.

1167
01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.470
You could probably solve the problem with some physical therapy.

1168
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:36.770
There's like a band that runs down from your hip and I think that's like flaring

1169
01:08:36.771 --> 01:08:39.860
up and that's why the pain bounces around and dude, it wasn't two later,

1170
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.760
two days later that pain was gone. I said to Yonis, I'm like, man,

1171
01:08:43.761 --> 01:08:48.410
I feel like psychologically frail. I feel that there's a very, I was like,

1172
01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:48.861
I feel it.

1173
01:08:48.861 --> 01:08:53.861
There's a very thin membrane that separates my brain from my body and Yana said,

1174
01:08:55.791 --> 01:09:00.130
there is no membrane that separates your brain from your body. And I don't,

1175
01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.080
I can't rule out now that I'm,

1176
01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:07.340
I can't rule out now that I'm like mentally pretty weak because the minute

1177
01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:10.610
someone told me there's not actually a problem or I need to get a surgery,

1178
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:14.960
I like, I, I like I, I now try to feel the pain, but I can't find it.

1179
01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:21.770
<v 1>It is no corresponding like hiking or anything that has contributed to it where</v>

1180
01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:23.750
you weren't doing it once. It felt better

1181
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:27.390
<v 2>one day, um, in the spring,</v>

1182
01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:29.843
uh,

1183
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:33.630
me and my buddy Pete Munich went out looking for black bears during black bear

1184
01:09:33.631 --> 01:09:35.850
season and this was when I was really like,

1185
01:09:35.851 --> 01:09:39.720
thought I had a knee problem and we went out and we didn't hike a long ways.

1186
01:09:39.721 --> 01:09:41.880
We hike maybe six miles and um,

1187
01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:44.850
and I came back and noticed but it was real mucky.

1188
01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:48.270
You know when you're walking and your feet keeps sticking in the market and then

1189
01:09:48.271 --> 01:09:51.570
your feet build up a layer of Mach on your boot bottom and then it comes off and

1190
01:09:51.571 --> 01:09:54.660
then you're walking cockeyed cause your other boot hasn't shed its boot mud

1191
01:09:54.661 --> 01:09:55.494
layer. Yeah.

1192
01:09:55.860 --> 01:10:00.090
We had one of those walks and after that walk the pain went away for two days.

1193
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:04.800
But yeah man, I don't know.

1194
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:09.210
<v 1>It can be like a deep fear of being old and shit. That's real.</v>

1195
01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.250
My eyesight's going bad. Mine too.

1196
01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:14.190
I see you wearing those little glasses all the time and I saw you a minute ago.

1197
01:10:14.191 --> 01:10:16.680
You didn't have him and you couldn't bear to look at your phone? No,

1198
01:10:16.681 --> 01:10:20.760
I can read that. But you had to, you had to like hold it unusually far away.

1199
01:10:20.761 --> 01:10:25.260
I felt it was I reading like that like that I can read or you read that that's

1200
01:10:25.261 --> 01:10:27.950
not a problem. Know you had a thing. I'm going to be honest with you,

1201
01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:32.490
<v 2>your head up and tilt your eyes down and held it far away. I felt</v>

1202
01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:34.770
<v 1>I do do that.</v>

1203
01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.310
I do do that sometimes but mostly with my phone that's not an issue.

1204
01:10:38.311 --> 01:10:40.420
Like I can read emails and shit. The real,

1205
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:44.730
the real problem is a laptops like the laptop but with small texts or reading

1206
01:10:44.731 --> 01:10:48.510
that like that piece of paper in front of him that's fucked.

1207
01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:49.830
Like if I had to read that,

1208
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:54.050
I mean I could do it but I've got to do this talking monkey and corporate or

1209
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:57.870
there's another podcast called the drunk. Jill was reading my release. Yeah,

1210
01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:02.460
it's a, it's just reality. You know your body starts to deteriorate.

1211
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:03.690
There's nothing you can do about it.

1212
01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.790
[inaudible] use it as like all this like journey of life. Shit, right? Yeah.

1213
01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:11.580
But he's all into like weird Yonis is into strange stuff.

1214
01:11:11.581 --> 01:11:15.690
Like he thinks you can kinda like, you can kind of like, um,

1215
01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.630
not address things manifest. He just believes that

1216
01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:25.300
<v 2>he believes, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I feel that,</v>

1217
01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:30.520
uh, this is a, this is a long debate we have about psychological States.

1218
01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.330
I feel that you can have pessimistic thoughts,

1219
01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:40.940
but as long as you behave like an optimist, you'll, you'll get the same outcome.

1220
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:46.640
Meaning let's say you go hunting and you have feelings that like it's never

1221
01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:50.720
going to work out. We're never going to get one. But you do everything right.

1222
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:56.350
It doesn't matter what's in your head because your actions are such the only

1223
01:11:57.321 --> 01:11:59.630
thing. He doesn't like to entertain the negativity.

1224
01:11:59.631 --> 01:12:03.570
He doesn't like to entertain the negativity cause he feels that. But I'm like,

1225
01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:05.420
well, what does it matter if we still hunt hard?

1226
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:09.110
What does it matter if I feel like it won't work as long as we hunt hard,

1227
01:12:09.111 --> 01:12:11.180
it doesn't matter. And I think that he feels,

1228
01:12:11.181 --> 01:12:14.210
he would argue that that mental state

1229
01:12:15.850 --> 01:12:19.630
affects outcomes. And so he applies this to all the aspects of his life.

1230
01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:22.630
Having a sense of positivity.

1231
01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:27.140
<v 1>I think there's a benefit to having a sense of positivity in the sense that</v>

1232
01:12:27.141 --> 01:12:29.240
you're going to enjoy the experience more.

1233
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:34.340
If you're always walking around pessimistic and then things happen that are good

1234
01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:38.600
and you're like, well look at that. All right, well tomorrow is going to suck.

1235
01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:45.440
That was a fluke. Whereas if you just are appreciating the fact that Hey,

1236
01:12:45.441 --> 01:12:49.550
here I am living in America, you know, I'm healthy, I don't have cancer.

1237
01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.210
Like uh, could be so many things worse that are wrong with me.

1238
01:12:53.211 --> 01:12:55.400
I could have been born with weird birth defects.

1239
01:12:55.401 --> 01:12:59.270
I could have been poured and you know, El Salvador with no feet,

1240
01:12:59.271 --> 01:13:03.620
I could have been, you know, living in some fucking drug ravage community.

1241
01:13:03.621 --> 01:13:07.550
I'm lucky. Just extremely unbelievably lucky.

1242
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:10.640
Like if you had given the opportunity to be Steve Rinell,

1243
01:13:10.641 --> 01:13:14.810
if you were some guy who was living in some terrible third world country with

1244
01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:19.520
you know, awful drug cartel violence all around you, he'd be like,

1245
01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:24.500
what would you, what would you give to be like a regular guy living in Bozeman,

1246
01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:27.800
Montana and a beautiful place and have a healthy,

1247
01:13:27.801 --> 01:13:29.960
happy family and a great way to make a living. You're like,

1248
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:32.930
what am I going to do? What do I have? You're giving me,

1249
01:13:32.931 --> 01:13:36.320
you're giving me patriotic stirrings, which I'm inclined to. I'm inclined to it.

1250
01:13:36.321 --> 01:13:37.970
That's why I got American flag back there.

1251
01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:43.240
<v 2>Yeah. It'd be like, Oh, I can have a TV show. I can start a business.</v>

1252
01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.130
Just have children. I don't think [inaudible] country that go to school,

1253
01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:50.800
they go to the Nike great school. Yes. For free.

1254
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:54.250
Insanely for down the road. Yes, yes.

1255
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:54.691
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1256
01:13:54.691 --> 01:13:58.290
I mean there's not a lot of places like that anymore because people have a find

1257
01:13:58.291 --> 01:14:00.840
those places and fuck them up and overpopulated them,

1258
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:04.020
but there's a few of them left. You just got to deal with extreme weather.

1259
01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.820
The extreme weather is the barrier for pussies. It keeps them out. I think so.

1260
01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.190
Yeah. I was moving to fucking Montana.

1261
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:15.540
<v 0>It's hard. That's why we just tried to buy a Greenland. Yes,</v>

1262
01:14:15.610 --> 01:14:19.180
the shot got shot down. Well, I think I like that idea of that though.

1263
01:14:19.181 --> 01:14:21.970
I like it too. Things hilarious. Do you see his fucking post where he said,

1264
01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:25.210
I promise not to do this and he showed a picture of green room with a giant

1265
01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:29.200
Trump tower. I like that. This morning guys. Funny he might be an asshole.

1266
01:14:29.201 --> 01:14:32.380
People might hate them. They might. It might be a problem as a president, blah,

1267
01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:36.660
blah, blah, blah, blah. You can deny that occasionally. He is fucking hilarious.

1268
01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:40.490
It is funny and I think that people try,

1269
01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.480
there are certain people that try hard to not see the humor in any of this.

1270
01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:48.850
I've retweeted it. I was like, get on with your bad self, Mr. Trump.

1271
01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.340
I look, I don't read my, my Twitter posts.

1272
01:14:51.341 --> 01:14:53.860
I'm sure a bunch of people got mad at me for that, but I don't read it.

1273
01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.470
I just post it and forget it. I just get out of Dodge,

1274
01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:59.170
I just leave a little packages and I get the fuck out of there.

1275
01:14:59.171 --> 01:15:01.730
I don't know what that picture that I found myself, uh,

1276
01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:05.170
zooming in trying to see what those people in those houses they had going on.

1277
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:09.690
I was like, Oh, these guys look like they probably hunt. Well,

1278
01:15:09.691 --> 01:15:13.570
Greenland has so much natural resources and it's also probably a place that's

1279
01:15:13.571 --> 01:15:16.870
going to be an awesome spot to live in a hundred years when the fucking wrestle

1280
01:15:16.871 --> 01:15:19.210
world's on fire. Maybe they'll wind up there, man. Yeah.

1281
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:21.610
Well muskox we were talking about that yesterday.

1282
01:15:21.611 --> 01:15:26.170
Muskox Jamie pulled up a thing, a statistic on mock socks. Muskox that um,

1283
01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.140
the success rate for bow hunting is 100%

1284
01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:36.130
in some units. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. In Greenland. Oh, okay.

1285
01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:39.400
100% in Greenland. Cause you know, they, they huddle, you know,

1286
01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:41.590
they huddle up to protect themselves against wolves.

1287
01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:44.470
So they just stay in a spot when they, they see a threat,

1288
01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:47.780
which is great for walls, but not so good for projectiles. Yeah, no,

1289
01:15:47.781 --> 01:15:50.710
I've haunted them for, yeah, apparently they're delicious.

1290
01:15:50.711 --> 01:15:54.520
Brendan burns said that they taste like the best Kobe beef. Yeah.

1291
01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:58.030
He said it's like really tough but good and marbled. Yeah.

1292
01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:02.140
You know what's funny is the, well I mean tough like, yeah,

1293
01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:07.340
tougher. But what's funny about, um, w w I,

1294
01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:11.620
I drew it permit like in Alaska the way they,

1295
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:14.830
so I'm trying to find another way to approach this.

1296
01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:18.310
Any American speaking of America land of opportunity,

1297
01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:22.210
any American can apply for a permit to hunt for muskox and Alaska. Um,

1298
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:27.160
and what units are available to you if you're not an Alaska resident? Very,

1299
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:30.340
and I believe right now, um,

1300
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:35.730
the only area that you can apply for a permit as a non resident might be new

1301
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:41.620
Novak Island. And I drew a permit to hunt on, to hunt muskox on Nunavik Island.

1302
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:46.530
I saw that episode. Yeah. And hunt in there. The,

1303
01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:51.450
the Tupak ask Mo and a bunch of people would be like, duh, duh,

1304
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:53.110
duh. You can't say ask them. Oh,

1305
01:16:53.111 --> 01:16:57.700
but it was funny cause I asked that you pick man who I was staying with.

1306
01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:00.550
I'm like, you know, I feel like, uh,

1307
01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:04.790
I'm always told not to use ask him.

1308
01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:10.010
And he said, what the hell else would you call me? So I'm going to say,

1309
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:15.260
<v 2>and in deference to what this man prefers to be called these Chupa gusts,</v>

1310
01:17:15.261 --> 01:17:17.960
he explained I'm Chewbacca Eskimo. I'm not something else.

1311
01:17:17.961 --> 01:17:22.670
I think the Canadian folks prefer to as anyone on the high end and the high

1312
01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:27.330
Arctic. Yeah. But then I think it's created a lot of confusion. Yeah. But um,

1313
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:29.270
it was just interesting that on this, on this,

1314
01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:34.400
this Western Alaska coast along the Bering sea,

1315
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:40.030
he a Tupak man was telling me that that was where he prefers to be referred to

1316
01:17:40.071 --> 01:17:44.960
as Tupak Eskimo. But the way that we know, like we, you know,

1317
01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:47.540
people consume wild game or talk about meat rise.

1318
01:17:47.541 --> 01:17:50.000
Like when rating meats,

1319
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:54.680
we tend to talk about tenderness are not tenderness. Right. It was tough.

1320
01:17:54.681 --> 01:17:57.890
It was tender. It was talk, it was tender, tender being good. Tough being bad.

1321
01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:02.870
I mean, you've been involved in a hundred of these conversations. He like a,

1322
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:07.250
this cherubic male. I was like, we prefer it to be tough.

1323
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:13.370
You know that tendon that like if you look at the spine of an animal,

1324
01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:17.930
the the, the, the vertebra above its shoulder, we'll have like a,

1325
01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.780
what's called a thoracic belonger longer thoracic process.

1326
01:18:20.781 --> 01:18:22.280
Like that blade that comes up,

1327
01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:28.570
there's a tendon that runs from the top of those thoracic processes out to the

1328
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:33.050
neck and it allows like big animals. It's really exaggerated on moose,

1329
01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:37.280
bison, mosque ox where it's like the size of your wrist,

1330
01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:42.850
this giant tendon that's more word to the top of those thoracic processes that

1331
01:18:42.921 --> 01:18:44.570
allows this thing like to hang its head,

1332
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:49.940
which I mean the head is 80 pounds or whatever and it hangs off there.

1333
01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:54.800
They like that thing. Whoa real chewy meat.

1334
01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:57.830
And they even would that, they would cook the muskox,

1335
01:18:57.831 --> 01:18:59.480
they would basically like boil them.

1336
01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:04.130
They would take the tough parts of the muskox and almost like purposefully make

1337
01:19:04.131 --> 01:19:06.710
it more tough but kind of like boy,

1338
01:19:06.711 --> 01:19:11.711
like flash boiling it and they would talk about like this cuts good.

1339
01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:16.460
It's tough. Not Ooh, it's so tender. Why did they like that?

1340
01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:20.300
Did they split different varied preferences. Wow. That's weird.

1341
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:22.580
But I liked it quite a bit, man.

1342
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:27.610
What was funny is I gave a bunch of muskox to a Guatemalan woman in Seattle that

1343
01:19:30.351 --> 01:19:35.351
we knew and I gave a bunch of muskox to her and she made me a bunch of tamales.

1344
01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:40.970
So I had Guatemalan style tamales with Moscow, with muskox.

1345
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.070
And we made a deal where I gave her a bunch. I said,

1346
01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:45.620
you can keep half of what I give you,

1347
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:50.120
like make tamales and give me half the tamales. Ah. So he struck a deal.

1348
01:19:50.121 --> 01:19:53.510
I had a freezer full of frickin tamales, like wrapped up. But, uh,

1349
01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:57.020
and I would laugh about that, that, uh, you know,

1350
01:19:57.021 --> 01:20:00.830
my kids would have muskox sandwiches or muskox tamales and they'd go down to

1351
01:20:00.831 --> 01:20:03.890
school with, Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah, it was great.

1352
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:07.980
My kids like freak out other kids at school, you know,

1353
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.800
<v 1>like, uh, like kids at my kid's school be like, Oh, what's your favorite food?</v>

1354
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:16.770
My daughter be like, I like, bear thinks it's hilarious that she's eaten bear,

1355
01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:20.730
you know, she, she likes to tell people bare sausage. It's my favorite.

1356
01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:23.100
And the other kid's like, what the fuck? You know,

1357
01:20:23.101 --> 01:20:27.630
kids that have never experienced any wild game and my kids have eaten, you know,

1358
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:31.770
since 2012 when I started hunting,

1359
01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:36.360
they've basically eaten everything. They've eaten elk, they've eaten deer,

1360
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:41.190
they've eaten ducks, they've eaten wild Turkey, they've eaten everything.

1361
01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.410
What's their, uh,

1362
01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:46.500
how are they viewed in their community?

1363
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:50.700
Like how are you viewed in that? That like school, parent community.

1364
01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:55.050
I don't know. It's hard to tell cause you go to the events. Yes.

1365
01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:59.220
I got to go to one today. Yeah, I'm a weirdo for sure.

1366
01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:04.110
But you ostracized, friendly. No, I'm really friendly. So like most of the,

1367
01:21:04.111 --> 01:21:08.010
it's all hugs, you know, like the parents. Like I'm a nice guy.

1368
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:10.920
So when I see those folks, it's all like friendly and hugs.

1369
01:21:10.921 --> 01:21:14.430
But some guys will pull me aside and ask me about manly activities

1370
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:17.920
cause they feel like, how did you, you're, you're,

1371
01:21:18.140 --> 01:21:21.980
you're actually allowed to be a man and you're, everyone's neutered. You know,

1372
01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:23.040
like, so many guys are,

1373
01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:26.520
their wives are yelling at them and I'm off doing cage fighting events,

1374
01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:29.880
you know. And, and uh, I took a, where were you last week?

1375
01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:33.240
I was bow hunting and I was in the mountains but no cell service.

1376
01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.980
So they might be inclined to be like, Oh,

1377
01:21:34.981 --> 01:21:39.600
I don't like that for like middle America rednecks, but it's okay for you.

1378
01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:41.000
Well they know me, right?

1379
01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:44.970
So they don't the preconceived notion and they know I'm a good dad and they know

1380
01:21:44.971 --> 01:21:49.500
I'm very active and I'm constantly around my kids and I take it very seriously

1381
01:21:49.501 --> 01:21:53.580
and it means the world to me. So like parents, one of the most,

1382
01:21:53.610 --> 01:21:58.610
the most important things that I find is good parents respect good parents.

1383
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:01.950
They see that you love your children. That's an interesting point. Yeah.

1384
01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:06.000
I mean if you find someone who's like a dismissive parent and is not interested

1385
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:06.990
in disinterested parent,

1386
01:22:06.991 --> 01:22:10.620
it's like one of the most disturbing and disappointing things.

1387
01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:11.820
If you love someone,

1388
01:22:11.821 --> 01:22:15.510
you care about them and then you find out they're a bad person or a bad parent,

1389
01:22:15.511 --> 01:22:18.690
you have to reevaluate your perspective on them. Because to me,

1390
01:22:18.691 --> 01:22:23.190
being a parent and my wife is huge on this, it's like it's everything to her.

1391
01:22:23.191 --> 01:22:26.460
She will not talk to someone or hang out with someone as you feel like they're a

1392
01:22:26.461 --> 01:22:27.650
bad parent. And she, she,

1393
01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:32.070
she forms her relationships with her friends based on whether or not they're

1394
01:22:32.071 --> 01:22:35.460
good parents. It's everything. Because if you're, you know,

1395
01:22:35.461 --> 01:22:39.690
you're contributing to this community. So when I'm around these parents,

1396
01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.960
you know, I'm, I'm a nice guy, so it's all, it's all friendly,

1397
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:47.100
but they all have questions. All these poor men that are stuck in cubicle jobs,

1398
01:22:47.690 --> 01:22:52.500
you know, men, men are tortured, you know, it's like that, uh, who was it? Uh,

1399
01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:57.120
the row. Yeah. Most men live lives of quiet desperation. Yeah.

1400
01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:01.900
It's one of my favorite, including through, well,

1401
01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:05.710
he knew what he was talking about. You know, it's, uh, it's

1402
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:10.720
<v 8>these, most people are just living this boring ass fucking life.</v>

1403
01:23:10.721 --> 01:23:14.410
And I'm living this life where I'm telling jokes in front of thousands of people

1404
01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.580
and then I'm doing podcasts in front of millions of people and then I'm hunting.

1405
01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:21.880
And then, uh, and then occasionally I go off and I do cage fighting commentary.

1406
01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:25.960
<v 2>It's like a caricature of masculinity. Really. Yeah. People get confused.</v>

1407
01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:29.170
Well it is and want to smoke pot. So it's like, but that's going on here.

1408
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:33.970
One of the things, one of the early things that surprise me about you is, man,

1409
01:23:33.971 --> 01:23:35.980
I don't want to use that word cause I don't want it to be insulting.

1410
01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.890
One of the things that, uh, yeah,

1411
01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.380
what are the things that surprised you about you?

1412
01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:47.230
But it's something that sounds like asshole ish is how serious you take being a

1413
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:52.390
parent. Because I think that someone could look like someone could,

1414
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.810
someone could add a glance look and be like, Oh, you know, uh,

1415
01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:00.100
discussion of drugs and like dirty humor and sorta go.

1416
01:24:00.101 --> 01:24:04.750
Like those are not congruence with parenting, but you take soup, you paint,

1417
01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:08.520
you take parenting like extremely seriously. Well, but you don't, yeah,

1418
01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:10.120
I don't think you, you, you're not like, you don't,

1419
01:24:10.121 --> 01:24:13.270
you're not so concerned with, uh,

1420
01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:17.560
people understanding the full package that you need to spend shitloads of time

1421
01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.320
telling everybody about how good of a parent you are.

1422
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:25.220
<v 8>Yeah. I'm not interested in that. Um, I'm interested in love, you know,</v>

1423
01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:29.600
and uh, as a kid who grew up with sort of a deficit of it,

1424
01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:34.940
and it's very important for me to spread as much of it as I can,

1425
01:24:34.941 --> 01:24:38.570
whether it's through my friends or through children and to children,

1426
01:24:38.571 --> 01:24:41.450
it's like the most important responsibility because my friends, they're fine.

1427
01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:42.830
I met them, they're grown up,

1428
01:24:42.831 --> 01:24:45.230
still figure it out on their own and I'll help them when I can,

1429
01:24:45.231 --> 01:24:50.150
but [inaudible] but kids, you know, it's like you get one shot at that,

1430
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:53.780
you get one shot at raising kids, man. You know, it's not,

1431
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:57.500
he can't redo it. He can't go out of this one socks.

1432
01:24:57.501 --> 01:24:59.120
Let me rip it up and start from scratch.

1433
01:24:59.121 --> 01:25:02.690
Like you have to do it right and you have to and you're going to make mistakes

1434
01:25:02.691 --> 01:25:03.141
for sure.

1435
01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:08.141
But you have to spend as much conscious time talking to them and interacting

1436
01:25:09.321 --> 01:25:12.980
with them. And really, you know, I like it. I enjoy it.

1437
01:25:13.310 --> 01:25:13.951
<v 2>One of the things that,</v>

1438
01:25:13.951 --> 01:25:18.620
that you get afraid of about damaging your children is that you would leave a

1439
01:25:18.621 --> 01:25:21.410
legacy of damage. Yes, you can have,

1440
01:25:21.411 --> 01:25:24.830
I have all kinds of things that I did in my life in ways that treated people.

1441
01:25:24.831 --> 01:25:27.530
And I could sit here and name names, right. I'm like, things I did,

1442
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:31.240
the people that were very unfortunate, I wish I hadn't done it someday.

1443
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:34.760
Maybe I'll call him and apologize. But if you,

1444
01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.780
when you damage your kid, man,

1445
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.480
<v 8>man, yeah.</v>

1446
01:25:40.710 --> 01:25:44.670
<v 2>You're setting, you're like creating a string of decades.</v>

1447
01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:50.320
<v 8>Yup. Yeah. And maybe describes that they will do the same to their kids.</v>

1448
01:25:51.490 --> 01:25:55.780
And it's also, it sort of reflects how selfless,

1449
01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.570
selfish or selfless you are. You know,

1450
01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:01.840
whether you do a good job or a shitty job, you know, I've know,

1451
01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:03.740
unfortunately I have friends that

1452
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.410
<v 1>are not that good at it. And you know, comics in particular,</v>

1453
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:11.990
there was a, I don't want to say any names,

1454
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:16.790
but there was a guy who was friends with the son of a famous comedian.

1455
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:18.790
Let me track that for a minute. Uh,

1456
01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.570
a guy who I know who grew up with the son of a very [inaudible] guy.

1457
01:26:22.890 --> 01:26:25.850
So now they get confused and people talk about like my cousins brothers, uncle.

1458
01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:26.693
Yeah. I know I'm with him.

1459
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:30.890
And he was telling me that his dad was a piece of shit and he, he hated him.

1460
01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:34.520
And I'm like, God damn you dad's one of my heroes. Yeah.

1461
01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:38.840
When you talk to the actual son of the man, and he's like, yeah,

1462
01:26:38.841 --> 01:26:43.370
my dad's a piece of shit. And I'm like, fuck, I gotta know what to do with that.

1463
01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.250
You know, like, what do I say to, I mean, his art is amazing,

1464
01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:48.080
is his what he did to the world. I mean,

1465
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:51.290
but what he didn't do was take care of his own backyard.

1466
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:53.240
What he didn't do is take care of his own children.

1467
01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:56.850
<v 2>I find that that creates some difficult because there's some writers,</v>

1468
01:26:58.470 --> 01:27:00.520
not some immune, so many of them writers,

1469
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:03.770
<v 1>musicians, um,</v>

1470
01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:08.510
actors who have, uh,

1471
01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:12.230
blessed the world with what they've put out. [inaudible]

1472
01:27:12.570 --> 01:27:16.020
<v 2>but then you look at the destruction they sewed in their immediate vicinity.</v>

1473
01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.970
Yeah. And you want to be like, well,

1474
01:27:17.971 --> 01:27:22.320
do you condemn it or are you just thankful that or is that like collateral

1475
01:27:22.321 --> 01:27:25.230
damage? Unavoidable collateral,

1476
01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:27.600
collateral damage in order to have the things that,

1477
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:31.980
<v 1>to have the things that we appreciate. Yeah. Well there's also,</v>

1478
01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.360
you kind of follow what I'm saying 100%, well Hendricks, you know what mean?

1479
01:27:35.361 --> 01:27:36.150
This pod,

1480
01:27:36.150 --> 01:27:38.990
this podcast is called the G the Joe Rogan experience cause I stole it from

1481
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:41.560
Hendrix. Oh really? Yeah, it was funny.

1482
01:27:41.561 --> 01:27:43.850
I was thinking about that earlier when I was sitting in your, your uh,

1483
01:27:44.210 --> 01:27:45.560
in the back room there and you had that,

1484
01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.290
I was just looking at the experience one and about where that came from.

1485
01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:53.030
Jimi Hendrix experience. Yeah. It's all 100% stolen from Hendrix. Um,

1486
01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.240
and then I read that he beat his girlfriends and really? Yeah, I was like,

1487
01:27:56.241 --> 01:27:58.160
what is that real like,

1488
01:27:58.161 --> 01:28:02.090
I don't want to think Hendrix even got mad on it.

1489
01:28:02.130 --> 01:28:05.930
Think he's that dude who put the bandana on and just played voodoo child.

1490
01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:10.970
You know, when, uh, I worked with Phil Hartman when Phil Hartman was a kid.

1491
01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:15.980
He was like 17 or 18 Hendrix played at the whiskey and uh,

1492
01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.470
he was there, uh, as like a roadie.

1493
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:23.660
And his job was to keep the amp, uh, the speakers from falling over, you know,

1494
01:28:23.690 --> 01:28:28.690
so he stood there on the stage and Hendrix was right there playing guitar in

1495
01:28:29.061 --> 01:28:33.380
front of him. And the, the way he described it was like, his eyes were a light.

1496
01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:35.960
He was like, describe like, he's almost like he right there,

1497
01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:40.010
he was right there and he's playing, you know, this has been,

1498
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:45.140
I grew up but just a giant Hendrix fan, like a giant fan led Zeppelin,

1499
01:28:45.141 --> 01:28:48.710
Hendrix, the doors like saw classic rock when I was a kid, you know,

1500
01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:52.190
suburban Boston neighborhood type shit.

1501
01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:57.050
You draw van Halen on your fucking notebook, that kind of AC DC logos,

1502
01:28:57.410 --> 01:29:01.950
you know, it's like that's, that's how I grew up. You know.

1503
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:04.500
So I was trying to figure out a name for this podcast. I was like, man,

1504
01:29:04.501 --> 01:29:08.520
who the fuck is affected me more in terms of motivation than Hendrix?

1505
01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:11.640
Cause I listened to his music when I worked out and listened to his music.

1506
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.530
Oh that's great. Driving to gigs, you know.

1507
01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:17.280
And plus he just seemed like so different, you know,

1508
01:29:17.281 --> 01:29:21.360
just such a crazy anomaly in pop culture.

1509
01:29:21.361 --> 01:29:25.350
This African American dude is like the greatest guitarist of all time.

1510
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:29.200
Like you've all these rock guys. And one of the things that Eric Clapton,

1511
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:31.980
it said like he thought he knew how to play guitar. Then he saw Jimmy Hendrix.

1512
01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:35.190
He was like, what the fuck? I realize he did Wayne like what am I doing?

1513
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:40.710
Cause he was just so out there. He was so out there. It was so different.

1514
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:45.510
You know, just a freak. Just an anomaly. It's like hung around me. Warren

1515
01:29:47.150 --> 01:29:50.100
[inaudible] I'm glad you guys got him doing a punk.

1516
01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:54.050
<v 0>Good. That's great. I love it. Yeah. The head. Yeah. Hendrix.</v>

1517
01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:56.540
I always point out to people that how I grew up, uh,

1518
01:29:57.230 --> 01:30:01.820
my dad discovered that I have his left eye, Donovan dominant and uh,

1519
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:04.910
all the hand me downs, shit, guns arise right handed.

1520
01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:07.700
But I had to relearn how to shoot everything left-handed.

1521
01:30:07.701 --> 01:30:09.560
So now I talk about how I was like Hendrix,

1522
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:11.780
where I had to shoot left-hander with right-handed gun.

1523
01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:16.950
<v 1>Well, I shot my first deer with your gun. So left-handed gun,</v>

1524
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:21.210
your rifle. I had a cockpit on the wrong side. I remember.

1525
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:26.930
<v 0>No. Yeah, I shot your rifle though. It's out there, man. The deer's here.</v>

1526
01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:32.750
Yeah. Yeah. Where did it lost its position of a prominence to this?

1527
01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:36.770
This is not the helmet table. Yeah. To Nazi helmet, right?

1528
01:30:39.230 --> 01:30:41.900
Yeah. It used to be right there. Hey, did you, did you see a,

1529
01:30:41.901 --> 01:30:43.940
I don't want to change so deep, but I do want a,

1530
01:30:44.150 --> 01:30:48.500
did you see the video I sent you? Which one of the shark tag and the dude?

1531
01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.290
The Instagram video. Yeah. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. Which one?

1532
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:55.910
Let me shoot me. I've seen, that's one of the things that is just so crazy.

1533
01:30:55.911 --> 01:30:58.620
I get so many of those goddamn things sent to me. No,

1534
01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.480
I thought you'd appreciate it. I'm sure of a guy getting a,

1535
01:31:02.481 --> 01:31:05.270
I don't know what kind of shark it is. Yeah. I'll send it to Jamie.

1536
01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:08.630
What kind of shark is it? You know, I think it's a bull shark. Maybe.

1537
01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:09.464
I'm not sure.

1538
01:31:10.570 --> 01:31:15.250
<v 1>Oh yeah, here it is. I was almost dinner. He says, yeah, here share two. Oh,</v>

1539
01:31:15.251 --> 01:31:18.970
that was, yeah, dude, it's fucking terrible.

1540
01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:22.960
It's terrible. I'm terrified of sharks.

1541
01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:27.940
<v 0>Do you think it's, yeah. Uh, [inaudible] I thought you'd appreciate it.</v>

1542
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.300
Yeah. Cause the, where would the, the, the, the, the um,

1543
01:31:31.690 --> 01:31:36.370
mental presence of that guy. Yeah. He kept together. Yeah. Just to like,

1544
01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:39.610
he's getting attacked by a shark and puts, not only thinks that,

1545
01:31:39.611 --> 01:31:42.640
put his spirit on in its mouth here, this right here pulled the trigger.

1546
01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:46.133
<v 5>Boom.</v>

1547
01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:51.430
<v 1>Suck it bitch. Yeah. I mean, look, that thing was coming in hot.</v>

1548
01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.201
That's amazing.

1549
01:31:53.201 --> 01:31:56.500
And that's some sharp thinking and he's attached to this fucking shark now,

1550
01:31:56.501 --> 01:31:59.740
right? Yeah, but he's stones it. Yeah. Oh, it's dead.

1551
01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.520
<v 0>That's hilarious. [inaudible] yeah. Fuck sharks.</v>

1552
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:06.970
I wish there was more of them so you could say fuck sharks and not worry about

1553
01:32:06.971 --> 01:32:11.020
it. Yeah. Now he can't. Um, it's funny, man.

1554
01:32:11.021 --> 01:32:14.860
Like you were talking about sharks, you hear about guys, uh, the fish,

1555
01:32:14.861 --> 01:32:16.450
the Gulf coast and Florida and shit,

1556
01:32:16.451 --> 01:32:21.451
and you gotta be very careful cause a pulling the shark up on the beach,

1557
01:32:21.791 --> 01:32:23.530
people will get pissed. Oh yeah.

1558
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:27.010
And they'll get pissed that you're fishing sharks because it lowers sharks in.

1559
01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:28.840
Oh, so it's a double whammy. Yeah.

1560
01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:31.690
Sharks have kind of entered like they've almost gotten like, um,

1561
01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:34.860
<v 1>they've climbed.</v>

1562
01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:36.310
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1563
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:40.600
<v 0>They've sort of moved in how we view wildlife.</v>

1564
01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:44.740
They made the jump. They're up there with elephants. Yes. Yes.

1565
01:32:45.670 --> 01:32:49.090
They like almost, it's great news for a species, man.

1566
01:32:49.091 --> 01:32:54.091
If I was a different species and I was trying to like make my plan,

1567
01:32:54.730 --> 01:32:56.980
my three year plan, I'd be like,

1568
01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:01.360
I want to elevate my species up to,

1569
01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:05.830
I want to look at like what the shark's done and get there. Cause that shit,

1570
01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.140
that's where safety lies. Right?

1571
01:33:07.141 --> 01:33:09.640
Like if you were in their trainer and you wanted to get to,

1572
01:33:09.641 --> 01:33:13.090
I want to get to where Kanye is. Like if you were an animal,

I want to get there with this sharks. Like if I was a possum, yeah.

1574
01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:19.240
Of all the possum I'd get with other possums that I'd be like,

1575
01:33:20.170 --> 01:33:24.430
what does it take to get to, um, what elephant Joyce,

1576
01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:26.260
I was discussing with my kids right now.

1577
01:33:26.261 --> 01:33:30.580
People are th th th people don't consider possums. No,

1578
01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:33.130
they're like hitting with the car. No one cares. He's like, Oh,

1579
01:33:33.131 --> 01:33:34.780
it's just a greener, just keep moving. Yeah.

1580
01:33:35.290 --> 01:33:39.450
<v 1>Uh, I was talking to my kids last night about racism in the insect world that,</v>

1581
01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:43.950
uh, we were, we're hanging out outside and uh, my youngest daughter goes,

1582
01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:45.571
Oh,

1583
01:33:45.571 --> 01:33:50.460
it's a cricket and turns her back on this thing like,

1584
01:33:50.461 --> 01:33:54.960
has no concern at all. She goes from being, Oh, it's cricket.

1585
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:59.430
I mean, and just turns her back. Same size. Like, you know,

1586
01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:04.050
saying prospect of danger. There's none just wandering around.

1587
01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:07.680
She thought it was a Roach and she was terrified. And then it was a cricket.

1588
01:34:07.710 --> 01:34:11.640
I find crickets in my house all the time. I capture them and I let them go.

1589
01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:15.720
Yeah. I'll bring them outside and let them go. So we do this, um, w you know,

1590
01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:20.550
this cricket is hanging out behind my daughter and then my dog comes over and

1591
01:34:20.551 --> 01:34:23.970
just fucking scoops it up and eats it and be like, Hey man,

1592
01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:28.860
why the fuck you eat in a cricket? And he's like laughing, smiling.

1593
01:34:28.861 --> 01:34:33.120
He thinks it's hilarious. It's like, fuck man, he's eight a cricket.

1594
01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:37.510
<v 0>Yeah. We, uh, the, the racism, the species or whatever is, uh,</v>

1595
01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:41.930
you know, we used to have a rat infestation. This Jamie,

1596
01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:45.890
what do you got here is a dog and eat that bird? Yeah. Oh wow.

1597
01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:47.700
<v 5>Nope.</v>

1598
01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:52.590
<v 0>Oh man. That bird was like halo.</v>

1599
01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:56.130
Frightened. Jamie's one of the better internet, uh, thing finders.

1600
01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.190
He's the best. He's got a gold

1601
01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:01.670
<v 1>medal. You call that. It's like stuff. Fine. Internet finding.</v>

1602
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:04.610
Have you seen that cat? Yeah, I've seen that cat. Somebody sent me that.

1603
01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:06.890
That's up muscular. He's rippled that cat.

1604
01:35:06.891 --> 01:35:10.290
Looks like he's been running mountains. He's been taken down some Alex.

1605
01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:16.430
Yeah. He's ripped. You don't like, um, you had a, was he your podcast? I mean,

1606
01:35:16.431 --> 01:35:21.230
I know you had, um, uh, elk one Oh one. What is his name?

1607
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:25.590
No, Cory Jacobson. Nope. Jason Phelps. Oh, that's right. That's right.

1608
01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:30.200
All right. Different guy. Phelps game calls. Right. I love that guy, dude. Yeah.

1609
01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:34.830
Great podcast too. He's a, he's a good guy for Tony. We had Corey Jacobson on,

1610
01:35:34.890 --> 01:35:38.160
<v 2>no, no sir. Never met him. I'd like to have met him. I'd like to, to, uh,</v>

1611
01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:42.750
Phelps. Uh, yeah,

1612
01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:47.820
like one just as an isolated specimen. Okay. Like,

1613
01:35:47.970 --> 01:35:49.260
like no context.

1614
01:35:49.261 --> 01:35:53.580
Nothing if he's like met them because whatever you like want to try and to park

1615
01:35:53.670 --> 01:35:56.310
at the airport and you're trying to find a spot and he's pulling out like,

1616
01:35:56.311 --> 01:35:58.860
Hey are you pulling out? Like you'd like them in that context.

1617
01:35:58.861 --> 01:36:00.000
He would just seem like a good dude.

1618
01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:05.780
But kind of as business it's kind of when I see him and his company like is the

1619
01:36:08.701 --> 01:36:10.530
thing that always pops in my head was a,

1620
01:36:11.970 --> 01:36:14.820
there's this term like [inaudible] like American elbow grease.

1621
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:19.820
<v 1>Yeah. I mean I do what's, tell people what he does. He makes elk calls.</v>

1622
01:36:19.890 --> 01:36:20.041
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1623
01:36:20.041 --> 01:36:23.910
He makes a wide variety game calls but he's acting like he's like very much

1624
01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:28.590
specialized in elk calls. Bits like grouping a logging family. Um,

1625
01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:29.831
you know, in,

1626
01:36:29.831 --> 01:36:34.831
in like a logging area in that industry at this particular time is a little bit

1627
01:36:35.491 --> 01:36:37.170
in the autumn of its,

1628
01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:39.720
of its life expectancy in the area where he grew up at as kind of his

1629
01:36:39.721 --> 01:36:40.554
background.

1630
01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:44.340
And this dude like interested in something good at something may retire early.

1631
01:36:44.341 --> 01:36:48.740
Like being an American, you know, the benefits of being an American. Yeah. Um,

1632
01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:50.940
not that we have a monopoly on,

1633
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.040
but we have a lot of it just like great benefits.

1634
01:36:53.041 --> 01:36:58.041
And this dude just like starts making game calls and like what does mom and his

1635
01:36:58.171 --> 01:37:01.440
wife like builds a business man and is a good dude.

1636
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:04.630
<v 1>He, you know, is, it's called blowing a game call, right.</v>

1637
01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:08.640
So he sends me his tee shirt, it says I blow Phelps and uh,

1638
01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:12.100
my wife was like throw it out. And I was like, no.

1639
01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:18.220
She goes, you're never gonna wear it. I'm like, it doesn't matter.

1640
01:37:18.630 --> 01:37:21.370
It stays cause he's the nicest guy. You know,

1641
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:24.830
when you're already sitting like someone's a nice as like, yeah, like,

1642
01:37:24.930 --> 01:37:28.120
Oh he's the nicest guy. Like I don't know, I value that.

1643
01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:31.090
That means everything to me. Such a good dude.

1644
01:37:31.150 --> 01:37:34.420
I lose a lot of respect for people when they're really good at what they do,

1645
01:37:34.421 --> 01:37:36.550
but they're not nice. It's like I get it.

1646
01:37:36.610 --> 01:37:41.020
You had to figure out how to be good at what you did and what was sacrificed.

1647
01:37:41.110 --> 01:37:46.030
His community. If you sacrifice friendliness, this not necessary,

1648
01:37:46.810 --> 01:37:51.100
it's not necessary. It's a weakness. I really believe that, you know, and um,

1649
01:37:51.490 --> 01:37:54.110
it's a, it's common. It's common weaknesses like that.

1650
01:37:54.130 --> 01:37:56.250
Thinking of yourself before. The problem

1651
01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:58.890
<v 8>is it's goal oriented, right? You're all,</v>

1652
01:37:58.891 --> 01:38:02.370
you're worried about achieving success or achieving a certain position or a

1653
01:38:02.371 --> 01:38:05.090
goal. But the problem is when you get to that goal, you're going to be fucking,

1654
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:06.570
you gotta be depressed.

1655
01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:10.920
You're going to be sad because you don't have any friends go on your way to the

1656
01:38:10.921 --> 01:38:15.780
top. You know, it's like you can't, can't, you have to see the trees.

1657
01:38:16.170 --> 01:38:18.180
You got to see everything. You got to see the whole forest.

1658
01:38:18.630 --> 01:38:21.990
You can't just keep your eye on the prize because you fuck over people and push

1659
01:38:21.991 --> 01:38:23.850
them aside along the way. And eventually you're gonna get,

1660
01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:27.120
but you have to fuck over some people. And I don't mean fuck them over,

1661
01:38:27.121 --> 01:38:30.300
but tell him to fuck off. Like there's some people that will get in your way.

1662
01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:33.990
People that are selfish that will trip you up,

1663
01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:36.660
cause you'll wind up being completely absorbed in their own problems.

1664
01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:38.700
And you're like, Hey, you're not dealing with your own problems.

1665
01:38:38.701 --> 01:38:41.490
You've made me the curator of your problems.

1666
01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.550
Sometimes you have to like know when to cut people loose,

1667
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.640
but you also have to like, I know now I know that you're big on this too.

1668
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.350
You're, you're big on tribe.

1669
01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:53.010
Like you have like those guys that you travel with or you do shows with.

1670
01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.850
This is like a tribe of you. Like you have a community and it's very important.

1671
01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:00.120
I respect that. I think that's very, that's huge.

1672
01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:03.110
<v 2>That's it. But it's the thing I've learned from, uh,</v>

1673
01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:06.890
my interactions with you and other thing I've seen is, uh,

1674
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:12.260
you don't, you don't pray, turn it around and you don't talk about too much.

1675
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:15.110
But you do talk about that. There are some things where you just,

1676
01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:20.620
you put up some firewalls in your life and the people that you're around,

1677
01:39:21.050 --> 01:39:25.100
and I have heard you refer to at times that that something got to,

1678
01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:28.310
someone was maybe like too damaging

1679
01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:34.020
in referring to people that it wasn't even like you were condemning them or

1680
01:39:34.021 --> 01:39:34.980
thought they were bad,

1681
01:39:34.981 --> 01:39:38.070
but you just referred to like times when you've had to like just sort of protect

1682
01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:43.170
what you had and what you care about and just make some things not part of your

1683
01:39:43.171 --> 01:39:43.770
life anymore.

1684
01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:47.100
<v 8>Yeah. You have to do that. Sometimes you have to,</v>

1685
01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.800
you have to realize that there's some people that are not looking out for

1686
01:39:49.801 --> 01:39:50.280
themselves.

1687
01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:53.780
<v 2>Some people don't make that jump well and they keep that around. Yeah.</v>

1688
01:39:53.850 --> 01:39:54.561
They keep that,

1689
01:39:54.561 --> 01:39:58.880
that influence around because they cause of maybe like misplaced loyalties. Yes.

1690
01:39:58.930 --> 01:40:01.170
I've noticed you bring that up a handful of times where you're like,

1691
01:40:01.171 --> 01:40:04.160
something just got to be where you had to like build. You just,

1692
01:40:04.170 --> 01:40:07.580
you had to be like, you, I love you, respect you, whatever. But I just can't,

1693
01:40:07.620 --> 01:40:09.900
I gotta protect these other things. Well,

1694
01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:14.100
<v 8>some people get completely self absorbed and they burn everything around them</v>

1695
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:15.780
cause they're only thinking about themselves.

1696
01:40:15.781 --> 01:40:19.140
And even if you love them and care them or appreciate what they're doing.

1697
01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:23.070
Like some people are amazing at certain things. Like, you know,

1698
01:40:23.071 --> 01:40:25.620
we were talking about Hendrix, I mean if Hendrix did beat his wife,

1699
01:40:25.621 --> 01:40:27.620
I don't know if that's true or Pete, his girlfriends. Yeah.

1700
01:40:28.050 --> 01:40:33.050
But it's like some people are so good at what they do that like that's all

1701
01:40:33.061 --> 01:40:34.020
they're thinking about.

1702
01:40:34.021 --> 01:40:38.700
And they didn't develop these interpersonal skills or relationship skills or you

1703
01:40:38.701 --> 01:40:41.640
know, uh, whatever, you know,

1704
01:40:41.641 --> 01:40:46.500
they didn't develop a sense of nuance in terms of their perspective of the world

1705
01:40:46.501 --> 01:40:48.870
or a sense of, uh,

1706
01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:52.860
introspective thinking when they're looking at themselves and being objective

1707
01:40:52.861 --> 01:40:55.990
about they interface with the people around them and in life,

1708
01:40:56.710 --> 01:40:59.470
those people that are just like wholly focused on the self,

1709
01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:03.610
especially pure narcissist, which you run into a lot of them in show business.

1710
01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:06.070
And some of them, it's not their fault. You know,

1711
01:41:06.071 --> 01:41:09.010
you talk to them and if you believe in determinism, you know,

1712
01:41:09.011 --> 01:41:11.620
and you believe that they're a product of all the things that have happened to

1713
01:41:11.621 --> 01:41:14.890
them and then you run down the list of all the things that have happened to

1714
01:41:14.891 --> 01:41:17.620
them. It's fucking bone chilling. I mean, so many people that I know,

1715
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:22.000
particularly in show business are there because of just a giant hole that they

1716
01:41:22.001 --> 01:41:26.380
developed in their self esteem. And there's the who they are as a child.

1717
01:41:26.410 --> 01:41:27.550
They didn't get enough love.

1718
01:41:27.551 --> 01:41:32.551
They got too much abuse and hate and bullying and all these varying factors that

1719
01:41:32.650 --> 01:41:36.790
made them push so hard to achieve success, to let everybody know, Hey,

1720
01:41:36.791 --> 01:41:40.840
I am special. Hey, I am something you were all wrong. And then the,

1721
01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:45.910
but along the way they, they burn everything around them. Yeah. And I don't,

1722
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:50.590
I don't, you know, I don't want to, it's,

1723
01:41:50.650 --> 01:41:54.430
it's possible to get there without that. That's what I want to say. It's like,

1724
01:41:54.431 --> 01:41:56.710
it's possible to get there without being a piece of shit.

1725
01:41:57.190 --> 01:41:59.710
And some people think you have to be a piece of shit to be successful.

1726
01:41:59.711 --> 01:42:01.390
You don't, you don't have to.

1727
01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:05.070
<v 2>Or I think some people get to where, remember earlier I mentioned, uh,</v>

1728
01:42:05.180 --> 01:42:06.530
like the collateral damage.

1729
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:10.850
I saw people have S you could develop such an inflated sense of what you're

1730
01:42:10.851 --> 01:42:12.860
bringing to the world that you ex,

1731
01:42:12.861 --> 01:42:16.940
you personally come to accept the idea that there is a price to pay. Yeah.

1732
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.230
That price being other people.

1733
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:21.630
<v 8>Yeah, yeah. That's a problem. But then again,</v>

1734
01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:26.280
if you don't have certain standards than other people will chew up all your time

1735
01:42:26.850 --> 01:42:29.970
and their problems become your problems and then aren't even thinking about

1736
01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:33.420
their problems. They're thinking about you thinking about their problems.

1737
01:42:33.450 --> 01:42:37.050
I mean there's many people that pawn off their problems and other folks and they

1738
01:42:37.051 --> 01:42:39.000
think that if you're a good friend, you're helping me.

1739
01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:41.430
Like you're not a good friend. You're not taking care of me.

1740
01:42:41.431 --> 01:42:43.750
You're not helping me. Like you're already helping yourself. Yeah.

1741
01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:45.450
The fuck are you doing for yourself.

1742
01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:48.390
Like this is a trap that a lot of people get stuck into.

1743
01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:50.970
It's codependency and it happens in a lot of relationships.

1744
01:42:50.971 --> 01:42:52.680
There's a lot of people that get involved in relationships.

1745
01:42:52.681 --> 01:42:57.120
Boy and girl that they find that the person who is their,

1746
01:42:57.150 --> 01:43:01.200
their soulmate is also the source of all their fucking problems.

1747
01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:04.250
And they're the curator of this person's life. They're there.

1748
01:43:04.251 --> 01:43:07.380
They're supposed to be like helping this person along because this person is

1749
01:43:07.381 --> 01:43:09.930
like deemed them the person who is most important to them.

1750
01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:15.370
And it's like you gotta you gotta find, you gotta find out what you know. Oh,

1751
01:43:15.371 --> 01:43:18.930
what is the, what's the boundary where you won't cross,

1752
01:43:18.931 --> 01:43:22.650
where you realize like someone is becoming an impediment to your own happiness

1753
01:43:22.651 --> 01:43:23.484
and success.

1754
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:28.400
<v 2>It's amazing the degree to which people deep down do care about,</v>

1755
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.020
um, what someone is quote like,

1756
01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:38.750
you know where I find that because I've been on your show a number of times.

1757
01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:44.990
Um, people are curious about you and people will often ask me, well, you know,

1758
01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:48.170
what's Rogan really like? But they know,

1759
01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:50.330
they know that they know what answer they want to hear.

1760
01:43:50.331 --> 01:43:54.140
Bad people would love a story. Okay.

1761
01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.090
You think of something like Oprah Winfrey.

1762
01:43:56.870 --> 01:44:01.130
I've found that people love a story about how bad,

1763
01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:05.270
like people are going to eat up a story that she's awful.

1764
01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:07.750
<v 1>Yeah. The like, damn. For sure.</v>

1765
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:10.180
<v 2>Like people want a story about somebody who bad,</v>

1766
01:44:10.181 --> 01:44:14.980
but what's funny about what you've done, how you've done it is that,

1767
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:18.670
and this happens quite often where people are like, they're like,

1768
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:20.110
he's a good guy, right?

1769
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:25.060
But they want to know that they feel like you are and they want to have a

1770
01:44:25.061 --> 01:44:26.800
confirmed. Not that they're like, Ooh, yeah.

1771
01:44:26.801 --> 01:44:30.850
Tell me the story about him being bad like they would with a lot of people.

1772
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:34.240
If someone has a really bad story about Oprah, I'm like, Oh, I'm all ears.

1773
01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:39.490
<v 1>Wow. Course. Wow. Wow. Well I think first of all,</v>

1774
01:44:39.670 --> 01:44:43.360
cause Oprah's enormously successful. Like in some sort of preposterous way.

1775
01:44:43.890 --> 01:44:47.410
She's worth $1 billion. We're just talking. She can't sing, she can't dance.

1776
01:44:47.770 --> 01:44:50.530
She's not in good shape. Like what is she doing? She's just talking,

1777
01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:54.420
she's got $1 billion. Fuck her. I hope she, I hope she's a meanie.

1778
01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:57.670
I hope she's doing terrible. This is the thing about that.

1779
01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:59.020
It's like you want to find out,

1780
01:44:59.050 --> 01:45:02.500
Oh she got that way cause she's fucking people over. Yeah,

1781
01:45:02.501 --> 01:45:05.800
I heard she beats her assistant, her cheat, you know, you know what I mean?

1782
01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:10.510
She lit her sister's house on fire. Makes sense of the world in some ways.

1783
01:45:10.511 --> 01:45:14.350
Like you want to think that someone who's achieved that ridiculous level of

1784
01:45:14.351 --> 01:45:18.130
success is mean. I've got passed by Oprah. Oprah has a house in Montecito.

1785
01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:21.700
I pass by the house. Like that is your ridiculous house for a person.

1786
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.980
It's like a giant lawn, $50 million house, a fucking huge estate. It's a castle.

1787
01:45:27.010 --> 01:45:30.250
She's a queen. You know, you don't want that. Like fuck her.

1788
01:45:30.730 --> 01:45:33.880
You know my house is 250 grand. Why isn't,

1789
01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:36.310
what the fuck is she doing with that 50 million?

1790
01:45:36.311 --> 01:45:39.430
That's not even a house she lives in. She just visits that like once a year.

1791
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.940
Takes your shit there. Has someone cook for takes a nap.

1792
01:45:42.970 --> 01:45:47.200
Gets up and stirs and animosity makers and animosity. Yeah. Well,

1793
01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:48.753
you know,

1794
01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:53.940
preposterous success breeds animosity and that lady's got a lot of preposterous

1795
01:45:54.041 --> 01:45:56.950
success. You know there's certain people you meet them,

1796
01:45:56.951 --> 01:46:01.300
you want them to say like dr Phil, like a similar thing.

1797
01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:05.830
I would be receptive to a bad dr Phil story. I'm sorry. He's great.

1798
01:46:06.490 --> 01:46:09.610
Dr Phil is fucking great. My friend Jay is dr Phil's son.

1799
01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:14.410
I became friends with dr Phil through another guy through another guy because my

1800
01:46:14.411 --> 01:46:17.710
friend Ron white, my friend Ron white is a good buddy of mine,

1801
01:46:17.711 --> 01:46:22.480
is one of the best comedians on earth is good friends with J J McGraw,

1802
01:46:22.630 --> 01:46:24.490
who's dr Phil's son.

1803
01:46:24.850 --> 01:46:29.080
So I became friends with Jay before I became friends with dr Phil and then I had

1804
01:46:29.081 --> 01:46:32.680
dr Phil on the podcast. Dr Phil's the fucking nicest guy ever.

1805
01:46:32.890 --> 01:46:35.620
He's a regular guy, like you hang out and talk to him.

1806
01:46:35.621 --> 01:46:38.680
He's got a ridiculous amount of success, but he's hilarious.

1807
01:46:38.890 --> 01:46:40.150
He's like a regular dude.

1808
01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:43.490
<v 2>Yeah. Before we started, we talked about how we're both pro marriage. Yes,</v>

1809
01:46:43.491 --> 01:46:47.990
we root for marriages, right? But with kids. Yeah, but married. Yeah.

1810
01:46:47.991 --> 01:46:50.010
When there's no kids involved, I

1811
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.860
<v 0>still root for them. Yeah. You know, I root for marriages,</v>

1812
01:46:53.530 --> 01:46:57.480
I root for happiness and sometimes happiness means divorce.

1813
01:46:58.170 --> 01:47:01.950
Well, I'm able to make the switch by even root for mayor.

1814
01:47:01.951 --> 01:47:06.600
I just root for marriages. I don't know what that's it. Well, cause you,

1815
01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:11.250
I know why because you grew up in a fucked up sort of situation where it didn't,

1816
01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:12.113
you know,

1817
01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:17.690
you grew up with broken promises and divorces and separating and that kind of

1818
01:47:18.151 --> 01:47:20.880
shit. A lot of that hadn't happened. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1819
01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:24.180
There was stuff that had happened well for chill, not for me,

1820
01:47:24.181 --> 01:47:26.970
but there was like, it was around right. It was in,

1821
01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:31.860
it was in our family history for sure. Yeah. Now mine too. Yeah. Um,

1822
01:47:31.890 --> 01:47:33.600
I, I root for happiness.

1823
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:37.530
Sometimes happiness means someone getting the fuck away from somebody. You know,

1824
01:47:37.531 --> 01:47:41.660
my favorite story about, um, people being a good guy. Mo,

1825
01:47:41.730 --> 01:47:43.740
I mentioned Moe Fallon earlier. He's been on the show,

1826
01:47:43.741 --> 01:47:44.850
so I feel like I can mention them.

1827
01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:48.690
I'm assuming that your listeners like have this like amazing capacity for

1828
01:47:48.691 --> 01:47:53.220
retention, but so will Fallon's village show and Moe Fallon talks about to,

1829
01:47:53.221 --> 01:47:55.650
this is like a third, this is like a fifth hand story,

1830
01:47:56.070 --> 01:48:00.420
but Moe founds body meets the guy that used to be like,

1831
01:48:01.230 --> 01:48:05.700
who's the dude in the nerds movie who'd go like nerds? Oh yeah,

1832
01:48:05.701 --> 01:48:10.260
Whoa guy ogre. Yeah. Okay, check this out. Wow.

1833
01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:15.820
So reference Mo's buddy meets the dude who was ogre in the nerds and nerds,

1834
01:48:16.501 --> 01:48:18.780
not the nerds nerds. I fight. Oh man. So,

1835
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:22.650
and the guy that doesn't want to bring it up but he can't help himself at bring

1836
01:48:22.651 --> 01:48:24.840
it up. He's like, you know,

1837
01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:28.290
I loved you and nerds.

1838
01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.890
So the guy goes into this big thing like, he's like,

1839
01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:40.400
do you have any idea what it would be like to have like your whole life defined

1840
01:48:42.091 --> 01:48:44.310
by some role you did long ago?

1841
01:48:44.610 --> 01:48:47.850
And I'm a thespian and I do theater now.

1842
01:48:48.270 --> 01:48:52.180
And you people that bring this up all the time, nerds, you know,

1843
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:55.730
he does it like he like is cool with that. Right.

1844
01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.070
And enrolls into it and the dude's relief, the,

1845
01:48:59.071 --> 01:49:03.090
he enabled him to like have that recollection [inaudible] you know,

1846
01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:05.000
he was always like, yeah, okay,

1847
01:49:06.010 --> 01:49:08.970
people are going to look and when I hear that now if I see that guy,

1848
01:49:08.971 --> 01:49:11.970
I'm like that guy must be a cool guy. Right.

1849
01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:15.120
Cause he doesn't take himself too seriously cause he could roll with it. Yeah.

1850
01:49:15.210 --> 01:49:19.440
There he is. What's the, do you do pro wrestling or something

1851
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:25.770
which on, on their ranch to the nerds moving. Yeah.

1852
01:49:27.090 --> 01:49:27.750
Yeah.

1853
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:32.010
I mean it looks like a guy that you would cast in a row row where he'd be mean

1854
01:49:32.011 --> 01:49:36.150
to nerds. Yeah. Some people take themselves fucking super seriously.

1855
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:38.970
Like that's one of the best things about my career is like,

1856
01:49:39.150 --> 01:49:42.510
Oh I will for always be forever. Always be the fear factor guy.

1857
01:49:43.060 --> 01:49:46.680
Like if I wrote it. That's true. Ah, it's definitely true with some folks.

1858
01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:51.490
Really. Yeah. You can watch it. It's on TV. I mean you can still understand it,

1859
01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:54.550
but I don't know that. I don't know that that's where the case with you.

1860
01:49:54.580 --> 01:49:57.970
I feel like the, you might have a wrong impression of your, over your legacy.

1861
01:49:58.630 --> 01:50:02.430
<v 1>Uh, it's in, there is definitely in there, in there, but it's not it, well,</v>

1862
01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:07.040
maybe it's not there, but if anybody wanted like poke fun at me,

1863
01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:11.380
that's always there and I would welcome it. Like, I don't think it's right.

1864
01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:12.620
I'm the, I don't think that that happens.

1865
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:16.760
It would prevent me from taking myself, my myself and my, you know,

1866
01:50:16.761 --> 01:50:20.150
I wanted to pretend I'm some sort of moody artists that has always followed the

1867
01:50:20.151 --> 01:50:23.630
path of creativity and artistic expression. No,

1868
01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:25.580
not whored myself out for like six years.

1869
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:31.500
<v 0>I think it's in your head, but I don't think it's in people's head. Maybe. Yeah.</v>

1870
01:50:31.950 --> 01:50:33.750
I don't know. It's in some people's heads.

1871
01:50:33.751 --> 01:50:35.610
I can remember the first place I ever hear. You know what?

1872
01:50:35.611 --> 01:50:38.520
You know what helps to substantiate what you're telling me.

1873
01:50:39.690 --> 01:50:42.180
I know where I was sitting the first time I ever heard your name.

1874
01:50:42.210 --> 01:50:45.390
I know who I was talking to. And unfortunately,

1875
01:50:45.450 --> 01:50:48.870
I don't like to admit this is a long time ago. Unfortunately,

1876
01:50:49.590 --> 01:50:53.880
the point of contact when I was like, Oh, you're right.

1877
01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:56.040
Fear factor. Yeah. Yeah.

1878
01:50:56.041 --> 01:50:59.160
I mean fucking millions of people saw that God damn thing.

1879
01:50:59.190 --> 01:51:00.023
I need to tell you too.

1880
01:51:00.030 --> 01:51:05.030
That was the first conversation when I ever heard the word podcast.

1881
01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:09.090
Really? I know where I was sitting. I was talking to Helen Cho who you know.

1882
01:51:09.330 --> 01:51:10.110
Oh yeah,

1883
01:51:10.110 --> 01:51:15.090
I heard the word Joe Rogan and the word podcast and had no idea what either of

1884
01:51:15.091 --> 01:51:17.820
those things were. That's before you came on to, yeah.

1885
01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:22.260
I'm going to talk a long time ago. 12 [inaudible]. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not like,

1886
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:26.130
I'm not, I mean I have, I don't want to say have my finger on the pulse,

1887
01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:29.280
but I'm not like a Luddite. Well that was when I heard [inaudible]

1888
01:51:29.290 --> 01:51:33.820
<v 1>the word, the podcast was only three years old back then when you first came on.</v>

1889
01:51:33.821 --> 01:51:37.450
Now it's 10 years old. That Craig as longer ago than that,

1890
01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:38.990
it was 2012 okay.

1891
01:51:39.310 --> 01:51:43.000
Cause that's when we went hunting maybe in 2011 and we went hunting in 2012

1892
01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:45.190
yeah. Yeah. So it was probably two years old.

1893
01:51:45.191 --> 01:51:47.950
The podcast was two years old and she said fear factor. I'm like, Oh

1894
01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:52.960
the world, the world of podcasting, man.

1895
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:57.490
There was a funny variety article that was just written that Conan O'Brien is

1896
01:51:57.491 --> 01:52:00.190
blazing a trail in the world of podcasting and you know,

1897
01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:04.540
just got just openly shit on by the entire world who read that.

1898
01:52:04.541 --> 01:52:05.710
Like what are you talking about?

1899
01:52:05.711 --> 01:52:09.460
Like no one's even like his podcast gets like a hundred thousand downloads or

1900
01:52:09.461 --> 01:52:12.730
something. And in comparison to like Mark Mayer and or Adam curl,

1901
01:52:12.731 --> 01:52:16.270
all these people who've been doing it forever and ever and ever. But it's a,

1902
01:52:16.670 --> 01:52:21.670
it still to this day like this sort of in mainstream views and mainstream eyes.

1903
01:52:22.540 --> 01:52:27.540
It's like just starting to gain recognition when some people like Corolla has

1904
01:52:28.271 --> 01:52:32.050
been doing podcasts for 10 years and I think Marin has been doing it longer than

1905
01:52:32.051 --> 01:52:35.590
me. I've been doing it for 10 years. It's Marin's probably 10 11 years in.

1906
01:52:36.490 --> 01:52:37.780
You know, it's a, it's a weird world.

1907
01:52:37.781 --> 01:52:42.460
And how many years you guys been doing it now? Five. Yeah. Five years in. Yeah.

1908
01:52:42.610 --> 01:52:45.920
I listened to your goddamn podcast every week. I get on Monday.

1909
01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:50.780
<v 8>Monday's mind one day. Yes. If I see a man, yeah, I really enjoy doing it.</v>

1910
01:52:50.781 --> 01:52:55.730
And I, and I've tried to point out, um, I've tried to point out that,

1911
01:52:56.990 --> 01:53:01.370
uh, yeah, if it was the view I hadn't, I wouldn't have gone into it. Well,

1912
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:03.980
you were really good as a guest and I was like, man,

1913
01:53:03.981 --> 01:53:08.630
this guy has so much unusual knowledge in his head and you're so good at

1914
01:53:08.631 --> 01:53:11.360
articulating thoughts and you have a background in journalism. You're,

1915
01:53:12.170 --> 01:53:15.510
you're so eloquent. Like, why wouldn't you do it? I'm like, it's so easy.

1916
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:17.050
And there's like this market for,

1917
01:53:17.070 --> 01:53:21.800
for people that enjoy hunting and enjoy the outdoors. There's, you know,

1918
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:22.550
there's,

1919
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:26.120
and I don't mean any disrespect to anybody who's making podcasts do your best,

1920
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:30.830
but there's a lot of clunky, uh,

1921
01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:36.160
poorly articulated thoughts that are being put out in podcast form.

1922
01:53:37.370 --> 01:53:40.070
And my, my thought was like, this is, um,

1923
01:53:41.190 --> 01:53:44.800
w the word spiritual is a very weird word, right? Um,

1924
01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:47.090
because it's been sort of co opted by assholes,

1925
01:53:47.450 --> 01:53:50.660
but there's this sometimes in LA for sure.

1926
01:53:50.661 --> 01:53:53.870
I was on a beach wearing [inaudible] and I'm with you, you know,

1927
01:53:53.871 --> 01:53:58.130
but there's a spiritual aspect to hunting. It's real, you know,

1928
01:53:58.460 --> 01:54:03.460
and one of the things that I really appreciate about you is like this idea,

1929
01:54:04.281 --> 01:54:07.760
like no shooting collar deer speaks to it.

1930
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:10.090
It's like there's,

1931
01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:14.450
there's something about this that's not just about shooting an animal and eating

1932
01:54:14.451 --> 01:54:17.720
it. It's about the difficult difficulty of their pursuit,

1933
01:54:18.230 --> 01:54:21.110
what it means and what you're getting out of it as a human being.

1934
01:54:21.111 --> 01:54:26.111
And then also the recognition of what you're eating and when you're eating this

1935
01:54:26.391 --> 01:54:29.000
animal that this is a, this is a wild,

1936
01:54:29.001 --> 01:54:33.290
beautiful creature that you respect and that there's a certain amount of, like,

1937
01:54:33.890 --> 01:54:38.030
there's a certain amount of a feeling of loss and sadness when that animal dies.

1938
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:38.631
And this is,

1939
01:54:38.631 --> 01:54:43.340
this is recognizing that this is real and it's hard for people to articulate

1940
01:54:43.341 --> 01:54:43.760
that.

1941
01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:47.450
And I think it's very important that there's people like you out there that are

1942
01:54:47.451 --> 01:54:49.000
articulating this and that,

1943
01:54:49.090 --> 01:54:52.700
that people can digest this in a podcast form and get it over and over again.

1944
01:54:52.701 --> 01:54:55.310
And they also get, cause you always do these big groups of people,

1945
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:58.860
they get a sense of comradery too and where people are talking them.

1946
01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.860
And there's also like an up pride of hard work. You know,

1947
01:55:03.861 --> 01:55:07.900
there's a pride that comes through that which I think is very, um,

1948
01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:10.060
contagious like this, uh,

1949
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:14.660
the feeling of appreciating and respecting hard work and like the way that you

1950
01:55:14.661 --> 01:55:17.960
were talking about Jason Phelps, you know, it's like that kind of a,

1951
01:55:17.961 --> 01:55:20.720
that appreciation for ingenuity and hard work.

1952
01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.290
I think it's very important for people. It's very important for people to here.

1953
01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:28.370
It gives you something that I don't, in terms of like outdoor,

1954
01:55:28.630 --> 01:55:30.080
like the outdoor world,

1955
01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:33.710
like whether it's hunting and fishing and just appreciation for wildlife.

1956
01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:38.960
It's not publicly articulated on a broad scale. You know,

1957
01:55:38.961 --> 01:55:43.110
when you referred to the comradery, which is super important to me.

1958
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:44.963
Uh,

1959
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:49.650
<v 2>when I thought about making a show, um, you know,</v>

1960
01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:51.960
not always had a lot of this, when I thought about making a podcast,

1961
01:55:51.961 --> 01:55:54.540
you know what always had a lot of installs. Your Ford was, um,

1962
01:55:55.980 --> 01:56:00.330
Howard stern in the mid nineties. Yeah. I don't know what his shows like now,

1963
01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:02.670
if I remember the era when it was, um,

1964
01:56:02.760 --> 01:56:05.670
I mean he made me even when he's still be on there, like hit him,

1965
01:56:05.671 --> 01:56:08.280
all these dudes around that were kind of like funny. Yeah.

1966
01:56:08.370 --> 01:56:10.650
And there's so many people in the room you couldn't tell who was talking.

1967
01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:15.120
It's just like people, it felt like people hanging out. Yeah. I liked that.

1968
01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:20.160
And I liked, um, fresh air Bertera girl. Sure. That I was like,

1969
01:56:20.190 --> 01:56:21.660
dude, you should do a combo

1970
01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:24.993
<v 8>of Howard stern,</v>

1971
01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:27.890
<v 2>Terry Gross. Yeah. Like a thing. That was the thing I thought about,</v>

1972
01:56:27.891 --> 01:56:30.200
but the comradery, that's one of the,

1973
01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:33.110
one of the things I like to see in most when people write in, they feel like,

1974
01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:36.770
um, they feel like it's that like people sitting around shooting the shit,

1975
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:40.910
which, you know, it's a very, uh,

1976
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.680
controlled shooting of the shit. Sure has to be.

1977
01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:46.530
It's controlled

1978
01:56:46.530 --> 01:56:49.000
<v 8>well. That's why I personally use important, like there,</v>

1979
01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:53.090
there has to be one person that's sort of like aware that we're all shooting the

1980
01:56:53.091 --> 01:56:56.360
shit, but sort of like gently guiding it. You know,

1981
01:56:56.390 --> 01:57:00.650
Opie and Anthony was the same thing for me when I started doing opion Anthony in

1982
01:57:00.651 --> 01:57:04.130
like the early two thousands, uh, I realized like, wow,

1983
01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:08.810
what is this crazy people don't, people that weren't fans of it back then,

1984
01:57:08.811 --> 01:57:10.850
it doesn't exist anymore. Unfortunately.

1985
01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:14.660
It was an amazing hangout for comedians. We would all go there and I would,

1986
01:57:15.170 --> 01:57:19.520
I would show up and Ricky Gervais' would be there and Jim Norton would be there

1987
01:57:19.521 --> 01:57:22.460
and all these guys would be there and Louis C K be there, bill bird be there.

1988
01:57:22.461 --> 01:57:23.420
We'd just be talking shit.

1989
01:57:23.421 --> 01:57:26.630
And Ari Shaffir we'd all be just laughing and chime in.

1990
01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:29.900
And even though it was six o'clock in the morning, like you went and did it,

1991
01:57:29.901 --> 01:57:33.230
man, you had a cup of coffee, you showed up and everybody was happy to see you.

1992
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:37.490
And it was a hang and it was a really loosely structured hang that they put

1993
01:57:37.491 --> 01:57:42.170
together and that inspired me to kind of do my podcast in a similar way.

1994
01:57:42.490 --> 01:57:45.920
<v 2>I don't know how comfortable you are pulling back the curtain or showing like</v>

1995
01:57:45.930 --> 01:57:48.370
how the sausage is made, but um,

1996
01:57:48.850 --> 01:57:53.680
I was talking to someone recently about you and sort of how you do your deal.

1997
01:57:54.010 --> 01:57:58.240
That was like, if you, if you imagine this make you uncomfortable. No. Okay.

1998
01:57:59.530 --> 01:58:03.460
If you imagined that someone, I don't want this to seem like at all negative.

1999
01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:08.920
If someone read a transcript of your, of what you ask, you wouldn't be like,

2000
01:58:08.921 --> 01:58:09.754
Oh my God.

2001
01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:14.620
But you bring out things in and the people that you interview,

2002
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:19.950
I like to listen to your show and you get something from people that people

2003
01:58:19.961 --> 01:58:22.390
don't get. Did you get it on purpose?

2004
01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:29.450
<v 8>Uh, like I don't know what I'm getting. I'm trying my best.</v>

2005
01:58:30.490 --> 01:58:32.040
Yeah. So I'm trying my best to relate.

2006
01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:33.531
<v 2>Yeah. Do you like,</v>

2007
01:58:33.531 --> 01:58:36.080
you know what I'm gonna do you ever say to yourself you don't know how to do

2008
01:58:36.081 --> 01:58:36.914
different?

2009
01:58:36.930 --> 01:58:41.260
<v 8>No, I don't think that's the, the beauty of it all.</v>

2010
01:58:41.610 --> 01:58:46.360
There's not that much thinking. I mean, I do think with some people,

2011
01:58:46.361 --> 01:58:49.930
like there's certain people at Cornell West, I read his book before he came on.

2012
01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:52.900
I really wanted to be prepared cause he's such a brilliant guy.

2013
01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:58.120
Same thing with like, um, uh, Sean Carroll, like a scientists,

2014
01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:00.760
you know, anyone who's like, yeah. You got your,

2015
01:59:01.090 --> 01:59:05.110
you're paying respect to the yes. The complexity of their ideas. Yes.

2016
01:59:05.111 --> 01:59:08.830
And like if say someone like, um, like Richard Dawkins,

2017
01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:13.150
we're talking about doing a podcast soon. If I, if I have him on,

2018
01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:18.180
I will devour his material for like a week or two beforehand.

2019
01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:20.380
I will read his book.

2020
01:59:20.381 --> 01:59:25.240
So I'll listen to recordings and conversations and debates that he's had and I

2021
01:59:25.241 --> 01:59:29.620
already am a big fan of the guy and so I'll get a good understanding of like

2022
01:59:29.621 --> 01:59:33.250
where I'm at when we lead into the conversation.

2023
01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:34.930
But then I won't have an agenda.

2024
01:59:35.110 --> 01:59:38.050
I would just like let the conversation flow and if a,

2025
01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:40.390
there's a moment in time where I want to ask him,

2026
01:59:40.391 --> 01:59:44.680
like you said this thing about Islam ones like do you, what do you mean?

2027
01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:48.460
Do you mean this in terms of we got general understanding of the religion

2028
01:59:48.461 --> 01:59:48.940
itself.

2029
01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:52.630
What about the individuals that are just trying to be good people that are born

2030
01:59:52.631 --> 01:59:56.620
into this environment and this sort of, uh, you know, I will,

2031
01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:01.570
I will have some places to go to if we get stuck and some things that I will,

2032
02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:04.940
but I won't, I won't force those things in. Yeah.

2033
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:08.210
But I think it's like an mean without, with the,

2034
02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:10.230
the risk of sounding pretentious. I think that uh,

2035
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:15.270
podcasting is in a weird way in art form and the art is in like the people

2036
02:00:15.521 --> 02:00:17.320
listening. Like, I know sometimes I talk over,

2037
02:00:17.321 --> 02:00:22.060
people are interject too much a disagree. It happens,

2038
02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:24.190
it happens. It just happens.

2039
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:27.970
There's no way you can have a perfect conversation because I don't know when the

2040
02:00:27.971 --> 02:00:30.010
person's going to stop talking and,

2041
02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:33.190
or I don't want to lose a thought and I want to jump in with it.

2042
02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:37.090
But I'm way better at it now than I was five years ago.

2043
02:00:37.091 --> 02:00:39.580
And certainly way better at it now than I was 10 years ago.

2044
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.500
And then I think that there's a,

2045
02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:46.560
it's an art to the way the things that you're saying sound and how they sound to

2046
02:00:47.591 --> 02:00:48.424
people.

2047
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:53.430
And there's an art to expression expressing genuine open

2048
02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:59.250
mindedness and genuine curiosity and like just a,

2049
02:00:59.251 --> 02:01:02.710
a purity of thought or it's not, there's,

2050
02:01:02.711 --> 02:01:06.550
you're not trying to make people feel about you a certain way. You're not,

2051
02:01:06.551 --> 02:01:09.160
you're just trying to explore ideas. And there's a,

2052
02:01:09.490 --> 02:01:14.200
there's a smoothness to the way that's D that's, that's,

2053
02:01:14.650 --> 02:01:18.430
um, devoured by people when people are listening, the way they're consuming it,

2054
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:22.510
it's easy. And the easier you can make it on people listening,

2055
02:01:22.511 --> 02:01:25.930
the more they'll like you. So like the, like if they know that like,

2056
02:01:25.931 --> 02:01:30.070
Hey that Steve Rinella guy, he loves his kids, he's a nice guy.

2057
02:01:30.071 --> 02:01:32.680
He's his friends love him. Like I liked that guy.

2058
02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:36.180
Listen to what he says when he talks to John Norris, you know,

2059
02:01:36.181 --> 02:01:39.460
what does John [inaudible] about this and about that and like it, it,

2060
02:01:39.590 --> 02:01:41.270
it adds to it.

2061
02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:46.300
Whereas is there someone who is clunky and louder than is fucking,

2062
02:01:47.901 --> 02:01:51.560
they're just trying to toot their own horn and all that comes through,

2063
02:01:51.710 --> 02:01:56.090
especially in this long form podcast genre.

2064
02:01:56.091 --> 02:01:59.810
It's like this is the fucking mirror man.

2065
02:01:59.811 --> 02:02:04.250
Like he did with long form podcasts. You find out who the fuck everybody is.

2066
02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:07.670
Yeah. That's good. That's a good point. Like, like Bernie Sanders,

2067
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:09.260
like I had Bernie Sanders on us.

2068
02:02:09.261 --> 02:02:12.970
A lot of people that like the fucking comments were insanely positive too.

2069
02:02:12.971 --> 02:02:16.340
Like I thought that guy was crazy. Like I thought he was a nut.

2070
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:18.050
I would see him in these little interviews. I'm like,

2071
02:02:18.051 --> 02:02:20.360
he just wants to give away everybody's money. Like a,

2072
02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:23.510
there's a picture with Bernie with my dog and one of the fucking hilarious

2073
02:02:23.511 --> 02:02:25.880
comments, like he just wants to give your dog treats other dogs.

2074
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:32.930
But it's like that's, that's the character. I mean,

2075
02:02:32.931 --> 02:02:35.900
everyone has a character, right? The character that guy is,

2076
02:02:35.901 --> 02:02:39.050
he just wants to take money from successful people and give it to lazy people.

2077
02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:42.800
That's the worst, the worst view of Bernie Sanders, you know?

2078
02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:47.210
And you'd get to see instead of like this narrative that gets established

2079
02:02:47.211 --> 02:02:51.680
through these little short sound bites on these panel talk shows,

2080
02:02:51.681 --> 02:02:54.500
there's three people talking over each other or debates or whatever it is.

2081
02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:56.450
All those are ineffective.

2082
02:02:56.451 --> 02:03:00.440
And what's interesting about is all those are fueling podcasts,

2083
02:03:00.890 --> 02:03:05.890
all those things that have so for so long been thought of as main stream venues

2084
02:03:08.181 --> 02:03:09.620
for getting your ideas out.

2085
02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:14.890
Now they highlight all the problems with those and they highlight all the

2086
02:03:15.351 --> 02:03:19.430
strengths of podcasts. That's encouraging. Yeah,

2087
02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:22.160
it's very encouraging. And [inaudible] are you Bernie Sanders man,

2088
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:27.020
he's a nice guy. You know, I, I, I like some of his ideas.

2089
02:03:27.050 --> 02:03:32.050
I do not have a problem giving up more of my money as a person who's made a lot

2090
02:03:32.811 --> 02:03:33.644
of money,

2091
02:03:33.890 --> 02:03:37.270
if I know that it's going to benefit the greater good of mankind in the,

2092
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:39.860
in a result, once you get squandered, I don't want to see it squandered.

2093
02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:42.710
I don't like bureaucracy. I don't like red tape. I don't like government.

2094
02:03:42.711 --> 02:03:46.280
I don't like people that are so lazy that they just want to take everybody's

2095
02:03:46.281 --> 02:03:48.860
money and then do what they will with it and take long lunch breaks.

2096
02:03:48.861 --> 02:03:53.600
And this is the problem with like a lot of what we think of in terms of like

2097
02:03:53.601 --> 02:03:57.890
government. Government is filled, it's bloated, it's filled with assholes.

2098
02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:00.800
It's filled with people that just got government jobs and they're,

2099
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:04.160
they're not good at it. You know, they just, no one else wants that job.

2100
02:04:04.161 --> 02:04:06.920
So they take that job and they do a shitty job with it and they squander

2101
02:04:06.921 --> 02:04:07.754
resources.

2102
02:04:08.090 --> 02:04:11.420
That's what drives people crazy and especially hardworking people that know how

2103
02:04:11.421 --> 02:04:14.390
hard it is to make a living and you have to give up. You know,

2104
02:04:14.391 --> 02:04:15.470
if you're a fucking lager,

2105
02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:18.440
you could've given away certain percentage of your money and you're tired,

2106
02:04:18.441 --> 02:04:22.620
all the splinters in your hands and you're exhausted and some asshole is going

2107
02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:24.290
to take away your money and you know,

2108
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:28.010
allocate a certain amount of it to nonsense. Yeah. You know,

2109
02:04:28.190 --> 02:04:32.660
gender research and all sorts of stupid shit that you think is just fruitless.

2110
02:04:32.690 --> 02:04:37.160
And it just, it's infuriating for people, for hardworking people with dirt,

2111
02:04:37.380 --> 02:04:38.280
their fingernails.

2112
02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:41.190
<v 0>They don't want to think about anybody squandering their money. Yeah.</v>

2113
02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:45.560
I'm instinctively uh, yeah,

2114
02:04:45.561 --> 02:04:49.850
fiscally very conservative. Yeah. I'm not very fiscally conservative.

2115
02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:54.990
People might look at where I'm at and think that I'm socially liberal,

2116
02:04:54.991 --> 02:04:59.550
but in social issues I'm somewhat libertarian, you know, but, uh,

2117
02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:02.060
I feel that, um,

2118
02:05:02.740 --> 02:05:07.740
I need the right to come my direction quite a long ways on conservation issues.

2119
02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:13.690
But that's [inaudible] that's, yeah, that's instinctively where I belong. Yeah.

2120
02:05:13.750 --> 02:05:16.590
But the right, but I need them to move back my number.

2121
02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:18.880
I say back my direction cause historically, I don't know,

2122
02:05:19.330 --> 02:05:23.600
the right and left heart is confusing, but um, yeah,

2123
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:27.170
I need them to come my way on conservation. Well,

2124
02:05:27.171 --> 02:05:29.120
I liked the way you've described yourself in the past,

2125
02:05:29.121 --> 02:05:33.650
that you're politically sort of alone, that you're, you're,

2126
02:05:33.710 --> 02:05:36.680
you're kinda without a party because the left wants to take your guns away and

2127
02:05:36.681 --> 02:05:40.340
the right ones take your land away. And this is what we see fiscally.

2128
02:05:40.341 --> 02:05:41.750
That what the,

2129
02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:46.840
the most disturbing aspects of a right wing administration says they want to

2130
02:05:47.001 --> 02:05:50.120
sell off public land. They want to figure out a way, just a little bit,

2131
02:05:50.121 --> 02:05:52.760
just a little bit. We just take a little bit, we're going to use it for mining.

2132
02:05:52.761 --> 02:05:55.490
Just take a little bit. Well, we may lose this salmon river,

2133
02:05:55.491 --> 02:05:59.900
but who the fuck is paying attention to that? [inaudible] I'm watching. Yes,

2134
02:05:59.901 --> 02:06:03.860
me too. That's a Ryan Callahan. I talked about that with a, what is it called?

2135
02:06:03.861 --> 02:06:08.690
Pebble beach. Is that what the no, pebble. Mine, pebble. Mine that. I'm mean,

2136
02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:13.470
gigantic salmon fisheries. The biggest, most important. It's a deeply on, yeah.

2137
02:06:13.550 --> 02:06:16.100
I don't want to get into hard, but yeah,

2138
02:06:16.101 --> 02:06:18.890
you can get into the weeds with this stuff, but yeah,

2139
02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:23.120
it's like there's no perfect party and there's no perfect politician.

2140
02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:27.550
There's no perfect ideology. Which pisses people off when you point that out.

2141
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.900
Yeah.

2142
02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:32.980
Do we've gotten hit hard for that kind of stuff for pointing out that it's just

2143
02:06:32.981 --> 02:06:35.380
not, um, you know, we as a company,

2144
02:06:35.381 --> 02:06:39.170
like immediately we've been like hit hard for pointing out that, um,

2145
02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:43.630
it's unfortunate that someone's not speaking for our wholly for our concerns.

2146
02:06:43.660 --> 02:06:46.610
Yes. Well, what's interesting about you guys is a,

2147
02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:50.650
people think that you're some sort of a green Trojan horse. It's just hilarious.

2148
02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:54.610
We don't really like what you don't like go dude, we don't really like the hunt.

2149
02:06:55.450 --> 02:07:00.120
I love it, but it's so preposterous. So I worked with the hardest. Uh,

2150
02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:04.000
I work with the hardest hit and I work with the hardest hit Hunter and honors

2151
02:07:04.001 --> 02:07:07.480
and fishermen that there, that there are ever that I've ever lived.

2152
02:07:07.481 --> 02:07:10.880
You don't really like hun. It's hilarious. No, it's like [inaudible].

2153
02:07:11.010 --> 02:07:13.990
I'm like beltway lobbyist. You don't really like hunting. Oh, is that right?

2154
02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:18.190
He just shows you how silly people are. It's like, let's line them up. Yeah.

2155
02:07:18.810 --> 02:07:21.220
It's, yeah. Come on, bring your side over here. Let me,

2156
02:07:21.250 --> 02:07:22.930
let me see what you're doing. Yeah, it's,

2157
02:07:22.931 --> 02:07:25.330
it shows you how ridiculous people can be in their,

2158
02:07:25.360 --> 02:07:29.560
their desire to like put people into a very small,

2159
02:07:29.561 --> 02:07:33.400
easily dismissed category. You know, it's like this is what people love to do,

2160
02:07:33.550 --> 02:07:36.160
you know? Yeah. That's what you do, di, that drives people

2161
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:40.420
<v 1>crazy as you defy your soul. Hard to bucket.</v>

2162
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:45.370
I love it. I don't sit around at night thinking about you,

2163
02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:50.260
but I love it when I'm thinking about you either. It makes you feel comfortable,

2164
02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:53.980
but I think we need more people like that, that, yeah. Most,

2165
02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:55.660
most people would think that I'm conservative,

2166
02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:58.360
that I'm a Republican or an alt right or something like that.

2167
02:07:58.570 --> 02:08:01.450
I vote left on almost everything except gun control.

2168
02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:03.730
I just don't think that people understand what they're talking about when

2169
02:08:03.731 --> 02:08:04.750
they're talking about gun control.

2170
02:08:04.751 --> 02:08:08.020
I don't think they understand the nuances of the second amendment or the nuances

2171
02:08:08.021 --> 02:08:12.340
of taking away people's ability to defend themselves or to hunt or to, you know,

2172
02:08:12.341 --> 02:08:16.420
to, to own something that may or may not be used against someone else,

2173
02:08:16.421 --> 02:08:18.220
but they never would use it. It's,

2174
02:08:18.250 --> 02:08:22.000
you don't have the right to tell people what they can and can't have just

2175
02:08:22.001 --> 02:08:24.640
because some people abuse things.

2176
02:08:25.090 --> 02:08:30.090
It's like this is a very complex conversation that people on the left want to

2177
02:08:30.731 --> 02:08:35.230
boil down to guns equal bad. Oh, for sure. It's like,

2178
02:08:35.231 --> 02:08:39.700
it's like I don't have them and I can understand why someone would yes.

2179
02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:43.570
But, um, therefore I don't know why you would,

2180
02:08:44.290 --> 02:08:48.580
but at the same time there were sending her with a drink,

2181
02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:53.320
but at the same time you look at like alcohol and one could make a very cogent

2182
02:08:53.321 --> 02:08:58.321
argument about the overall destructiveness of abused alcohol for sure.

2183
02:08:58.990 --> 02:09:03.700
But people, I don't hear a lot of people talking about a prohibition.

2184
02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:07.930
No, no. I had this go, I don't drink Crenshaw. I don't drink and drive.

2185
02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:11.440
Dan Crenshaw was a Congressman. There's not for legalized marijuana.

2186
02:09:12.210 --> 02:09:15.580
Nobody likes scotch. So we had this weird conversation. I'm like, come on man,

2187
02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:19.120
stop. And I'm like, when we're standing in front of a Ash tray,

2188
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:21.770
fill with blunts. I'm like, come on. And this, uh,

2189
02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:24.040
this idea that like if you're a marijuana smoker,

2190
02:09:24.041 --> 02:09:26.860
that somehow another you're lazy like work out with me.

2191
02:09:27.250 --> 02:09:30.340
Come get up with me to stop. Just stop that nonsense.

2192
02:09:30.370 --> 02:09:33.070
I would like to tackle with this with you. Uh,

2193
02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:39.250
cause I have um, questions about, yeah, about that being lazy,

2194
02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:40.870
you know, weed, smoker, weed.

2195
02:09:40.871 --> 02:09:43.990
Smoking makes me work harder cause it makes me paranoid.

2196
02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:48.430
I don't want to be lazy. I want to earn my keep, I want,

2197
02:09:48.431 --> 02:09:51.580
I don't want people to ever think that I'm slacking. I love it. That's great.

2198
02:09:51.730 --> 02:09:54.610
Let's, I think about comedy. When I think about when I smoked pot,

2199
02:09:54.611 --> 02:09:56.980
I think about comedy. I'm like, I better get to work.

2200
02:09:57.010 --> 02:09:58.900
That's good that you get so paranoid in.

2201
02:09:58.901 --> 02:10:02.440
The paranoia is that you don't work hard enough. 100%. It's all of it.

2202
02:10:02.770 --> 02:10:04.500
All of it. My wife don't deserve,

2203
02:10:04.810 --> 02:10:08.230
my wife gets where she thinks,

2204
02:10:08.231 --> 02:10:11.800
not that she's going to pee your pants, but that she has Peter pants.

2205
02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:18.740
That's the most innocuous concern when it comes to alcohol or marijuana ever.

2206
02:10:19.330 --> 02:10:21.340
That's a great one. I wish I only had that one.

2207
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:25.600
That'll make it so easy to live with. But mine AIDS productivity, my,

2208
02:10:25.601 --> 02:10:29.920
my fears aid productivity, whether it's exercise, whether it's um, um,

2209
02:10:30.050 --> 02:10:34.010
you know, I'm doing stand, stand up is a big one cause you

2210
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.350
<v 0>don't want to suck. You just don't want to suck.</v>

2211
02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:38.990
You don't want anybody to pay money and have a bad time.

2212
02:10:38.991 --> 02:10:41.090
That is the worst feeling in the history of the world.

2213
02:10:41.150 --> 02:10:43.420
Well I'm going to go see it tonight. Yes. If you suck,

2214
02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:46.280
I'm going to fuck and be like, boom, I'm working hard. Dude.

2215
02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:49.940
I might heckle you but I've seen people heckle you and it doesn't work well.

2216
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:51.950
They don't come out on top.

2217
02:10:51.980 --> 02:10:55.970
It's not a smart move because you're interrupting a show for your own idea.

2218
02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:58.400
You're, if people are already rooting for the guy on stage,

2219
02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:00.560
cause when people heckle you, it doesn't work out well for them.

2220
02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:03.050
Well occasionally people are rooting for the heckler.

2221
02:11:03.051 --> 02:11:05.150
If the heckler has a good point, like SA, look,

2222
02:11:05.151 --> 02:11:08.480
people have heckled me and said hilarious shit and I'll laugh along with them.

2223
02:11:09.290 --> 02:11:11.630
It's like, as long as we're not filming anything,

2224
02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:14.750
the real problem is people that want to heckle in your filming, you know,

2225
02:11:14.751 --> 02:11:17.330
like you're filming something like don't hackle. Yeah dude, you're funny.

2226
02:11:17.331 --> 02:11:21.770
But you're not fun. You'd like to know for like posterity, it's alcohol,

2227
02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:24.550
it's all alcohol. So like you get a couple of drinks and you're like,

2228
02:11:24.570 --> 02:11:27.540
I had some funny shit to say too. And you know, you got,

2229
02:11:27.650 --> 02:11:31.010
you're not the only funny one is bald man,

2230
02:11:31.580 --> 02:11:35.690
bald man up here and telling me what's funny. I know what's funny and I'm not,

2231
02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:37.340
and sometimes people have good points,

2232
02:11:37.610 --> 02:11:39.920
but that's the beauty of live performances. You know,

2233
02:11:39.921 --> 02:11:44.180
you live in this world where from ready start, who knows what's going to happen.

2234
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:48.560
You press start and like this thing goes off in its own little journey and you

2235
02:11:48.561 --> 02:11:51.860
have this idea of what the way you're going to steer it and you're bringing up

2236
02:11:51.861 --> 02:11:55.310
subjects and you're making people laugh. But anything could happen.

2237
02:11:55.850 --> 02:11:59.810
Anything can happen. Do. When I saw you last, I saw you in Seattle. And uh,

2238
02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:03.370
you know, I want to say this,

2239
02:12:03.371 --> 02:12:08.371
but the people destroyed this by saying we laugh.

2240
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:10.360
My wife and I laughed so much.

2241
02:12:10.690 --> 02:12:13.330
I wish no one had ever pointed this out because people are gonna be, Oh,

2242
02:12:14.890 --> 02:12:19.750
it hurt. My stomach hurt my stomach so much or hurt.

2243
02:12:19.751 --> 02:12:23.200
I love as much. I cried like, yeah, shut up. But like we last much,

2244
02:12:23.210 --> 02:12:25.750
my stomach hurt, my stomach muscles hurt.

2245
02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:28.150
That's as good as a person could ever get. Yeah.

2246
02:12:28.151 --> 02:12:31.540
That's the best compliment can literally,

2247
02:12:31.541 --> 02:12:35.260
I had like stomach afterward we were talking about our stomach muscles.

2248
02:12:35.261 --> 02:12:38.320
Like we're doing AB as like, we had been doing a bunch of crunches.

2249
02:12:39.670 --> 02:12:43.530
Comedy is a crazy art form, man. It's a crazy art form. It was a beautiful,

2250
02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:46.060
it was like, cause we're like in the mix of it, man.

2251
02:12:46.110 --> 02:12:50.290
I mean we have three kids that are under 10. It's hard. Everything's hard.

2252
02:12:51.010 --> 02:12:52.990
And we went to see you. It was just like,

2253
02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:57.610
we went to see you or you watch your shit. And, um,

2254
02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.370
it was just for, you know, for just like glorious whatever, I don't know,

2255
02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:04.880
60 minutes, 45 minutes. It was,

2256
02:13:05.110 --> 02:13:09.540
we were just like two people like ha, like fucking like having fun.

2257
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:11.980
That's the best thing of really common.

2258
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.710
It's really nice and laughing as stuff that we thought.

2259
02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:20.430
What makes it especially fun and especially, um,

2260
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:25.560
cathartic is we're laughing about stuff that we felt like we're not supposed to

2261
02:13:25.561 --> 02:13:29.580
laugh about. Yeah. But you have this moment, you have this epiphany like, Oh,

2262
02:13:29.581 --> 02:13:32.310
you know what though? But it is funny.

2263
02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:36.750
<v 1>It is funny and it's okay because you're with 3000 other people and everyone's</v>

2264
02:13:36.751 --> 02:13:41.640
drunk. Yeah. You're like, Oh, we're all on the same page. But it is funny.

2265
02:13:41.670 --> 02:13:41.881
Yeah.

2266
02:13:41.881 --> 02:13:46.260
But also like this that you can be a good person and laugh at things that are

2267
02:13:46.261 --> 02:13:48.390
ridiculous and that you probably shouldn't be laughing at.

2268
02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:50.910
These things are possible. No, we loved it.

2269
02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:54.170
That's the art form of that is the art form of comedy. You know,

2270
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:57.650
the my favorite kind of comedy, my favorite comic comedy is fucked up. I,

2271
02:13:57.860 --> 02:14:02.010
I mean, I love all kinds of comedy. If somebody like is like a Jerry Seinfeld,

2272
02:14:02.011 --> 02:14:03.840
you ever notice? I'm like, that's great to me.

2273
02:14:03.841 --> 02:14:07.040
He's an artist and he figures out a way to craft these things.

2274
02:14:07.070 --> 02:14:11.700
You can take your kids to your grandma, but I'm a Joey Diaz fan.

2275
02:14:12.090 --> 02:14:15.030
I like that kind of guy. I like Kennison. I like that. I like prior,

2276
02:14:15.031 --> 02:14:16.140
I like that kind of comedy.

2277
02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:18.930
<v 2>I've told you this before and I've told your listeners this before enough.</v>

2278
02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:23.100
Excuse me. Um, then I don't mean to wrap your own show, but I got to go. But,

2279
02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:26.730
uh, you didn't like this when I, it,

2280
02:14:26.770 --> 02:14:28.740
I felt like you didn't like it when I said it before,

2281
02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:33.360
but your comedy comes from a position I think he like,

2282
02:14:33.390 --> 02:14:37.620
I think you didn't like this because it sounds, um, you're, you're modest.

2283
02:14:37.621 --> 02:14:40.110
How do you know if I liked it? But your body language,

2284
02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.830
your comedy comes from a position of strength.

2285
02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:46.090
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

2286
02:14:46.090 --> 02:14:49.930
<v 2>So much comedy comes from a position of self-loathing was self-loathing is</v>

2287
02:14:49.931 --> 02:14:53.770
funny, right? I can't get it up. I can't please my girlfriend.

2288
02:14:54.100 --> 02:14:58.210
I'm a horrible husband. Right? It comes from self-loathing.

2289
02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:03.720
But to have someone come at comedy from a position of strength is unusual

2290
02:15:05.380 --> 02:15:09.580
because the formula is that it's self deprecating. I'm so pathetic

2291
02:15:11.170 --> 02:15:13.650
<v 0>Brian. But to have</v>

2292
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:18.750
<v 2>comedy coming from an individual who isn't mired in self-loathing,</v>

2293
02:15:21.070 --> 02:15:22.450
is it really fresh angle?

2294
02:15:22.780 --> 02:15:25.990
And I feel like I brought this out to you before and you, you seem to, um,

2295
02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:30.510
<v 1>they seem to not dig it. I probably just didn't want to talk about myself.</v>

2296
02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.820
Like they didn't want to talk about comedy cause you come from a position of

2297
02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:36.960
strength. It's like, eh, it's fine. It's just jokes.

2298
02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:39.210
If you came from a position of self loathing,

2299
02:15:39.211 --> 02:15:42.440
you would have luxuriated in the compliment, right? Probably be like,

2300
02:15:42.450 --> 02:15:47.180
well thank you. Oh, never thought about that way. I guess I'm okay. Yeah,

2301
02:15:47.470 --> 02:15:51.030
I guess I'm okay. Yeah. So there was a compliment for you. It's tricky business.

2302
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:54.490
Um, you, you gotta go, you're filming some shit with Brian counting.

2303
02:15:54.510 --> 02:15:57.990
I know when we get in together, what are we doing? Come on man. Well,

2304
02:15:58.890 --> 02:16:02.820
I know some Turkey hunting or was it Alaska?

2305
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:05.870
<v 2>Turkey, but I, if you remember, I propose you, not long ago,</v>

2306
02:16:05.871 --> 02:16:08.510
I was asking you about your availability to hunt elk in September,

2307
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:09.810
but it kind of petered out.

2308
02:16:10.270 --> 02:16:12.830
<v 1>Oh, I have two hunts. I have one. I see. I have,</v>

2309
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:15.460
that's the thing about having kids in a family and everything like,

2310
02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:19.980
<v 2>so what I would like most is to bring you in your family up to my fish shag for</v>

2311
02:16:19.981 --> 02:16:22.520
a few days. Let's do it. Because I think our children,

2312
02:16:22.670 --> 02:16:26.420
<v 1>let's do that. Our kids are kids like kids. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do that.</v>

2313
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:30.040
Let's do that. I'm into that my, and like I said, my youngest fucking

2314
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:34.230
<v 8>loves fishing. We'll have a great time. It'll be good. Steve and Allen,</v>

2315
