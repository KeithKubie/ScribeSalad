00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.573
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.516
&gt;&gt; So we're very excited
to be here also.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.716
The Post has been a
very big supporter

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.890
of the National Book
Festival for 10 years.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.260
We're a charter sponsor of the
festival and we're thrilled

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.253
that we've had such an
amazing turnout today.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.106
And this pavilion is just
full of such excited faces.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.910
It's really great.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.763
I was actually told to do
a one minute introduction

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.456
of Katherine Paterson.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.203
And I have to say, I could stand
here for more than a minute

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.890
and just list all the
awards that she has won.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.996
That would certainly
make it very easy

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.930
but that would be a very
boring little introduction.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.596
So, I'm going to try to
say a couple of things.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.796
She clearly is though a towering
figure in children's literature.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.393
She is a two-time winner
of the Newbury Medal

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.380
and the National Book Award for
her titles Bridge to Terabithia,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.980
Jacob I Have Loved, The Great Gilley
Hopkins and the Master Puppeteer.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.250
Her books are almost not
children's literature

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.576
because they really do
deal with many themes

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.843
that you don't often find
in books for children.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.216
At the same time though,
her characters triumph

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.303
in such wonderful ways even if
they are children themselves.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.903
So her treatment of her
characters is really very much

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.676
like the treatment of her readers.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.053
She treats them with the
utmost respect and admiration

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.433
and that is why she is so loved.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.020
It's no wonder the library
of congress has named her

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.520
in 2000, "A Living Legend."

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.173
Wouldn't we all like to
be named a living legend

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.773
in some point in our life?

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.906
And she is currently
the National Ambassador

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.040
for Young People's literature.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.306
Please welcome Katherine Paterson.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.673
[ Sound effects ]

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.463
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
Well I cannot believe all

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.263
of you have waited this
long on this hot day.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.436
But it's wonderful to see you,
but hasn't it been a great day?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.933
I've just -- I hope you've had half
as good a time as I've had today.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.176
I love this festival and don't tell
anybody, I've been to four of them,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.753
because they try not to
invite people too often.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.080
[Laughter] And I don't want them to
know how often they've invited me.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.950
I'm hoping the list has
been lost or something

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.010
so I can come again very soon.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.126
I was told that this afternoon you'd
like to hear about my newest book.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.420
And someone said to
me, "But it's different

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.420
from all your other books."

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.056
And I said, "Yeah, most of
my books are all different

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.183
from every other book."

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.783
But this is different because
I'm writing about a country

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.250
that I've never been to and
about people who speak a language

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.876
that I've never spoken, and
I've never done that before.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.423
I wrote this book called The Day
of the Pelican because one Sunday

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.750
after church, Steve Dale, who's
also in the choir said to me,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.786
"I think you should write
about the high Jews."

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.863
Now over the many years that I've
been a writer I cannot tell you how

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.343
many times someone has come to me
and said, "I've got a great idea

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.116
for you to -- for a book.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.673
All you have to do is write it."

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.146
[Laughter] To which I've
said and I hope politely,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.846
"I think that's our idea.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.113
I think you should write it."

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.970
[Laughter] But I was
looking for an idea

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.930
at that time for a newspaper serial.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.173
Some years ago Ava, the young adult
writer got a bunch of involved

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.476
in what we call breakfast serials.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.080
And you write a chapter every week
for the newspapers who subscribe

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.786
and of course you have
to end every page,

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.066
every chapter with a cliffhanger
so they'll buy the paper next week.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.060
But, because newspaper
space is limited,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.900
each chapter is only three
double-spaced pages long.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.276
So three double-spaced pages,
ending in a cliffhanger

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.313
and about fifteen chapters of
that and I thought about it

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.490
and I thought well so much
was happening in Kosovo back

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.196
in the late 90's I think I could
make three pages of the cliffhanger

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.590
out of that if I did
plenty of research.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.016
So three pages and
fifteen chapters of it

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.843
and I felt pretty good about it.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.066
It went around to about
100 newspapers

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.420
and people seemed to
respond positively.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.800
But my editor Virginia Buckley, who
has been my editor since 1970 said

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.983
to me, "I think you should
turn that story into a novel."

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.206
I said, "Virginia I can't do that.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.493
I can do three pages and a
cliffhanger and for that I had

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.506
to do two years of research.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.770
I don't know how the people talk.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.436
I don't know what they wear.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.436
I don't know what they eat."

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.770
And she said, "Well I
think you really should try

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.990
because it's a story
that people need t hear."

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.950
So I did more research,
but really to prove

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.693
to Virginia that it was impossible.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.060
I went to the internet and began
looking for pictures of Kosovo.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.533
And I found almost 200 absolutely
gorgeous pictures taken by a man

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.883
who called himself, "Kosovo Cajun",

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.580
which sounded like a
very interesting name.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.136
So I emailed Kosovo Cajun who turned
to be a man named Mark Orphila,

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.820
naturally from Louisiana but Mark
had lived for seven years in Kosovo.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.470
He knew the language.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.003
He knew the people very well.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.803
He and his wife had worked

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.343
in a Macedonian refugee
camp during the worst

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.063
of the tragedy and he loved Kosovo.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.486
So I told him what my problem was.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.166
I said I'm desperate to find
someone who will help me because all

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.686
of attempts, the Haxhiu family
had long ago moved away from Berry

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.600
and all of my attempts to get
in touch with other refugees

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.680
from Kosovo who had failed -- I live
in Vermont so it sort of limits you,

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.190
although we do have a lot
of refugees in Vermont.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.803
So I asked him a couple of questions
which he immediately answered

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.460
and that gave me a hope to
ask him to read my drafts

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.203
and help me not make any horrible
mistakes as a I wrote the story.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.370
So the second email
he wrote me he said,

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.110
"You know when I answered your first
email I'd never heard of you before.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.883
But I mentioned you to
my wife and my mother,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.630
his mother had been a school
librarian [Laughter] they seemed

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.496
to know who you were."

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.810
[Laughter] So Mark was the most
wonderful help and you'll notice

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.710
that the book is dedicated to him

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.626
because I couldn't have
done it without him.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.823
I would write a chapter
and I would email it to him

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.116
and of course my chapter would be in
black and he would reply paragraph

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.883
by paragraph in red and the
black paragraph was this long

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.770
and the red paragraph was this long.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.426
And we just kept working until
there was no more red on the page.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.146
So I owe everything to Mark.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.773
He was wonderful.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.550
Sometimes he would give me
answers that I didn't want to hear

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.530
because I thought something
else would be more dramatic

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.596
but we were determined
to keep the book as true

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.823
to the actual events
as we possible could.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.223
I'm going to read -- I know there's
somebody that's going to flash cards

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.240
at me and tell me when to shut
up and I do want to leave time

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.316
for questions but I'd
like to read a little bit

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.043
from the book if that's alright.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.676
And it's not quite fair
because I'm going to read way

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.150
over towards the end of the book.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.653
But I want to do that because I
think perhaps this is the thing

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.960
that's most important for us to
think about in this day and time

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.123
when we are having all kinds of
problems with not only refugees

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:37.853
and immigration but our whole
attitude towards the people

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.193
of Muslim faith is
being sorely tested.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.616
So the Lleshi family has
gone through all kinds

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.653
of terrible events in
their native Kosovo.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.446
They've been in a Macedonian
refugee camp and then a church

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.773
in Vermont has sponsored
them to come to this country.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:05.383
They are settling in,
they've been here

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.383
about two years and
then the sky falls.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.856
At home they watched on television
as the plane hit the second tower

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.896
over and over again and as both
towers crumbled to giant piles

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.466
of debris over and over
again their throats were dry.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.920
They could not speak
or look at each other.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
"Turn it off", Baba commanded.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:40.766
He had been sent home
from work early.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.786
No one had come to the restaurant.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.443
Everyone in America was

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.443
at home watching the planes
crash and the towers fall.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.250
Did they eat that night?

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:57.516
They must have but afterward
Meli couldn't remember eating,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.986
just the replay of the planes
crashing and the towers falling.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.330
Even with the screen black the image

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.166
of the disaster played
on in her mind.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040


00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.170
After Vlora and the younger
boys were put to bed,

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.780
Mehmet turned the TV on again.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.080
That was when they heard the news
that the whole world now knew.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.296
The terrorists who had crashed
the planes into the twin towers

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.583
and blown open the
pentagon were all Muslims.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.750
Baba shook his head in disbelief.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.240
"This is not the way of
the prophet", he said.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.896
"This is sickness, madness."

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:46.790


00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.990
The next day going to
her locker Meli realized

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.833
that people were staring at her.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.460
And then after passed lots
of students in the halls,

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.303
there was silence and
then a whispered exchange.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.420
She was used to people not speaking
to her, but this was different.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.240
Everyone is upset.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.283
We're all afraid.

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:09.546
A number of people had
stayed home fearing somehow

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:12.533
that the terrorists would
find their way to Vermont

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:15.686
and bomb the largest
building in their town,

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.113
which was the high school.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.226
And over a little way,
they go to their sports.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.546
They're both wonderful
soccer players.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.150


00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.110
The principal announced over
the PA system that classes

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.720
and activities would go on as usual.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.353
But nothing felt usual.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:42.406
During soccer practice no
one passed her the ball.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.963
She tried to pretend that she
didn't notice the strange looks sent

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.810
her way.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.810
Once she found herself
sprawling on the field.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.386
No one had meant to
trip her had they?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.706
But later as she showered she could
hear one of the seniors talking.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.576
It was Brittany, the
varsity goal keeper.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:04.983
She seemed to be talking loudly on
purpose so that Meli couldn't help

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.656
but hear her over the
noise of the water.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.630
"That's what her family
is", Brittany was saying.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.236
"She's one of them, her and
that weird brother of hers."

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.066
"No", someone protested,
"She's okay."

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.266
"Just ask her", Brittany
said, "You'll see."

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.416
Should she just stay in the
shower, pretend she heard nothing,

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.936
but that seemed cowardly.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:32.416
Meli turned off the water, wrapped
her towel around herself and stepped

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.896
out into the locker room.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.023
It was as if someone had
pushed the mute button.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.536
No noise, just stares.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:45.480
Brittany, the only
fully dressed girl

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:47.823
in the room gave Rachel a shove.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.016
"Go ahead ask her."

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.173
Rachel who'd been trying to put on
her jeans nearly fell on her face.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.986
She caught at her balance
and then glanced back

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.120
at Brittany before turning
red-faced toward Meli.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.516
"Someone said you were
one of them Meli",

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.730
she said her voice hardly
more than a whisper.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.610
"That's not true is it?"

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.810
"What do you mean them", Meli
asked, "I don't understand."

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.400
She looked from one
team member to another,

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.543
"If you mean what nationality,
I am Kosovar."

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.763
"Well what's that", Brittany asked.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.830
"It's not Christian is it?"

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:36.030
"No." Her throat was so tight
that she could hardly speak.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.160
"No Serbs are Christian.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.790
I am not a Serb -- I --
my family is Albanian.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.666
"I thought you just said Kosovar."

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.333
Brittany's eyes narrowed to a slit.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.370
"Yeah, Meli."

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.903
It was Chrystal, the junior
whose place Meli had taken

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.770
on the Varsity squad.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.836
"What are you really?"

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.113
"I told you, I'm Albanian Kosovar."

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.730
Come on Meli.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.876
Brittany stepped around
Rachel and glared at Meli.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.383
"You are one of them
you know you are."

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.383
"Explain what you mean them."

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:15.673
Of course, by now Meli knew
full well what Brittany

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.113
and the others meant by them.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.193
But she wanted to make Brittany
say it out loud to her face.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.893
"How am I one of them?"

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.946
She leaned so close to Brittany
that she could see the pimples

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.373
on the girls cheeks set to explode.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.003
Brittany straightened,
"Like the terrorists",

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.773
she stepped back slightly.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.173
"You know, like their religion."

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.973
"I'm not a religious person."

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.600
Meli walked over toward
her locker and opened it.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.826
"I told you she wasn't Christian."

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.913
"I'm not a religious person"
Meli continued keeping her eyes

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.353
on her locker and her voice
as steady as she could.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.846
"But if I have to choose Christian
or Muslim, the okay, I'm Muslim."

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.313
She turned around, "But that
doesn't make me one of them.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.480
I'm not a terrorist."

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.346
Brittany shoved Rachel
forward once more.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.780
Meli wrapped her towel more
tightly around herself and looked

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:15.546
into the face of the girl she
had thought of as her friend.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.560
Rachel looked everywhere
except at Meli.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.696
"As her about her brother
Rachel", Brittany demanded.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.553
"Ask if he's a terrorist."

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.303
"It is not terrorist to want
to fight for your homeland."

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.963
As soon as the words were out of
her mouth Meli knew she should never

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.290
have said them.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.556
Rachel backed away, her eyes wide.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:42.436
"See", Brittany yelled so loud her
voice reverberated around the tiles.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.250
"See. I told you."

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.053
She whirled around toward
the locker opening the door.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.280
She grabbed her book
bag and threw it

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.213
over her shoulder before she
turned again toward Meli.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.376
"Why don't you and your brother
just go back to where you came from?

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.450
We don't want any Muslim
terrorists around here."

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.920
With that she slammed
her locker shut

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:07.233
and marched out of the locker room.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.280
For a few minutes, they
all stared at the door

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.406
as it swung behind Brittany.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:18.590
And then careful not
to look Meli's way,

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.886
everyone finished dressing
quickly and left,

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:27.023
leaving Meli standing their
alone shivering in her towel.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.170


00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.143
Pull yourself together,
get dressed, go home.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.203
She was thinking in Albanian.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.870
How long had it been
since she'd done that?

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:42.306
She thought in Albanian
only when speaking to mama

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.673
and Baba, never in school.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.363
She smiled grimly then --
carefully methodically --

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.006
dried herself and put
on her street clothes.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:55.463
Next she gathered up
her practice uniform,

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.436
her freshly laundered game uniform,
her shin guards and her mouth guard

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:02.933
and took them all through the
swinging door to the coach's office.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.640
She carefully folded her
practice uniform into a square

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.146
and laid everything down on the
desk in a neat stack with a sheet

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.623
of paper torn from her notebook.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.553
She scribbled a short
note for Mrs. Rogers

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.916
and laid it on top of the pile.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.170
The she walked out of the school
door into the crisp autumn air.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.086
Mehmet was waiting for her
as he used to back in Kosovo.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.000
She could see that someone
had bloodied his nose.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.206
He had tried to wash it away
but there were still traces

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.573
of blood around the nostrils.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.193
She did not have the
strength to ask him why.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.636
They walked home in silence.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.543
Mama and Baba were both home.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.760
There was no work for them that day.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.666
"What happened", mama asked
looking back and forth

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.753
from Meli's face to Mehmet's.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.210
"I'm going home", Mehmet said.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.316
Baba turned off the TV and got up.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.216
"What is going on?"

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:06.300
"I'm going home", Mehmet said again.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.133
"I hate America."

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:11.343
Baba put his arm around
Mehmet's shoulder.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.010
"You must tell me what
happened Mehmet."

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.330
Mehmet looked at the floor,

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.596
"They were all swearing
against the terrorists.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:20.776
Then they said all
Muslims are terrorists

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:23.210
and Americans must kill them
before they destroy America."

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.623
And then Meli could see how close
to tears he was in his anger.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.673
"And then I said, I am
Muslim will you kill me?"

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.900
So, he blew out his breath.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:40.870
So they tried.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:42.380
He wiped his nose on the back of
his hand making it bleed again.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:46.450
"I'm never going back
to that school.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.150
They think I'm like
those terrorists.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.420
They hate me."

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.286
He looked up defiantly into
Baba's face, "Well I hate them.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:00.890
We are even."

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:03.890


00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.546
And then I'm going to
read a little later scene

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.086
that takes place that night.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.220


00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.733
She dimly heard the telephone ring
in the kitchen and didn't think

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.886
to wonder who might be calling,

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.253
but before long Baba knocked
on her half open door.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.953
"Meli are you dressed?"

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.420
"Yes Baba", she whispered
as to not wake Vlora

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.613
who was sleeping peacefully
in the other bed.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:30.123
"Wash your face and comb your hair.

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.456
We have visitors coming."

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.056
"Visitors, at 9 o'clock at night?"

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.110
Then she heard Baba
at Mehmet's door.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.850
She didn't want to
listen to them argue.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.650
She couldn't bear it.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.716
She went quickly to the
bathroom and washed her face.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.790
She patted down her hair and
then went into the kitchen

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.576
where mama was busy making coffee.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.216
She had changed into
her nicest dress.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.730
"Mama." "Take some chairs from
the kitchen into the parlor Meli.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.490
We need more chairs in there."

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.053
As she was bringing
in a second chair Baba

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.593
and Mehmet emerged
from the boy's room.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.300
"Help your sister Mehmet",
Baba said.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.253
Mehmet brought in a
chair and sat down on it,

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.666
his body as stiff as a pole.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.323
Meli and mama sat on the others.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.856
She waited for some explanation
from Baba but none came.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.466
At length they could hear
footsteps on the stairs.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.853
It sounded like a number of people.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.936
Police! They're going to
arrest us for being Muslims.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.070
No that was crazy.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:34.163
Police didn't call ahead
to say they were coming

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.070
and mama wouldn't be
dressed up and making coffee

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.373
if she thought they were all
going to be hauled off to jail.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:43.846
It was a ridiculous fear.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.053
Still it was a few seconds
that her heart stopped racing.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:49.573
Just some of the welcomers, surely.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.906
But why would they
come so late at night.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:58.670
At the knock Baba nodded at Meli
so she got up and opened the door.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:58.940
The first person she saw in the
dark hallway was Mrs. Rogers.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.986
Just behind her was Mr.
Marcello and with them Adona.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:07.916
Why was Adano here?

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.900
They hadn't needed a
translator for months.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.390
Mehmet or she or one of the
other children had done all

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.410
of the translating
for their parents.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.806
The three visitors were in the
process of taking off their shoes.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.650
Adano must have told the others too.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.416
Americans didn't seem to
know how important that was.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.920
"Let the guests in Meli", Baba said.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.330
He and mama stood up.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.480
When Mehmet saw his coach
he started for his bedroom

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.466
but mama grabbed his arm.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.653
"How are you Meli?",
Mrs. Rogers asked.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.373
Meli tried to smile back,
but her face felt frozen.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:50.290
Adano stepped forward and
said to Adano in Albanian,

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.863
"These are the children's
coaches for playing soccer."

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.950
She introduced Mrs. Rogers and
Mr. Marcello to mama and Baba.

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.263
The adults shook hands formally.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.470
Then Baba indicated that everyone
including Mehmet was to take a seat.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.663
The three guests sat
down on the couch.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.756
"I have made coffee",
mama said shyly to Adano.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.733
"Should I bring it out?

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.633
We don't have any cola or mineral
water but" -- Adano shook her head.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.233
"I don't think so", she said.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.300
"It's late.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.766
They won't stay long."

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.870
Mr. Marcello was sitting on
the edge of the couch cushion.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.330
He had taken off his baseball
cap and was playing with it.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.736
The light from the ceiling fixture
seemed to bounce off his bald scalp.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.976
Finally without looking
at Baba he spoke to Adano.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.763
"Tell Mr. Lleshi", the coach
said, "That I've come to apologize

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.140
for what happened to his son today."

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:45.883
Adano translated.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:47.630
Mehmet sat like a stone on the
kitchen chair, his lips tight,

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.003
a bruise on his face dark
against his red cheek.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.706
Meli could still see the
dried blood in his nostrils.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.553
"Tell him", the coach continued,
"That it will never happen again.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.583
I will not tolerate
this kind of behavior.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:08.256
Tomorrow those boys are
off the team for good."

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.006
As Adano translated, Meli
saw Mr. Marcello had a hole

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.423
in one of his socks.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:19.090
She could see his big toe
sticking out like a tiny bald head.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.716
Poor man, she thought, how
hard this must be for him.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.333
She glanced at Mehmet to see if
he felt any pity for his coach.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.493
If he did, there was no sign of it.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.800
"And you should tell Mr. and
Mrs. Lleshi that I totally agree

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.133
with Coach Marcello",
Mrs. Rogers said.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:37.356
I'm cutting every girl who
took part in that scene

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.716
in the locker room today.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.050
But that would be the
whole team Meli thought,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.730
and then wondered how her coach
had found out what had happened.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.936
Someone must have been
ashamed and told her.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.960
Meli hoped it had been Rachel.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.933
"I should have been there.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.733
I'm usually just next
door in my office

00:23:59.200 --> 00:23:59.866
but I had been called
to the main office.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:01.533
So I wasn't there when it happened.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.133
Otherwise, I cannot tell
you how sorry I am."

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.043
Baba listened, his head
bent towards the translator

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.236
to make sure he understood
every word.

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.830
When Adano finished, he
looked up at the coaches.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.420
"Thank you", he said.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.966
Then he turned back to Adano,
"Tell the kind teachers

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.663
that it would not be a good
thing to remove those boys

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.670
and girls for all the more.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.650
Tell the teachers that
my children are strong.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.626
They have endured many hard
things in their short lives.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.470
They can also endure this."

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:36.953
He waited for Adano to
say the words in English.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.580
When she paused, he continued.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.413
"Tell them my children wish to
be respected as fellow teammates

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.600
and not despised because
of their heritage.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.713
This is the way of the old country.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.720
This is America, tell them.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:58.196
In America everyone
has a new beginning."

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.233
When Adano finished translating,
Mrs. Rogers smiled first

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.516
at Baba and then at Meli.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:06.086
"And what about you
Meli", she asked softly.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480
"Do you agree?

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:10.783
Shall I let everyone
stay on the team?"

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.176
"Yes, like Baba said."

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.966
"Even Brittany?"

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.513
"You can't have a team
without a goalkeeper."

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.323
Coach Marcello turned and
spoke directly to Mehmet.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.003
"What about you Mehmet?

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.336
How do you feel about this?"

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.370
Mehmet didn't answer.

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.636
He sat very still,
his eyes on the floor.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.990
"Tell the teacher", Baba
said, speaking to Adanoa

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:39.260
but looking all the while at Mehmet.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.106
"Tell the teacher that my son had
endured much more painful hardship

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.160
than this.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:47.543
As a child he was once in a
Serbian jail where he was beaten

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.576
and left in a field to die."

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.906
As Adano translated, Meli saw
Mr. Marcello's eyes widen.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:58.836
Mrs. Rogers gasped.

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.730
"He is very brave, my
son", Baba continued.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.710
"And I'm very proud of him.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.380
He will do the right thing.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:09.690
You will see."

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.646
Now Mehmet looked up at Baba

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:17.180
and for a moment Meli imagined she
saw tears in her brother's eyes.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.343
He did not wait for Adano to finish
her translation before he said

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.350
quietly, "Baba is right.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.673
One man does not make a team.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.953
We must play together
or there's no game."

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.290
Coach Marcello's hand
stopped fiddling with his cap.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.096
He cleared his throat.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.856
"Thank you Mehmet", he said.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.226
Then quietly so that
Meli did not hear it

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.233
until it was repeated
in her own language.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:51.740
"He says to tell you Mr.
Lleshi that you are a good man

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.980
and he hopes he will
be as good a father

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.560
to his children as
you are to yours."

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.286
"Tell the kind teachers",
Baba answered, "That Mehmet

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.933
and Meli will be back
for practice tomorrow."

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.680
[Applause] Thank you.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.146
I've been signaled that
we have four minutes

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:25.756
so if I don't make the answers
too long we should have time

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.503
for a few questions.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.526
I think there mics in
the aisle if anyone wants

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.460
to step up and ask a question.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:38.470
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.203
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Hi.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:42.870
&gt;&gt; I was wondering how you
maintain the authenticity

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.670
when you're speaking from the
voice of a child or a young person

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.870
and how you maintain
that connection.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.556
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Oh, how
do I maintain the connection

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.136
with the child that
I'm writing about?

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:57.823
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you mentioned a little bit
that you had authenticity talking

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.830
about Kosovo and that experience.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.920
And speaking from the perspective

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.673
of a young person I'm curious
how you're so authentic.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:07.436
I really enjoyed reading
your books as a young person

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.763
and it really spoke to me.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.213
And I just wanted to
ask how you did that.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:14.780
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Thank you.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.263
Well, it's always very mysterious
to me because, see my gray hair.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:24.163
I don't think I have actually
a very good memory for details

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.853
of my childhood and youth,

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.030
but I think I have a
good emotional memory.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.603
And that's what I rely
on when I right.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.963
I remember how things felt

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.186
and in this book I remember
how it felt to be a refugee.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.203
I remember how it felt to
come to the United States

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.550
and be despised by my classmates.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:49.730
So I think that helped
me in writing the book.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:54.630
Yes.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:59.696
&gt;&gt; What is your inspiration for
the book Bridge to Terabithia?

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:01.823
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: I
wrote Bridge to Terabithia

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.490
because our son David's
best friend was a girl

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:06.826
and the summer they were both
8 years old she was struck

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.026
and killed by lightening.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.746
And it was such a terrible tragedy
that I began to write the book

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:14.350
to try to make sense of a tragedy
that didn't make any sense to me.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:23.130
I didn't for one minute think it was
going to comfort my grieving son,

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.790
but I did think it might help me.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:26.733
And indeed it's always been a
very hard book for David to read.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.913
I think until he was in his
40's and actually made the movie

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.020
that was the thing that helped
him the most, to go back

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:43.243
and revisit the book and
to put in another form.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.160
&gt;&gt; Okay thank you.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.160
And by the way, I liked the book.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.160
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Thank you.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.960
Yes.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:52.990
&gt;&gt; Hi I love your books and I was
wondering how long it normally takes

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:58.863
to write your books?

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:00.863
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Well
it depends on the book.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:02.876
I did write a book in the shower
once, but that's a record.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:04.466
I've taken a lot of
showers since then

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.233
and no more books in the shower.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.076
But that was really terrific

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.230
and it was a fairy story
called The King's Equal.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:14.250
It just came to me all in a rush.

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:20.650
Usually it takes me -- I used to say
it took me a year now I say year,

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:25.523
two years, three years,
depending on how much research

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.420
and also what else is
happening in my life.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:34.450
How are we doing on time down there?

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:37.436
One more minute?

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:39.170
I guess we have time
for one more question.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.770
&gt;&gt; I love your books.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.970
And what was your reaction
to the people

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:50.516
that bought all your
books so quickly?

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.070
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Oh,
can you think of anything

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:53.766
that would make you happier than
to have them lined up with books

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.266
that they had paid for you
to sign that you had written.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.276
You know when I'm in that situation
I just wish all those publishers

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:08.390
that wouldn't publish my
books could be there that day.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:09.940


00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.106
[Sound effects] I consider that
the perfect revenge don't you?

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.286
I think I have to quite now.

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:23.406
I'm sorry because another
program is coming in.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.120
But thank you so much for your
patience and being with me.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.990
[Applause]

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.856
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the library of congress.
