imagining that stuff it's all that we
 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.610
imagining that stuff it's all that we
know of I still think it's all in his

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620
know of I still think it's all in his
 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.130
know of I still think it's all in his
head not seen elsewhere

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140

sounds like boy fancy to me but that
that's my supply which will make sense

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800
that's my supply which will make sense
 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.320
that's my supply which will make sense
why he can't use his imagination either

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330
why he can't use his imagination either
 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.760
why he can't use his imagination either
because he's already using his

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770
because he's already using his
 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.650
because he's already using his
imagination so it'd be difficult for him

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660
imagination so it'd be difficult for him
 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.030
imagination so it'd be difficult for him
he's like no I don't want to do that

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040
he's like no I don't want to do that
 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.830
he's like no I don't want to do that

thing where you imagine that you're
 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.300
thing where you imagine that you're
somewhere else cuz that's dumb even

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310
somewhere else cuz that's dumb even
 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.770
somewhere else cuz that's dumb even
though that's what he's doing so it

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780
though that's what he's doing so it
 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.040
though that's what he's doing so it
would make sense of that anyway rigueur

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050
would make sense of that anyway rigueur
 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.380
would make sense of that anyway rigueur
mmm it's not the idea that he would

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390
mmm it's not the idea that he would
 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.199
mmm it's not the idea that he would
still not want to use his imagination or

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209
still not want to use his imagination or
 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.729
