00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.410
&gt;&gt; Where do you see the place of

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.030
bioethics in the future of genetics in personalized medicine?

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.720
&gt;&gt; I actually think that bioethics and especially a knowledge

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.980
of genetics is increasingly important. Because

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.940
you know, bioethics as a concept originated. As an idea

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.560
of how to protect participants in research and consumers

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.220
of healthcare. People who don't have all of

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.659
the training and the information held by the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.790
physicians and the researchers who are you know,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.650
bossing them around. Standing there in white coats looking

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.350
scary and saying give me your blood, I'm

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.380
going to go do great things with it. It's

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.200
important in order to protect autonomy that people

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.650
have. As we've talked about, informed consent. You need

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.030
to have the information going into a study. But

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.120
I don't think protecting informed consent is just about giving

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.400
someone a form when they're coming into a study,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.660
and saying. This is exactly what we're going to do. This

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.060
is what you're going to experience. Do you sign on

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.570
the dotted line? Okay. It's about making sure that people

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.300
have the tools to understand their participation in such

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.870
an area, in such a venture, in the first place.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.160
And that's by ensuring that people are educated

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.320
about genetics, about personalized medicine, about the possibilities

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.450
that their future and their genetic code actually

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.240
hold. What that actually means for them. The

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.490
level of predeterminism or not, that this information

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.970
actually applies. And, well, I'm perhaps a little

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.520
bit biased in favor of the study of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.030
bioethics because I think it is super fun and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.930
interesting and really important. But. You know,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.890
science is advancing at a pretty breakneck pace.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.950
And you know, we won't always get out in front of it like with Gina. But

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.550
someone needs to be paying attention and you know, you never want to say, stand

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.650
in the way of any kind of scientific

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.460
advancement. I don't think that's at all what

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.430
the study of the intersection of ethics and science is about.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.535
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:16.820
&gt;&gt; But insuring beneficial and responsible use I

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.760
think is critical to respecting the people who make research possible. So my

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.370
background, I came to bioethics as a philosophy major as an undergraduate. I,

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.910
I began studying human rationality, mostly, and philosophical

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.870
conceptions of understanding individuals as rational beings

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.540
and what your ethical duty is to

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.650
a rational being are. That led me

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.990
into studying informed consent and medical ethics

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.630
because I found it fascinating. I mean

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.950
especially how you get informed consent. How

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.460
you get any kind of consent from

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.880
someone who isn't rational, was formerly rational,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.150
is never rational. Fun questions.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah seriously.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.450
&gt;&gt; and then that in turn led me actually to becoming a lawyer.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.380
Because I realized that law is the tool that you're actually going

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.520
to use to make sure that people who cannot advocate for themselves

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.090
are nonetheless protected. You know, the best advice I can give to learning

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.860
bioethics is just be open to figuring out what the next

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.815
weird issue is going to be. And learn all you can about it.

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:30.815
&gt;&gt;

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:30.440
[LAUGH]

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.810
&gt;&gt; That's why bioethics is fun, right? It's sort of a, a mix between

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.520
hard nose practicality and science fiction. You're paying attention to, what

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.660
could go wrong and how do we stop that or you know, aspirational

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.030
fiction. What, what's not great right now? How can we make it better?

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.600
&gt;&gt; Rachel thank you so much for coming in.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.800
&gt;&gt; Thanks for bringing me in.
