00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.720
Okay, so let me see if

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.930
anything changed after we did this last modification.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.530
Acutally, there is someting that I would like

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.120
to do here. Because looking at this a little

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.560
bit more, I noticed that there are two

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.760
attributes, renewed and due date. That we have in

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.640
loanable Item, right? But they don't seem to

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.590
be really, attributes or characteristics of loanable Item.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.150
They're more of the characteristics of the association between the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.450
Loanable Item and the patron. Wouldn't you agree?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.230
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, it's not like you could

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.644
only renew a book once in it's entire history.

00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:41.220
&gt;&gt; Right. Exactly, exactly. So, that's why what l like

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.970
to do is I would like to move those out of loanable

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.020
item. And actually there is a construct that we can use

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.710
to express this. It's called, we haven't seen it yet, but it's

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.780
a special kind of class. It's called an association

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.480
class. So, it's a class that is connected to

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.730
a specific association. So what we can do

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.730
here, we can create this class, which I'm going to

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.200
call checked out. I'm going to, associate it with

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.520
this, association. I'm going to connect it with this association. And

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.620
then I'm going to move the due date and the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.300
renewed attributes From the LoanableItem here in this checked

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.520
out class. So in this way, seems to me that

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.910
it makes it very explicit for somebody looking at this

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.530
class diagram, that these characteristics are characteristics of the loan,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.200
and not of the elements involved in the loan.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.410
&gt;&gt; Can you do the same thing with Fine, isn't Fine a property of the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.740
loan? Yeah, actually is right because

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.120
a fine is a fine for a specific loan, right?

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.910
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.950
&gt;&gt; Okay, so yeah. Then we can do that.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.900
We don't need to represent fine as a class, we can just transform

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.460
that into an attribute that we can put into the checked out association class.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.560
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.760
&gt;&gt; Anything else?

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It occurred to me that there's another thing that happens in one

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.260
of my scenarios, I put down

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.770
about the patron actually returning an item.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.620
&gt;&gt; Right. Okay, so we would probably need an additional operation,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.550
I guess, for the patron.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.990
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.310
&gt;&gt; So, okay, so what I'm going to do, that's pretty easy

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.350
to do, I'm just going to add the return operation here in the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.310
patron, and when that happens, that will mean that I'll get rid

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.490
of this association class because the item is returned. Is that right?

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.060
&gt;&gt; Well, what happens if somebody drops the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.400
book in the book drop, but doesn't pay the,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.050
if it's overdue and doesn't pay the fine?

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.700
Will that get rid of the information about what

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.040
they owe?

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.960
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see. So you can have the item being available, but you still

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.510
want to know whether there is any pending fines on the book.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.390
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, and how much those fines are.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.340
&gt;&gt; And how do you compute how much it is?

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.710
&gt;&gt; It's how many days it was, from the time it was

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.170
due, to when they returned it. I see. OK.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.380
So you know what we can do? I think

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.690
we can put an additional attribute in the checked out

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.190
class and I'm going to call it when returned and

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.200
that item will have either a special value or it

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.040
will contain the date in which the book was

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.520
returned. So in this way you should be able to

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.040
keep this in the system until it's paid, and also to compute

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.970
how much the fine is. Is that working?

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.210
&gt;&gt; So the special value is for a normal situation when they

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.880
haven't, they don't owe anything and haven't returned it yet.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.080
&gt;&gt; Exactly so that will tell us that,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.970
that the loan is still active basically.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.500
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.480
&gt;&gt; Does that work for you?

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.200
&gt;&gt; Yes. And you know, I like this. I mean, I feel pretty good

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.490
about it. I think we have a nice class diagram. So what I'd like to

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.280
do is just go off and clean it up a little bit, and put it

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.640
in an IDE so I can pretty print it and rearrange things a little bit.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.080
And then I'd like to sit down again and

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.730
just go through it for a last time. And

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.900
for some final considerations. So if you don't mind

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.880
we will take a ten minute break and reconvene here.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.500
&gt;&gt; That's fine.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.990
&gt;&gt; Alright.
