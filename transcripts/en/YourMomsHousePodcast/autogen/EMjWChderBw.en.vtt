thing is that like you know we all

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600
thing is that like you know we all
 

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.560
thing is that like you know we all
laughed about your certainty that you

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:44.570
laughed about your certainty that you
 

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.150

could run the marathon you know yeah and

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:46.160
could run the marathon you know yeah and
 

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.470
could run the marathon you know yeah and
then you're like after your start

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480
then you're like after your start
 

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.210
then you're like after your start
running outdoors you're like hey this is

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:49.220
running outdoors you're like hey this is
 

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.190
running outdoors you're like hey this is
fucking way harder it's way harder but

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200
fucking way harder it's way harder but
 

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.989
fucking way harder it's way harder but
like but the reason I

00:33:52.989 --> 00:33:52.999
like but the reason I
 

00:33:52.999 --> 00:33:55.689
like but the reason I
the reason that you say I could

00:33:55.689 --> 00:33:55.699
the reason that you say I could
 

00:33:55.699 --> 00:33:58.389
the reason that you say I could
definitely run it before you realize how

00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399
definitely run it before you realize how
 

00:33:58.399 --> 00:34:00.249
definitely run it before you realize how
difficult it would be is because you

00:34:00.249 --> 00:34:00.259
difficult it would be is because you
 

00:34:00.259 --> 00:34:03.219
difficult it would be is because you
think that's what a strong person would

00:34:03.219 --> 00:34:03.229
think that's what a strong person would
 

00:34:03.229 --> 00:34:06.519
think that's what a strong person would
say yeah a strong person is confident if

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:06.529
say yeah a strong person is confident if
 

00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:08.079
say yeah a strong person is confident if
the person says I can't run the marathon

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:08.089
the person says I can't run the marathon
 

00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:10.899
the person says I can't run the marathon
that person is weaker but in that

00:34:10.899 --> 00:34:10.909
that person is weaker but in that
 

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:13.029
that person is weaker but in that
scenario I think the person that says I

00:34:13.029 --> 00:34:13.039
scenario I think the person that says I
 

00:34:13.039 --> 00:34:14.649
scenario I think the person that says I
would need a lot of time to prepare for

00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:14.659
would need a lot of time to prepare for
 

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:15.879
would need a lot of time to prepare for
that marathon that's what I was that's

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:17.149
what I just realistic
 

00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:18.669
what I just realistic
yeah I'm not realistic because you

00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679
yeah I'm not realistic because you
 

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:21.339
yeah I'm not realistic because you
because of your hyperbole tendencies I

00:34:21.339 --> 00:34:21.349
