&gt;&gt;She said baseball and soccer.

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:07.626
&gt;&gt;Diana: Every kid has an interest.

00:00:07.626 --> 00:00:10.646
Sometimes he doesn't know what it
is, sometimes he can't articulate it.

00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:14.096
But every kid has an interest,
that's a fundamental belief.

00:00:14.096 --> 00:00:16.806
If you can't buy into that, then you
can't buy into the work that we do.

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:30.026
&gt;&gt;In this day and age, the
responsibility of libraries, museums,

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.246
schools, after-school programs, the
type of institutions we work with,

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:37.216
is to not only help that
kid identify the interest,

00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:41.486
but progress through that
interest, become more advanced.

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:43.416
It's just the same
job as a tennis coach,

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:45.666
the same job as a football coach.

00:00:45.826 --> 00:00:47.516
It's the academic coach.

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:52.706
&gt;&gt;So I'm Diana Rhoten, I'm
an organizational sociologist.

00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:55.536
I work at the Social
Science Research Council.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:59.726
One of my projects right now
is called the New Youth City

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:00.666
Learning Network.

00:01:00.736 --> 00:01:02.856
It's in New York City;
it's a consortium

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:05.086
of about a dozen institutions.

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:11.236
We're working together to create new,
digitally-enabled learning activities

00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:14.696
and create new youth
networks across the city.

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:20.446
&gt;&gt;The notion of interest-driven
learning is not a new concept.

00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:23.036
In fact, it's quite
an old conversation,

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:28.916
but it's a conversation that's been
enlivened recently by two things:

00:01:30.096 --> 00:01:32.076
unprecedented technical
infrastructure

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:35.696
and new empirical evidence
around learning.

00:01:36.736 --> 00:01:39.386
What we see in the kids
that we're working with is,

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:42.986
they want an experience that means
something to them personally.

00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:45.346
They want to be able to
relate it into the context

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:46.946
of their own lives or
their own interests.

00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:51.986
Then they wanna be able to reshape
that story and tell it in the context

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:53.476
of their own lives and interests.

00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:55.836
And then they want to
be able to translate

00:01:55.876 --> 00:01:59.766
that into something they can do
in the community, they can do--

00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:02.296
whether that's an online
community or a physical community.

00:02:02.356 --> 00:02:04.566
So it's really a--
it's going consumption,

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:05.976
production, participation.

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:09.946
&gt;&gt;"What does this mean?"

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:12.406
I mean, we had to start there.

00:02:12.536 --> 00:02:14.356
So part of the reframe was,

00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:17.286
we're talking about
learning, not education.

00:02:17.506 --> 00:02:18.316
What's that difference?

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:19.626
We're talking about digital media;

00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:22.026
we're not talking about
big technology.

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:25.556
We're talking about learner centered,
rather than institutional driven.

00:02:26.206 --> 00:02:29.246
So there's a lot of sort
of ground leveling to do,

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:31.326
in terms of just basic understanding

00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:33.586
of what this transformation
might mean.

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:36.856
We're trying to get
them to think about,

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:43.646
what happens if you take your assets
around biodiversity, for example,

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:47.386
and start putting them out there in
a way that a kid can incorporate them

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:51.036
in a narrative that he or she
finds personally motivating,

00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:53.666
personally relevant,
personally interesting?

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:58.296
And then ways in which they might
be able to do dynamic remodeling

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:00.436
around that asset, dynamic mapping

00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:02.626
around that asset,
dynamic story telling.

00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:04.216
Because, you know, part

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:07.396
of the opportunity here
is learning the content,

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:11.666
which is very much the twentieth
century idea around education.

00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:16.246
But in twenty-first century, it's
learning the tools and the skills

00:03:17.026 --> 00:03:21.416
of remaking that content and becoming
the creator and the producer.

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:26.926
&gt;&gt;We have a mandate
and we have a mission.

00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:29.016
You know, we wanna go
through this process,

00:03:29.016 --> 00:03:33.226
at the end of which we can
demonstrate what digital media

00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:36.106
learning tools can do.

00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:37.506
We started on the edges.

00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:42.666
These are institutions
that are central to a city,

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:45.646
but not necessarily central
to a kid's life right now.

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:50.426
They're more flexible; schools are
highly structured around standards

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:52.956
and assessment right now,
so it's very difficult.

00:03:53.536 --> 00:03:57.196
Even where there's a will, it's very
difficult for a teacher right now

00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:59.906
in a formal school
setting to think about,

00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:04.906
"How do I incorporate this
mobile-based geolocative game

00:04:05.016 --> 00:04:06.356
into my classroom?"

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:09.676
Can't even use mobile phones in
New York City classrooms right now,

00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:12.716
whereas if you come to a place
like the Natural History Museum,

00:04:12.716 --> 00:04:14.896
or you go to the Wildlife
Conservation Society,

00:04:15.526 --> 00:04:19.426
not only do they have the assets
to teach about that subject matter,

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:22.446
but they can use the tools
and they can practice

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.406
and demonstrate the tools.

00:04:26.026 --> 00:04:30.356
We don't have enough positive
examples of what this means.

00:04:30.356 --> 00:04:33.966
We have a lot of discourse around it,
but we don't have a lot of concrete,

00:04:34.096 --> 00:04:36.616
positive examples of
how do you do this?

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:40.576
And that is our job right now; we
have to put that out in the world,

00:04:40.686 --> 00:04:43.756
so that the chancellors
and the principals

00:04:43.756 --> 00:04:49.096
and the teachers understand that
this isn't just about media arts

00:04:49.176 --> 00:04:52.566
and crafts, but it's about using
the tools to get to the content

00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:54.536
and the skills and the
competencies that they value.
