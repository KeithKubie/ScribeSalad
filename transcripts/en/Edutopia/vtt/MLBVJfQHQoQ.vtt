00:00:00.446 --> 00:00:04.136
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: Okay. How many activities
did you find out that she has?

00:00:04.576 --> 00:00:06.966
&gt;&gt;Ambar: Because of the
professional growth partners,

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:09.376
it makes me see things
in a different light.

00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:13.376
By sharing our practices and
providing feedback to one another,

00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:17.246
every educator in our
building has the capacity

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:19.406
to become the best educator they can be.

00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:22.906
&gt;&gt;So today, I notice a lot of
students working independently.

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:25.306
I have some questions.
If you notice here--

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.276
&gt;&gt;The vision of our school is
that all scholars can learn

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:37.376
as [inaudible] does not
determine your destination.

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:42.016
Every educator sees the responsibility
that they have to all students

00:00:42.196 --> 00:00:43.996
when teachers learn and grow.

00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:46.346
That benefits everyone in the building.

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:52.846
Our Peer Inter Visitation initiative is
a way to promote professional growth.

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:55.306
So we call each other
professional growth partners.

00:00:55.756 --> 00:01:00.916
And we have six weeks to go into each
other's classroom to observe and learn.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.496
&gt;&gt;Partner: Page 59.

00:01:02.826 --> 00:01:05.216
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: I mean, initially,
when you get anybody

00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:06.926
in your room, you get a little nervous.

00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:09.146
But when you're getting
observed from your colleagues,

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:11.116
I think there's more of,
like, a comfort level.

00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:15.156
And you learn best practices from
one another, so you see strategies

00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:17.086
that you can then implement
in your classroom

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:18.606
that could work for your
students as well.

00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:21.276
&gt;&gt;Ambar: See, I'm going to give
you the opportunity to read page 60

00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:26.686
and annotate important information
that helps us better understand Jazmin

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:29.236
and her relationship
with her family. Okay?

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:31.836
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: So usually, what we
do is we use our prep periods.

00:01:32.016 --> 00:01:35.376
Every week, I'll go to my
professional growth partner's room

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:37.936
for 15 minutes and then,
I'll take notes.

00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:42.146
&gt;&gt;Ambar: It's all objective. You're
just writing down what you see,

00:01:42.186 --> 00:01:45.706
that the students are saying and
doing, and what the educator is saying

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:49.166
and doing and you type
everything up in order to later

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.666
on provide the feedback with evidence.

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:56.796
&gt;&gt;Alexa: When I'm thinking about how
to pair teachers, I assign them based

00:01:56.796 --> 00:02:00.626
on their learning needs,
strengths, and also personality.

00:02:00.926 --> 00:02:04.526
Jennifer is really great
at setting up small groups.

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:07.506
That's a need Ambar may have
and then, I want Jennifer

00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:10.256
to see how Ambar's annotating texts,

00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:12.466
because that's something that'll
support her in her practice.

00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:17.976
&gt;&gt;Ambar: So my annotations were that mom
was not very loving, but also, grandma--

00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:20.146
&gt;&gt;Student: So the mom
followed the grandma.

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:22.686
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: So when I went
into Ms. Quinones' room,

00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:26.536
I was looking to see the literacy
skills and how to apply them in math.

00:02:26.536 --> 00:02:29.466
I noticed Ms. Quinones was
modeling annotations in math.

00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:33.226
When we problem solve, we also need
to make annotation markings as well.

00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:35.926
&gt;&gt;Ambar: So now, you guys are
going to have a chance to read it

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:38.466
on your own and continue annotating.

00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:42.076
&gt;&gt;Ambar: So when I observe Ms.
Negron, in order to prepare to walk

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:45.626
into her classroom and get the
best out of the experience,

00:02:45.716 --> 00:02:48.456
I make sure that I check
what we have spoken before.

00:02:48.636 --> 00:02:51.926
Every week, then, we build on
the suggestions that we have.

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:55.126
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: So how is your triad doing?
&gt;&gt;Student: Good.

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:57.346
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: So you guys
solved the problem already?

00:02:57.546 --> 00:03:01.176
&gt;&gt;Ambar: So after the 15-minute
observation every week, we sit down

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:03.216
and debrief using the TAG form.

00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:06.486
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: TAG is-- the T stands
for tell something you like.

00:03:06.596 --> 00:03:08.846
&gt;&gt;I noticed that you were
modeling how to annotate,

00:03:08.846 --> 00:03:11.166
and I really liked how you
were, like, here's my evidence

00:03:11.196 --> 00:03:12.956
in the text that supports this.

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:14.896
&gt;&gt;The A is to ask a question.

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:16.996
So maybe we didn't understand
what the kids were doing

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.886
or why a certain group
was given something.

00:03:19.216 --> 00:03:20.636
So we ask a question for clarity.

00:03:20.716 --> 00:03:23.966
&gt;&gt;Are the questions ever
differentiated for your small group?

00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:25.916
&gt;&gt;Ambar: Some chapters have
front-loaded questions.

00:03:26.156 --> 00:03:28.576
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: The G is to give a
suggestion. So what is one thing

00:03:28.576 --> 00:03:30.266
that they can work on
that is attainable?

00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:33.186
&gt;&gt;And that's actually great
that you said that because one

00:03:33.186 --> 00:03:35.296
of my suggestions was
maybe you can give students

00:03:35.296 --> 00:03:37.696
in your small group the question
ahead of time so that they can--

00:03:37.696 --> 00:03:39.476
&gt;&gt;Ambar: Definitely, it's
very useful, the feedback.

00:03:39.616 --> 00:03:42.316
At the end, you have
that concrete next step

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:44.196
of this is something that you can do.

00:03:44.466 --> 00:03:48.026
We always e-mail the TAG form
because we want that person to have

00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:50.776
that as a reference and
we CC Ms. Sorden.

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:54.996
&gt;&gt;Alexa: So it allows me to be a part of
the conversation, and it also allows me

00:03:54.996 --> 00:03:58.336
to provide resources to help
them meet their next step.

00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:01.500
It's about learning. It's
not about evaluation.

00:04:02.046 --> 00:04:03.926
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: It's definitely
opened my eyes to things

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:07.206
that I don't necessarily see when I'm
in the classroom every day with kids

00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:09.406
and it has helped me grow as a teacher.

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:12.096
We've created an environment
where we feel safe

00:04:12.096 --> 00:04:14.146
with each other. It's
respectful feedback.

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:18.316
&gt;&gt;Ambar: It's part of our school
culture. So just by opening the doors

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:20.936
of their classroom, it's--
there's a bigger picture to this.

00:04:21.146 --> 00:04:23.116
It's about how you could
improve teaching,

00:04:23.286 --> 00:04:26.276
which would ultimately
help students learn.

00:04:26.686 --> 00:04:28.486
&gt;&gt;Ambar: Bye. 
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: Bye. Thank you.
