00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.090
Anyone who grew up with Disney movies knows
that they can get pretty dark, from Mufasa

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.690
getting trampled to death in The Lion King
to Quasimodo's mother being brutally killed

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.590
in The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Still, many
of Disney's animated classics have had to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.511
soften or remove the more gruesome or depressing
aspects of the fairy tales that they were

00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:29.610
based on. Make sure you let us know if we
forgot any in the comments below! Here is

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:37.890
Screen Rant's Dark Disney: Real Stories Behind
Popular Disney Films.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.050
Tangled

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.280
Disney's Tangled puts a different spin on&nbsp;Rapunzel's
charming prince, instead having the long-haired

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.010
heroine helped down from her tower by a thief
named Flynn Rider. In the original story,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.649
the escape never even takes place. Mother
Gothel discovers&nbsp;Rapunzel's plans and casts

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.180
her out into the desert, where she eventually
gives birth to twins and lives in misery for

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.710
years. Her handsome prince is tricked into
climbing the tower to find Gothel waiting

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.250
for him at the top. She throws him from the
tower into a thorn bush that pokes out his

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.680
eyes. The poor prince is also left to wander
for years, completely blind and surviving

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.840
only by eating grass and roots. The lovebirds
eventually meet and Rapunzel cures his&nbsp;blindness

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.830
with a magic tear and they live happily ever
after - and probably both pretty traumatized.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.830
Pinocchio

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.760
You might think that Disney's version of Pinocchio
is dark enough already - especially the scene

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.880
where a bunch of misbehaving children get
horribly transformed into donkeys. Still,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.199
Pinocchio makes it out alright by the end
of the film with the help of his good friend

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:43.750
- and conscience - Jiminy Cricket. What happens
to the lovable Jiminy Cricket in Carlo Collodi's

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.349
original novel? Well, he doesn't get a chance
to sing about wishing upon a star. When the

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.200
talking cricket shows up to offer Pinocchio
a bit of moral guidance, Pinocchio immediately

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.899
murders him with a mallet, and is haunted
by the ghost of the dead cricket throughout

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:57.899
the rest of the book.

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:58.899
The Little Mermaid

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:59.899
Hans Christian Andersen is also the writer
behind The Little Mermaid, which Disney adapted

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:00.899
in 1989 and sprinkled with some classic songs,
a great villain, and a characteristically

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:01.899
happy Disney ending. The original story is
considerably more depressing. After the Little

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:02.899
Mermaid is given human legs, every step she
takes feels as though the soles of her feet

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:03.899
are being stabbed with knives. To make matters
worse, the prince ends up marrying someone

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.899
else and never finds out that the Little Mermaid
was the woman who saved him from drowning.

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:05.899
The Little Mermaid is given a chance to get
her tail back by stabbing the prince in the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:06.899
heart, but she can't bear to kill him and
instead throws herself into the ocean and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.899
dies, her body dissolving into froth.

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:08.899
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:09.899
Like many animated Disney films, early classic
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ends with

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.899
the villain getting a deadly comeuppance.
After trying unsuccessfully to kill Snow White

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.880
several times, the evil Queen falls off a
cliff, gets crushed by a boulder and then

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.730
vultures descend to feed on her corpse. It
doesn't get any darker than that, right? Well,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.010
in the Brothers Grimm version of the story,
the Queen is forced to put on a pair of glowing

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.530
hot iron shoes and dance in them until she
dies. Suddenly falling off a cliff doesn't

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.530
sound so bad.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.530
Sleeping Beauty

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.410
A handsome, charming prince is a common trope
of Disney movies, and they're usually the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.469
perfect gentleman. In Disney's Sleeping Beauty,
Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip meet each

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:36.469
other and fall in love in the forest, and
Phillip later rescues Aurora from an enchanted

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:37.469
sleep. It's a lot more romantic than 17th
century author Giambattista Basile's version

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:38.469
of the story, in which the Sleeping Beauty
is discovered by a passing king. Instead of

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:39.469
breaking the spell, he rapes the sleeping
woman and then leaves, forgetting all about

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:40.469
her. The poor girl wakes up nine months later
after giving birth to two children, with no

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.469
idea what happened.

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:42.469
Cinderella

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.469
After being forced to play servant to her
wicked stepmother and ugly stepsisters, Disney's

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:44.469
Cinderella is eventually rewarded with a handsome
prince and a royal castle to live in. But

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.319
in the Brothers Grimm version of the story,
Cinderella's stepsisters are so desperate

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.290
to get the glass slipper on that they cut
off bits of their feet to try and make it

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.269
fit. It works, but all the blood kind of gives
them away. To make matters worse, when the

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.939
stepsisters attend Cinderella's wedding, birds
descend on them and peck out their eyes. Apparently

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.939
birds have a very low tolerance for brats.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:04.939
Frozen

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.290
Disney's tale of two sisters, Frozen, is very
loosely based on a book called The Snow Queen

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.569
by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen.
In the original version of the story, a demonic

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.819
troll creates a looking-glass that reflects
even the most beautiful things back as being

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.620
ugly and hideously distorted. When the mirror
is accidentally shattered, the pieces scatter

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.540
all over the world and splinters of glass
land in people's hearts, turning them cold

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.989
and cruel, or in their eyes, making them incapable
of seeing beauty. One unfortunate little boy

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.499
gets a splinter in his heart and his eye,
corrupting him so much that he runs away to

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:38.010
live with the powerful Snow Queen. This fairy
tale does at least have a happy ending, but

00:03:38.010 --> 00:04:59.430
it doesn't have a happy snowman.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.400
