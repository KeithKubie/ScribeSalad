1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.120
The general gun experience. Look,

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.660
fucking Trump just pass something and no one wants to give him credit for this.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.820
He stuff was the kidney stone. He did.

4
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:12.660
He did wonderful stuff for kidney transplant stuff. I'm sure he pushed through.

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.890
Well that was going to say that he absorbed all the student loans for disabled

6
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:19.110
veterans. Fantastic. I love it.

7
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.270
You don't hear a word about it and where to praise. Look,

8
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.630
we should absolve student loans for fucking everyone. We're crippling kids.

9
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.950
We're crippling the 1718 year old kids who sign up for these fucking loans and

10
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:32.160
they get compromised to the point where we have people to this day right now

11
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.160
that are getting their social security money,

12
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.240
their social security money's getting docked because they owe student loans.

13
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.560
They're at the end of the fucking road. What do you do? What do you do? Uh,

14
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.900
and this is a real question. This is not rhetorical.

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.720
What do you do about the feeling of fairness?

16
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.340
The people that work their way through college waiting tables?

17
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.090
That's a good question. Working really hard. And then they, uh,

18
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.480
do we just say their feelings, which I think is valid, which is,

19
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.990
yeah, yeah, you got fucked on this, but let's help someone else out.

20
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.650
What are we here? Compassion. Here's the goods. You know, um, uh,

21
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.270
there are people that worked really hard to not have student loans and there are

22
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:16.710
people that took them. Um,

23
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.960
there has to be somebody who took them prevalently 100%. I think quite a few.

24
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.220
And I think it's also,

25
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.480
we also should pay attention to the human mind and the development of the human

26
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:28.710
mind and the frontal cortex.

27
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.430
And the frontal lobe does not develop properly until you're 25 years old. Right?

28
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.280
Right. So some, somewhere in that restaurant minus four years,

29
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:37.410
definitely out 17, it's definitely not 18 months.

30
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.250
So you're taking on these fucking loans. You, you, you,

31
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:44.040
you can't be trusted with money or your future or thinking about what the fuck

32
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:47.610
you're doing in terms of like taking on a debt of hundreds of thousands of

33
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.780
dollars doing this also ties in, um, uh, with,

34
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.980
with bisexual stuff as well.

35
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.320
Don't we have to decide when someone's adult and then give them that respect.

36
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.560
Yes. We have to say you're 18 years old.

37
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.640
We can't control what decisions you make. Yes.

38
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.690
And one is that you're going to be, cause I think 25 is too old.

39
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.320
I think 25 is too old as well. But I think what we're saying is, I mean look,

40
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.140
there's a lot of 18 year old people that make very good moral decisions. Yes.

41
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.820
And we should, we should praise that.

42
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.030
Here's the problem with the student loan thing. In terms of the fee,

43
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.830
that's the only loans that you never get exonerated from.

44
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.290
You can get bankruptcy, right? And you can get exonerated. You can,

45
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.710
you could escape the loans of credit cards,

46
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.900
the debt of mortgages.

47
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.930
You could escape a bad business collapsing and owing millions and whatever you

48
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.620
get. You could escape that through bankruptcy.

49
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.620
You cannot do that with student loans. It's a corrupt system.

50
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.100
You take a child who's trying to learn a trade or trying to learn a profession

51
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.980
and you acquire insane debt that's going to track you and cripple you for the

52
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:02.050
rest of your life and no matter what happens to you, you owe that money.

53
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.200
<v 1>But also you're taking your colleges out of the free market too by giving those,</v>

54
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.880
by giving those loans easily. Yes. And by having government help, yes.

55
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.140
You're also, you're also taking away the free market because you know,

56
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.000
we found out that when you put the free market in like LASIK surgery,

57
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.900
when insurance doesn't cover it, it gets wicked cheap. You know?

58
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.110
And if colleges had to be paid as people went without easy loans to get,

59
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.550
and if colleges did not get government money, they might be wicked cheaper.

60
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.640
I think they would be really, really expensive.

61
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.710
I think the expense is crazy expensive.

62
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.800
<v 0>I think the real solution is in treating education like a thing that's going to</v>

63
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:48.670
make our society better.

64
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.720
And think of it as the same way we think about the fire department.

65
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.703
Same way you think about,

66
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.720
<v 1>please don't you think that, I mean when you read the paper,</v>

67
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.310
there's always one whole thing about colleges getting too expensive and people

68
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:03.030
can't go.

69
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.740
Did they keep that and then you turn 20 pages later in the paper and there's an

70
00:04:07.741 --> 00:04:12.300
article about how online learning is going to happen is happening and all this

71
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:13.134
stuff is going to happen.

72
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.010
Do you think that that idea of college is going to hold up for another 10 years?

73
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.380
I think there's an experience that people, I mean, did you go to college?

74
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.120
<v 0>Well I did, but I went to college in my town. I went to UMass Boston and uh,</v>

75
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:27.120
I really only went because I didn't want to be a loser.

76
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.580
It was really all it was. I was, uh,

77
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.600
doing martial arts and fighting and traveling all over the world or all over the

78
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:37.230
country rather. And, and thinking about doing standup at the time as well.

79
00:04:37.231 --> 00:04:40.590
And then transitioning to doing standup while I was also still taking classes,

80
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.800
I was learning nothing. It was a complete waste of time.

81
00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:45.390
I was only doing it so I could say, yeah,

82
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.600
taking classes at UMass Boston and I was barely paying attention,

83
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.060
barely showing up. And um,

84
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.080
it was just a thing that I didn't want to tell people that I wasn't going to

85
00:04:55.081 --> 00:04:59.010
college. Like that was the number one reason why I did it, but I, but that was,

86
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.850
I had a unique life from the time I was, uh, you know,

87
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:05.940
graduating from high school to the time I started doing standup.

88
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:09.330
I was obsessed with martial arts and competing and that's all I wanted to do is

89
00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:11.640
make the Olympic team for TaeKwonDo. That's what,

90
00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:13.260
that was my goal and that's what I was trying to do.

91
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.600
So I wasn't a normal person.

92
00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:19.990
I wasn't like I wasn't going to go to Ohio and fucking travel over there and

93
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.890
take a full course load and not be able to pursue what I wanted,

94
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.083
what I wanted to do.

95
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.280
<v 1>Oh, so you've got a window. I think politically it's fairly small.</v>

96
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.300
<v 0>No, there was no scholarships for TaeKwonDo, doesn't, it didn't exist.</v>

97
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.090
And the only other option was the army. There was a dude,

98
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.890
I think his name was clay, Barbara's,

99
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.610
this really talented guy was a fighter who was, uh, on the U S team,

100
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.930
had one point in time I think. And he was a competing through the army.

101
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.930
Like they, they had subsidized his training somehow or another.

102
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:52.210
And I was thinking maybe I should join the army, like those, the other,

103
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.350
the only other thing that I was thinking about doing, but um, for people,

104
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:58.490
I think there's a thing about getting away from your parents,

105
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.220
getting away from them, getting away from their influence,

106
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:03.950
being wild and crazy and be with a bunch of other kids and trying to find

107
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:08.180
yourself. And I think that comes from traveling to a place and going to college.

108
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.520
And I think there's, there's some benefit in that.

109
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.750
And I have friends that have had great benefit in that sort of a transformative

110
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:16.580
experience of being on a campus,

111
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:20.180
a physical campus in a place that's outside of their hometown where it gives

112
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:22.790
them this new experience where they get to try to reinvent them.

113
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:26.480
So they're still got a book that people do that being able to be someone else.

114
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.180
But I wonder, I wonder if all of that,

115
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.860
why are we giving that a four year period? Why isn't that our whole lives?

116
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.930
It can know. It could be and should be.

117
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:37.800
And isn't that the way that's going to change?

118
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.790
Because people aren't having jobs for their whole life anymore. And by the way,

119
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.790
the liberal arts education was never supposed to teach people a trade, right?

120
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:50.791
It was always supposed to make it so that young men could talk in parties.

121
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.940
We could have the same cultural thing. We can tell about Shakespeare.

122
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:57.530
We can talk about this, we can talk about that.

123
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.970
But none of this was meant to give people jobs. Well, it's so rigid, right?

124
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:03.290
You get out of high school,

125
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:06.770
high school was this torturous affair where you're being a square peg,

126
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:08.390
they're trying to shove into a round hole.

127
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:11.480
Then you get out and then they fly off to wherever the fuck you're going to go

128
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:16.481
to school and you go there and you're forced with this overbearing workload of

129
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:19.370
school and then social things.

130
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:22.460
You're trying to figure out what's okay and what's not okay now where's the safe

131
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:24.760
space and well am I, what am I?

132
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:27.740
Am I allowed to say this and am I allowed to say that?

133
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:30.890
And what are the new rules now for this new generation or are we really gonna

134
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.733
change the world?

135
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.220
And then all of a sudden you're out in the world and you realize that fucking

136
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.840
money that you spent or that loan that you got is not getting you a job and

137
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:42.470
you're fucked and you can't get a job and you're also massively in debt and

138
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:45.680
severely depressed and trying to figure out your future. I mean,

139
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.990
Mindy go on Adderall and then you're like,

140
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.000
we're setting people up. We're setting people up for a horrible failure.

141
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.780
I am with Bernie Sanders in that I think education should be free and I don't

142
00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:58.580
think that's a bad thing. I think you should earn it.

143
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.630
I think you should have to earn it.

144
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.620
How bout if education is really cheap?

145
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.460
Like everything else is getting cheaper? Well, I mean, TVs are really cheap,

146
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:09.590
more expensive.

147
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.860
I think we can pay for it with taxes maybe wrong or the individuals could pay

148
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:16.250
for it. Maybe the individual is cheap and if it made sense, if it made sense.

149
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.150
I mean, if you want to learn something now we know this very well.

150
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:25.130
If you want to learn anything now you can get it for free on the web.

151
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.850
You definitely can't do many things. I mean, other than physical things,

152
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.850
there's a lot of physical things that you need to be taught by a coach.

153
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.300
I think there's a lot of things you can learn online and even the physical

154
00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:40.250
things, you can get a big chunk of it from online tutorials. I mean let's,

155
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.520
let's talk about all that matters. Okay. Let's talk about juggling. You know,

156
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.850
I grew up as a juggler when you were doing the TaeKwonDo,

157
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:48.260
I was juggling all the time.

158
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.500
That's all I did and that was my whole life was juggling.

159
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.980
And what happened was with the internet juggling gut

160
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.090
<v 1>tremendously better because people could watch videos of things they knew were</v>

161
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:03.720
possible and get better. If juggling get better.

162
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.310
Physics certainly can.

163
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.610
It seems like you can take a course at any college online and if you sincerely

164
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:14.580
want to learn, you know, I don't know if we need to have this, what is,

165
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.960
what is the term called when the,

166
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.400
when the Amish take their one year of Rumpelstiltskin assessment.

167
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.010
I'm spraying Rumspringa, I'm spraying,

168
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:28.220
I don't think we need a nationally tax subsidized rum spring for every person in

169
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:32.370
the country. I don't think that it is. Right. Yeah. You go to college,

170
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.070
well you just described you do the dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

171
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.650
It seems like live your fucking life.

172
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.750
There isn't this four year magic period or there's two year magic period and go

173
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:46.530
out and learn the stuff you want to learn. I mean, um, you know,

174
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:49.560
we both have children and they'll be talking about going to college and of

175
00:09:49.561 --> 00:09:51.930
course my, my not of course,

176
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:56.910
but my wife will push very hard for college and my thinking is anything they

177
00:09:56.911 --> 00:10:01.890
want to learn, they can, they can just learn it. You know, by the way,

178
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:06.690
this was also true with just the libraries in local towns.

179
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.020
It's just more true now. It's even easier now. You know,

180
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.220
I can't imagine growing up where my,

181
00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:18.300
my son can type in Lenny Bruce and it all just pops up. Right? I mean,

182
00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:20.940
that was amazing. Store order it, order it.

183
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.600
They didn't grip into Gribbins music store in Greenfield,

184
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:28.770
Massachusetts did not have the Carnegie hall concert right there in the stacks.

185
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.830
I had an order, Oh, Frank Zappa,

186
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.690
I'm back a one of his records mentions Lenny Bruce and he's on Sergeant pepper.

187
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.340
I guess I should learn about him. Um, uh, let me write that down.

188
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:43.050
That's how I learned about Terence McKenna.

189
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:46.050
I learned about Terence McKenna from listening to a bill Hicks record. Yeah,

190
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.030
yeah. I was like, who's this McKenna and what's a heroic dose? And at,

191
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.480
at Frank Zappa, one of his records, I forget what year it is,

192
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:58.170
I think it's freak out, but it might be absolutely free. Says on the back.

193
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:02.850
Do not listen to this song until you've read Franz Kafka in the penal colony.

194
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.350
Ah, I got the record, opened it up. It said that I listened to one side,

195
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:12.300
got to that song, got on my bike, rode down to the Greenfield public library.

196
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.250
Kafka. I've got this written down. Kafka in the penal colony. Sat there,

197
00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:18.840
Reddit went back, listen to the record.

198
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.730
My entire education starts with Mike Nesmith of the monkeys who said,

199
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.750
listen to Zappa.

200
00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:29.640
Listen to Hendrix from Zappa to Lenny Bruce from Lindy Bruce to the whole world.

201
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.640
And I believe that, uh,

202
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.830
that is available to everybody all the time. I mean, I don't know,

203
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:42.480
as I would say tax players should pay for college. I think I would say,

204
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.610
do we need college? Isn't that fade in a way?

205
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.870
I think there's a real benefit to being in a classroom with a brilliant

206
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:53.350
professor. Yeah. Yeah. I think there is, but we're also seeing with Ted talks,

207
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:58.060
which I know are jive, but there is a, there's always, you know,

208
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.660
their job, there can be a lot of jive Ted talks. There's some jive Ted talks.

209
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:02.350
Yeah. Yeah.

210
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:07.350
But what I'm saying is I went to one of the first Ted conferences and

211
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.680
[inaudible] and got to hear, um, you know, um,

212
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.970
all these credible people speaking.

213
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:19.540
It was mind blowing and I wasn't college age. I was, you know,

214
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.720
I was whatever I was 45 or something 40 and it was,

215
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.230
it was an amazing spirit. Jonas Salk, you know,

216
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.540
I sat and listened to Jonas salt talk.

217
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:33.340
I been in a room with brilliant people speaking and it's really,

218
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:37.420
really great. But I think we can,

219
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.560
we can deliver that cheaper. And that's the side that Bernie Sanders,

220
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.780
I want to talk about. It's not,

221
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.980
can we give endless amounts of money to these fucking people on college

222
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:48.814
campuses?

223
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.870
Can we pay them all the money in the world to take our children and give them

224
00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:56.650
something to do in between smoking dope? Could we rather just say,

225
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.330
can't we make this experience cheap enough so that anybody can go and experience

226
00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:02.680
it? Why don't you, why?

227
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:07.681
Why isn't it possible for you for a few bucks to go and be in a room with a

228
00:13:08.051 --> 00:13:08.884
brilliant person?

229
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.970
I think that would be a thing that would be beneficial to almost anybody at any

230
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:16.780
point in time instead of the rigid structure of like, you know, this is you.

231
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:19.930
You know, you have to get all this work done by X amount of time.

232
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.520
That's the other thing that happens to kids too.

233
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.840
They're taught about having no sleep and about beating your body up and about

234
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:30.370
cramming and about getting all this work done in a short period of time.

235
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:30.850
They're really,

236
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.060
we're really preparing them for a horrible job and all this shit that doesn't

237
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:36.220
work. You know, all that weird,

238
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.620
that weird kind of hazing shit that we do for medical professionals.

239
00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:46.060
You're going to work for fucking never weren't saying it's terrible for the

240
00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:48.880
patient. It's were bad for everybody, you know?

241
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:53.140
So my wife and you just made the argument about the frontal cortex and you're

242
00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:53.974
not really ready to,

243
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.480
you're 25 and what are the huge advantages I had in my life was a shitty,

244
00:13:58.481 --> 00:14:03.370
shitty education, horrible education. You know, I went to a bad, bad,

245
00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:08.320
bad public school that had an influx of hippies from UMass that came in and

246
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.790
experimented on us. So we had no education whatsoever.

247
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:15.700
I graduated from high school and a plea bargain.

248
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.550
I had very good, um,

249
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.730
S a T so I had scholarships to wherever I wanted to go,

250
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:24.610
but I chose not to because I misunderstood Bob Dylan.

251
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:25.660
I didn't know he was lying.

252
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.440
So I went and hopped trains and hitchhiked around and lived homeless for a

253
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.090
couple of years and I never read Moby Dick till I was 45. Thank you.

254
00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.990
If I'd read Moby Dick when I was supposed to, would call the judge,

255
00:14:37.991 --> 00:14:39.310
I wouldn't have gotten it.

256
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.900
But I was able to get it at the right age and now it's my favorite book cause I

257
00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:45.100
was ready for it. You know,

258
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.930
there's so many things that are on the curriculum that are very, very important.

259
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:51.950
Maybe not that day.

260
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.930
I think there's also an issue with people not thinking of education in terms of

261
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.610
like that it's a lifetime for sure. Yeah.

262
00:14:59.611 --> 00:15:02.720
It's not something that you graduated from college and then you're done.

263
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.380
We really should be educating ourselves throughout life and not just

264
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.140
accidentally or incidentally by experiences.

265
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.760
We should do it because there's things that we pursue that are interesting. Yes.

266
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.090
Now is one of the greatest times ever to do that because of audio books.

267
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.800
You can do it while you're in the car.

268
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:20.180
You could do it while you're on the train.

269
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.730
You can get educated and you can also,

270
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.440
they're doing this weird connecting thing where I've not experimented with this,

271
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:32.441
but I'd love to where people take courses online and then find people who are

272
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:37.541
also taking courses online in their communities and then meet it like a fucking

273
00:15:37.551 --> 00:15:42.080
Starbucks to discuss what happened before, uh, in the class,

274
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:46.010
which is mind blowing that that can happen. So you can take, you know, uh,

275
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.590
one of my huge,

276
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.220
I mean one of the things I wanted to do was I wanted to learn to play jazz on

277
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.450
me, play upright bass.

278
00:15:53.451 --> 00:15:57.680
I took that up at 45 and I learned to play upright bebop base.

279
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:02.690
Passably a huge accomplishment. And now I really want to learn a language,

280
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:04.160
you know, so I was looking at a little bit,

281
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:09.161
cause I figured maybe there's a government watch list I'm not on,

282
00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.360
so I should learn Arabic

283
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.030
cause don't you think that that takes all the boxes that's going to give me

284
00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:19.220
everything if I just learn Arabic.

285
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.870
So I started looking into how I can learn how I can learn, uh,

286
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.910
Arabic and uh,

287
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:31.150
it's amazing the kind of network that's developing all over the world to be able

288
00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:37.480
to learn anything. So my argument with you, uh, on the, on the, uh,

289
00:16:37.481 --> 00:16:41.360
on the Bernie thing of paying for everybody's college is I think we can get

290
00:16:41.361 --> 00:16:46.340
college so fucking cheap. You can go to college your whole life. Well,

291
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.620
I don't think that's a bad idea. You know,

292
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:50.210
if it's possible to get college that cheap,

293
00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:52.340
but I don't want professors to be poor. I mean,

294
00:16:52.341 --> 00:16:55.550
I think one of the real problems we have a Pudge with public education is that

295
00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:59.150
people don't want to be a teacher because Patriot teachers don't get paid much.

296
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.090
Sure. But there's a, there's a way, there's,

297
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.670
I would say that's government intervention that's doing that.

298
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.060
I would say if you government intervention is keeping the salary low.

299
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.080
I think so. Really?

300
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:13.880
I really think so because I think that we're not having enough of the of the of

301
00:17:13.881 --> 00:17:18.840
the of the competition is stuff. I mean, um, you know, you,

302
00:17:18.841 --> 00:17:22.670
you would pay good money to be in a room with the Steven Pinker, you know,

303
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:26.720
and I think that locally, this was always a problem that I never figured out.

304
00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:31.340
You know, when I was in Greenfield, Massachusetts, a town of 20,000,

305
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.140
I would say to all the other, uh, by other high school students, I would say,

306
00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:36.974
you know,

307
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.040
if we didn't give her money to the rolling stones and the Beatles and Dylan and

308
00:17:43.101 --> 00:17:44.270
all these other bands,

309
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.140
we could pull our buddy together and have a really good local band.

310
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.070
We could have a great band

311
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.140
<v 0>right here in town. You know,</v>

312
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.920
and I think that if you thought of education that way,

313
00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.720
can't we get in our little area really great teachers, you can teach this stuff.

314
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:02.460
It might be pretty boss. Well,

315
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:06.840
it'd be amazing if we could spread education right through any, any method,

316
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:09.480
whatever we can do, if we can encourage people to be more educated.

317
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:13.440
But I think that one of the best ways to do it really is just, look,

318
00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:15.930
there's a lot of podcasts that are educating people.

319
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.970
There's a lot of information that you can get and it's minor, but it's,

320
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.260
what we're getting is there's more information available now than ever before.

321
00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:28.890
I think it's very different than what colleges traditionally is a thing where

322
00:18:28.891 --> 00:18:31.320
you go and it's a Rite of passage. It's like,

323
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.370
and we don't have those in this world. And I think we could do with them.

324
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.360
I think we could do with these rights, particularly for young men. I don't mean,

325
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.730
and maybe it's the case for young women, obviously I never was one,

326
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:43.950
but when you're a young man,

327
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:48.000
there's this transitionary period where you're a boy and then all of a sudden,

328
00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.530
am I a man yet? Like when am I a man? Certainly a lot of, a lot of cultures,

329
00:18:52.531 --> 00:18:54.390
religions has done that.

330
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.960
Getting thrown into getting that certificate and getting your diploma.

331
00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:02.190
Holy shit, I graduated from fucking university. I'm a man now.

332
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:06.900
I am a grown up. I have a degree. I am a woman now. I have a degree.

333
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.580
I am an adult. And you're obviously, you know, uh, I'm, I'm seeing this,

334
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.780
you know, it's okay to speak with an accent. It's not okay to hear with one. Uh,

335
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:21.560
I'm hearing that from someone who spent an awful lot of time explaining to

336
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:25.020
myself and others why I didn't go to college. You know,

337
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:29.040
you wanted to show you weren't a loser. I didn't have that.

338
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.670
I didn't say I went to Ringling brothers Barnum Bailey greatest showrunner of

339
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:36.180
clown college. You know what I mean? If you want a big shore,

340
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.320
you don't get respect. That's where you go. Well, I'd say I talk about,

341
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.170
it's just cause I want people to really know where my head was at.

342
00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:46.500
I don't want to like glorify college.

343
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.280
I went without any Rite of passage at all. Right. You know,

344
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:54.300
and the closest I had to a right of passage was earning my living. Well,

345
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.840
the true shoot. You were also, you were on a different pursuit.

346
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.440
Like your pursuit was the Carney pursuit and you enjoyed that. I mean,

347
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:04.850
there was like a, you have how to lust for it, you know,

348
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.000
it obviously worked out well.
