00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.310
Voiceover: So let's
talk a little bit about

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.901
how we all came into being.

00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:08.568
What we see right over
here, this is a picture

00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:14.575
of a sperm cell fusing with an egg cell.

00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:17.502
So that's a sperm cell
and this is an egg cell

00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:21.244
or we could call this an ovum.

00:00:21.244 --> 00:00:23.907
And even this scene
depicted right over here,

00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:28.169
this is the end of an
epic competition because

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.910
this sperm cell is one
of one of two to three

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.179
hundred million that
is vying for this ovum.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:38.509
So there's two to three hundred
million of these characters

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:43.369
and they're all vying
for this ovum and the one

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:45.045
that you see that's about to fuse for it,

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.575
this is the winner of this incredibly -

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:49.701
remember two to three hundred,

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:54.571
200 million to 300 million
sperm are trying to get here

00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:57.640
so this is a major
victory and to some degree

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.703
we should all feel pretty
good about ourselves

00:01:00.703 --> 00:01:03.112
because we are all the by-product of that

00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:07.174
one in 200 to 300 million sperm cells

00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:11.700
that won this race getting
to our mother's ovum.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.876
So the sperm cell came from
our father and the egg cell,

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:18.716
this is all happening
inside of our mothers,

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:21.181
the egg cell is from our mother.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.972
Now, once this happens,

00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:24.911
let's talk a little bit
about the terminology.

00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:29.450
So once these two fuse, or
the process of them fusing,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.197
we call that fertilization.

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:37.303
Fertilization.

00:01:39.238 --> 00:01:42.233
And it produces a cell
that then differentiates

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:45.443
into all of the cells of our body,

00:01:45.443 --> 00:01:47.575
so you can imagine that this
is an important process.

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:49.767
So let's make sure that we
understand the different

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:53.042
terminology, the different
words for the different things

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:56.837
that are acting in this process.

00:01:56.837 --> 00:02:01.844
So each of these sex cells,
I guess we could say,

00:02:01.844 --> 00:02:05.776
the sperm cell and the ovum,
these are each called gametes.

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:11.305
So this right over here is a gamete

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:13.312
and the ovum is a gamete,

00:02:13.312 --> 00:02:17.101
the egg cell is also a gamete.

00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:21.350
And as we'll see, each
gamete has half the number

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.903
of chromosomes as your
body cells or most of

00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:30.445
the somatic cells of your body
so outside of your sex cells

00:02:30.445 --> 00:02:35.708
that might be in your
ovaries or your testes,

00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:38.498
depending on whether
you're male or female,

00:02:38.498 --> 00:02:40.644
these have half the number

00:02:40.644 --> 00:02:43.777
so let's dig a little bit
deeper into what I mean there.

00:02:43.777 --> 00:02:46.708
So let's just do a blow up

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:51.438
of this sperm cell right over here,

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:54.301
so a blow up of a sperm cell and I'm not

00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:56.301
going to draw it to scale,
you see the sperm cell

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.242
is much smaller than the egg cell but just

00:02:58.242 --> 00:03:01.845
to get a sense, so let me draw the nucleus

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:05.842
of this sperm cell, so just like that.

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:08.378
If we're talking about a
human being, and I'm assuming

00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:10.433
you are a human being, so that might be

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:13.567
of interest to you, this will have 23

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:16.452
chromosomes from your
father so let's do them.

00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:18.969
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.325
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:25.681
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:29.370
and for the 23rd one, that's going to be

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.504
your sex-determining chromosome

00:03:31.504 --> 00:03:34.378
so if your father contributes an x,

00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:36.641
you are going to be female,

00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:39.580
if your father contributes a y,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.300
you are going to be male.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.638
So these are the chromosomes in

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:47.365
the male gamete or I guess
I should say the gamete

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:50.175
that your father's
contributing, the sperm.

00:03:50.175 --> 00:03:53.902
So this is a gamete right
over here and that's going to

00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:57.908
fuse with the egg, the ovum
that your mother is contributing

00:03:57.908 --> 00:04:00.577
and once again, I'm not
drawing that to scale.

00:04:00.577 --> 00:04:06.247
So this is the egg, and
let me draw it's nucleus.

00:04:06.247 --> 00:04:07.510
So that's it's nucleus, once again

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.648
none of this is drawn to scale.

00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:12.441
And your mother is also going
to contribute 23 chromosomes.

00:04:12.441 --> 00:04:15.646
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:17.635
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

00:04:17.635 --> 00:04:21.443
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

00:04:21.443 --> 00:04:25.174
and then she will
contribute an x chromosome

00:04:25.174 --> 00:04:28.177
for the sex determining
so your sex determining

00:04:28.177 --> 00:04:30.978
chromosomes are going to be
xy, you're going to be male,

00:04:30.978 --> 00:04:33.970
if this was xx, you're going to be female

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.514
so this is also a gamete here.

00:04:36.514 --> 00:04:41.441
So a gamete is the general term
for either a sperm or an egg.

00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:49.647
Now once these two things
are fused, what do we have?

00:04:49.647 --> 00:04:53.247
Once they're fused,
then we're going to have

00:04:53.247 --> 00:04:55.379
you could say a fertilized egg

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.109
but we are going to call that a zygote

00:04:57.109 --> 00:04:58.766
so let me draw that.

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:00.513
I'm going to do this in a new color,

00:05:00.513 --> 00:05:02.108
and I'm running out of space
and I want this all to fit

00:05:02.108 --> 00:05:09.301
on the same screen so I'll
draw it not quite at scale

00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:11.244
and so let me draw the
nucleus of the zygote,

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:13.839
I'm going to make the nucleus
fairly large so that we can

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:15.377
focus on the chromosomes in it,

00:05:15.377 --> 00:05:17.512
once again none of this is drawn to scale.

00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:19.376
So you're going to have the 23 chromosomes

00:05:19.376 --> 00:05:22.310
from your father, so let me do that.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.241
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:31.372
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

00:05:31.372 --> 00:05:38.633
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23,

00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:40.771
and then the 23 chromosomes
from your mother.

00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:48.589
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:53.578
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

00:05:53.578 --> 00:06:02.969
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.773
so you got that x
chromosome from your mother.

00:06:05.773 --> 00:06:08.771
And as you might have notice,
I've drawn them in pairs

00:06:08.771 --> 00:06:10.841
so you now have a total,
let me make it clear,

00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:13.643
you have 23 chromosomes here,

00:06:13.643 --> 00:06:18.975
23 chromosomes in the sperm,

00:06:18.975 --> 00:06:25.512
you have 23 chromosomes in the egg

00:06:25.512 --> 00:06:30.444
and now you have 46 chromosomes
in the fertilized egg,

00:06:30.444 --> 00:06:33.846
46 chromosomes, and now that we have

00:06:33.846 --> 00:06:36.902
a full contingent of chromosomes

00:06:36.902 --> 00:06:39.707
and then this cell can
now keep replicating,

00:06:39.707 --> 00:06:41.707
keep splitting and
differentiating into all of what

00:06:41.707 --> 00:06:44.971
makes you, you, we call
this right over here,

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:49.300
we call this a zygote.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.171
So one way to think about it,
the gametes are the sex cells

00:06:53.171 --> 00:06:55.371
that have half the number of chromosomes

00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:58.370
and the zygote is the cell
that's now ready to differentiate

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.909
into an actual organism
that has double the number

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:04.367
or that has a full
contingency of chromosomes,

00:07:04.367 --> 00:07:07.500
that has 46 chromosomes, and you see that

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.433
I've made them in pairs and these pairs,

00:07:09.433 --> 00:07:11.166
we call these homologous pairs

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:12.779
and in each of these pairs,

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:25.179
this is a pair of homologous chromosomes.

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:26.835
So what does that mean?

00:07:26.835 --> 00:07:29.448
Well that means that in
general, these two chromosomes,

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:32.109
you got one from your
father, one from your mother,

00:07:32.109 --> 00:07:36.578
they code for the same
things, they code for the same

00:07:36.578 --> 00:07:39.774
proteins but there are different
variants of how they code

00:07:39.774 --> 00:07:43.579
for those proteins, those
traits that you have

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:46.236
so gross oversimplification is,

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:52.901
let's say that there is a gene on,

00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:56.367
that one from your father
that helps code for hair color

00:07:56.367 --> 00:07:57.970
well there would be a similar,

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.372
there would be another
variant of that gene

00:08:00.372 --> 00:08:02.512
on the chromosome from your mother

00:08:02.512 --> 00:08:05.038
that helps code for hair color as well.

00:08:05.038 --> 00:08:06.713
So these are homologous chromosomes,

00:08:06.713 --> 00:08:10.178
these two chromosomes code, in general,

00:08:10.178 --> 00:08:13.843
for the same things and
so the zygote now has,

00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:16.437
you could say it has 46
chromosomes or you could say

00:08:16.437 --> 00:08:20.444
it has 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes.

00:08:20.444 --> 00:08:23.312
And this is, once again, this
is the case for human beings.

00:08:23.312 --> 00:08:25.501
If we're talking about some
other species, instead of

00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:29.238
23 pairs of homologous
chromosomes or 46 chromosomes

00:08:29.238 --> 00:08:31.840
in total, you might be
talking about 10 pairs of

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.509
homologous chromosomes with
20 chromosomes in general.

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:41.707
Now to help biologists, to
help clarify when they're

00:08:41.707 --> 00:08:43.173
talking about the number
of chromosomes for

00:08:43.173 --> 00:08:46.236
a given species, they introduce two words,

00:08:46.236 --> 00:08:49.433
haploid and diploid.

00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:52.506
And haploid is referring
to when you have half

00:08:52.506 --> 00:08:56.174
the full contingency of chromosomes.

00:08:56.174 --> 00:09:01.307
So for human beings, the
haploid number is 23.

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:11.771
So, this is the haploid number, it is 23.

00:09:11.771 --> 00:09:14.233
For another species it
would be something else

00:09:14.233 --> 00:09:18.770
and haploid is based on the prefix "hapl",

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:24.041
that's the prefix for single,
so you have a single member

00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:25.645
I guess you could think of it,

00:09:25.645 --> 00:09:29.240
of each of the pairs and now you have both

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.845
of each pair, you have
both chromosomes in each

00:09:32.845 --> 00:09:37.512
pair or you have the full
contingency and this 46 chromosomes,

00:09:37.512 --> 00:09:45.033
this is called the
diploid number for humans.

00:09:45.033 --> 00:09:47.448
The diploid number right over here.

00:09:47.448 --> 00:09:49.776
And when people talk in general,
and we will speak in general

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:52.633
when we start talking
about mitosis and meiosis

00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:55.911
for a given species they will
refer to the haploid number,

00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:59.042
they will refer to the haploid
number as n chromosomes

00:09:59.042 --> 00:10:01.839
and they will refer to the
diploid number as just twice that,

00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:04.979
as two n chromosomes.

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:08.380
So hopefully this gets you familiar
with some of the vocabulary

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.705
around fertilization
and haploid and diploid

00:10:11.705 --> 00:10:14.577
and zygotes and gametes
and also makes you feel

00:10:14.577 --> 00:10:17.777
a little bit better about
yourself that, just to exist,

00:10:17.777 --> 00:10:20.903
at least half of your
chromosomes had to win

00:10:20.903 --> 00:10:24.903
an incredibly competitive race.
