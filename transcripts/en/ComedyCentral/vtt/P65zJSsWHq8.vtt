00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.604
AND THE MANAGER
OF BUGS "A" TO "Z,"

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:05.038
A PEST-CONTROL COMPANY

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:07.341
BASED OUT OF WOODLAND HILLS,
CALIFORNIA,

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.343
AND HE'S DESPERATE
TO EXPAND HIS BUSINESS

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:12.379
BEYOND THE RESIDENTIAL
HOMES HE NORMALLY SERVICES.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.316 line:0%
 
- IT'D BE GREAT IF, I MEAN,
WE LAND ANY KIND OF HOTEL WORK.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:19.286 line:0%
 
- JAVIER WANTED A CONTRACT
WITH A MAJOR HOTEL,

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:21.788 line:0%
 
AND I HAD THE PERFECT METHOD
TO WIN HIM THAT DEAL.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.958
RATHER THAN MAKING IT
LOOK LIKE THE HOTEL HAS

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.761
AN EXTERMINATOR VISITING,
WHY DON'T YOU INSTEAD

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.898
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE HOTEL
IS WINNING AN AWARD?

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.268
- RIGHT.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:37.638
- EVERY HOTEL'S GREATEST FEAR IS
HAVING TO HIRE AN EXTERMINATOR,

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:39.973
BECAUSE THEIR ARRIVAL
IS BASICALLY AN ANNOUNCEMENT

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.042
THAT THE HOTEL HAS PESTS,

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.144
SO IF JAVIER COULD DISGUISE
HIS PURPOSE

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.080
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE HE'S THERE
TO GIVE THE HOTEL AN AWARD,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.715
HE'D NOT ONLY DELIGHT GUESTS,

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.984
BUT SURELY WIN A CONTRACT
WITH THE HOTEL

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.921
THAT WANTS TO KEEP
THEIR PEST PROBLEM A SECRET.

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:57.357
- NOW, HOW--I MEAN,
DO I SHOW UP WITH--

00:00:57.357 --> 00:01:02.062
I MEAN, I JUST--
I-I--AS FAR AS, I MEAN--

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.164
- IF CUSTOMERS SEE YOU
COMING IN,

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.699
THEY'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA BE LIKE,

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:08.101
"OH, THIS HOTEL
IS REALLY GOOD,"

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.703
YOU KNOW, RATHER THAN SEEING
AN EXTERMINATOR

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:12.606
AND BEING LIKE,
"OH, THIS HOTEL IS NOT SO GOOD."

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:15.142
- [laughs]
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:16.777
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A BUSINESS MAJOR.

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:20.614
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:22.216
- JAVIER WAS ON BOARD
WITH THE CONCEPT.

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.651
SO, TO SELL THIS TO A HOTEL,
I NEEDED TO SHOW THEM

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.120
EXACTLY HOW THE SYSTEM
WOULD WORK,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.389
SO I HAD ONE OF JAVIER'S
SERVICE VANS REWRAPPED

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:33.193
TO LOOK LIKE A DELIVERY VEHICLE
FOR THE HOTEL EXCELLENCE AWARDS,

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:36.496
A VERY PRESTIGIOUS ORGANIZATION
THAT I MADE UP.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:39.233
THEN JAVIER AND I WORKED
TO DEVELOP A DISCREET METHOD

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:41.802
FOR EXTERMINATING
EVERY ROOM IN A HOTEL.

00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:44.338
LIKE, SOME SORT OF SECRET...
- A COMPARTMENT

00:01:44.338 --> 00:01:46.340
OR OR AN OPENING.
- COMPARTMENT THAT OPENS UP.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.408
WITH THE SYSTEM NOW IN PLACE,
I GOT PERMISSION

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:51.979
FROM THE HISTORIC MAYFAIR HOTEL
TO SHOOT A DEMONSTRATION VIDEO

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.816
OF OUR METHOD THAT WE COULD THEN
PRESENT TO THEIR MANAGEMENT.

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:58.185
IT BEGINS BY ARRIVING
IN OUR COVERT VEHICLE,

00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:00.687
THEN REMOVING WHAT LOOKS
LIKE A LARGE TROPHY

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.890
THAT'S BEING AWARDED
TO THE HOTEL.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.858
THIS SERVES A DUAL PURPOSE
OF BOTH GETTING

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:07.494
OUR EQUIPMENT INSIDE,
AND IMPRESSING GUESTS,

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.930
AS THEY SEE THAT THEY'RE
CURRENTLY RESIDING IN THE HOTEL

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.332
WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT
OF BEDBUGS.

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.902
- WITH THE LEAST BEDBUGS?
- YEAH.

00:02:14.902 --> 00:02:17.104
- SO IT'S A POSSIBILITY
OF SOME BEING THERE.

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:18.272
- WE'RE JUST DELIVERING
THE AWARD,

00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:19.806
WE DON'T KNOW.
- OH, OKAY.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.709
- THEN, WE MAKE OUR WAY
INTO THE PRIVATE BACK OFFICES

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.578
WHERE WE CAN SAFELY REMOVE
ALL OUR GEAR

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:27.281
WITHOUT ANYONE SEEING.

00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:30.417
ONCE THAT'S DONE,
WE CONVERT OUR AWARDS TABLE

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:32.386
INTO A CUSTOM-DESIGNED
MAID CART,

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:36.957
AND I CHANGE MY OUTFIT
TO LOOK NATURAL PUSHING IT.

00:02:36.957 --> 00:02:39.693
THE HOLLOWED-OUT INTERIOR
THEN ALLOWS JAVIER TO TRAVEL

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:41.962
FROM ROOM TO ROOM
WITHOUT DRAWING ANY SUSPICION

00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:43.163
FROM HOTEL GUESTS.

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:46.767
[beeps]
YOU OKAY IN THERE?

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:48.669
- YEAH.

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.304
- WHEN WE GET
TO AN INFESTED ROOM,

00:02:50.304 --> 00:02:53.106
THE CART BLOCKS THE DOORWAY
AND JAVIER IS ABLE

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:55.375
TO SNEAK OUT
WITHOUT ANYONE SEEING.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.812
A QUICK HANDOFF OF THE VACUUM
THEN GETS OUR EQUIPMENT INSIDE,

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:00.214
AND JAVIER CAN GET TO WORK

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:02.549
SPRAYING DOWN
THE PEST-RIDDEN AREAS.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.085
ALTHOUGH WE DIDN'T
FIND ANY IN THIS HOTEL,

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:07.354
JAVIER TOLD ME HE OFTEN
ENCOUNTERS MATTRESSES

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:09.256
THAT GET SO INFESTED
WITH BEDBUGS

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:10.657
THEY HAVE TO BE THROWN OUT.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.759
SO I ALSO WANTED TO SHOW
THE HOTEL MANAGER

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.062
THAT WE HAD A METHOD
TO SECRETLY DISPOSE OF ONE

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:18.198
WITHOUT GUESTS THINKING
ANYTHING FISHY WAS GOING ON,

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.268
AND SINCE THE MAYFAIR CATERED
TO A LOT OF ASIAN CLIENTELE,

00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:24.204
THE PERFECT COVER
WAS OBVIOUS.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.828
IN THE GUISE
OF AN IMPROMPTU CELEBRATION,

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:49.496
WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE
A MATTRESS

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:52.165
STRAIGHT THROUGH THE LOBBY,
AND ONCE OUTSIDE,

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:55.302
ALL IT TOOK WAS A QUICK
IDENTITY CHANGEOVER

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:58.939
TO KEEP EVERYTHING
LOOKING NORMAL TO ONLOOKERS.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:01.041
THEN, IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE,
WE'RE GONE,

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:02.676
WITHOUT ANYONE EVER KNOWING

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:05.612
THE HOTEL HAD A PROBLEM
WITH PESTS.

00:04:05.612 --> 00:04:08.248
SO LATER THAT WEEK,
I WAS HOPEFUL OUR SALES VIDEO

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.851
WOULD BE ENOUGH TO WIN OVER
THE MAYFAIR MANAGER,

00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:12.920
MIKE SCHOEFFIN.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.923
- UNDERNEATH THAT DRAGON
IS OUR MATTRESS

00:04:15.923 --> 00:04:19.059
THAT WAS COVERED WITH BEDBUGS,
INFESTED WITH BEDBUGS.

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:22.062
- AND YOU CAN SEE WE'VE BEEN
DEVELOPING A NEW METHOD

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:26.600
OF SPRAYING THE PUBLIC AREAS
USING A BLIND MAN'S CANE.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.869
SO TO GUESTS,
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE,

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:32.206
"OH, THERE'S A BLIND MAN
STUMBLING AROUND THE LOBBY."

00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:34.942
- RIGHT.
- SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ABOUT.

00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:36.076
- AND ONCE OUR SALES VIDEO
WAS DONE,
