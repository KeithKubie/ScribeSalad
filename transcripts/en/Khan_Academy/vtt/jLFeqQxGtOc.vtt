00:00:00.388 --> 00:00:02.116
Voiceover:In an experiment
aimed at studying

00:00:02.116 --> 00:00:05.376
the effect of advertising on
eating behavior in children,

00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:08.697
a group of 500 children,
seven to 11 years old

00:00:08.697 --> 00:00:10.918
were randomly assigned
to two different groups.

00:00:10.918 --> 00:00:13.664
After randomization, each child was asked

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:15.354
to watch a cartoon in a private room,

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:18.903
containing a large bowl
of goldfish crackers.

00:00:18.903 --> 00:00:21.853
The cartoon included
two commercial breaks.

00:00:21.853 --> 00:00:24.237
The first group watched food commercials,

00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:26.648
mostly snacks while the second group

00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:28.142
watched non-food commercials,

00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:29.744
games and entertainment products.

00:00:29.744 --> 00:00:32.352
Once the child finished
watching the cartoon,

00:00:32.352 --> 00:00:35.413
the conductors of the experiment
weighed the cracker bowls

00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:38.238
to measure how many grams
of crackers the child ate.

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.533
They found that the
mean amount of crackers

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.149
eaten by the children who
watched food commercials

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.571
is 10 grams greater than
the mean amount of crackers

00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:49.370
eaten by the children who
watched non-food commercials.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.472
Let's just think about what
happens up to this point.

00:00:52.472 --> 00:00:56.731
They took 500 children

00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:58.690
and then they randomly assigned them

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.300
to two different groups.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.083
You have group one over here

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:03.871
and you have group two.

00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:06.473
Let's say that this right
over here is the first group.

00:01:06.473 --> 00:01:08.791
The first group watched food commercials.

00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:11.009
This is group number one.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.150
They watched food commercials.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.164
We could call this the treatment group.

00:01:15.164 --> 00:01:16.459
We're trying to see what's the effect

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:19.603
of watching food commercials
and then they tell us.

00:01:19.603 --> 00:01:24.129
The second group watched
non-food commercials,

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:25.606
so this is the control group.

00:01:25.606 --> 00:01:29.931
Number two, this is non-food commercials.

00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:33.854
This is the control right over here.

00:01:33.854 --> 00:01:36.508
Once the child finished
watching the cartoon,

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:40.742
for each child they weighed

00:01:40.742 --> 00:01:42.262
how much of the crackers they ate

00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:44.343
and then they took the mean of it

00:01:44.343 --> 00:01:46.446
and they found that the mean here

00:01:46.446 --> 00:01:49.074
that the kids ate 10
grams greater on average

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:51.100
than this group right over here

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.797
which just looking at that
data makes you believe

00:01:53.797 --> 00:01:56.743
that okay, well something
maybe happened over here.

00:01:56.743 --> 00:01:59.422
That maybe the treatment from
watching the food commercials

00:01:59.422 --> 00:02:04.343
made the students eat more
of the goldfish crackers

00:02:04.343 --> 00:02:06.783
but the question that you
always have to ask yourself

00:02:06.783 --> 00:02:07.969
in a situation like this.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.643
Well, isn't there some probability

00:02:09.643 --> 00:02:11.255
that this would have happened by chance

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:14.510
that even if you didn't make
them watch the commercials.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.644
If these were just two random groups

00:02:16.644 --> 00:02:18.946
and you didn't make either
group watch a commercial,

00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:20.504
you made them all watch
the same commercials.

00:02:20.504 --> 00:02:23.527
There's some chance that
the mean of one group

00:02:23.527 --> 00:02:25.694
could be dramatically
different than the other one.

00:02:25.694 --> 00:02:27.782
It just happened to be in this experiment

00:02:27.782 --> 00:02:30.321
that the mean here that it looks like

00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:32.015
the kids ate 10 grams more.

00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:34.360
How do you figure out,
what's the probability

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.171
that this could have happened,

00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:40.752
that the 10 grams greater
in mean amount eaten here

00:02:40.752 --> 00:02:42.734
that that could have
just happened by chance.

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:45.909
Well the way you do it is
what they do right over here.

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:52.557
Using a simulator, they
re-randomize the results

00:02:52.557 --> 00:02:55.170
into two new groups and
measure the difference

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.076
between the means of the new groups.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.477
They repeated the simulation 150 times

00:02:59.477 --> 00:03:01.493
and plotted the differences given.

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:04.449
The resulting difference
is as given below.

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.500
What they did is they said, okay,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.322
they have 500 kids and each
kid, they had 500 children.

00:03:11.322 --> 00:03:17.201
Number one, two, three,
all the way up to 500.

00:03:17.924 --> 00:03:19.550
For each child they measured

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.879
how much was the weight of
the crackers that they ate?

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.127
Maybe child one ate two grams

00:03:25.127 --> 00:03:27.737
and child two ate four grams

00:03:27.737 --> 00:03:32.695
and child three ate, I
don't know, ate 12 grams

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:35.559
all the way to child number 500 ate,

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.378
I don't know, maybe they
didn't eat anything at all,

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:38.474
ate zero grams.

00:03:38.474 --> 00:03:41.553
We already know, let's
say the first time around.

00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:50.450
The first half was in the treatment group

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.438
when we're just ranking them like this

00:03:54.438 --> 00:03:56.348
and then the second,
they're randomly assigned

00:03:56.348 --> 00:03:58.551
into these groups and at the second half

00:03:58.551 --> 00:04:01.272
was in the control group.

00:04:01.272 --> 00:04:03.080
What they're doing now

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.591
is they're taking the same results

00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:06.058
and they're re-randomizing it.

00:04:06.058 --> 00:04:07.104
Now they're saying, okay,

00:04:07.104 --> 00:04:11.393
let's maybe put this
person in group number two

00:04:11.393 --> 00:04:14.859
and this person in group number two

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.576
and this person stays in group number two

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:20.328
and this person stays in group number one

00:04:20.328 --> 00:04:22.434
and this person stays in group number one.

00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:24.252
Now they're completely mixing up

00:04:24.252 --> 00:04:25.808
all of the results that they had.

00:04:25.808 --> 00:04:28.624
It's completely random
of whether the student

00:04:28.624 --> 00:04:30.271
had watched the food commercial

00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:31.514
or the non-food commercial

00:04:31.514 --> 00:04:34.915
and then they're testing what's the mean

00:04:34.915 --> 00:04:37.999
of the new number one group
and the new number two group.

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:41.033
They're saying well,
what is the distribution

00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:42.819
of the differences in means.

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.181
They see when they did this way

00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:47.025
when they're essentially
just completely randomly

00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:49.968
taking these results and putting
them into two new buckets.

00:04:49.968 --> 00:04:51.759
You have a bunch of cases

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.881
where you get no difference in the means.

00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:58.678
Out of the 150 times that
they repeated the simulation

00:04:58.678 --> 00:05:01.248
doing this little exercise here.

00:05:01.248 --> 00:05:05.062
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:07.923
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:05:07.923 --> 00:05:09.356
I'm having trouble
counting this let's see.

00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:13.628
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:05:13.628 --> 00:05:14.961
10, 11, 12.

00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:19.468
It's so small, I'm aging

00:05:19.468 --> 00:05:21.836
but it looks like there's
about, I don't know.

00:05:21.836 --> 00:05:23.519
High teens about 20 times

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:26.590
when there's actually
no noticeable difference

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.827
in the means of the groups

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:31.416
where you just randomly
allocate the results

00:05:31.416 --> 00:05:32.757
amongst the two groups.

00:05:32.757 --> 00:05:34.781
When you look at this, if it was just,

00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.330
if you just randomly put
people into two groups,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.207
the probability or the situations

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:46.966
where you get a 10 gram difference

00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:49.152
are actually very unlikely.

00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:51.923
Let's see, is this the difference?

00:05:51.923 --> 00:05:53.984
The difference between the
means of the new groups.

00:05:53.984 --> 00:05:57.090
It's not clear whether this
is group one minus group two

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.265
or group two minus group one

00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:02.074
but in either case the situations

00:06:02.074 --> 00:06:06.518
where you have a 10
gram difference in mean.

00:06:06.518 --> 00:06:10.161
It's only two out of the 150 times.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.097
When you do it randomly,

00:06:12.097 --> 00:06:14.969
when you just randomly put these results

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:15.956
into two groups,

00:06:15.956 --> 00:06:18.507
the probability of the
means being this different,

00:06:18.507 --> 00:06:22.210
it only happens two out of the 150 times.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.498
There's a 150 dots here.

00:06:23.498 --> 00:06:30.129
That is on the order of 2% or
actually it's less than 2%,

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:31.569
it's between one and 2%.

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:35.807
Let's say the situation
we're talking about.

00:06:35.807 --> 00:06:38.802
Let's say that this is
group one minus group two

00:06:38.802 --> 00:06:40.153
in terms of how much was eaten

00:06:40.153 --> 00:06:42.053
and so you're looking at this
situation right over here

00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:44.698
that that's only one out of a 150 times.

00:06:44.698 --> 00:06:50.608
It happened less frequently
than one in a 100 times.

00:06:50.608 --> 00:06:53.468
It happened only one in a 150 times.

00:06:53.468 --> 00:06:55.709
If you look at that, you
say well, the probability

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:56.800
this was just random.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.658
The probability of getting
the results that you got

00:06:58.658 --> 00:07:00.592
is less than 1%.

00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:03.858
To me and then to most statisticians,

00:07:03.858 --> 00:07:06.593
that tells us that our
experiment was significant,

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:09.256
that the probability of getting
the results that you got.

00:07:09.256 --> 00:07:11.218
The children who watched food commercials

00:07:11.218 --> 00:07:13.155
being 10 grams greater
than the mean amount

00:07:13.155 --> 00:07:14.434
of crackers eaten by the children

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:15.743
who watched non-food commercials.

00:07:15.743 --> 00:07:18.100
If you just randomly put 500 kids

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.610
into two different buckets
based on the simulation results

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.522
it looks like there's only,

00:07:23.522 --> 00:07:25.582
if you'd run the simulation a 150 times,

00:07:25.582 --> 00:07:27.994
that only happened one
out of the 150 times.

00:07:27.994 --> 00:07:31.557
It seems like this was
very, it's very unlikely

00:07:31.557 --> 00:07:33.131
that this was purely due to chance.

00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:35.579
If this was just a chance event,

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:38.953
this would only happen
roughly one in 150 times

00:07:38.953 --> 00:07:40.698
but the fact that this
happened in your experiment,

00:07:40.698 --> 00:07:42.725
it makes you feel pretty confident

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:44.576
that your experiment is significant.

00:07:44.576 --> 00:07:47.593
In most studies, in most experiments,

00:07:47.593 --> 00:07:49.311
the threshold that they think about

00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:53.593
is the probability of something
statistically significant.

00:07:53.593 --> 00:07:56.321
If the probability of
that happening by chance

00:07:56.321 --> 00:07:59.902
is less than 5%, this is less than 1%.

00:07:59.902 --> 00:08:02.764
I would definitely say that
the experiment is significant.
