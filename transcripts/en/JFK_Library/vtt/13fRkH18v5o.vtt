00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.380
- For him, the key decision on Vietnam

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.100
would have come in his
second and final term

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.450
when he can no longer run for reelection.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.510
Matters enormously.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.680
And then I would say that

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.250
I think he and his brother

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.140
saw this a little differently,
even in '62 and '63.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.080
I think Bobby...

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.660
Bobby was more hawkish.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.503
I think in the missile crisis,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.080
Jack was really the only one
in the room on the EXCOMM

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.060
who was totally committed to
seeking a political solution

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.150
to the missile crisis question.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.070
But even on Indochina,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.300
it seems to me that there is

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.210
some daylight between the two brothers.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.060
Now, last thing I'll say is, of course,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.530
that a surviving JFK,
it would have been...

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.840
I'm not wanting to say here

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.870
that it would have been easy for him,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.940
especially in domestic political terms,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.320
to withdraw from the war.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.550
But I think he ultimately would have

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.953
if the alternative is massive escalation.
