00:00:00.697 --> 00:00:03.148
- [Voiceover] It's super
valuable in biological systems

00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:05.226
to be able to take a glucose molecule

00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:06.677
and to phosphorylate it.

00:00:06.677 --> 00:00:08.325
So let's start with a glucose molecule

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:10.419
and phosphorylate it, and the reason why

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.497
is once you have this phosphate group--

00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:15.039
let me make sure I put that
charge right over there.

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.396
Once you have this phosphate group,

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:18.778
or once you have this negative charge

00:00:18.778 --> 00:00:20.693
on this glucose six phosphate,

00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:22.829
it becomes much harder
for it to leave the cell.

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.720
The cell wants to hog as many
glucose molecules as it can.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.032
When the glucose isn't charged,

00:00:27.032 --> 00:00:29.272
it's able to pass through
the cellular membrane,

00:00:29.272 --> 00:00:30.909
but then once it becomes phosphorylated,

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:32.534
it's going to stay in the cell.

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:34.659
And glucose six phosphate right over here,

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.737
this is a very important input

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:40.951
to a whole series of
processes inside of cells.

00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:44.956
Now unfortunately, this reaction

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:47.011
of taking glucose and phosphorylating it,

00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:49.611
it requires energy, it's endergonic,

00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:51.527
it's not going to happen spontaneously.

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:54.174
It has a positive delta-G.

00:00:54.174 --> 00:00:57.830
It is ender, ender,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.850
it is endergonic.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.096
And so you can imagine
what we're going to need

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:03.187
to make it happen.

00:01:03.187 --> 00:01:06.321
We're going to have to use the
energy currency of the cell,

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:08.539
our good friend ATP.

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.617
And the way that we're going
to make this reaction happen

00:01:10.617 --> 00:01:12.997
is we're going to couple
what's essentially,

00:01:12.997 --> 00:01:14.924
you could view it as a hydrolysis of ATP,

00:01:14.924 --> 00:01:16.839
although we won't have
exactly a water molecule

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:18.035
in the mechanism,

00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:20.566
but what's functionally
the hydrolysis of ATP

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.400
into ADP and a phosphate group.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.524
Which is very energetically favorable.

00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:25.999
It is exergonic,

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.798
it would happen spontaneously

00:01:27.798 --> 00:01:29.307
under the right conditions.

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:30.480
It won't just always happen

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.059
inside of an solution,

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:34.505
it needs a little bit of
activation energy or an enzyme

00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:36.305
to lower the activation energy,

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.905
but the net reaction, it is exergonic.

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:41.587
So what we can do is we can
couple these two reactions.

00:01:41.587 --> 00:01:44.524
And so when we couple the two reactions,

00:01:44.524 --> 00:01:45.998
when we couple the two reactions,

00:01:45.998 --> 00:01:48.153
we have ATP,

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:50.883
ATP plus glucose,

00:01:51.588 --> 00:01:53.732
plus glucose,

00:01:55.374 --> 00:01:56.303
reacting,

00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:58.195
and we use an enzyme,

00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:00.378
the general term for it is hexokinase,

00:02:00.378 --> 00:02:03.872
to facilitate this reaction,
to lower the activation energy,

00:02:03.872 --> 00:02:06.542
it's going to yield, it's going to yield

00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:10.512
glucose six phosphate, glucose,

00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:14.753
glucose-6-phosphate,

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:16.535
phosphate,

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.266
and ADP.

00:02:21.014 --> 00:02:23.725
And ADP.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.157
A-D-P.

00:02:26.157 --> 00:02:28.618
Now what's the delta-G for
this reaction going to be?

00:02:28.618 --> 00:02:30.290
Well it's a coupled
reaction, you can view it

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.774
as a combination of these two reactions,

00:02:32.774 --> 00:02:34.481
and so roughly speaking you can say,

00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:36.419
well, let's just add the delta-G's.

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:38.451
So if you add the delta-G's here,

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:39.519
you're going to get,

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.901
if you add this negative delta-G,

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:43.454
this exergonic and this positive delta-G,

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:47.471
you're gonna get -30.5 plus 13.8,

00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:51.952
that's going to be -16.7 kilojules,

00:02:51.952 --> 00:02:54.019
kilojules per mol.

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.339
And so this coupled reaction
is going to be exergonic.

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:59.150
Not quite as exergonic as hydrolysis,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.379
because now you're gonna be
using some of that energy,

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.317
but this can happen spontaneously,

00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:05.709
especially if you can lower
the activation energy enough

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.276
for it to happen.

00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:09.470
And so let's now look at the mechanism

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.573
of how it happens.

00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:13.232
Now without an enzyme, without an enzyme,

00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:15.774
the way that this reaction needs to occur

00:03:15.774 --> 00:03:18.537
is that you have an electron,

00:03:18.537 --> 00:03:20.336
you have an electron pair right over here

00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:21.927
on this hydroxyl group,

00:03:21.927 --> 00:03:24.957
and it needs to do what's
called a nucleophilic attack

00:03:24.957 --> 00:03:28.312
on this phosphorous right over here.

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:30.831
But without an enzyme, it's
gonna be very hard for it to do.

00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:32.746
It's gonna have a high activation energy

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:34.755
because it's going to be
impaired by all of this

00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:37.785
negative charge from these
oxygens right over here.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:39.108
You can imagine, electrons don't like

00:03:39.108 --> 00:03:40.455
going through a lot of negative charge,

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:42.312
they're repulsed by negative charge.

00:03:42.312 --> 00:03:43.972
So we're gonna need an enzyme

00:03:43.972 --> 00:03:45.690
to help facilitate this reaction,

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.206
to help lower the energy
to actually start it.

00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:52.969
Essentially get these
electrons out of the way.

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:54.513
And the enzyme, or the general term

00:03:54.513 --> 00:03:57.949
for the enzymes that do
this, is called hexokinase.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.461
And hexokinase, let me write this down.

00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:04.059
Hexokinase.

00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:07.791
And the way it does it
is it provides ions to,

00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:09.126
one way to think about it is to

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:11.669
keep these electrons over here busy.

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.188
And in particular, it has a magnesium ion,

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:16.510
a magnesium ion,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.764
right over here,

00:04:17.764 --> 00:04:20.631
and this is bound to the
rest of the hexokinase.

00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:22.407
Remember, this is all
happening in three dimensions,

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:24.891
So the hexokinase is
kinda wrapping around it,

00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:27.411
so these can keep these electrons busy,

00:04:27.411 --> 00:04:29.965
there's other ions on the hexokinase

00:04:29.965 --> 00:04:31.567
that can keep these electrons busy,

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:34.666
other positive ions keep
these electrons busy.

00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:36.524
And so these electrons can sneak in

00:04:36.524 --> 00:04:38.706
and do the nucleophilic attack.

00:04:38.706 --> 00:04:40.146
Remember, when we talk about enzymes

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:42.584
these are these protein, these protein,

00:04:42.584 --> 00:04:45.811
let me do the same color that
I wrote the hexokinase in.

00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:49.410
These are these complex protein structures

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.906
right over here, just like this,

00:04:51.906 --> 00:04:54.587
and so you might have the magnesium ion,

00:04:54.587 --> 00:04:57.082
and let me do that in that purple color.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:02.520
Just right over there, and then
maybe the glucose molecule,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.433
the glucose molecule gets
bound right over here,

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:08.371
and then maybe you have your ATP,

00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:10.739
it gets bound right, right over here,

00:05:10.739 --> 00:05:12.829
and I'm obviously, I'm just kind of

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:14.454
giving you an example,

00:05:14.454 --> 00:05:16.196
this isn't exactly what's happening.

00:05:16.196 --> 00:05:19.794
But by essentially wrapping
it with this positive charge,

00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:21.849
it's able to pull the electrons away

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.276
to help facilitate this
nucleophilic attack

00:05:24.276 --> 00:05:27.433
that needs to happen for
the reaction to proceed.

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:28.873
And so this bond right over here

00:05:28.873 --> 00:05:32.251
between this oxygen and this phosphorous,

00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:34.236
that is going to be,

00:05:34.236 --> 00:05:37.556
that is going to be this
bond right over here,

00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:42.262
and as this happens, then this character,

00:05:42.838 --> 00:05:46.342
then these two electrons can
be taken by this character,

00:05:46.342 --> 00:05:48.919
and so this oxygen

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.672
is this oxygen right over here,

00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:53.110
and now has a negative charge.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.596
And so what we've just resulted with

00:05:54.596 --> 00:05:58.137
is glucose-6-phosphate and ADP.

00:05:58.137 --> 00:05:59.715
And ADP.

00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:01.677
And it's energetically favorable,

00:06:01.677 --> 00:06:02.734
it's exergonic.

00:06:02.734 --> 00:06:03.871
It's going to happen,

00:06:03.871 --> 00:06:05.299
assuming that you have the enzyme there

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:08.074
to help distract these electrons,

00:06:08.074 --> 00:06:09.955
lowering the activation energy.

00:06:09.955 --> 00:06:10.976
And I know what you're thinking,

00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:12.950
we had this hydrogen right over here,

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.596
so this hydrogen should
be right over here still,

00:06:15.596 --> 00:06:17.152
and then another water molecule could come

00:06:17.152 --> 00:06:20.356
and nab the proton, the hydrogen proton,

00:06:20.356 --> 00:06:22.016
and so you're left once again

00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:25.058
with just the glucose-6-phosphate.

00:06:25.058 --> 00:06:26.811
So this, hopefully this gives you a sense

00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.808
of how reaction coupling occurs,

00:06:28.808 --> 00:06:32.476
and also a sense of how
ATP is actually useful.

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:33.730
When I first learned about ATP, I'm like,

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.775
okay, fine,

00:06:34.775 --> 00:06:36.416
it's, you know, it really wants to let go

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:39.365
of this phosphate group,
it's energetically favorable,

00:06:39.365 --> 00:06:41.698
but how is that actually used to,

00:06:41.698 --> 00:06:45.424
to drive things, to actually do,

00:06:46.513 --> 00:06:47.964
to do things in the system

00:06:47.964 --> 00:06:49.879
that might not be energetically favorable.

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:51.702
And hopefully this gives you
a sense of how it's done,

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:54.836
and also the importance of an enzyme

00:06:54.836 --> 00:06:57.048
in facilitating it.
