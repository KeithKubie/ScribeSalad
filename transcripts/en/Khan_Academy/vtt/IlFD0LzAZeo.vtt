00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.710
Liam opened a savings
account and put $6,250 in it.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.330
Each year, the account
increases by 20%.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.540
How many years will it take
the account to reach $12,960?

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.600
Write an equation that
models the situation.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.590
Use t to represent
the number of years

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.207
since Liam opened the account.

00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:22.790
So I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.430
and actually try to do
it on your own first.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.710
Try to write this equation
that models the situation

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.487
using the variable t in
the way they described.

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:31.070
And then actually
answer the question,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.297
how many years will it take for
the account to reach $12,960?

00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:37.630
Well, let's just think about it.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.750
So t is to represent
the number of years

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.260
since Liam opened the account.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.159
So let's just say it's
been 0 years since Liam

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:44.950
opened the account.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.290
How much is he going to have?

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.590
Well, he's just going
to have $6,250 in it.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.480
That's how much he starts with.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.219
Now, let's say it's
been one year since he

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.010
opened the account.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.510
How much will he have?

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.060
Well, he's going to
have $6,250 times--

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:08.880
or let's write it this
way-- plus 20% 6,250.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.180
It grows 20% every year.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.900
So this is how much he
started the year with,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.180
and then he gets another
20% of that 6,250.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.880
If we factor out
a 6,250, this is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.730
equal to 6,250 times 1 plus 20%,
or we could write that as 0.2.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:38.795
Which is equal to
6,250 times 1.2.

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:42.135
Now, how much is he going to
have at the end of two years?

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.385
Well, he's going to have the
same amount that he still

00:01:44.385 --> 00:01:48.890
had at the end of
one year, times 1.2.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.774
Because it grew by 20% again.

00:01:50.774 --> 00:01:52.440
So he's going to have
the amount that he

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.490
had at the end of
one year times 1.2,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:10.360
which is equal to 6,250
times 1.2, times 1.2.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.010
Which is equal to 6,250
times 1.2 squared.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.987
I think you might see
where this is going.

00:02:21.987 --> 00:02:24.320
Or I could even write it like
this, order of operations,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.160
you do the exponent first.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.530
So what about after three years?

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.360
So after three years, well,
we're just going to compound.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.140
We're going to multiply
by 1.2 once again.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.930
So then he's going to have 6,250
times 1.2 to the third power.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.340
And so after t
years, we're going

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.200
to multiply by 1.2
that many times.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.850
So after t years in his account,
he's going to have 6,250 times

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.880
1.2 to the t'th power.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.400
1.2 to the t'th power,
or to the t power.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.080
I don't want get
confused with the thing

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.430
that you use to take bites with.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.550
Anyway.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.220
So they say, write an equation
that models the situation.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.178
So we want to figure out
how many years will it

00:03:16.178 --> 00:03:18.210
take the account
to reach 12,960?

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.760
So we essentially
want to say, when

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.780
is the account
going to be $12,960?

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.490
Or we could write
12,960, when is

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:38.510
that going to be equal to
6,250 times 1.2 to the t power?

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.600
So that's the equation
right over there

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.390
that models the situation.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.960
And then we need to think
about how we can actually

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.330
go about solving this thing.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.970
Well, a natural thing is
to isolate the t variable.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.240
Let's divide both
sides by 6,250.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.920
So we could get-- and if
we flip the two sides,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:06.770
we could get 1.2 to the t power
is equal to-- well let me write

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:16.630
this, 12,960 divided by 6,250.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.399
And since they're
both divisible by 10,

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.230
why don't we divide
them both by 10?

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.770
So it's 1,296 divided by 625.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.450
And there's several
ways that you

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.320
could solve this
problem at this point.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.160
One way, if you feel
confident that this

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.545
is going to have an integer
answer right over here,

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:36.670
you could literally just
try to use your calculator

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.440
and multiply 1.2 enough times
to get whatever number this is.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.240
And so we could do it that way.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.240
And as we'll see, there's
a more systematic way

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.960
of doing it once you
learn about logarithms,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.126
and I'll do that at the end.

00:04:47.126 --> 00:04:48.560
But I'll do that
last just in case

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.840
you haven't been exposed
to logarithms yet.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.350
So you could literally
say-- so let me just

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.250
exit out of everything.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.550
So you could literally say OK,
let's see, 1,296 divided by 625

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.720
is this value.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.270
So let's see how many times
we have to multiply by 1.2.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.460
1.2 times 1.2 gets
us-- well, that

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.770
doesn't get us close enough.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.670
So let's try it three times.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.930
So let's take that same number.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.190
Let's just take
1.2, let's raise it.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.832
Let's raise 1.2.

00:05:24.832 --> 00:05:26.040
Let's just do it three times.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.397
Times 1.2 times 1.2.

00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:31.730
That still doesn't get us there.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.460
What if we were to multiply
by 1.2 one more time?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.990
Well, that actually
gets us there.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.020
And we just did
this by brute force.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.930
1.2 to the fourth power
will give us this value.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.585
So that's one way, kind
of a brute-force way,

00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:48.700
of figuring out that
t is equal to 4.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.439
Another way, this just might be
a little bit less intuitive, it

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.980
might jump out of
it, gee, this looks

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.530
like some type of a power of 5.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.400
We know that 5 to the first
is 5, 5 squared is 25,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.612
5 to the third is 125,
5 to the fourth is 625.

00:06:07.612 --> 00:06:09.570
And so you might recognize
this right over here

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.349
is 5 to the fourth.

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:12.890
And it's actually
a little bit harder

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.560
to recognize that
this right over here

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.360
is 6 to the fourth power.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.690
And this right over here is 6/5.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:26.440
So we could rewrite this as
6/5 to the t is equal to 6

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.320
to the fourth over
5 to the fourth.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:40.790
Which is the same thing as
6/5 to the fourth power.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.790
So here you'd say, well, 6/5 to
the t needs to be equal to 6/5

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.980
to the fourth power.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.070
t must be equal to 4.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.740
Now, this is nice
when you can recognize

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.740
that this is something raised
to the fourth power, which

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.680
isn't easy to do.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.526
Or if you know
this is an integer,

00:06:56.526 --> 00:06:58.150
and you can just keep
multiplying 1.2--

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.750
if you know it's a low integer.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.670
But the systematic
way of doing it

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.156
is to actually use logarithms.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.780
And there's many
videos on Khan Academy

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.977
about how to use logarithms.

00:07:05.977 --> 00:07:07.810
But if you're more
concerned with, well gee,

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.710
if I just want to figure
out 1.2 to what power

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.660
is equal to this thing,
what you would do--

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.720
and we prove this
in other videos--

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.940
is if you say, look, let's
take the thing that we want 1.2

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.730
to some power to be.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.105
Let's take the
logarithm of that.

00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:26.188
And actually, you could
take a logarithm any base.

00:07:26.188 --> 00:07:28.980
Your calculator tends to have
a natural log, which is base e,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.040
and a log base 10.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.210
We could just take
a log base 10.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.420
So let's do that.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:40.700
So we'll take the logarithm of
what we want to get to, 2.0736,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.620
and divide that by
the thing that we're

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.940
trying to take the power
of to get to this number.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.000
So divided by the
logarithm of 1.2.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.940
And once again, we prove this--
actually, I wanted to divide.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.239
So let me insert
division symbol.

00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:58.280
So once again, it might
look like a little voodoo

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:58.825
right here.

00:07:58.825 --> 00:08:00.450
We prove it in other
videos, but if you

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.940
wanted to use a calculator to
calculate things like this,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.610
because sometimes it won't be
a nice integer number of years.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.297
It might be 3 and
1/2 years, or it

00:08:07.297 --> 00:08:11.820
might be 7.1234 years,
whatever it might be.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.980
This will give you a
more precise answer.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.790
So what do you want to get to?

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.130
You want to get to 2.0736.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.660
What are you raising
to some power?

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.594
1.2.

00:08:20.594 --> 00:08:22.010
Divide the log of
the thing you're

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.030
trying to get to divided
by the log of what the base

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.010
that you're trying to raise to
a power, and you click Enter.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.680
And then you get--
so this is literally

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.679
another way of saying that
1.2 to the fourth power

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.451
is going to be 2.0736.

00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:38.159
So once again, if this
looks like voodoo,

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.617
you don't know what
logarithms are,

00:08:39.617 --> 00:08:41.406
we have videos on
Khan Academy on that.

00:08:41.406 --> 00:08:43.030
But there's multiple
ways to tackle it,

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.140
especially this problem
where the answer was

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:47.400
a little bit simpler.
