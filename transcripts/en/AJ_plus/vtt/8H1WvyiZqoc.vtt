00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
“First off, I want to know how you guys identify yourselves.”

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.360
“How do you identify?”

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.980
“Depends if we’re at TSA or not.”

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.500
Hi, I'm Yara.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.180
In episode 1 of this series, I explored a slice of Iran in Los Angeles, also known as “Tehrangeles.”

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.380
But now, I want to see how young Iranian-Americans are breaking down the stereotypes and assumptions

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.860
a lot of other people might have about us.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.920
There's a certain stereotype about Iranian-Americans, especially those in Los Angeles.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.740
“White BMW.”

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.040
That they’re rich, shallow and made for reality TV.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.240
“Ohhhhh, like a Persian.”

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.380
But I personally don’t relate to those depictions at all.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.620
I'm definitely not flashy. I mean, I wear the same pair of black pants every single day.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.760
But I do change my socks.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.220
And many young Iranian-Americans don’t relate to these stereotypes, either.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.820
Like Alex Shams, who grew up in L.A.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.560
He showed me a side of the Iranian-American community here that you don’t see on TV.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.880
And, surprise, he doesn’t have any gold chains or drive a white BMW.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.040
“We are in downtown Los Angeles, in the jewelry district.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.380
So there’s a lot of gold shops everywhere around us, and jewelry shops of all kinds,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.740
with a lot of Iranians working around here.”

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.680
Alex showed me how Tehrangeles extends far beyond its symbolic center in Westwood,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.760
and into downtown L.A.’s jewelry and garment districts.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.400
“Many Iranian merchants here, in the valley and many other places, they end up learning Spanish

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.040
because most of their clients, for example, are Spanish-speaking.”

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.680
“Oh my god.”

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.640
“I just want to hear a mixture of both:

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.980
“I found two Iranians who speak Spanish!”

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.780
“What do people misunderstand about the Iranian community in L.A.?”

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.460
“I think there’s a certain image that many people outside of Los Angeles have of Iranians,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.760
particularly because of shows like Shahs of Sunset which show this kind of really particular Westwood,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.260
rich Beverly Hills, L.A. Iranian that I think is definitely a part of the community,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.060
it’s definitely a part of what's happening, but it's so much more diverse than that.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.740
Both in terms of the neighborhoods that Iranians live in across the city,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.320
and the kinds of jobs they're doing, the kind of lifestyles they have, socio-economically.”

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.220
Alex is right. There are wealthy and working-class Iranians. Secular and religious Iranians.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.740
Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian and Baha’i Iranians.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.200
Just about every kind of Iranian you can think of lives in L.A.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.760
Including some incredible artists and musicians.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.240
“Sometimes I'll hear a melody, and it’ll be a melody that needs voice,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.960
but it won't sound good in English. So it needs to have Farsi words on it.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.620
Because the Persian language is so sweet and melodic.”

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.760
This is Chloe Pourmorady. She’s an Iranian-American Jewish musician who’s never been to Iran,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.780
but she’s fully in touch with her Iranian – or Persian – identity.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.580
“I feel so, so blessed to have been brought up here, because I think this is the closest place

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.380
outside of Iran that you can get to Iran.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.020
If you want to really immerse yourself in Persian culture, you can do that very easily in Los Angeles.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.840
People call me American, but it’s still something in my heart that doesn’t resonate so much.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.120
I feel in my heart the Persian is first.”

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.340
“Does your Jewish faith incorporate itself into your music?”

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.840
“Spiritually it does. I sometimes use text from the Torah.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.280
Very beautiful, very poetic texts, much like you would find in poetry of Rumi or Hafez or something like this.”

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.040
Chloe’s music is unlike anything I’ve ever heard.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.980
It’s part Persian, Jewish, Turkish, Greek and Balkan.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.220
“I remember I had a composition professor. He found out I was both Iranian and Jewish, he was very startled.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.260
He said, ‘You're Jewish? I thought you were Iranian,’ not thinking that it's possible to be both. Which it totally is.”

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.820
The Iranian Jewish community is a huge part of the Tehrangeles story.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.180
They’ve opened restaurants,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.960
…supermarkets...

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.000
…and even pharmacies. And that’s just a small taste of how they’ve shaped L.A.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.480
It was obvious to me  the “Shahs of Sunset” stereotype is really blown out of proportion.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.460
But there’s also another stereotype that young Iranian-Americans also have to grapple with.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.220
That of the dangerous, scary Middle Easterner.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.800
[screaming]

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.980
“Our biggest threat is now Iran.”

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.880
To talk about this, I caught up with Justin and Fatemeh Mashouf, an Iranian-American couple

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.500
who are also practicing Muslims.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.380
“Oh yeah, by the way, so Justin breakdances.”

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.660
Justin is half-Iranian, and in 2007 he traveled to Iran to make a documentary about breakdancing.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.320
It was his way of trying to bridge the gap between Iran and the United States.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.260
“Coming back to the U.S., I was interrogated at Homeland Security,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.280
and all of the footage that I had shot in Iran was confiscated from me.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.200
And I had to do multiple, extensive interviews with the FBI in order to regain the footage.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:29.120
It was a huge kind of blow, I think, to my own sense of feeling, being an American

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.840
because, all of a sudden, it was like, ‘What the hell are you doing?

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.360
You're treating me like a terrorist.’”

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.400
Iranian-Americans and other Middle Easterners are marked as “white” by the U.S. government.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.680
But a lot of us don’t agree with being labeled that way.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.480
Many like Justin have grown up with constant reminders that they are not white,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.080
especially after 9/11 and the “War on Terror.”

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.600
“College applications, job applications, Iranian-Americans are confronted with this question,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.700
‘What race are you?’”

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.000
“Even though I know I'm technically supposed to check ‘white,’ no, I'm not going to.”

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.160
“My whole life, I’ve always just put ‘other,’ and then put, you know, ‘Iranian-American.’

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.560
Even though people would see me as, like, ‘Whatever, you’re white, just put the Caucasian box.’

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.500
I would just, I would always say I'm biracial.”

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.400
“In the Iranian-American community, what is it like being, kind of, I guess I can say

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.280
a devout or a practicing Muslim?”

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.200
“I grew up in a Muslim household where, amidst all my cousins and aunts and uncles,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.000
we were the most Muslim of them.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.960
So I constantly had this struggle to figure out, like, well, how Muslim do I want to be?”

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.660
While most Iranians have a Muslim background, those in L.A. are predominantly secular.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.900
So life as a practicing Muslim here can sometimes be difficult.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.360
“If I'm going to wear hijab, it really creates a bind for me to be able to connect with Iranians.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.940
For the first time, with the travel ban, I feel like Iranians are kind of coming together

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.680
and saying no – as a people, we stand up and say that this is wrong.”

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.940
“We named him after he was born. We decided for Sajjad Ali.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:07.980
And it became very important for us that just because he can pass off as white,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.660
because he is three-quarters Persian, and because we want him to identify as Muslim,

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.520
that his name precedes all of that.”

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.240
There was one more thing I had to do while I was in L.A.:

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.300
get some amazing Iranian food.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.860
Alex recommended a place called It’s All Good House of Kabob, a restaurant you’d only find in Tehrangeles.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.400
Just look at the walls.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.760
This is the only place in America I’ve seen serve Isfahani biryani.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.600
It's kind of like a really flavorful Iranian lamb burger with lots of herbs and spices.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.320
“This is what happens when you try to eat for a camera.”

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.480
“Was there ever a moment in your life when you became more aware of your, sort of, Iranian identity?”

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.240
“When the U.S. invaded Iraq, I was at a school where there were actually no Iranians.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.700
People would call me ‘Saddam Hussein’ and ‘Osama bin Laden’ in the halls.”

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.500
“Oh my god.”

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.540
“The difference between an Iraqi, an Afghan, an Iranian or anything else didn't really matter.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.320
There was a kind of hatred towards Muslims, towards people who look Muslim.”

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.820
“I very much wanted to blend in, I didn't want to look different. I mean, obviously I had

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.460
these eyebrows and these facial features.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.480
Interestingly enough, yeah, the mustache just came out very quickly, I should say.”

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.580
“Hair developing quickly is a big theme with Iranians, I think.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.100
It’s the moment when you realize there's something different about you.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.240
That's when your whiteness suddenly falls apart.”

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:29.240
“Here’s the big question. Persian or Iranian or Iranian-American or something else?”

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:37.360
“I prefer to identify myself as Iranian, and often I specify Iranian from Los Angeles because I really do feel like

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.200
the fact that I'm from Los Angeles adds a certain dimension to my Iranian-ness

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.260
that for me is like powerful. This combination of people, this diversity that exists in Los Angeles,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.960
I think, has really shaped how I think about being Iranian.”

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.300
Talking to young Iranian-Americans in L.A., I’ve realized something:

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.900
Despite all the stereotypes and discrimination, a lot of us are actually embracing our Iranian-ness.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.540
It made me think about my own dual identity, as someone who didn’t grow up in Tehrangeles.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.800
I wanted to talk to my family about what they went through.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.980
And how that’s helped me become my own version of Iranian-American.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.020
So we've given you a little taste of L.A.'s Iranian community in the past two episodes,

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.760
but the truth is, there's little pockets of Tehrangeles all over southern California --

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.860
in Glendale, Irvine, Palos Verdes -- everywhere.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:26.480
In the next episode, though, we're heading back to northern California to interview my own parents.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.040
