but how do you you know make something

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390
but how do you you know make something
 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.639
but how do you you know make something
for the developing world and get them to

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649
for the developing world and get them to
 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.350

make a hundred dollar laptop and let's

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280
make a hundred dollar laptop and let's
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100
make a hundred dollar laptop and let's
get the government's to buy the laptops

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
get the government's to buy the laptops
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.170
get the government's to buy the laptops
on mass and give them you know one two

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
on mass and give them you know one two
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.149
on mass and give them you know one two
one one laptop per child and I thought

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
one one laptop per child and I thought
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.069
one one laptop per child and I thought
oh my gosh Nicholas figured out the

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079
oh my gosh Nicholas figured out the
 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.169
oh my gosh Nicholas figured out the
business model of course we became

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179
business model of course we became
 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.859
business model of course we became
nonprofit to do this business but then

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
nonprofit to do this business but then
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.270
nonprofit to do this business but then
it became my job to make the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
it became my job to make the
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.919
it became my job to make the
hundred-dollar laptop cost a hundred

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929
hundred-dollar laptop cost a hundred
 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.910
hundred-dollar laptop cost a hundred
dollars which you know it is a little

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
dollars which you know it is a little
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.429
dollars which you know it is a little
bit more expensive we could have hit 150

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
bit more expensive we could have hit 150
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.649
bit more expensive we could have hit 150
it's at 188 and there's reasons for that

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659
it's at 188 and there's reasons for that
 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.480
it's at 188 and there's reasons for that
and I can I can defend them but still

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
and I can I can defend them but still
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.370
and I can I can defend them but still
it's the lowest cost laptop ever made

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
it's the lowest cost laptop ever made
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.080
it's the lowest cost laptop ever made
the lowest power laptop ever made and

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
the lowest power laptop ever made and
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.209
the lowest power laptop ever made and
the greenest laptop ever made and all of

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219
the greenest laptop ever made and all of
 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.550
the greenest laptop ever made and all of
that comes from looking at it from the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
that comes from looking at it from the
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.469
that comes from looking at it from the
screen backwards the screen is what

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
screen backwards the screen is what
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.269
screen backwards the screen is what
people see when they see the laptop

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:50.279
people see when they see the laptop
 

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:51.830
people see when they see the laptop
there could be little green men inside

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
there could be little green men inside
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.559
there could be little green men inside
of electronics it wouldn't wouldn't make

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569
of electronics it wouldn't wouldn't make
 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.959
of electronics it wouldn't wouldn't make
any impact to somebody looking at the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
any impact to somebody looking at the
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.969
any impact to somebody looking at the
laptop the screen and the housing or

what we see and so if you can lower the

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:01.139
what we see and so if you can lower the
 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:04.429
what we see and so if you can lower the
cost of this screen and the electronics

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
cost of this screen and the electronics
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.199
cost of this screen and the electronics
behind it and lower the power

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209
behind it and lower the power
 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.169
behind it and lower the power
consumption you can deliver amazing

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179
consumption you can deliver amazing
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.840
consumption you can deliver amazing
results

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850
 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.780
the whole architecture the display most

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790
the whole architecture the display most
 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.860
the whole architecture the display most
displays have motherboards so the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870
displays have motherboards so the
 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.220
displays have motherboards so the
question was how do you make a display

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230
question was how do you make a display
 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.350
question was how do you make a display
that costs less than a hundred dollars

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360
that costs less than a hundred dollars
 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.480
that costs less than a hundred dollars
because that's a real barrier to $100

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490
because that's a real barrier to $100
 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.060
because that's a real barrier to $100
laptop and what what do you do with the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070
laptop and what what do you do with the
 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.500
laptop and what what do you do with the
motherboard it was very clear we had to

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510
motherboard it was very clear we had to
 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.270
motherboard it was very clear we had to
get rid of the hard disk right and moved

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280
get rid of the hard disk right and moved
 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.410
get rid of the hard disk right and moved
to what we call flash and use a smaller

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420
to what we call flash and use a smaller
 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.390
to what we call flash and use a smaller
processor skinny down the operating

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400
processor skinny down the operating
 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.350
processor skinny down the operating
system and also massively lower the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360
system and also massively lower the
 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.720
system and also massively lower the
power consumption but that really came

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730
power consumption but that really came
 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.130
power consumption but that really came
from choosing really noticing working

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140
from choosing really noticing working
 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.770
from choosing really noticing working
with with with the the chip manufacturer

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780
with with with the the chip manufacturer
 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.270
with with with the the chip manufacturer
I asked them a question I asked him

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280
I asked them a question I asked him
 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.490
I asked them a question I asked him
every month for about six months and

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500
every month for about six months and
 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.560
every month for about six months and
they finally answered this question how

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570
they finally answered this question how
 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.620
they finally answered this question how
much power does it take to just keep the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630
much power does it take to just keep the
 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.110
much power does it take to just keep the
screen on even if the pixels aren't

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
screen on even if the pixels aren't
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.449
screen on even if the pixels aren't
changing well the answer was 223 watts

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459
changing well the answer was 223 watts
 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.820
changing well the answer was 223 watts
and at that point I had reinvented a

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830
and at that point I had reinvented a
 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.830
and at that point I had reinvented a
screen that was you know one watt

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840
screen that was you know one watt
 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.440
screen that was you know one watt
instead of usual a usual screen this is

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450
instead of usual a usual screen this is
 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.130
instead of usual a usual screen this is
like seven watt power consumption and so

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140
 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.470
so I just thought that was stupid to

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480
so I just thought that was stupid to
 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.190
so I just thought that was stupid to
sort of keep a cpu on to you know

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200
sort of keep a cpu on to you know
 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.110
sort of keep a cpu on to you know
consume 2 to 3 watts plus the whole

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120
consume 2 to 3 watts plus the whole
 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120
consume 2 to 3 watts plus the whole
motherboard just to drive a screen with

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130
motherboard just to drive a screen with
 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.000
motherboard just to drive a screen with
the same pixels on all the time say

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010
the same pixels on all the time say
 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.620
the same pixels on all the time say
you're reading something and just the

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630
you're reading something and just the
 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.000
you're reading something and just the
pixels aren't moving around there's no

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010
pixels aren't moving around there's no
 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.130
pixels aren't moving around there's no
video on the screen everything's sort of

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140
video on the screen everything's sort of
 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.420
video on the screen everything's sort of
the same well it turns out that um I

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430
the same well it turns out that um I
 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.759
the same well it turns out that um I
know a lot about display but maybe the

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769
know a lot about display but maybe the
 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.509
know a lot about display but maybe the
people you know I didn't know this is

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519
people you know I didn't know this is
 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.920
people you know I didn't know this is
going to be so technical I'm just

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930
going to be so technical I'm just
 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.320
going to be so technical I'm just
wondering how to do a technical talk to

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330
wondering how to do a technical talk to
 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.570
wondering how to do a technical talk to
non-technical audience

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580
