1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,910
You got to start from a place,
put it like this.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,120
I don't know if you heard of this.
Greenville,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,820
where they want to take 70% of
anyone that makes over $10 million,

4
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:11,490
70% of their income. That's
hilarious. That's hilarious.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,590
It's the dumbest thing ever. AOC, right?
Yeah. It's the dumbest thing ever, right?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
I mean, I wasn't calling her a bitch.
No, no, no, no. That, I like her.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,400
Good luck pitch as expression.
Yes. I liked her too. I like her,

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,810
but I'll agree with her that,
but I like her,

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,230
but what I'm saying is my friend was
like, oh, you know, if the Democrats win,

10
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:34,290
that's going to get passed because
we hate rich people and I go,

11
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,940
that's the problem.
We're starting at hate.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,630
The reason why you think it's going to
pass because you think people hate rich

13
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:44,340
people see it and that's, you got to have
a conversation. Here's no, first of all,

14
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:48,510
you've got incompetent use of funds.
Like where does the money go?

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,180
Our techs were psycho
that if you tax the rich,

16
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,810
they're all of a sudden all the problems
will stop existing. That so silly.

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,390
You still have incompetent people
that are distributing the money.

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,310
They're just create more jobs.

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,270
There'll be more red tape and we
get one more in debt. Yeah. Well,

20
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,290
we've got to do is figure out a real
plan for engineering our civilization

21
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:10,440
better.
That's,

22
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,130
that's what people have to do and they
should be like real discussion from like

23
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:18,390
real experts, biologists, historians,

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,520
people who really understand
how psychologists,

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,630
people really understand human beings
really understand what's wrong with our

26
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:29,070
society today. And we have
an open discussion. But you
know, that never felt that.

27
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:31,890
But that can never happen. Of
course you can, but no, no, no, no.

28
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,710
Right now because of the government,
because they, here's the thing,

29
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,000
what do you mean that can happen?

30
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:39,300
It's just we have to look at it in
terms of what a real priority. But no,

31
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:43,770
it goes by, it goes by the whoever
party's in charge of their priorities.

32
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,760
It's not like my problem is to
make it a priority for the nation.

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,230
That's what I'm saying. It's
impossible, but until you have a person,

34
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,710
I believe everything can be fixed.
This is a simple fix.

35
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,420
If you just elect a person that takes
some republican values and some democratic

36
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,510
values, the thing is right now in
politics, you have to be one or the other.

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Like if I, if a person came
in and go, you know what?

38
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,010
I liked these republican ideas. I like
these democratic ideas, less role.

39
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:14,590
I'm a be down the middle and less role
with Polk call being a centrist. Yeah,

40
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,780
that exists. But in these
to win, if that can happen,

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,770
it can happen. All of it.
But until that happens,

42
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:26,460
it doesn't mean though does it every
four years we figured out what happens.

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,460
Right? And before Trump won, we
never thought of reality show.

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,970
Fucking guy could win, but that
guy won. Yeah, and you go, okay,

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,080
well now we know that happens. All this
stuff can happen. This is not like,

46
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,900
we're not asking for alchemy.
We're not trying to turn lead into gold.

47
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:41,100
We're trying to figure out a way,

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,120
but you're going against
the system that then is the,

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,680
there's a new system. The new system
is the system of public opinion,

50
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:53,070
which is readily accessible. Absolutely.
And that's never happened before.

51
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,660
There's never been a time where everyone
had a say in one way, shape or form.

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,660
Whether it's through through
Instagram or Twitter or social media.

53
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,680
That's one of the reasons why upholding
the freedom of speech in these things is

54
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:08,290
so important. Even if people are
saying things you don't agree with,

55
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,220
the only way this all gets sorted out
as we get to figure out a way to express

56
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,530
ourselves and there's going to
be arguments back and forth,

57
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:19,420
but what you've gotta do is someone's
got to put forth an educated plan,

58
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:24,250
like a plan that's based on science and
reason and a plan that you can debate

59
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:25,930
against opposers of that plan.

60
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,440
But when you have people that don't
believe in science, a lot of how do you,

61
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,860
how do you slowly but surely
got to educate people.

62
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,920
It's going to take generations. This
is what I'm saying. It's like the, the,

63
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,040
the momentum of our stubbornness
and our, our, our past and the,

64
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,730
the sort of the systems that
we find ourselves stuck in,

65
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,490
systems of behavior and
thinking and culture.

66
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,980
All that stuff is just
going to take a long time.

67
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,380
We sort the wheat from the chaff.

68
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,380
We've got to figure out what's good
and what's bad and we're doing it,

69
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,071
we're doing it,

70
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:57,490
but it doing it actively
and it's frustrating because
you're like, God dammit,

71
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,800
this is the worst time.
We still have all these problems.

72
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:01,780
We still have cops shooting people.
We still have crime,

73
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,500
we still have Wall Street theft.
We still have all this stuff. Yeah.

74
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,170
But you know what? I like him.
But you know what I like is,

75
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:13,000
we know about it now where it's not
hitting like 20 years ago, like you heard,

76
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,280
let's go 30 years ago you heard Nwa
make that sound f the police and they're

77
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:21,040
talking about the same things that are
happening today except you would hear the

78
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,470
song and go, oh, that's a great song.
That's not Rodney King. Yeah. Rather kick,

79
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,850
you watched him get the
fuck beat out of him on TV.

80
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,940
And here's the thing about the Rodney
king thing. That guy apparently was, look,

81
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,600
we had done a bunch of crazy shit, right?
He got gotten a car chase with the cops.

82
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,930
Beat the fuck out of somebody before that.
There was a lot going on.

83
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,790
He just got to see the end
of it while this guy is, was
he on? Was He on 10 years?

84
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,880
I don't know if he was he on a
drug and I think he was on PCP.

85
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,790
PCP apparently makes you
look super humans strong.

86
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,610
I had a buddy of mine who got his
finger bitten off while he's on PCP,

87
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,480
so he didn't even know it bitten
off by who? The street fight. Yeah.

88
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,950
It's like he didn't even realize
this fit cause he was, he was on PCP.

89
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,910
He didn't realize how many bit
his finger off then he went to.

90
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:11,860
Yeah, he had, he had a, his
toe removed and his toe,

91
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:16,360
uh, put onto his finger. Wears finger.
Used to be, was it a thumb? No,

92
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:20,770
this is pinky fingers up. Put his
trigger finger, so on one of his,

93
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:24,010
and he had it curved so he
could always throw ride hooks.

94
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,530
So is when you'd shake his hand.
He's a,

95
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:30,490
he would give you like this weird
handshake while he would shake your hand,

96
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:33,400
but there was always one finger that
wouldn't just try to take out the middle.

97
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,500
It didn't move good because they had,

98
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,190
it was really his toe that they
replaced his finger with a toe.

99
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,900
That must have looked weird. It
was weird. It was real weird. Yeah,

100
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,540
but that's PCP son live in that PCP,

101
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:50,950
like fucking crazy people in
Boston, man. He was a boxing coach.

102
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:56,050
Oh yeah. I don't know man. It's just
we need to get to a better place. Yeah,

103
00:05:56,051 --> 00:06:00,770
we're getting to a better place, but
I think it's a long, slow process.

104
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:04,040
I think we are in the, I mean
there's people that say like, Hey,

105
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,680
two to minimize the suffering that
people feel right now is in Justin.

106
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,290
For you to say that is outrageous and
it's just a hallmark of your delusional

107
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:16,970
perspective. That's not true. This is not
denying the awful things of the world.

108
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:18,260
The awful things in the world exist,

109
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,400
but if you tried to look
at this as a mathematical
equation, if you looked above,

110
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,410
he would say, well, there's
a lot of problems here.

111
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,300
There's a lot of competing factors.

112
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,270
There's environmental factors like
what are they doing in the world?

113
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,120
What are they doing to the ocean? What
are they doing in the air? Oh Jesus,

114
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:35,620
everything's warming up and people
are fighting over what's causing it.

115
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,700
Like they not even pay attention.
This is madness,

116
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,080
but look how much knowledge there is.
Look how much discussion there is.

117
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:45,080
Let's say movements are moving
and growing and people are,

118
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,350
even when they're misinformed,
it's still, there's activity.

119
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:51,260
There's all this stuff going on.
Even when you know someone says, Hey,

120
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:53,300
we're going to tax everybody
that makes more than $10 million,

121
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:58,100
70% like bitch shape, tax and shit,
stop. Just stop, stop, stop, stop,

122
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,860
stop. Just because someone works really
hard, you can't take all of it. Look,

123
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,540
stop people from stealing
money, stop people for, but
if you, if people say, well,

124
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:10,460
we want equality of outcome. Okay. As
soon as we get a quality of effort,

125
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:15,470
talk to me as soon as we get,
cause some people don't hustle,

126
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,620
they just don't. And I don't know why.
Maybe it's the way they were raised.

127
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,720
Maybe they have poor nutrition,
maybe they a hookworm.

128
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,950
I don't know what the fuck it is.

129
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,150
But don't say that everybody's supposed
to hit the right spot and everyone's

130
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:28,820
going to get to this spot and then
after that spot we're going to divvy,

131
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,780
divvy up all the money.

132
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:32,510
So nobody ever makes more than $100,000
a year in the world's a better place,

133
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,870
bitch. That doesn't make the world better.
Notes that makes the lazy people happy.

134
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,550
That some fucking juggernaut like
Mark Cuban or one of these billionaire

135
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:44,930
characters is like hustling constantly
and gathering up massive resources. Yeah,

136
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,630
he's playing the game of monopoly
but he's playing at 24 hours a day,

137
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:50,330
seven days a week. That's
his option. He can do that.

138
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,190
You can't stop people from doing that.

139
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,510
Well you can stop them is from doing in
just things with that money and wait,

140
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,540
maybe you can do is like help someone
like lean towards it like a bill gates

141
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:06,551
type situation where he does so much good
and so much charitable work and helps

142
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:08,180
out so many people that you go,

143
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:11,720
oh well maybe it's not a bad thing for a
guy like that to have all that money he

144
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,120
gives. You don't have to think
of him as just mister money bags.

145
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:17,090
Like maybe you could think of them as
he does have access to all this money,

146
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:21,950
but he's also this incredible resource
for hope and change and prosperity for

147
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:22,630
some folks.

148
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,630
I think like I think people wouldn't
mind giving money to something that they

149
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:32,600
see being built.
Like if there's work into it,

150
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,830
people hate the idea of just giving
money and that seeing something from it.

151
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,280
Sure.
Guilty.

152
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:41,210
Giving it to people that don't know what
the fuck to do with it and they just

153
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:46,010
going to find a use for it because that's
what bureaucracy is. Yeah. I don't know,

154
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:50,180
man. I don't know. I
don't know. Joe, we just,

155
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,980
I don't know either, but I do know
that it's fashionable to say it.

156
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,970
It's fashionable to say everything
sucks. Well it's, it's easy to say that,

157
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,050
but like you said,

158
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:06,051
but I really think it starts with if the
government is not on the same page and

159
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:09,450
they're always fighting, you
can't, you can't move forward.

160
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,290
Then all this great stuff you're saying
can't move forward because it starts

161
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,630
from the top Joe. That's true.
But it starts from the top.

162
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,300
What's interesting is one of the
things that's cool about the government

163
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:19,500
fighting as you get to see that,

164
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:22,360
like even the president can't do
the things that he wants. Yes.

165
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,880
He has to consult with people and they
have to agree on something and it has to

166
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,070
be reasonable and they have to
present it to the American people.

167
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:31,020
And so the people have to
represent their constituents.

168
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:34,350
And so you're seeing this
really fascinating thing
because you've never had a

169
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,030
guy like Trump in office before.

170
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,930
So you see him say he's going to do
things and then you see the rest of it

171
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:42,930
doesn't happen on the fuck you
are. Yeah. The fuck you are.

172
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,290
And then you watch this stalemate,
you watch this, this go down,

173
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,730
and you watch these people
being forced to negotiate.

174
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:51,510
And the way Trump was forced
to talk about Nancy Pelosi,

175
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:54,960
cause she has so much power, you know, and
you know, he did have to call her a cut.

176
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,220
Oh yeah. He'll will have to call her
at all. Which like the fuck out here.

177
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,500
He has to pay their respect because he
knows now golf claps right in his face.

178
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,540
She's like, man, this
I, it's so fun to watch.

179
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,860
It's so fun to watch right now.
