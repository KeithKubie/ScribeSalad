00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.029
So  a couple of days ago a guy named Chris
was detained here

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.730
in Baltimore right here at the Cultural Center
light rail station

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.809
Well, all he was doing was taking video of trains

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.009
It was his hobby

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.990
Why shouldn't he be able to do that?

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.820
"...that’s your story"

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.340
“So why don’t you have any signs posted to say I cannot take pictures?”

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.380
I'm on public
property and I'm just minding my own business here

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.540
waiting for the train to come pick me

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.860
Uh,  am I being detained?

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.260
Yes, you are being detained

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.320
You're not under arrest, but you are being detained

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.510
So I just want the opportunity to talk about the cops right after the tornado

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.480
our 2nd Amendment right is the right to
bear arms

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.769
And so we had some looting.  So I'll show you what the police down there did

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.100
Chris was detained here in Baltimore
but in Alabama

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.700
the cops actually encouraged us to use
our weapons to defend our place

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.200
"You might not be able to with the mag loaded all the way because what I happened to do"

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.320
"is getting it about right there, pushing down"

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.000
And get the lip forward
*click*

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.070
Pretty cool. When I called the police chief and said, "Hey, what's the deal"

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.150
"if I  got some video, do I need to blot out
the faces or anything like that?"

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.740
He said, "No, use anything you have"

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.680
That's pretty impressive,  so he's actually
encouraging me to use my rights

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.399
that wasn't the case with Chris so I hope our
country is going more towards the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.490
direction of liberty

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.110
than the opposite direction. That's it. I hope you

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.340
realize that if you don't use your
freedom, they'll go away.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.600
In 1759, Benjamin Franklin said those who would
give up Essential Liberty to purchase a

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.740
little temporary

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.900
safety deserve neither liberty nor
safety
