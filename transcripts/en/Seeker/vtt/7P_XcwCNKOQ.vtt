Ever wonder why some people cry when they’re
happy?

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.160
Well, psychologists may have just figured
it out!

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.110
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you’re
the type of person who cries tears of joy

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.500
during happy moments - you’re not alone.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.960
Tons of people do it, but the question is
- why?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.540
Well now, science has an answer.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.719
Oriana Aragon, a psychologist at Yale with
possibly the coolest name ever, has been conducting

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.289
a series of studies to figure out why people
cry when they’re happy.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.750
According to her study, which will be published
soon in the journal Psychological Science,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.750
crying tears of joy - may be a way for us
to restore emotional equilibrium.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.289
It’s not uncommon for us, she says, to respond
to positive experiences with negative emotions,

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.820
whether it’s crying when we’re happy,
or screaming out of excitement, or even pinching

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.059
an adorable baby’s cheeks.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.030
When you think about it, in the most basic
sense - all of those are negative reactions

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.140
to an otherwise positive experience.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.950
So Aragon and her colleagues, decided to run
subjects through some of these scenarios and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.409
measure their responses.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.690
What they found, is that people who expressed
negative reactions to positive events, were

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.780
also capable of recovering from those emotions
much more rapidly than people who didn’t.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.070
And those kinds of reactions tend to happen
across the board.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.390
Meaning that someone who cries at their children’s
graduation, is also the type of person who’s

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.070
most likely to pinch a cute baby’s cheeks.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.640
But it’s not just a one-way street.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.550
According to Aragon, there’s also evidence
that strong negative feelings can lead to

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.040
positive expressions.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.360
Nervous laughter in an awkward or difficult
situation, would be a good example.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.540
At the end of the day, it’s all just a way
of restoring equilibrium.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.760
What do you guys think, are you the type of
person who cries easily during happy moments?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.410
