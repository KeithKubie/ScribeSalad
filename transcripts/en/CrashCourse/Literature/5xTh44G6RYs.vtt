00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.500
Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature and it is a truth universally acknowledged

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.870
that a video series about world literature
must be in want of a Jane Austen episode.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.870
/
So here it is.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.320
Today, we’ll be discussing Pride and Prejudice,
Austen’s Regency-era novel of life, liberty

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.320
and bonnets.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.380
The book was first published in 1813, it’s
a social satire about a family with five daughters

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.180
and quite a lot of economic anxiety.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.470
And the novel’s characters and themes have
remained relevant for centuries now--which

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.100
is why there are SO.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.750
MANY. adaptations of it, from the Keira Knightly
movie to an Emmy winning web series co-created

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.750
by my brother.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.440
/
Today, we’ll talk about the social and historical

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.750
context in which the book was written, the
style that Jane Austen helped invent, and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.590
the dilemmas the major characters face.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.250
And in the next episode, we’ll look more
closely at the politics of the book and its

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.000
attitudes toward money, class and gender.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.210
But for now: It’s bonnets all the way down.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.740
INTRO
So we don’t know that much about Jane Austen’s

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.610
life because after her death her sister burned
most of her letters.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.460
Just a friendly note, by the way, to any future
literary executors out there, maybe don’t

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.740
burn so much stuff?

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.180
Even if you’re told to.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.780
Wait, unless your MY literary executor.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.780
Then burn everything.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.020
But, here’s what we do know: Jane Austen
was born in 1775 to an Anglican clergyman

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.380
and his wife; Jane was the second youngest
of eight children.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.500
And her father farmed and took in students
to makes ends meet.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.090
Jane was mostly taught at home and sometimes
she wasn’t taught at all, although she and

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.140
her sister did go to a year or two of boarding
school.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.730
When she was eleven, Jane started writing
plays and novels, mostly social satires and

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.140
parodies of “novels of sensibility,” a
literary genre in which women like, cry and

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.720
sigh and faint a lot.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.440
Many of these early works were in the style
of the epistolary novel, which is a story

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.310
composed of letters, and we see echoes of
that form in Pride and Prejudice.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.299
We also see some echoes of Pride and Prejudice
in Austen’s life.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.330
She never married, but she did receive at
least one proposal that she accepted for a

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.420
few hours.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.530
And after her father’s death in 1805, her
financial position and the positions of her

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.380
mother and her sister became increasingly
insecure.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.920
By 1816, four of her books had been published.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.150
And she was working on a new novel, called
Sanditon, when she died in 1817, at the age

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.410
of just 41.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.710
/
Two more of her works, Persuasion and Northanger

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.230
Abbey, were published after her death.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.740
They’re all good--but to me at least Pride
and Prejudice is the most perfect of them--there’s

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.250
a precision to it.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.200
Like Gatsby or Sula, Pride and Prejudice is
a novel in which every single word feels genuinely

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200
essential.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.350
So what happens in Pride and Prejudice?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.160
well, let’s go to the Thoughtbubble:
Mr. and Mrs. Bennet live in rural England

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.711
with their five daughters: pretty Jane, lively
Elizabeth, horrible Mary, airhead Kitty, and

00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:47.300
boy obsessed Lydia.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.200
When Mr. Bennet dies the estate will go to
a male cousin, so the daughters have to find

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200
rich husbands.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200
Or else.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200
/

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.989
Or else live in poverty or become governesses,
and if you’ve read Jane Eyre, you know how

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.130
great that gig is.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.540
Mr. Bingley, an eligible bachelor, arrives
on the scene, and he and Jane fall in love.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.180
Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley’s best
friend, definitely don’t.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.569
Elizabeth gets a proposal of marriage from
Mr. Collins, the cousin who’s going to inherit

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.569
the estate.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.230
And marrying him would save her sisters from
poverty, but Mr. Collins is awful and Elizabeth

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.230
declines.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.810
So her best friend, Charlotte, ends up snagging
him.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.610
Meanwhile, Elizabeth starts to fall for Wickham,
a soldier in the militia.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.040
He hates Mr. Darcy, too.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.930
/ Suddenly Mr. Bingley moves away and Jane
is heartbroken.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.760
Elizabeth goes to visit Charlotte and is introduced
to Lady Catherine, Mr. Darcy’s ultra-snob

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.760
aunt.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.440
She sees Mr. Darcy there and he also proposes
marriage but in a very insulting way.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.769
She insults him right back.

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:44.769
/
much for love at first sight.

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.311
Some months later Elizabeth is on a trip with
her aunt and uncle.

00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:51.209
They visit Mr. Darcy’s lavish estate and
Elizabeth softens toward him.

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.750
Then she gets word that Lydia has run off
with Wickham.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.440
/
Mr. Darcy saves Lydia’s reputation by brokering

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.440
a marriage.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.670
Then it’s happy endings all around:
Lydia gets married; Jane and Mr. Bingley get

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.959
married, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy get married,
Kitty learns to be a little bit less of an

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.120
airhead and Mary is presumably still horrible.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.120
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.569
So let’s talk life and letters in Regency
England.

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.379
By the way, Regency England refers to a period
from about 1800-1820 when King George III

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:20.739
became mentally ill and unfit to rule.

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.870
In England, this was a time of political uncertainty
and a lot of economic volatility.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.569
There was a rising middle class, a burgeoning
consumer culture, and a move from an agrarian

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.530
economy to an industrial one.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.979
And that meant less overall poverty, but it
also meant a lot of social instability.

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.389
And It was also a time when people in England
were beginning to talk about the rights of

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:40.389
women.

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.449
Like, Mary Wollstonecraft published “Vindication
of the Rights of Women” seven years after

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.460
Austen was born, though it’s important to
remember that at this place and time women

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.599
didn’t really have many rights--they couldn’t
vote, and in Pride and Prejudice, the whole

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.389
plot begins because all of Bennet’s five
children are daughters,

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.409
This means that legally, Bennet’s estate
has to go to a male cousin.

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.839
But there was a growing belief that hey, maybe
women should have rights.

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.529
Abroad, the American Revolution and the French
Revolution had recently unsettled established

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:08.289
social and political orders.

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.610
Everywhere there were increasing discussions
about rights and responsibilities, liberties

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.610
and duties.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.810
You can even hear this in the famous first
sentence of Pride and Prejudice: “It is

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.360
a truth universally acknowledged that a single
man in possession of a good fortune must be

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.659
in want of a wife.”

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.479
It has an echo of the American Declaration
of Independence: “We find these truths to

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.629
be self-evident…”

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.860
But the comic deflation in the second half
of the sentence is pure Austen.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.059
Some people are initially put off by Pride
and Prejudice because they view it as a sort

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:37.339
of literaryfied romance novel.

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:42.430
And, it is a book primarily interested in
human relationships, especially romantic ones--but

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.949
I’d challenge the idea that such novels
can’t be great.

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.330
/
Nobody ever argues that picaresque novels,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.529
or bildungsromans, are merely genre novels--even
though they are also genres.

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.419
But the word “romance” is too often and
too quickly dismissed.

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:02.779
By the way, Austen has this completely unearned
reputation for being genteel and conservative.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:08.669
The reality is that her work is very funny
and mean and super smart about human behavior.

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.189
/
You can hear that in the letters that survive,

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:15.210
like when she writes to her sister, “I do
not want people to be very agreeable, as it

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.889
saves me the trouble of liking them a great
deal.”

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:18.889
Also, this may be a novel about relationships,
but relationships are important.

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:19.889
Most of us aren’t going to get to decide
the fate of a city-state or die in pursuit

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:20.889
of a great white whale but many of us are
going to have to decide whom to marry.

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:21.889
/

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:23.059
But also while this book involves lower-case
r romance, it is very aggressively not capital-r

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:28.130
Romantic, in the Byron Wordsworth Shelley
sense that feelings are so overwhelming that

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.249
they supersede logic.

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:33.830
I mean, Wordsworth can write a hillside for
thirty-seven stanzas, but if you read Austen

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.849
closely, you’ll find that there’s a striking
absence of physical description.

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.279
We don’t know what the dresses look like.

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:40.919
We don’t know what the people look like.

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.770
When there is a physical description, like
the description of Mr. Darcy’s estate or

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.149
Elizabeth’s petticoat, it means that something
crucially important is happening.

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:51.229
And even then these descriptions are very
brief.

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:54.399
If we’re being honest, there isn’t even
all that much in here about bonnets.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:57.919
In fact, Austen is suspicious of overwhelming
emotion.

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:01.580
Remember how I mentioned the novel of sensibility
and Austen’s early satires?

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.960
She’s skeptical of feeling too much, of
getting so carried away by emotion that it

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.930
prevents you from thinking clearly.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.429
This is exemplified by Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy’s
relationship.

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:12.719
They don’t fall in love at first sight.

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:14.180
Actually, it’s the opposite: hate at first
sight.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.449
At a ball, she overhears him telling his friend
that her sister is the only hot girl in the

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:21.899
room and that Elizabeth is merely “tolerable.”

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:25.659
Given that Elizabeth and Darcy are end up
together, this is a novel that’s suspicious

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:29.719
of romantic love, especially romantic love
based on instant physical attraction

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:33.589
and when characters do get carried away by
their emotions, they’re either fooling themselves,

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:37.409
like Mr. Collins, or doing something really
wrong, like Lydia.

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:38.409
Pride and Prejudice: Not a capital-r Romance.

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:43.339
Yes, it has a wish-fulfilling ending, but
it’s a sly, and ironic and clear-eyed exploration

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:47.809
of the individual vs. the collective, happiness
vs. security and how and why people form romantic

00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:48.809
relationships.

00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:49.809
/
It’s about love, but rather than presuming

00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:54.699
that love is only a feeling, Pride and Prejudice
explores how thinking and feeling and need

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:59.680
and responsibility intersect to form the experience
that we call love.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.629
/
One might even say that it’s a novel about

00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:04.810
love that deconstructs love.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.619
Austen joked that the scope of her works was
narrow, equating her writing with a two-inch

00:08:08.619 --> 00:08:13.219
piece of ivory “on which I work with so
fine a brush, as produces little effect after

00:08:13.219 --> 00:08:14.219
much labour.”

00:08:14.219 --> 00:08:17.529
She also critiqued of Pride and Prejudice,
writing to a friend, “The work is rather

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:21.069
too light &amp; bright &amp; sparkling; it wants shade.”
/

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:22.800
and yeah, OK, the novel is fun.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.370
But reading should be fun sometimes.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.029
I mean, we already read To the Lighthouse.

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:30.939
And in terms of the prose-style itself, Austen
actually was pioneering a new style here called

00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:32.920
free indirect discourse.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.690
It means that even though the narration is
in the third person, the narrative voice takes

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.729
on the thoughts and feelings of characters.

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:40.920
/
I mean, After unexpectedly meeting Darcy at

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.010
his estate, the third-person narration captures
Elizabeth’s embarrassment:

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:48.410
“Her coming there was the most unfortunate,
the most ill-judged thing in the world!

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.330
How strange must it appear to him!

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.220
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike
so vain a man!

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.290
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown
herself in his way again!”

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.761
This narrative approach reflects emotion without
stating it--showing instead of telling, as

00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:07.340
the saying goes--and makes us feel not as
if we can sympathize with Elizabeth, but instead

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.610
as if we ARE Elizabeth,
/

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.450
which to me is one of the most profound and
important things a novel can do: Great books

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.880
offer you a way out of yourself, and into
others’ lives.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.640
Next time we’ll look more closely at some
of the themes, but for now, let’s briefly

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.500
explore the dilemma facing Elizabeth Bennet
and her sisters.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.140
Because her parents have been bad with money,
she knows she has to marry well or face poverty.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.140
Or become a governess.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.140
And as we know from Jane Eyre, that’s a
terrible option.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.720
When Mr. Collins proposes, that’s a fantastic
solution.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.240
Except for one thing: She can’t respect
him.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.750
Mr. Collins is pompous and foolish and the
very things that make Elizabeth terrific—like

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.720
her lively mind and her fresh wit—make him
nervous.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.200
She tells him, “ You could not make me happy,
and I am convinced that I am the last woman

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.130
in the world who would make you so.”

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.310
But the idea that happiness should be privileged
over security is pretty radical.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.400
/
Elizabeth is deciding that her personal individual

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.740
happiness should outweigh the economic problems
of her family.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.050
She is taking a huge risk when she rejects
him.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.450
/
As Mr. Collins tells her, she’s poor so

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.810
she probably won’t get another proposal.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:12.240
He might not have made her happy, but he would
have made her and any unmarried sisters financially

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.240
secure.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.600
And then, Elizabeth takes the same risk or
a greater one when she rejects Mr. Darcy’s

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.010
insulting first proposal.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.600
She can’t make herself marry a man she doesn’t
like.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.620
This was the same dilemma Austen herself faced
and her rejection of a suitor made things

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.110
hard for herself and for her family.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:31.150
But she did it anyway.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:35.500
Now, thanks to the fairy tale ending, Elizabeth
doesn’t experience, like, catastrophic consequences

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.520
as a result of her privileging happiness.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.340
/
But as 19th century English readers would

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.670
have been very well aware, she could have.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:46.560
And so, the novel helped them, and also helps
us, explore when we should put our own needs

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.209
first, and when the happiness and security
of others is more important.

00:10:50.209 --> 00:10:52.310
/
Is doing what is best for you always the right

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.310
thing to do?

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.270
Or are there moments when you must sacrifice
your happiness for the good of your family

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.580
or your social order?

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.690
We’ll continue our discussion next time
when we’ll also examine whether the politics

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.870
of the book are radical or conservative.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.440
And we’ll answer a vexing question: Why
does Lydia buy such an ugly bonnet?

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.440
Thanks for watching.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.440
Hope it was tolerable.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:36.200
I’ll see you next time.
