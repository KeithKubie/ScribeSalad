When we imagine lunar colonies, they mimic
cities in a small scale and have sweeping

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.440
vistas that include the Earth hanging above
the horizon.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.900
But that’s a great way to get cancer super
fast since we still don’t know how to protect

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.730
ourselves from cosmic radiation.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.610
So one solution might be to eschew scenic
surface colonies in favor of lovely lava tubes.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.289
Lava tubes on the Moon are basically the same
as the ones we see here on Earth.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.180
Back in the Moon’s history when it was geologically
active, molten rock flowed over the surface.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.460
The outside layer cooled first while the inside
kept flowing.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.269
But once the Moon’s internal lava flow ceased,
left behind were these huge hollow passages.

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.600
And because the Moon has relatively lower
gravity, it’s possible that these lava tubes

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.979
could have high ceilings, perhaps large enough
to allow a city to be erected inside them.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:46.979
YEAH.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:47.979
MOON CAVES.

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.530
We can find these caves by looking for pits
or “skylights.”

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.280
And JAXA scientists did just that, as did
NASA scientists using the Lunar Reconnaissance

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.280
Orbiter.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.379
Japan’s Lunar Radar Sounder looked at the
area close to the Marius Hills Hole, and found

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.010
these skylights might lead to lava tubes.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.439
Radar data shows a distinctive echo pattern
of a loss of power followed by a peak, suggesting

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.450
there might be a hollow underground lava tube
in the area around these skylights.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.689
This would be great for astronauts!

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.460
The tube’s thick roof would be a natural
shield against cosmic and solar radiation,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.039
meteor impacts, and the Moon’s extreme temperatures.

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.840
It’s even possible that these tubes, with
the end opening properly sealed with an airlock,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.030
could be pressurized with oxygen to create
a breathable habitat.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.179
Yay, no space cancer!

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.830
That is a far more appealing prospect than
living in tiny modules that, frankly, wouldn’t

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.359
offer nearly as much protection from all of
these hazards.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.890
Of course Newt can’t move there yet.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.340
Scientists need to study the area more with
better instruments to really figure out how

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.049
big these potential underground tubes might
be, BUT the preliminary evidence all points

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.960
to these natural structures offering at least
some inherent protection.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.539
Not to mention this simplifies access to safe
spaces on the Moon, and could come with the

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.319
added bonus of giving researchers access to
geologically significant sites that have so

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.509
far been out of reach.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.129
Moon caves, FTW!

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.209
Whether or not we’ll have wifi access in
those caves isn’t clear yet, but just in

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.060
case, why not set up your lunar exploration

we can just create an atmosphere on the Moon,
I’ve got some answers right here.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.530
But speaking of, the Moon actually has an
atmosphere, though it’s so minor it properly

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.330
speaking an exosphere.
