00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.280
Happy birthday Jesus!

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.280
We think...

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.339
Hey there holiday shoppers, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:14.540
If you are one of the estimated 2.2 billion
Christians across the planet, then December

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.650
25th is a special day for you!

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.100
It’s celebrated as the day Jesus of Nazareth
was born in a little manger in Bethlehem more

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.570
than two thousand years ago.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.870
But can we use science to actually determine
his exact date of birth?

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.950
Ouch, ouch, oof, talking about Jesus on a
science channel, playing with fire here.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.710
But hear me out, because I promise I’m not
trying to diminish anyone’s beliefs; theologians

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.620
whose job is to study stuff like this can’t
agree on the exact year, let alone the month

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.620
and day.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.890
Even the last head of the Roman Catholic church,
Pope Benedict the XVI, said the date was wrong

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.470
and Jesus might have been born earlier than
we thought.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.960
Part of the problem is the Bible doesn’t
name a specific date.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.910
It never explicitly says, “December 25th,
1 AD,” or anything like that.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.730
But, the Bible does mention events that happened
around the time Jesus was allegedly born,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.950
and scholars have tried to piece it together
from that.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.540
It mentions rulers and important people of
the time, like Herod the Great.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.570
Historians are pretty sure Herod died in 4
BCE, but even then they’re not dealing with

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.149
perfect historical records so these human
events aren’t the most reliable way to go

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.149
about it.

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.509
But you know what is reliable?

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:13.799
The night sky.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.859
Famously the story goes that when Jesus was
born, a new star appeared and guided three

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:18.859
wise men to Bethlehem.

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:22.210
It was only mentioned once, but if we're assuming
this new light in the sky was an actual thing,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.890
we might be able to figure out a known astronomical
event that corresponds to it.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.890
Luckily, Chinese and Korean astronomers kept
records!

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.490
One idea is the star was actually a nova.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.170
A nova is what happens when a white dwarf
steals nuclear fuel from a companion star

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.490
until it triggers a nuclear explosion, getting
extremely bright before fading again over

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.409
the course of months or years.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.689
They can happen at any time and Chinese astronomers
recorded a new star in the spring of 5 BCE,

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.310
but the biblical stories implied the star
moved, and novas can’t do that.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.170
A comet would fit the description of a bright
moving object in the sky, and since they’re

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.659
regular events we can wind back the clock
to predict when they would have appeared.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.999
Halley’s comet comes close to being visible
at the right time, but that was in 12 BCE

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:03.009
which is a little too far back to likely be
the “star” in question.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.009
On top of that, comets were considered bad
omens.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.009
Planets are bright, move, and were called
"wandering stars" by ancient people.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.599
Perhaps multiple planets came really close
to each other in the night sky in a conjunction

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.700
-- creating what appeared to the naked eye
to be one brighter object.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.000
The same way we can rewind the movement of
the comets to calculate when they passed by

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.680
the earth, we can turn back the motion of
the planets.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.560
When we do, we see that around the time of
Jesus’s possible birth there were actually

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.000
multiple conjunctions.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.330
Venus and Jupiter came together on June 17
in 2 BCE.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.360
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn came pretty close
in February of 6 BCE.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.690
And Jupiter and Saturn crossed paths THREE
times from late May to early December in 7

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.950
BCE, and did so in a different spot in the
sky each time.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.281
With all this astronomical data, perhaps there
did appear to be a new star in the sky around

00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:42.700
when Jesus was supposed to be born, but we’re
still no closer to knowing the exact date.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.819
That doesn’t mean it’s time to take down
the tree and return the gifts.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.140
Even if we’ve been getting Jesus’ birthday
wrong all this time, I hear he’s a pretty

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.230
forgiving guy.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.719
So we don't really know exactly when Jesus
was born, and there's some questions about

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:54.970
what he might have looked like.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.489

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.319
Alright guys, how are you spending December
25th?
