00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:01.350
- [Voiceover] All the problems

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.703
we've been dealing with so far

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:06.363
have essentially been
happening in one dimension.

00:00:06.363 --> 00:00:08.476
You could go forward or back.

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:10.380
So you could go forward or back.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.750
Or right or left.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.769
Or you could go up or down.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.859
What I wanna start to
talk about in this video

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.134
is what happens when we
extend that to two dimensions

00:00:19.134 --> 00:00:21.294
or we can even just extend
what we're doing in this video

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:24.521
to three or four, really an
arbitrary number of dimensions.

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:26.379
Although if you're dealing
with classical mechanics

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.746
you normally don't have to go
more than three dimensions.

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:32.114
And if you're gonna deal
with more than one dimension,

00:00:32.114 --> 00:00:33.182
especially in two dimensions,

00:00:33.182 --> 00:00:35.945
we're also gonna be dealing
with two-dimensional vectors.

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:37.826
And I just wanna make
sure, through this video,

00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:39.335
that we understand at least the basics

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:40.821
of two-dimensional vectors.

00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:42.006
Remember, a vector is something

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:44.978
that has both magnitude and direction.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.208
So the first thing I wanna do

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:47.741
is just give you a visual understanding

00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:50.899
of how vectors in two
dimensions would add.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.498
So let's say I have a vector right here.

00:00:54.498 --> 00:00:55.915
That is vector A.

00:00:57.494 --> 00:00:59.815
So, once again, its magnitude is specified

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:01.928
by the length of this arrow.

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:03.623
And its direction is specified

00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:05.388
by the direction of the arrow.

00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:06.851
So it's going in that direction.

00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:08.569
Now let's say I have another vector.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.102
Let's call it vector B.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:12.019
Let's call it vector B.

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:14.444
It looks like this.

00:01:14.444 --> 00:01:15.976
Now what I wanna do in this video

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:17.973
is think about what happens when I add

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:19.924
vector A to vector B.

00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:21.549
So there's a couple things to think about

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.175
when you visually depict vectors.

00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:25.845
The important thing is,
for example, for vector A,

00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:27.285
that you get the length right

00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:28.887
and you get the direction right.

00:01:28.887 --> 00:01:30.837
Where you actually draw it doesn't matter.

00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:32.091
So this could be vector A.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.181
This could also be vector A.

00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:35.853
Notice, it has the same length

00:01:35.853 --> 00:01:37.501
and it has the same direction.

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:38.895
This is also vector A.

00:01:38.895 --> 00:01:40.961
I could draw vector A up
here. It does not matter.

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:42.703
I could draw vector A up there.

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:44.560
I could draw vector B.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.319
I could draw vector B over here.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.462
It's still vector B.

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:50.993
It still has the same
magnitude and direction.

00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:52.399
Notice, we're not saying

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.082
that its tail has to
start at the same place

00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:56.473
that vector A's tail starts at.

00:01:56.473 --> 00:01:58.122
I could draw vector B over here.

00:01:58.122 --> 00:02:00.502
So I can always have the same vector

00:02:00.502 --> 00:02:02.035
but I can shift it around.

00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:03.010
So I can move it up there.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.425
As long as it has the same
magnitude, the same length,

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:08.165
and the same direction.

00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:09.697
And the whole reason I'm doing that

00:02:09.697 --> 00:02:11.996
is because the way to
visually add vectors...

00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:14.246
If I wanted to add vector A

00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:18.340
plus vector B...

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.980
And I'll show you how to
do it more analytically

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.977
in a future video.

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:28.088
I can literally draw vector A.

00:02:28.088 --> 00:02:29.435
I draw vector A.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:31.362
So that's vector A, right over there.

00:02:31.362 --> 00:02:33.173
And then I can draw vector B,

00:02:33.173 --> 00:02:37.980
but I put the tail of vector
B to the head of vector A.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.559
So I shift vector B over

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.276
so its tail is right at
the head of vector A.

00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:46.037
And then vector B would
look something like this.

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:47.755
It would look something like this.

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:51.636
And then if you go from the tail of A

00:02:51.636 --> 00:02:54.044
all the way to the head of B,

00:02:54.044 --> 00:02:55.986
all the way to the head of B,

00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:58.236
and you call that vector C,

00:02:59.668 --> 00:03:01.918
that is the sum of A and B.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.883
And it should make sense,
if you think about it.

00:03:07.883 --> 00:03:10.191
Let's say these were displacement vectors.

00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:12.118
So A shows that you're being displaced

00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:14.022
this much in this direction.

00:03:14.022 --> 00:03:15.601
B shows that you're being displaced

00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:18.062
this much in this direction.

00:03:18.062 --> 00:03:20.268
So the length of B in that direction.

00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:22.637
And if I were to say you
have a displacement of A,

00:03:22.637 --> 00:03:24.680
and then you have a displacement of B,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.631
what is your total displacement?

00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:28.488
So you would have had to be,

00:03:28.488 --> 00:03:30.439
I guess, shifted this
far in this direction,

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.225
and then you would be shifted
this far in this direction.

00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:35.315
So the net amount that you've been shifted

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:37.498
is this far in that direction.

00:03:37.498 --> 00:03:40.261
So that's why this would
be the sum of those.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.351
Now we can use that same idea

00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:45.207
to break down any vector in two dimensions

00:03:45.207 --> 00:03:48.063
into, we could say, into its components.

00:03:48.063 --> 00:03:49.595
And I'll give you a better sense

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:51.917
of what that means in a second.

00:03:51.917 --> 00:03:53.750
So if I have vector A.

00:03:54.812 --> 00:03:56.680
Let me pick a new letter.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.513
Let's call this vector "vector X."

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:03.253
Let's call this "vector X."

00:04:03.253 --> 00:04:07.336
I can say that vector X
is going to be the sum of

00:04:09.172 --> 00:04:11.587
this vector right here in green

00:04:11.587 --> 00:04:14.420
and this vector right here in red.

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:19.088
Notice, X starts at the
tail of the green vector

00:04:19.088 --> 00:04:22.478
and goes all the way to the
head of the magenta vector.

00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:24.126
And the magenta vector starts

00:04:24.126 --> 00:04:25.682
at the head of the green vector

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.377
and then finishes, I guess,

00:04:27.377 --> 00:04:30.999
well where it finishes is
where vector X finishes.

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:32.857
And the reason why I do this...

00:04:32.857 --> 00:04:35.016
And, you know, hopefully from this

00:04:35.016 --> 00:04:36.200
comparable explanation right here,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.998
says, okay, look, the green
vector plus the magenta vector

00:04:38.998 --> 00:04:40.987
gives us this X vector.

00:04:40.987 --> 00:04:41.933
That should make sense.

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:44.571
I put the head of the green vector

00:04:44.571 --> 00:04:48.054
to the tail of this magenta
vector right over here.

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:50.027
But the whole reason why I did this is,

00:04:50.027 --> 00:04:53.905
if I can express X as a
sum of these two vectors,

00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:56.924
it then breaks down X into
its vertical component

00:04:56.924 --> 00:04:59.780
and its horizontal component.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.447
So I could call this

00:05:04.546 --> 00:05:06.526
the horizontal component,

00:05:06.526 --> 00:05:08.802
or I should say the vertical component.

00:05:08.802 --> 00:05:10.311
X vertical.

00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:13.981
And then I could call this over here

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.443
the X horizontal.

00:05:15.443 --> 00:05:16.999
Or another way I could draw it,

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.578
I could shift this X vertical over.

00:05:18.578 --> 00:05:20.250
Remember, it doesn't
matter where I draw it,

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.340
as long as it has the same
magnitude and direction.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.012
And I could draw it like this.

00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:24.929
X vertical.

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:26.891
And so what you see is

00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:30.391
is that you could express this vector X...

00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:32.975
Let me do it in the same colors.

00:05:32.975 --> 00:05:34.392
You can express this vector X

00:05:34.392 --> 00:05:38.409
as the sum of its horizontal
and its vertical components.

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.576
As the sum of its horizontal
and its vertical components.

00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:45.677
Now we're gonna see over and over again

00:05:45.677 --> 00:05:47.813
that this is super powerful

00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:49.025
because what it can do is

00:05:49.025 --> 00:05:50.687
it can turn a two-dimensional problem

00:05:50.687 --> 00:05:53.120
into two separate
one-dimensional problems,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.908
one acting in a horizontal direction,

00:05:54.908 --> 00:05:57.369
one acting in a vertical direction.

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:59.459
Now let's do it a little
bit more mathematical.

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.085
I've just been telling you
about length and all of that.

00:06:01.085 --> 00:06:02.524
But let's actually break down...

00:06:02.524 --> 00:06:04.498
Let me just show you what this means,

00:06:04.498 --> 00:06:08.051
to break down the components of a vector.

00:06:08.051 --> 00:06:12.218
So let's say that I have a
vector that looks like this.

00:06:13.474 --> 00:06:15.865
Let me do my best to...

00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:19.696
Let's say I have a vector
that looks like this.

00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:21.322
It's length is five.

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:23.739
So let me call this vector A.

00:06:25.748 --> 00:06:28.915
So vector A's length is equal to five.

00:06:31.403 --> 00:06:33.110
And let's say that its direction...

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.664
We're gonna give its
direction by the angle

00:06:35.664 --> 00:06:38.334
between the direction its pointing in

00:06:38.334 --> 00:06:40.354
and the positive X axis.

00:06:40.354 --> 00:06:42.932
So maybe I'll draw an axis over here.

00:06:42.932 --> 00:06:44.395
So let's say that this right over here

00:06:44.395 --> 00:06:47.065
is the positive Y axis going
in the vertical direction.

00:06:47.065 --> 00:06:49.898
This right over here
is the positive X axis

00:06:49.898 --> 00:06:51.895
going in the horizontal direction.

00:06:51.895 --> 00:06:54.635
And to specify this vector's direction

00:06:54.635 --> 00:06:57.119
I will give this angle right over here.

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:58.884
And I'm gonna give a very peculiar angle,

00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:00.974
but I picked this for a specific reason,

00:07:00.974 --> 00:07:03.040
just so things work out neatly in the end.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.792
And I'm gonna give it in degrees.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.542
It's 36.8699 degrees.

00:07:11.912 --> 00:07:13.897
So I'm picking that particular number

00:07:13.897 --> 00:07:15.174
for a particular reason.

00:07:15.174 --> 00:07:17.287
Now what I wanna do is I wanna figure out

00:07:17.287 --> 00:07:21.745
this vector's horizontal
and vertical component.

00:07:21.745 --> 00:07:22.883
So I wanna break it down

00:07:22.883 --> 00:07:25.321
into something that's
going straight up or down

00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:27.782
and something that's going
straight right or left.

00:07:27.782 --> 00:07:29.059
So how do I do this?

00:07:29.059 --> 00:07:31.080
Well, one, I could just
draw them, visually,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.055
see what they look like.

00:07:32.055 --> 00:07:36.420
So its vertical component
would look like this.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.837
It would start...

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:41.096
Its vertical component
would look like this.

00:07:41.096 --> 00:07:44.579
And its horizontal component
would look like this.

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:46.718
Its horizontal component
would look like this.

00:07:46.718 --> 00:07:48.079
The horizontal component,
the way I drew it,

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:50.884
it would start where vector A starts

00:07:50.884 --> 00:07:54.971
and go as far in the X
direction as vector A's tip,

00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:56.341
but only in the X direction,

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:59.614
and then you need to, to get
back to the head of vector A,

00:07:59.614 --> 00:08:01.601
you need to have its vertical component.

00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:03.134
And we can sometimes call this,

00:08:03.134 --> 00:08:05.944
we could call the vertical
component over here A sub Y,

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:08.080
just so that it's moving
in the Y direction.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.724
And we can call this
horizontal component A sub X.

00:08:12.724 --> 00:08:14.790
Now what I wanna do is I wanna figure out

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.505
the magnitude of A sub Y and A sub X.

00:08:18.505 --> 00:08:20.108
So how do we do that?

00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:21.338
Well, the way we drew this,

00:08:21.338 --> 00:08:23.591
I've essentially set up
a right triangle for us.

00:08:23.591 --> 00:08:25.982
This is a right triangle.

00:08:25.982 --> 00:08:27.724
We know the length of this triangle,

00:08:27.724 --> 00:08:31.137
or the length of this side, or
the length of the hypotenuse.

00:08:31.137 --> 00:08:33.993
That's going to be the
magnitude of vector A.

00:08:33.993 --> 00:08:37.708
And so the magnitude of
vector A is equal to five.

00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:39.218
We already knew that up here.

00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:41.191
So how do we figure out the sides?

00:08:41.191 --> 00:08:44.118
Well, we could use a little
bit of basic trigonometry.

00:08:44.118 --> 00:08:46.765
If we know the angle, and
we know the hypotenuse,

00:08:46.765 --> 00:08:50.294
how do we figure out the
opposite side to the angle?

00:08:50.294 --> 00:08:51.896
So this right here,

00:08:51.896 --> 00:08:55.588
this right here is the
opposite side to the angle.

00:08:55.588 --> 00:08:57.771
And if we forgot some of
our basic trigonometry

00:08:57.771 --> 00:09:00.720
we can relearn it right now.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.720
Soh-cah-toa.

00:09:03.347 --> 00:09:05.285
Sine is opposite over hypotenuse.

00:09:05.285 --> 00:09:07.293
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:09:07.293 --> 00:09:10.172
Tangent is opposite over adjacent.

00:09:10.172 --> 00:09:14.073
So we have the angle,
we want the opposite,

00:09:14.073 --> 00:09:16.335
and we have the hypotenuse.

00:09:16.335 --> 00:09:17.585
So we could say

00:09:18.723 --> 00:09:20.973
that the sine of our angle,

00:09:22.202 --> 00:09:23.119
the sine of

00:09:24.762 --> 00:09:26.012
36.899 degrees,

00:09:29.104 --> 00:09:32.688
is going to be equal to the
opposite over the hypotenuse.

00:09:32.688 --> 00:09:34.360
The opposite side of the angle

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.332
is the magnitude of our Y component.

00:09:37.332 --> 00:09:41.499
...is going to be equal to the
magnitude of our Y component,

00:09:42.699 --> 00:09:44.623
the magnitude of our Y component,

00:09:44.623 --> 00:09:46.843
over the magnitude of the hypotenuse,

00:09:46.843 --> 00:09:48.399
over this length over here,

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:51.116
which we know is going
to be equal to five.

00:09:51.116 --> 00:09:53.346
Or if you multiply both sides by five,

00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:54.763
you get five sine

00:09:55.924 --> 00:09:57.424
of 36.899 degrees,

00:09:59.676 --> 00:10:03.843
is equal to the magnitude
of the vertical component

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:08.390
of our vector A.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.062
Now before I take out the calculator

00:10:10.062 --> 00:10:11.270
and figure out what this is,

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.892
let me do the same thing for
the horizontal component.

00:10:14.892 --> 00:10:18.979
Over here we know this side
is adjacent to the angle.

00:10:18.979 --> 00:10:20.627
And we know the hypotenuse.

00:10:20.627 --> 00:10:24.018
And so cosine deals with
adjacent and hypotenuse.

00:10:24.018 --> 00:10:27.685
So we know that the
cosine of 36.899 degrees

00:10:29.777 --> 00:10:30.944
is equal to...

00:10:31.936 --> 00:10:33.631
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:37.714
So it's equal to the
magnitude of our X component

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.808
over the hypotenuse.

00:10:39.808 --> 00:10:41.410
The hypotenuse here has...

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.686
Or the magnitude of the
hypotenuse, I should say,

00:10:43.686 --> 00:10:45.381
which has a length of five.

00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:47.656
Once again, we multiply
both sides by five,

00:10:47.656 --> 00:10:51.823
and we get five times the
cosine of 36.899 degrees

00:10:53.136 --> 00:10:56.886
is equal to the magnitude
of our X component.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.288
So let's figure out what these are.

00:11:00.288 --> 00:11:02.099
Let me get the calculator out.

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:04.682
Let me get my trusty TI-85 out.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:08.020
I wanna make sure it's in degree mode.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.553
So let me check.

00:11:09.553 --> 00:11:11.782
Yep, we're in degree
mode right over there.

00:11:11.782 --> 00:11:14.197
Don't wanna... Make sure
we're not in radian mode.

00:11:14.197 --> 00:11:15.834
Now let's exit that.

00:11:15.834 --> 00:11:20.001
And we have the vertical
component is equal to five times

00:11:20.969 --> 00:11:23.219
the sine of 36.899 degrees,

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:31.744
which is, if we round
it, right at about three.

00:11:31.744 --> 00:11:33.625
So this is equal to...

00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:36.179
So the magnitude of our vertical component

00:11:36.179 --> 00:11:37.679
is equal to three.

00:11:39.964 --> 00:11:41.218
And then let's do the same thing

00:11:41.218 --> 00:11:43.635
for our horizontal component.

00:11:45.865 --> 00:11:47.948
So now we have five times

00:11:49.734 --> 00:11:52.151
the cosine of 36.899 degrees,

00:11:54.489 --> 00:11:57.780
is, if once again we round it to, I guess,

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.375
our hundredths place,
we get it to being four.

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:03.625
So we get it to being four.

00:12:04.718 --> 00:12:07.737
So we see here is a
situation where we have...

00:12:07.737 --> 00:12:11.243
This is a classic three-four-five
Pythagorean triangle.

00:12:11.243 --> 00:12:15.410
The magnitude of our
horizontal component is four.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.270
The magnitude of our vertical
component, right over here,

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.601
is equal to three.

00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:23.855
And once again, you might say,

00:12:23.855 --> 00:12:27.129
Sal, why are we going
through all of this trouble?

00:12:27.129 --> 00:12:27.962
And we'll see in the next video

00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:30.133
that if we say something has a velocity,

00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:32.641
in this direction, of
five meters per second,

00:12:32.641 --> 00:12:36.426
we could break that down into
two component velocities.

00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:39.096
We could say that that's
going in the upwards direction

00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:40.512
at three meters per second,

00:12:40.512 --> 00:12:43.601
and it's also going to the right
in the horizontal direction

00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:45.342
at four meters per second.

00:12:45.342 --> 00:12:47.107
And it allows us to break up the problem

00:12:47.107 --> 00:12:48.523
into two simpler problems,

00:12:48.523 --> 00:12:50.334
into two one-dimensional problems,

00:12:50.334 --> 00:12:53.313
instead of a bigger two-dimensional one.
