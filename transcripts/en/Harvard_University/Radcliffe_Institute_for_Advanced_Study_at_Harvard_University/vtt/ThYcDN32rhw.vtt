00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.240
- Thanks a lot for this very
nice introduction as usual.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.410
And I'm impressed by the
level you already put in that.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.090
So you've been explaining
quite a few things already.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.670
That's excellent.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.820
And so I'm thankful for
everybody at Radcliffe,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.060
all the staff, everybody there.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.050
It's really a wonderful place
to have years to rest and change

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.430
our minds.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.200
It has been a great
time for me so far,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.500
and I'm really looking
forward to it the coming year.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.720
So I'm here in Radcliffe to
work on the topic of gene

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.520
regulation and gene expression.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.390
It's a very broad
topic, vast topic

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.640
that touch on very
many things in biology.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.290
I would just take
one angle today just

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.960
to give you one example of my
research in this area today.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.590
So first, I'd like to
start by acknowledgments.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.925
Some of the work
I've been presenting

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:08.410
has been done in collaboration
with Frederic Fyon, who

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.510
was a PhD in my lab.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.660
He now did finish his PhD.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.900
And much of what I
will be talking about

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.810
is taken from the PhD
and some other work

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.230
with some collaborator
mentioned here.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.830
So today my talk
here to you is you've

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.920
got to take it like
a desert, right?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.640
We are here to understand
new things perhaps.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.720
I know that most of
you are not biologists,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.330
who I will have to provide a lot
of background material for you

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.000
to understand my point.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.180
So what I can promise
is that it will

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.010
be a certified organic
evolution, the dessert, that it

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.100
will be completely free, of
course, of creation modified

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.300
ideas.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.420
But, you know, there will
be real bits of theory

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.480
into that talk.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.990
And so it might become at
times a little more difficult,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.940
so I will warn you
when it is the case.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.390
And it's a new flavor.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.580
It's new research, something
that has not been presented

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.710
so far or in different parts.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.940
So one of the-- an important
puzzle in modern biology

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.460
is the question,
why eukaryotic gene

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.290
regulation is so overwired?

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.830
So I will explain
many of those terms.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.990
So here on that picture
you see the gene network

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.390
and the regulatory
networks of the genes

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.020
in yeast that have been
depicted with a different set

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.050
of functions in
different colors.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.740
And it's really a
huge complexity.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.300
And it's very
difficult to not only

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.400
to understand what
is going on, but also

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.830
to understand how it came
about in the first place.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.810
Why is it that you've got so
complex regulatory networks

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.515
in eukaryotes especially?

00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:10.830
So that's my question today.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.780
And the answer is, and all my
talk is just in that slide.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.820
So I will just spend my talk
to explain this slide to you.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.870
So it says that in
prokaryotes the haploids--

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.722
I will explain the terms.

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:33.080
Just you've got an overview now.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.990
And you got simple regulation.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.660
In eukaryotes you've got
meiotic sex and recombination.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.700
So I'm seeing an
[INAUDIBLE] that Judy

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.840
mentioned in the introduction.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.550
And you've got also diploidy
and, therefore, complex

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.120
regulation.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.400
So the red arrows
here are intended

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.100
to mean a causal relationship.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.610
And so I won't explain
all those arrows today.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.070
I will mainly explain
this one and this one.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.180
And I will, of course,
give you some background

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.650
to understand what
it's all about.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.060
So we've got to start
with the background part

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.930
about what natural
selection is all about.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.160
And you probably know.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.160
Most of you, I'm sure, know
about Darwinian evolution

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.399
and about natural selection.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.930
The principle of natural
selection is pretty simple.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.977
When you want to understand
why a trait has evolved then

00:04:27.977 --> 00:04:29.560
you've got to
understand three things.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.460
That you've got trait variation,
which is brought by mutation.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.920
That this trait
variation is heritable,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.840
inherited through generations.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.590
And that you've got differential
reproduction or survival

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.040
of individuals carrying
those mutations.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.650
And that's it.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.230
That's pretty simple.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.750
That's just the core
of Darwinian theory.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.250
And here you've got the Gary
Larson explanation of it,

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.730
that shortsightedness is
probably not something

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.010
you would expect to evolve.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.870
So that's the first principle.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.750
And you know-- everybody,
I'm sure, knows about it.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.430
The second principle is that
perhaps on longer timescales,

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.550
like on what we
call macroevolution,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.440
you've got some other
steps going on, right?

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.440
Perhaps rare events
mess things up,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.980
like the extinction of
dinosaurs and things like that.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.804
So here Gary Larson is perhaps
not as good in the explanation,

00:05:28.804 --> 00:05:29.720
but you get the point.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.340
So that's-- most
people, non-biologists,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.970
not evolutionary biologists,
that's what they would see what

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.910
evolution theory is about.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.040
And you may wonder,
well, is that all?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.090
You know, it looks
pretty simple.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.640
You've got very
little principle,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.490
and yet you've got to
explain biodiversity.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.750
You've got so much to explain.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.680
All these life forms,
it's possible to predict

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:10.020
them and all this diversity and
complexity just from this very

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.870
simple principle.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:19.000
And in fact here I quote
a very famous philosopher

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.870
who had this quote about this.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.640
So Wittgenstein had this
quote in a correspondence

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.850
to a friend.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.360
"I have always thought
that Darwin was wrong.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.010
His theory doesn't account for
all of this variety of species.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.490
It hasn't the necessary
multiplicity."

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.040
And in some sense you may argue
with Wittgenstein about this,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.050
and I will do that.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.550
But you know, it looks
difficult perhaps at first sight

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.060
that a very simple process
like natural selection

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.800
would give rise to
complexity or diversity.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.870
Then of course,
natural evolution

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.500
is not just about those small
processes of natural selection.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.730
It's also a big
historical thing, right?

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:12.310
So that's the history
of Earth from here.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.920
And life on Earth, it takes,
like, billions of years,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.800
you've got many, many events.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.500
And so the question
is, is it really

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.020
possible to build an
evolutionary theory that

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.610
would account for that?

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.070
And from such a simple
principle you might think,

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.920
well, perhaps it's
a difficult task.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.580
And in fact, this
problem probably

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.530
expands beyond
evolutionary biology.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.140
Is it possible to make
a theory about history?

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.950
I know we've got
historians in the audience.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.010
And it's a big
question whether we

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.130
could have a theory
about history

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.300
or just to explain things,
or perhaps just see history

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.550
as Shakespeare did in Macbeth.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.700
If life is just a tale
told by an idiot, full

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.700
of sound and fury, signifying
nothing, just trying

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.710
to emphasize the idea
that history is just

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.280
a matter of chance, a
chance of many events.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.870
But there is not much
to explain beyond that.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.500
And so these are very
important critiques

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.390
of evolutionary theory.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:28.060
And but at the same time, so
we will come to those points

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.560
as you will see.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.919
So the questions here are,
is it possible to build

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.090
a historical theory?

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.059
Is it possible to understand
events in the very deep past?

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:44.510
Can evolutionary theory explains
multiplicity or complexity?

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.960
And in fact, many people
have been working on that.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.390
And you know when you talk
about this in general,

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.360
you talk about
major transitions.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.320
Major transitions, here a
picture again by Gary Larson--

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.150
he's a very useful cartoonist--

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.940
where you see when you've
got evolution out of water.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.020
That probably is the
kind of transition people

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.560
think about when you
think major transitions.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.300
But they are not
transitions that are really

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.850
difficult to understand
or the transitions

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:16.710
that people are working on in
evolutionary biology today.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.530
Those are not very
theoretically challenging.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.350
In fact, the major
transitions in evolution

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:30.170
were put forward by this book,
a very famous book in the field,

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:34.310
about 20 years ago,
trying to explain

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.320
what are those big
transitions that we

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.470
need to explain in evolution.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.070
And you've got different kinds.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.650
The first type of transitions
are about becoming of groups.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.010
So when you go from
solitary individuals

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:54.470
to new higher-level individuals
through group formation.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.095
For instance, you go
from a unicellular

00:09:57.095 --> 00:10:00.080
to a multicellular organism,
this type of change.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.780
That's not the type of change
that we'll be talking about.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.160
The second type
of big transition

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.950
is about energy, where
you switch to use

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.180
different kinds of energy.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.630
[INAUDIBLE] the story of Earth.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.470
And the last type of transition
is about genetic systems.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.380
That's the type of
thing I'm working on.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.430
And this type of
transition involves

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.210
things like sex, recombination
meiosis, diploidy.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.880
I will explain some of those
terms and the central dogma.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.510
The central dogma, you
perhaps heard about it.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:37.850
It was put forward by Crick
through the discovery of DNA.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.010
And the logic is
that information

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.560
flow in biological systems
from DNA to RNA to proteins,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.220
as the blue arrow here.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.960
And this central
dogma is about what

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.680
is this flow of information.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.420
And you may ask how did that
structure, that genetic system,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.250
came about in the first place.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:05.940
And that's where the topic of
gene regulation comes in here.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.080
Because gene regulation
is [INAUDIBLE] genes are

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.130
on the DNA, and regulation
because they produce--

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.320
well, you've got this protein
production, and that all you

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.370
regulate those steps.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.790
That's what is gene regulation
and gene expression.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.890
So that's my topic today.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:27.000
And as you will see, it's
connected to the other problem

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.030
for genetic systems.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.200
So briefly so that we can
see where we are in history,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.100
so we are, like, two
billion years ago,

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.060
like the original eukaryotes.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:48.200
Eukaryotes, that's cells
with nuclei, is about here.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.545
Eukaryotes are pretty
much everything you know,

00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:59.360
every big organisms you
know, plants, fungi, animals.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.050
Everything but microbes
are eukaryotes.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.570
And so we are here
interested in understanding

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.410
the evolution of gene regulation
in eukaryotes in comparison

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.570
to in prokaryotes.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.140
Of course, the
origin of eukaryotes

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.830
itself is a very
complex subject.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.620
I will not be going into that.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.380
So that's a prokaryotic cell
and the eukaryotic cells

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.600
differ in many, many ways.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.130
So you've got kind
of a basic type

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.050
of list of differences between
prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:39.280
But their DNA, naked or
not, circular or linear,

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.820
but the presence of organelles
and mitochondria in particular.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.130
The reproduction
is very different.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.460
And that's something I
would like you to remember.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.330
So in eukaryotes
you've got meiosis.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.110
I will explain in a minute.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:58.870
And eukaryotes also
are diploids, which

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.690
is not the case in prokaryotes.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.180
So that's a typical
lifecycle of a eukaryote.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:12.940
You've got that this is how
sex works in eukaryotes.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.770
You've got two events,
meiosis and fertilization.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.140
So that's the two key
events that you find

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.980
in all eukaryotic life cycles.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:28.090
And meiosis is so you've got
these two events, key events,

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.600
separate the life cycle into
two parts, the haploid phase

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.710
and the diploid phase.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.910
So in the diploid, so we
are diploids in this room,

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.440
we have two copies
of a gene, right?

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.010
That's one from the father,
one from your mother.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.830
You are a diploid.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.630
So that's the individual
in this phase.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.520
Then you've got this phase here
where the gametes are haploid,

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.531
right?

00:13:55.531 --> 00:13:56.860
A little warning.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.420
Here at meiosis,
you've got this process

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.480
that Judy mentioned, very
important that you've

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.530
got recombination at that step.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.040
At that step when
gametes are produced,

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.790
then the chromosomes
cross over to produce

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:16.350
a diversity of combination
that is called recombination.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.670
So the next important
difference between prokaryote

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:24.710
and eukaryote is that the gene
regulation is very different.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.340
This one is pretty simple.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.550
This one is very complex.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.680
So how complex it is?

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.620
So that's how it works.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.910
So you've got here
a eukaryotic cell.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.940
That's the nucleus.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.080
You've got the DNA.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.610
The DNA is tightly packed
by proteins in [? stones. ?]

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.520
Then it opens up.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.830
Then you've got what is
called transcription,

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.080
where you've got
some RNA produced

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.060
which is not matured yet.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:59.920
Then you've got RNA processing
export into the cytoplasm.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.720
Then this RNA is
translated into protein.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.250
And you've got a
polypeptide here

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.330
which then becomes a protein
after post-translational

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.000
modifications.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.210
At each of those
steps, you can have

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.280
regulation of gene expression.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.810
Each of those steps.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.010
By various mechanisms.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.540
I won't have time to
detail all of them.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.680
Here I will mostly
focus on the initiation

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.650
of transcription, the
major step here where

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.870
you go from DNA to RNA.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.610
So it looks like
this in the cell.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.220
So imagine this is a chromosome.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.570
So that's DNA.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.095
You've got a gene here.

00:15:46.095 --> 00:15:48.220
Next to that gene you've
got a regulatory sequence,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.920
it's called promoter.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.290
At that site, you've
got an enzyme,

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.900
which is called RNA polymerase.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.530
It's just an enzyme
that will produce RNA

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.720
from the DNA template.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.130
And the way this enzyme
is attracted to that place

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:11.080
really depends on a lot of
other proteins and factors

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.890
that gather here
and make a complex.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:18.430
And this complex,
in fact, depends

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.570
on what is called
enhancers other location

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.830
a little further away
on the chromosome that

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.220
controls the attraction
to those cofactors.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.960
And basically what differs for
the gene regulation for gene A

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.910
or gene B is that the identity,
the sequence of those enhancers

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:36.910
differ mostly.

00:16:39.846 --> 00:16:41.470
The next thing you've
got to understand

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.960
about gene regulation
in eukaryotes

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.820
is that you've got two kinds.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.500
What is called
the cis-regulation

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.650
and trans-regulation.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.110
So that you are in a diploid.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:57.170
You've got this gene,
which is in two copies.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.400
So in yellow here, you've got
the cis-acting sequence, so,

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.590
like, the promoter
or the enhancer, that

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:07.359
will control the expression
level of that gene.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.099
And the control
will be, in part,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:10.910
due to trans-acting
factors, that

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.079
is molecules that float
around in the nucleus that

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.230
will bind to the sequence.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.839
So but the important
point is that if you've

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.760
got a molecule floating
around, it can bind here.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.270
It can also bind here.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:29.860
So tran-acting factors, they
act on both chromosomes.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.440
Whereas cis-acting factors
just only act on the gene

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.610
they are sitting next to.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.880
That's the only
but very important

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.220
difference between
the two things.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.240
So now you know
more or less what

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.330
is a prokaryote, what is an
eukaryote, that the eukaryote

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.080
have meiotic sex.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.680
So we can start, right?

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.380
That was the introduction.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.520
I will start by
explaining this arrow.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.730
Why from when you've got
diploid [INAUDIBLE] meiotic sex,

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.920
you have diploidy evolving.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.860
So why are we diploids?

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.940
Before I get to
that point, you've

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.770
got to understand a
very important feature

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:24.010
of diploid genetics.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:27.070
So in diploids-- well,
in haploids as well.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:30.550
But when you've got mutations,
most mutations are deleterious.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.220
And we all have a lot of
deleterious mutations.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.270
Every organism carry a load
of deleterious mutations.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.370
And it's very important
to understand that when

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.080
a mutation occurs--

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.740
then let's say you've got
an allele as a gene, which

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.460
is big A. Then let's say you got
a deleterious mutation, little

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.040
a, arising in the population.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.410
So you've got three
types of individuals.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.550
The aa.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.930
Aa, and AA.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.990
That's called the heterozygotes
and the homozygotes.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.540
And so that's the three
types of genotypes.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.310
And here if you represent
fitness, or fitness

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.170
as a measure of
evolutionary success,

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.380
then you can say
that as a reference

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:20.150
the AA has a fitness of
1, and that the presence

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.150
of the deleterious allele
at that gene decreases

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.730
the fitness of that
individual by a quantity

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.340
s when it is homozygote.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.620
So when you are in a
heterozygote individual,

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.900
the effect of the mutation
is then 1 minus hs.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.190
And h is called the
dominance of that mutation.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.810
And, in fact, dominance
of deleterious mutation

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.240
has been measured in a huge
variety of organisms and cases

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.140
and situations and genes.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.020
And deleterious mutation
tend to be recessive,

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.170
meaning that h is
below one half.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.330
And in fact, it's about
0.25, one quarter,

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.900
on average across many studies.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.000
So the presence of the
deleterious mutation

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.200
in population cause what
is called a genetic load.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.180
So in the haploid
population, imagine

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.870
you've got deleterious mutation
occurring at the rate u.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.230
Then you've got these
two alleles, Aa.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.840
This one has an
effect on fitness of 1

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.800
minus s as I was
just explaining.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.810
In diploids you've got
twice as many mutations

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.510
because you've got
twice as much DNA.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:39.912
And you've got the fitness of
just explain the produce slide.

00:20:39.912 --> 00:20:41.620
So now you can compute
what the frequency

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.100
of the deleterious mutation
should be in the population.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.460
And as an approximation,
the frequency

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.210
of the deleterious
mutation is about U over s

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.140
in an haploid population,
and is about 2U over hs.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.000
H is dominant in the
diploid population.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.660
So it means that that's the
frequency at which you'll

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.130
find those mutations.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:08.590
Now you may want to
ask, but what reduction

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.400
of fitness overall, on
average in the population

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.790
is caused by the presence of
those deleterious mutations?

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.580
So well, that's just the
frequency of those mutations

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.470
times their effect.

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.540
So if you multiply
their effect--

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.690
and here they are mostly
found as heterozygote

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.550
because they are rare--

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.650
you'll find this
very famous results.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.870
In fact, it goes back
to almost a century

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.900
now, that the
genetic load, meaning

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.290
the reduction, the fitness
reduction in the population,

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.480
due to deleterious
mutation, just

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.310
depends on the mutation rate.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.990
And it's twice as
big in diploids

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:53.120
because you've got two
times, twice as many genes.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.810
So it is not dependent on
the intensity of selection

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.240
on those deleterious alleles.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:04.910
So because this load is
twice as large in diploids,

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.310
meaning that you know the
average fitness of diploids

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.890
should be lower all the time
than the average fitness

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:16.850
of haploids, you
may think, well,

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.440
why did diploids evolve
in the first place

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.285
if their average fitness
is lower than haploids?

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:29.800
Well, that's a
difficult problem.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.880
And in fact, to understand
what's going on we've

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.130
got to turn to something
you probably know.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.740
You know that story
about the selfish gene.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.760
You probably heard about
it as a popular idea

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.490
popularized by Richard Dawkins.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.130
Just meaning that to understand
what's going on in evolution,

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.490
you've got to think about not
only in terms of individuals

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:56.900
like the usual Darwinian way
is all about, but also in terms

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.070
of genes.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.670
And so that's just a
way to look at things.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.520
No, there is no difference.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.760
And it may offer clear
insights, but it's just

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.940
a matter of perspective.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.960
And so we're going to
practice that this afternoon

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.200
a little bit.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.820
So to practice we
make a little model.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.650
We imagine you've
got the same gene

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.650
as before with the same
fitness effect, the same story.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.090
And now you think that
there is another gene.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:35.820
And this other gene
changes in the life cycle

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.770
how much time you
spend in the diploid

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.650
or in the haploid phase.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.570
That's all it does.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:46.980
And you wonder will that
gene increase in frequency

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.230
or will it decrease in
frequency in the population.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.720
Meaning will it evolve--
or diploidies will

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.460
evolve or haploidy will evolve.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:02.130
That's the way you
solve that problem.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:06.630
And if you do that, so you've
got this [INAUDIBLE] model.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:09.480
And they recombine-- you've got
recombination between the two

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:15.720
genes at the rate R. When you
analyze this model, that's

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.970
the result. That's
the recombination

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.600
rate between the two loci.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.040
And that's the dominance
of the mutation.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:28.510
I told you that the dominance
of the deleterious mutation

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.820
is about one quarter,
so about here.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.160
And so if recombination
is quite high,

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.890
so that is if you
are in this red area,

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:40.800
and that's where most
eukaryotic organisms are,

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.860
you'd expect diploidy to evolve.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:52.330
Despite the fact that it reduces
mean fitness in the population.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.850
That's perhaps-- that
there is a trick.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.710
So what's the trick?

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.410
So I can put up an equation.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.170
Of course it won't
explain to you the trick.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:05.840
So I will try to use
metaphors, of course,

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.410
to explain to you the result.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.580
Well, the first
metaphor is the metaphor

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.440
you've got a double-edged sword.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.260
You've got two problems here.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.360
The first problem,
the first edge,

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.530
is that it's good to mask
deleterious mutations.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.260
When you are a
diploid, you don't

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.220
feel the deleterious
mutation as hard

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.970
just because they are
masked, because they

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.910
are partially recessive.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.910
So perhaps it's a good thing.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:37.970
At the the same time, if these
mutations are masked and hidden

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.130
to selection, you know they will
accumulate in the population.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.760
So perhaps it's not
such a good thing.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.910
But you've got to
weigh those two ideas.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.620
So how do you do?

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:54.190
Well, that's where the
second metaphor comes in.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:58.380
And that's where we try to
practice the selfish gene idea.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.450
So imagine that for a minute
you are a selfish gene causing

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.060
a little bit more of diploidy.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.344
And you arrive in a population
where you've got only haploids.

00:26:10.344 --> 00:26:11.010
What's going on?

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.170
Well, first you
enter a population

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.500
because you've got haploids
where deleterious mutations are

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.815
very efficiently purged
out of the population.

00:26:21.815 --> 00:26:25.020
So it's quite a
nice place to be.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.760
Not so many deleterious
mutations around.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.450
And if you are unlucky
enough to have,

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.120
to be associated with such
a deleterious mutation,

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.690
it's not a big deal either
because precisely you

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.264
are a diploid.

00:26:41.264 --> 00:26:42.930
You are a diploid
individual because you

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.600
are a gene causing diploidy.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.150
As a consequence, you
don't feel the effect

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.567
of that mutation too hard.

00:26:50.567 --> 00:26:51.650
It's not such a bad thing.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.950
But this mutation will not be
weeded out of the population

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.010
because you are
a diploid, right?

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:07.690
The trick is that if
recombination is large enough,

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.210
this deleterious mutation
which is still around--

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.910
no, it was not eliminated
in the population--

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.640
will be a burden to
everyone in the population.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.440
Not only in you as a
gene causing diploidy.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.210
So what's going on, in fact--

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.780
because recombination,
you know re-sort genes.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:29.070
So what's going on is that you
enjoy the benefit of masking

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.750
the deleterious mutation.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.010
But you share the cost
with everybody else

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:35.960
in the pollution.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:40.654
It's no surprise that
such a strategy evolves.

00:27:40.654 --> 00:27:42.970
Oh, there was a
part of the talk.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:46.420
There was another
part like that.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.640
So that's where you
probably get the idea what

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.890
is the selfish gene
idea is all about.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.050
You start thinking a little
bit more clearly about what's

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.210
going on when you take
the perspective of a gene

00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.800
to exist off that.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.970
Even if it's just a device that
you use to make things clear.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.730
Of course, the
third metaphor here

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.330
is that natural
selection here is not

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:16.850
optimizing average
fitness in the population.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.190
So on average, you
know the fitness

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:20.920
in the population
across [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:26.200
is reduced by natural selection.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.750
So if you like the invisible
hand of natural selection,

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.540
to take an economical
metaphor, it's

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.670
not maximizing average fitness.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:38.190
And that's something
that you've got

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.750
to remember about most
situation about evolution.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.260
It's not so simple.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.620
Summary of this first part.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.460
If there is recombination
in the population,

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.910
if deleterious mutation are
at least partially recessive,

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.060
then it follows that
diploidy is favored.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.050
Meaning that if you consider
a gene that extends diploidy,

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.270
it will prevail.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.760
And this evolution is
to lower average fitness

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.140
of the population.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.190
But that's a side effect.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:19.350
So when you've
got recombination,

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.780
you evolve diploidy.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.980
Well, now I'm trying
to-- will try and spend

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.290
the last of the part
of the talk to explain

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:28.800
to you the relationship
between diploidy and complex

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.150
regulation.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:35.560
So the evolution of gene
regulation in diploids.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.510
So we go back to
diploid expression.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.240
So here again we've got
a gene with two alleles

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.700
with deleterious mutation.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.937
We've got a cis-acting
regulator in yellow

00:29:45.937 --> 00:29:47.020
and a trans-acting factor.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.440
And they contribute to produce
proteins, some of which

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.660
are green because they are
produced from that allele.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.034
Some are blue because they
are produced from that allele.

00:29:58.338 --> 00:30:02.460
And they are kind of roughly
producing the same amount.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:09.429
Because they've got the same
regulatory sequence in this.

00:30:09.429 --> 00:30:11.220
Now, what's going on
if you've got mutation

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.690
in the cis-regulatory sequence?

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.390
Imagine you've got a
cis-acting factor which

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:20.340
is a little bit more efficient
at attracting the transcription

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:24.680
factors, like this or here.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.660
If this stronger--
let's call it stronger--

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:33.480
cis-regulator is close
to the allele, little a,

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.240
then you will produce more
of little a protein, more

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.435
of the green protein.

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:40.980
If this cis-regulator
is stronger,

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.372
the stronger cis-regulator
is close to the big A,

00:30:43.372 --> 00:30:45.330
then you will produce
more of the blue protein.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.860
And not 50/50.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.970
And in fact, when people
go out and measure

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.730
in using transcriptomics
for instance,

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:55.500
almost you've got imbalance
between expression,

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.980
in allelic expression,
you'll find a lot.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.220
So that's an example
where quite old studies,

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.560
early days of transcriptomics,
where you got nearly half

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.470
of the genes where
you've got more

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.260
than a two-fold difference
in the expression

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.300
level between the two
[INAUDIBLE] allele.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.010
So now you've got to think
about the same thing,

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.280
but in terms of what are
the consequences on fitness

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.690
for the individual?

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.840
So imagine as before
that the little a

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.635
is a deleterious mutation.

00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:30.260
Then if you produce more of the
deleterious mutation, of course

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.870
the fitness would be reduced.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.990
And if you produce
less of it, then it

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:36.790
would be a little higher.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:40.420
So in effect, variation
in the cis-regulator

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.920
will cause a variation in the
dominance of that mutation.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.710
So dominance here would
be a little bit higher.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:49.750
And here it will be
a little bit lower.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.195
So you want to ask,
if you've got this--

00:31:57.195 --> 00:31:59.700
if you've got mutation
on those sequences,

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.310
then you will have
allele-specific expression.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.800
Then you would have
changes in the dominance.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:09.250
So what are the evolutionary
consequences of that?

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:13.810
So we go back to this
expression to fitness graph,

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:17.860
where here imagine you've got
the fraction of expression

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.280
of this little a.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.740
So where you
[INAUDIBLE] heterzygote,

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.420
you still reproduce
50/50 of each protein.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:33.100
Then you've got the same as
before, a dominance of h.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.140
If the stronger
cis-regulator is close

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.850
to the deleterious
mutation, then you

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.310
will produce a little
bit more of that protein.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:41.530
And therefore the fitness
would be a little bit more

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:45.220
reduced because you've got more
of that deleterious mutation--

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:48.650
of that defective
protein, sorry.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:49.860
So that's the 2 value.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.770
Because this
function is concave,

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.290
you've got this property
which is inevitable

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:01.310
that you've got the average
of those two dominance

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:06.180
here will be larger than the
h values you started with.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:10.210
That is a detail you
will see later perhaps.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:15.070
And next, you do a model as
we did for the diploidy case.

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:16.780
You put exactly the
same ingredient.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:20.580
You've got deleterious mutation,
then you've got the fitness.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:24.900
And you introduce a new allele
that causes a little bit more

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.340
of expression or less.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:32.230
And you see what's going
on, what's the outcome.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.540
So if you look at the outcome
for a weaker cis-regulator,

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:41.550
that's the result. That's
the log recombination

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.850
is the distance between
cis-regulator and the gene.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.670
In logs, so meaning that it's
very close to the gene here

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:51.126
and it's quite far here.

00:33:51.126 --> 00:33:52.500
And that's a
neutral expectation.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.810
So that's a way that's a way to
measure evolutionary success.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.690
You compare the fate
of an allele that's

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:01.160
reducing the population in
one copy, to the probability

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.740
of fixation of an allele which
is neutral, does nothing.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.740
And you compare the two.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.690
If the fixation is
lower than neutral,

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.690
it means it's selected against.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:15.010
When it's above neutrality,
it means it's favored.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:20.590
So as you can see here, the
cis-regulator is always weaker.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.920
A weaker cis-regulator
is always disfavored.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.980
In contrast, a
stronger cis-regulator

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:30.880
is always favored
except when it's

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.797
too far away from the gene in
terms of recombination here.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.480
So stronger enhancers,
stronger cis-regulator

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.600
are always favored if they
are close enough to their gene

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.270
that they regulate.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:51.120
Of course, you've got a lot of
models you can do about this.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.030
And again, the metaphorical
explanation of what's going on

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:57.870
is simply that you've got--

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:01.370
as in the diploidy model,
you've got two effects.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.340
One of masking and
one of purging.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.410
The masking effect is always--
so it's always a bad thing

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.620
to have a new cis-regulator
in the population,

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.345
because it increases
average dominance.

00:35:15.345 --> 00:35:17.740
These mutations
are more exposed,

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.290
are more visible to selection.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:23.312
It reduces mean
fitness of individual.

00:35:23.312 --> 00:35:29.810
But stronger enhancers,
stronger cis-regulator,

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.360
then you know they will--

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.320
the gene that sits
next to them will

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.040
be more visible to selection,
more exposed to selection.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.850
And therefore better purged
from deleterious mutation.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.630
And so on average those
stronger regulators

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.590
will find themselves always
on good genetic background,

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.034
if you like.

00:35:51.034 --> 00:35:52.450
And that's the
reason they spread.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:36:00.420
And in fact, they spread
indefinitely in this model.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.000
There is what is
called a runaway.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.180
There is no reason, except
if you put it in the model,

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.060
that this process will stop.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.070
It will go forever.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:13.460
Cis-regulator will go further--

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.190
increasing strength further
and further and further.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.920
There is no limit,
at least f model.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.600
But it's like you run and you
keep staying at the same place.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.430
Because diploidy did not change,
dominance did not change.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.010
After the spread of a
stronger cis-regulator,

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.930
you are back to
the same situation

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.110
where you've got
50/50 expression,

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.640
deleterious mutation
of the same effect.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.800
Everything's the same
except that you've

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.870
got constant evolution on
this cis-regulatory region.

00:36:47.337 --> 00:36:49.170
And of course, the
strength of cis-regulator

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.450
you can see in different--
it can be different things.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:53.700
It can be that
the sequence where

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.550
you've got the matching between
the cis-regulatory region

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:59.790
and the transcription
factor [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:05.400
It can also be that you've got a
duplication of those sequences,

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.790
or that these sequences start to
attract different transcription

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:10.290
factor just to
increase in strength.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.220
Of course you may think,
well, but if the strength

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.200
of cis-regulator
increases and increases,

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.200
perhaps it pushes
expression levels up.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.225
And perhaps that's
not such a good thing.

00:37:28.225 --> 00:37:29.850
If you've got a
stronger cis-regulator,

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.890
perhaps you push
too many proteins,

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:34.350
and perhaps that's
not a good thing.

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:36.440
And in fact, when
you model this,

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.360
so you introduce the
idea that if you depart

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.520
from an optimal
quantity of protein

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:45.332
produced you've got
a fitness penalty--

00:37:45.332 --> 00:37:48.660
so that the optimal
production of a protein

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.320
and that the expression you
achieve, if it's too large

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.620
then it's not good, if it's
too low, it's not good either.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:38:00.560
And you can introduce other loci
that contribute to expression,

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.390
total expression.

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:03.250
So I will just give you
a very brief example

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:09.360
where a second locus is another
cis-regulatory sequence.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.810
In that case, I'll
just jump here.

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:17.140
So you introduce the first
cis-regulator at that point

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:18.200
here.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:23.660
So it reached some
value and it stops

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.170
because expression level
increased too much,

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.370
and it's deleterious.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:32.260
At that point, you introduce
mutation on the second locus.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.120
And what's going on is that
they each evolve in combination

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.850
to compensate each other.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.950
So you've got co-evolution
of all the regulators

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:43.460
together so that the expression
level stays the same.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.550
Yet you've got
permanent and very quick

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:48.813
evolution of all
those sequences.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.650
So that's summary of part II.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.810
If there is diploidy,
if deleterious mutation

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:59.570
are partially recessive,
then cis-regulator

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:03.260
evolve in a runaway fashion
that triggers co-evolution

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.090
of other regulators.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.480
And so regulatory
complexity emerges

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:13.480
selectively and not because
of individual advantage here.

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:18.980
Though we are done
with that slide,

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.360
so I jump to my conclusions.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.320
First, this theory-- in
fact, I didn't have time

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.100
to explain all the
other theories that

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.040
were [INAUDIBLE] around
about the evolution

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.320
of evolutionary complexity.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.830
Most of which can be summarized
by saying that complexity

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:38.470
is more maladaptive,
is just arising

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.780
in small populations
because of the fixation

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.130
of deleterious mutations.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.640
So this theory
here is not at all

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:50.230
about this fixation, this
maladaptive complexity.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:53.800
It's not really an adaptive
in the Darwinian sense

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.950
that you've got an optimization
of some individual level

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:58.570
properties.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:01.660
But it's Darwinian--
you've got selection here

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.880
just because you've got
genes that are favored

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.080
and that spread because
of natural selection.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.670
So it associates diploidy
and regulatory complexity

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.710
explicitly, explaining
perhaps better

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.380
why you find this
regulatory complexity

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:23.530
in eukaryotes and not in
prokaryote, which are haploid.

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:30.200
And it emphasizes
genetic conflicts

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.260
as a major engine of evolution.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:39.330
It results in just [INAUDIBLE],,
as you could imagine.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:41.470
So in evolution of
biology we often

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:45.040
use a metaphor of the Red
Queen taken from Lewis Caroll's

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.990
book, where now here you see
it takes all the running you

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:51.900
can do to keep in
the same place,

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.955
says this Red Queen to Alice.

00:40:53.955 --> 00:40:55.830
You think that you've
got to run faster, just

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.620
stays in the same place.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:03.290
Or if you prefer in
movies, everything

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:05.720
needs to change so
everything can stay the same.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.620
It's the same idea.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:11.480
That you've got here a lot of
evolution which is going on.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.240
But you know, on the surface
at the individual level,

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.225
you barely notice.

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.310
So if I can sketch
a very quick history

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:23.880
of eukaryotic evolution.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.280
So you first had this
first gene controlled

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.630
by cis-regulatory region.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.450
Because of the process
I was explaining,

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:35.930
it increases in
strength, it multiplies.

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:38.720
But a lot of complexity in
the regulatory cis-regulatory

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.420
region emerging.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.460
At some point, you go-- you
lack some transcription factor.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.650
There's not enough of
them to go further.

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:55.040
And perhaps you mutate here to
get some new, better strengths

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.305
of the cis-regulatory region.

00:41:58.305 --> 00:41:59.680
And that's the
point where you've

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.500
got the evolution of
this overwired regulation

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:04.660
in eukaryotes.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:11.850
So here we are, you know,
like one billion years ago.

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:14.210
Of course then you can add
all sorts of consequences

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:15.810
of this process.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:19.610
And for instance, you can
imagine that the whole region

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:21.380
here is duplicated.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.600
And now you've got two
versions of that gene.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.640
That because you've
got such a complexity

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.290
in the regulatory region.

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:30.650
It's fairly easy to
evolve, for instance,

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:36.310
tissue-specific expression where
you just switch off different

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:40.340
cis-regulator in different
tissue so that you've got--

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.200
in multicellular
organisms you can

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.370
evolve different
tissue and different--

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:48.080
and what is called development.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.427
All right, so that is
what I wanted to say.

00:42:52.427 --> 00:42:54.260
I've been explaining
those different arrows.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:58.120
I'm working on some
more integrated project

00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.250
here at Radcliffe.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.580
We don't have time to
talk about everything.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:04.880
And I'll finish by
quoting about, of course,

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.310
you know Wittgensten.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:13.190
I think that you can see that
genetic conflicts can generate

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.930
a lot of complexity and
a lot of multiplicities

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:18.200
that you would not
expect if you just

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:23.120
think in terms of kind of naive
Darwinian view of evolution.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.630
Of course it's more difficult
to disagree with Shakespeare.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.350
And I've just put
in green the parts

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:33.940
where I think you can read
a little of what he said.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:35.660
Thank you.
