00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:03.532
- [Voiceover] So this video
is about the short answer

00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:07.433
section on the AP U.S. history exam.

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:11.080
So this is a real practice
problem from the AP exam

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.331
and I'd like to go through
it step-by-step with you

00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:16.768
to give you an idea of how to approach

00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:19.207
these problems really well.

00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:21.482
So each of the short answer problems is

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:24.941
three questions long and they all discuss

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:28.564
one facet of American history.

00:00:28.564 --> 00:00:30.747
And so your job in these questions is not

00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:32.860
to try to write an essay,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.181
but merely to just answer A, B, and C,

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:38.432
which will be related to each other,

00:00:38.432 --> 00:00:40.058
and you have about the front of one

00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:41.823
blue book page to do this,

00:00:41.823 --> 00:00:44.447
so really no more than 200 words.

00:00:44.447 --> 00:00:45.794
And what's great about these

00:00:45.794 --> 00:00:48.835
is that there are many right answers.

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:52.040
They're asking you to
display your knowledge

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.245
about a topic in the past,

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:56.543
but what parts of that
knowledge you display

00:00:56.543 --> 00:00:57.868
is up to you.

00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:00.235
So that means you can really
play to your strengths.

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:01.746
Bring up the thing that you know.

00:01:01.746 --> 00:01:04.508
You don't have to worry
about knowing everything.

00:01:04.508 --> 00:01:07.644
Just enough to answer a few questions.

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:09.803
So let's read this
question and we're gonna

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.312
read it really carefully,

00:01:11.312 --> 00:01:14.029
which you'll see is important
for a number of reasons.

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:17.117
So answer A. B, and C.

00:01:17.117 --> 00:01:21.342
A, "Briefly explain one
example of how contact

00:01:21.342 --> 00:01:24.082
"between Native Americans and Europeans

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:26.953
"brought changes to
Native American societies

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:30.994
"in the period 1492 to 1700."

00:01:30.994 --> 00:01:33.315
Now this is really important.

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:36.172
Making sure that you know the date range

00:01:36.172 --> 00:01:38.076
that you're being asked to write about

00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:40.444
is really key to giving a good answer

00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:42.789
because we could talk
about Native American

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.528
history in American society
really right up to the present,

00:01:46.528 --> 00:01:51.036
so 1700 is our end date.

00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:55.145
B, "Briefly explain a second
example of how contact

00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:57.919
"between Native Americans and Europeans

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:00.723
"brought changes to
Native American societies

00:02:00.723 --> 00:02:02.257
"in the same period."

00:02:02.257 --> 00:02:05.183
And C, "Briefly explain one example of how

00:02:05.183 --> 00:02:08.364
"Native American societies resisted change

00:02:08.364 --> 00:02:12.172
"brought by contact with
Europeans in the same period."

00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:14.819
All right, so basically
what we're being asked here

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.551
is to give two examples of change

00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:24.426
and one example of
resistance to that change.

00:02:27.474 --> 00:02:28.727
Now the way I see it,

00:02:28.727 --> 00:02:31.444
we have one really important stricture

00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:32.954
like I mentioned already,

00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:35.438
which is that we can only
talk about the period

00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:39.849
in-between European
contact and the year 1700.

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.335
So that means a lot of
things that you might

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:45.956
want to be talking about
from the 1800s and 1900s

00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:48.859
you can't here, because you
won't get credit for it.

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.553
So we're talking about
the period long before

00:02:51.553 --> 00:02:53.202
the American Revolution,

00:02:53.202 --> 00:02:55.778
long before even the
French and Indian War,

00:02:55.778 --> 00:02:57.242
Seven Years' War.

00:02:57.242 --> 00:03:00.120
So this is really early contact.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.046
But the question actually
doesn't give any strictures

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:05.229
about societies,

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:07.993
so we could talk about Native Americans

00:03:07.993 --> 00:03:10.617
in North America at large,

00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:14.006
we could talk about Native
Americans in Jamestown,

00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:17.767
or we could talk about
Native Americans in Mexico.

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:20.391
We could talk about Native Americans

00:03:20.391 --> 00:03:24.084
and the French in the
Northwest Territories,

00:03:24.084 --> 00:03:26.987
so our geography is really broad here.

00:03:26.987 --> 00:03:29.936
It's our timeline that's relatively short.

00:03:29.936 --> 00:03:32.118
So let's brainstorm
what we could talk about

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:34.579
for answers A or B.

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.576
Well, we could mention,

00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:40.036
I think an excellent
example would be disease.

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:45.446
Native Americans experienced an epidemic

00:03:45.446 --> 00:03:49.185
of disease related to pathogens
brought over by Europeans,

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:52.853
so you could talk about disease
really reshaped society,

00:03:52.853 --> 00:03:56.453
particularly there were morning wars

00:03:57.983 --> 00:03:59.863
in the Northeast,

00:03:59.863 --> 00:04:02.836
where Native Americans
would raid New England

00:04:02.836 --> 00:04:06.250
settlements trying to find
replacements for the people

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.363
who had died in disease.

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:11.125
You could also talk about trade

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:15.375
and for example horses

00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:17.720
might be a good example of this.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.717
The Spanish brought
horses to the New World,

00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:22.202
which completely changed the form

00:04:22.202 --> 00:04:25.174
of transportation and wealth for a lot

00:04:25.174 --> 00:04:28.772
of Native American societies
on the Great Plains.

00:04:28.772 --> 00:04:30.467
What else could we talk about?

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:33.022
Well, we could also mention labor.

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:34.903
The Spanish tried to implement a system

00:04:34.903 --> 00:04:37.829
of encomienda labor,

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:41.080
which would grant land to the Spanish

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.191
for Native Americans to labor upon

00:04:44.191 --> 00:04:46.954
in a system of slavery.

00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:49.973
You might also talk about gender roles

00:04:49.973 --> 00:04:53.363
and intermarriage between

00:04:53.363 --> 00:04:57.194
Native Americans and Europeans

00:04:57.194 --> 00:05:00.676
which changed racial patterns

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:04.903
and created new racial caste systems

00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:06.784
and also changed the way that women

00:05:06.784 --> 00:05:09.269
were often viewed in
Native American societies,

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:11.544
often resulting in them having less power

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:14.331
than they did before
the Europeans arrived.

00:05:14.331 --> 00:05:15.793
When you're thinking about how to answer

00:05:15.793 --> 00:05:16.978
these types of questions,

00:05:16.978 --> 00:05:18.975
one of the most useful things you can do

00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:22.590
is think about race,

00:05:23.595 --> 00:05:27.421
class and gender.

00:05:28.308 --> 00:05:30.352
These are things that
historians think about

00:05:30.352 --> 00:05:32.024
all the time,

00:05:32.024 --> 00:05:34.509
and what they mean by
these things is to say

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.970
how does a certain issue affect

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.687
say white people differently than it might

00:05:39.687 --> 00:05:41.961
affect black people?

00:05:41.961 --> 00:05:43.772
Or Native American people

00:05:43.772 --> 00:05:46.234
differently than it
might affect Europeans?

00:05:46.234 --> 00:05:49.276
Or does this affect rich people

00:05:49.276 --> 00:05:52.179
more than it affects poor people?

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:54.640
And that might also include people who

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.089
own a factory, for example,

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.480
versus the people who work in a factory

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.988
or labor in a factory.

00:06:04.988 --> 00:06:06.381
And lastly, you might think about whether

00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:10.073
something affects men or women differently

00:06:10.073 --> 00:06:14.363
or people of different gender
expressions or sexualities.

00:06:14.363 --> 00:06:17.034
So if you're stuck on what to write,

00:06:17.034 --> 00:06:19.867
take some time to think
about how a certain event

00:06:19.867 --> 00:06:23.209
may have affected anyone
in these three groups

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:25.880
differently than another group.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.876
All right, so we answered
the first two questions,

00:06:28.876 --> 00:06:32.033
and you'll see that any one of these

00:06:32.033 --> 00:06:34.542
is a perfectly appropriate answer

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:38.048
and you only have to
talk about one for each.

00:06:38.048 --> 00:06:40.509
And for each of these I would really only

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:42.808
just write one sentence.

00:06:42.808 --> 00:06:45.988
Make sure that that
sentence gets at the heart

00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:48.079
of what it is that you're trying to say.

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:52.072
For example, don't just write, "Disease,"

00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:55.950
but rather write a sentence that says,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.829
"The introduction of pathogens brought

00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:02.150
"from the Old World to the New affected

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.658
"Native American societies by drastically

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:07.908
"reducing their populations
and their settlement patterns."

00:07:07.908 --> 00:07:09.952
All right, let's pause here for now

00:07:09.952 --> 00:07:13.401
and in the next video we'll tackle part C.
