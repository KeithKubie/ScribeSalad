00:00:00.417 --> 00:00:01.972
- [Voiceover] So let's say
you were to go to a restaurant

00:00:01.972 --> 00:00:03.942
and just out of curiosity you want to see

00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:06.978
what the makeup of the
ages at the restaurant are.

00:00:06.978 --> 00:00:08.302
So you go around the restaurant

00:00:08.302 --> 00:00:10.483
and you write down everyone's age.

00:00:10.483 --> 00:00:12.435
And so these are the ages of everyone

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.593
in the restaurant at that moment.

00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:17.566
And so you're interested
in somehow presenting this,

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.935
somehow visualizing the
distribution of the ages,

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:21.095
because you want just say, well,

00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:22.303
are there more young people?

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:23.300
Are there more teenagers?

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.393
Are there more middle-aged people?

00:00:24.393 --> 00:00:26.065
Are there more seniors here?

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:27.526
And so when you just look at these numbers

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:29.361
it really doesn't give
you a good sense of it.

00:00:29.361 --> 00:00:31.544
It's just a bunch of numbers.

00:00:31.544 --> 00:00:33.620
And so how could you do that?

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.915
Well one way to think about it,

00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:38.003
is to put these ages
into different buckets,

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:39.838
and then to think about how many people

00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:41.486
are there in each of those buckets?

00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:42.647
Or sometimes someone might say

00:00:42.647 --> 00:00:44.575
how many in each of those bins?

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:46.083
So let's do that.

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:48.788
So let's do buckets or categories.

00:00:49.358 --> 00:00:50.970
So, I like,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.402
sometimes it's called a bin.

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:56.723
So the bucket, I like to think
of it more of as a bucket,

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.440
the bucket and then the
number in the bucket.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.406
The number in the bucket.

00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:05.602
Number, I'll just write the number, oops.

00:01:06.534 --> 00:01:08.017
It's the, oops.

00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:10.317
It's the number (laughing),

00:01:10.317 --> 00:01:12.176
it's the number in the bucket.

00:01:12.176 --> 00:01:13.057
Alright.

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:14.196
So let's just make buckets.

00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:15.565
Let's make them 10 year ranges.

00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:19.629
So let's say the first
one is ages zero to nine.

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:21.109
So how many people...

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.943
Why don't we just define
all of the buckets here?

00:01:22.943 --> 00:01:25.719
So the next one is ages 10 to 19,

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.697
then 20 to 29, then 30 to 39,

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:35.420
and 40 to 49, 50 to 59,

00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:37.909
let me make sure you
can read that properly,

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.045
then you have 60 to 69.

00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:41.531
And I think that covers everyone.

00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:44.363
I don't see anyone 70
years old or older here.

00:01:44.363 --> 00:01:45.640
So then how many people fall into

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.916
the zero to nine-year-old bucket?

00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:52.141
Well it's gonna be one, two, three,

00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:57.133
four, five, six people
fall into that bucket.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.566
How many people fall into the...

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:02.980
How many people fall into
the 10 to 19-year-old bucket?

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.628
Well, let's see.

00:02:04.628 --> 00:02:06.709
One, two,

00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:09.173
three.

00:02:09.173 --> 00:02:11.008
Three people.

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:12.215
And I think you see where this is going.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.001
What about 20 to 29?

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.833
So that's one, two, three,

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:21.874
four, five people.

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:23.918
Five people fall into that bucket.

00:02:23.918 --> 00:02:26.959
Alright, what about 30 to 39?

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.187
We have one, and that's it.

00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:35.136
Only one person in that 30 to
39 bin or bucket or category.

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:38.842
Alright, what about 40 to 49?

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:41.953
We have one, two people.

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:44.089
Two people are in that bucket.

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:47.456
And then 50 to 59.

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:50.567
Let's see, you have one, two people.

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:51.938
Two people.

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:55.861
And then finally, finally, ages 60-69.

00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:57.301
Let me do that in a different color.

00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:58.810
60 to 69.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.688
There is one person, right over there.

00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:04.173
So this is one way of thinking about

00:03:04.173 --> 00:03:06.032
how the ages are distributed,
but let's actually

00:03:06.032 --> 00:03:10.466
make a visualization of this.

00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:12.114
And the visualization
that we're gonna create,

00:03:12.114 --> 00:03:13.896
this is called a histogram.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:16.241
Histogram.

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:18.867
Histogram.

00:03:18.867 --> 00:03:20.027
We're taking data that can take on

00:03:20.027 --> 00:03:22.164
a whole bunch of different values,

00:03:22.164 --> 00:03:23.627
we're putting them into categories,

00:03:23.627 --> 00:03:24.694
and then we're gonna plot how many

00:03:24.694 --> 00:03:26.599
folks are in each category.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.224
How big are each of those?

00:03:28.224 --> 00:03:30.198
How big are each of those categories?

00:03:30.198 --> 00:03:32.635
And actually, I wrote histogram.

00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:35.723
I wrote histograph, I should
have written histogram.

00:03:35.723 --> 00:03:38.348
So a histogram. So let's do this.

00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:39.555
Alright.

00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:42.458
So on this axis, let's see,
the largest category has six.

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:45.314
So this the number, number of folks.

00:03:45.314 --> 00:03:48.302
And it's gonna go one, two, three,

00:03:48.302 --> 00:03:50.971
four, five, six.

00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:55.220
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.568
This is the number.

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:59.586
And on this axis I'm
gonna make the buckets.

00:03:59.586 --> 00:04:01.629
The buckets, and let me
scroll up a little bit.

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:02.720
Now that I have my data here,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.019
I don't have to look at my data set again.

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.319
So I have one bucket.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.281
This is going to be the
zero to nine bucket,

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.349
right over here.

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.766
Zero to nine.

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:15.783
Then I'm going to have the three...

00:04:15.783 --> 00:04:17.595
Actually, let me just plot them,

00:04:17.595 --> 00:04:18.919
since I have my pen that color.

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.814
So in zero to nine there are six people.

00:04:21.722 --> 00:04:25.507
Zero to nine, there are six people.

00:04:25.507 --> 00:04:27.475
So I'll just plot it like that.

00:04:28.405 --> 00:04:31.167
And then we have the 10 to 19.

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:32.678
There are three people.

00:04:32.678 --> 00:04:37.461
So 10 to 19, there are three people.

00:04:37.461 --> 00:04:40.333
So I'll do a bar, like this.

00:04:41.983 --> 00:04:45.432
Then, 20 to 29, I have five people.

00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:51.035
20 to 29, which is gonna be this one,

00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:53.751
just getting, I'm writing too big.

00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:57.697
So 20 to 29 is gonna be this bar.

00:04:57.697 --> 00:04:59.197
There's five people.

00:04:59.997 --> 00:05:01.480
Five people there.

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.074
So it'll look like this.

00:05:04.896 --> 00:05:06.117
I should have made the bars wide enough

00:05:06.117 --> 00:05:07.278
so I could write below them.

00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:09.848
But I've already, that
train has already left.

00:05:10.548 --> 00:05:12.149
(laughing) Alright, alright.

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:14.425
Then 30 to 39, I'll try to write smaller.

00:05:14.425 --> 00:05:18.418
30 to 39, that's gonna be
this bar right over here.

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:20.299
We have one person.

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:21.825
One person.

00:05:23.358 --> 00:05:25.773
And then we have 40 to 49.

00:05:25.773 --> 00:05:27.305
We have two people.

00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:30.998
40 to 49, two people.

00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:32.919
So, it looks like this.

00:05:33.918 --> 00:05:35.985
40 to 49, two people.

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:38.447
Almost there. 50 to 59.

00:05:38.447 --> 00:05:39.885
We have two people.

00:05:39.885 --> 00:05:44.290
50 to 59, we also have two people.

00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:47.404
So that's that right over there.

00:05:47.404 --> 00:05:48.658
That's this category.

00:05:48.658 --> 00:05:51.538
And then finally, 60 to
69 we have one person.

00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:55.833
60 to 69, we have one person.

00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:57.564
We have one person.

00:05:57.564 --> 00:05:59.353
And what I have just constructed,

00:05:59.353 --> 00:06:00.955
I took our data.

00:06:00.955 --> 00:06:02.325
I took our data.

00:06:02.325 --> 00:06:04.609
I put it into buckets that
are kind of representative

00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:06.118
of the categories I care about.

00:06:06.118 --> 00:06:08.250
Zero to nine is kind of young kids.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.293
10 to 19, I guess you
could call them adolescents

00:06:10.293 --> 00:06:12.057
or roughly teenagers, although, obviously

00:06:12.057 --> 00:06:14.287
if you're 10 you're not
quite a teenager yet.

00:06:14.287 --> 00:06:15.911
And then all the different age groups.

00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:18.443
And then when I counted
the number in each bucket

00:06:18.443 --> 00:06:21.684
and I plotted it, now I
can visually get a sense

00:06:21.684 --> 00:06:24.424
of how are the ages
distributed in this restaurant.

00:06:24.424 --> 00:06:26.351
This must be some type of a restraunt

00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:27.698
that gives away toys or something,

00:06:27.698 --> 00:06:28.858
because there's a lot of younger people.

00:06:28.858 --> 00:06:30.275
Maybe it's very family-friendly.

00:06:30.275 --> 00:06:31.808
So every adult that comes in,

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.269
maybe there's a lot of
young adults with kids,

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.125
or maybe grandparents up here,

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:39.702
and they just bring a lot
of kids to this restaurant.

00:06:39.702 --> 00:06:41.838
So it gives you a view
of what's going on here.

00:06:41.838 --> 00:06:44.786
Just a lot of kids here, a
lot fewer senior citizens.

00:06:44.786 --> 00:06:47.028
So once again, this is just
a way of visualizing things.

00:06:47.028 --> 00:06:50.372
We took a lot of data that
can take multiple data points.

00:06:50.372 --> 00:06:52.020
Instead of plotting each data point,

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.762
like we might do in a dot plot,

00:06:53.762 --> 00:06:55.457
instead of saying how many
one-year-olds are there?

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:56.500
Well there's only one one-year old.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.476
How many three-year-olds are there?

00:06:57.476 --> 00:06:58.731
There's only one three-year old.

00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:00.286
That wouldn't give us much information.

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:01.772
We would just have these single dots

00:07:01.772 --> 00:07:03.211
if we were doing a dot plot.

00:07:03.211 --> 00:07:05.418
But as a histogram, we're
able to put them into buckets.

00:07:05.418 --> 00:07:06.740
Everybody was like,
hey, you know generally

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.799
between the ages zero and
nine we have six people.

00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:11.933
And so you see that plotted
out, just like that.

00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:13.944
And obviously this doesn't apply just to

00:07:13.944 --> 00:07:15.685
ages of people in a restaurant,

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.891
it applies to all sorts
of data that you might

00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:20.234
want to collect and observe.
