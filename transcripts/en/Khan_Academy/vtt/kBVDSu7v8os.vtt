00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
 

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.920
So I've got a 10 foot ladder
that's leaning against a wall.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.587
But it's on very slick ground,
and it starts to slide outward.

00:00:07.587 --> 00:00:09.670
And right when it's-- and
right at the moment that

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.170
we're looking at this ladder,
the base of the ladder is 8

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.020
feet away from the
base of the wall.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.610
And it's sliding outward
at 4 feet per second.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.340
And we'll assume that the top
of the latter kind of glides

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.050
along the side of the wall,
it stays kind of in contact

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.320
with the wall and
moves straight down.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.130
And we see right over here, the
arrow is moving straight down.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.290
And our question
is, how fast is it

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.296
moving straight
down at that moment?

00:00:33.296 --> 00:00:34.920
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.300
What do we know and
what do we not know?

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.900
So if we call the distance
between-- let's call

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.460
the distance between the
base of the wall and the base

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.280
the ladder, let's call that x.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.600
We know right now x
is equal to 8 feet.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.120
We also know the
rate at which x is

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.120
changing with respect to time.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.350
The rate at which x is
changing with respect to time

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.800
is 4 feet per second.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.700
So we could call this dx dt.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.480
Now let's call the distance
between the top of the ladder

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.820
and the base of the latter h.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.042
Let's call that h.

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:09.750
So what we're really
trying to figure out

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.720
is what dh dt is,
given that we know

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.850
all of this other information.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.060
So let's see if we can come up
with the relationship between x

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.980
and h and then take the
derivative with respect

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.920
to time, maybe using
the chain rule.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.330
And see if we can
solve for dh dt knowing

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.274
all of this information.

00:01:30.274 --> 00:01:32.190
Well, we know the
relationship between x and h

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.760
at any time because of
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.010
We can assume this
is a right angle.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.230
So we know that x
squared plus h squared is

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.480
going to be equal to the
length of the ladder squared,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.404
is going to be equal to 100.

00:01:48.404 --> 00:01:49.820
And what we care
about is the rate

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.580
at which these things
change with respect to time.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.920
So let's take the
derivative with respect

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.260
to time of both sides of this.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.060
We're doing a little bit of
implicit differentiation.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.470
So what's the derivative with
respect to time of x squared?

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.342
Well the derivative of x
squared with respect to x is 2x.

00:02:09.342 --> 00:02:10.800
And we're going to
have to multiply

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.940
that times the derivative of
x with respect to t, dx dt.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.670
Just to be clear, this
is the chain rule.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.040
This is the derivative of x
squared with respect to x,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.540
which is 2x, times dx
dt to get the derivative

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.690
of x squared with
respect to time.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.362
Just the chain rule.

00:02:30.362 --> 00:02:32.070
Now similarly, what's
the derivative of h

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.200
squared with respect to time?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.150
Well that's just going
to be 2h, the derivative

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.540
of h squared with
respect to h is 2h times

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.550
the derivative of h
with respect to time.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.680
Once again, this right
over here is the derivative

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.130
of h squared with respect
to h, times the derivative

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.210
of h with respect to time, which
gives us the derivative of h

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.142
squared with respect to time.

00:02:55.142 --> 00:02:56.850
And what do we get on
the right-hand side

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.805
of our equation?

00:02:57.805 --> 00:02:59.680
Well the length of our
ladder isn't changing.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.290
This 100 isn't going to
change with respect to time.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.780
Derivative of a constant
is just equal 0.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.870
So now we have
it, a relationship

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.210
between the rate of change
of h with respect to time.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.830
The rate of change of
x with respect to time.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.970
And then at a given
point in time,

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.920
when the length of
x is x and h is h.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.740
But do we know what h is
when x is equal to 8 feet?

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.360
Well, we can figure it out.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.591
When x is equal to 8 feet, we
can use the Pythagorean theorem

00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:27.090
again.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.650
We get 8 feet squared,
plus h squared

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.640
is going to be equal to 100.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.730
So 8 squared is 64.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.780
Subtract it from both sides, you
get h squared is equal to 36.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.080
Take the positive square
root, a negative square root

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.080
doesn't make sense because
then the ladder would

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.410
be below the ground, it
would be somehow underground.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.220
So we get h is equal to 6.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.140
So this is something
that was essentially

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.890
given by the problem.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:55.570
So now we know.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.320
We can look at this original
thing right over here,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.900
we know what x is,
that was given.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.690
Right now x is 8 feet.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.030
We know the rate of change
of x with respect to time.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.680
It's 4 feet per second.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.090
We know what h is
right now, it is 6.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.150
So then we can solve for the
rate of h with respect to time.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.380
So let's do that.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.690
So we get 2 times 8
feet, times 4 feet

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:35.040
per second, so times
4, plus 2h, is going

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.200
to be plus 2 times, our
height right now is 6,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.250
times the rate at which
our height is changing

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.050
with respect to t is equal to 0.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.140
And so we get 2 times
8 times 4 is 64.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.350
Plus 12 dh dt is equal to 0.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.320
We can subtract 64 from
both sides, we get 12.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.540
12 times the derivative
of h with respect to time

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.800
is equal to negative 64.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.520
And then we just have to
divide both sides by 12.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.550
And so now we get a
little bit of a drum roll.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.600
The derivative,
the rate of change

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.280
of h with respect to time is
equal to negative 64 divided

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.870
by 12.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.240
It's equal to
negative 64 over 12,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.620
which is the same
thing as negative 16

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.730
over 3, yeah that's right.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.530
Which is equal to--
let me scroll over

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.070
to the right a little
bit-- negative 5

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.877
and 1/3 feet per second.

00:05:30.877 --> 00:05:31.460
So we're done.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.490
But let's just do
a reality check,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.989
does that make sense that we
got a negative value right over

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:35.650
here?

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.150
Well our height is decreasing.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.220
So it completely makes sense
that its rate of change

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.620
is indeed negative.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.440
And we're done.
