00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.980
I think any founder who ultimately
plans to sell something to somebody

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.200
should be thinking about their
modernization strategy from day one.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.140
The reason is not,
because the early revenue, I think makes

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.490
a meaningful difference for your
business from a cash flow perspective.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.190
But because acquiring revenue is the
ultimate form of customer validation.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.540
It's pretty easy as
an entrepreneur to go out and

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.600
find somebody to tell you
that you have a cool idea.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.400
The difficult part is getting
them to open their wallet.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.460
So from that perspective,
I see it as a really,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.729
really great tool in
understanding your customer and

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.190
understanding that you've found
something that people want.
