1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,080
You are listening to radio lab radio from

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,040
W N y. S. T. E.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,170
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab. So Robert,

4
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:20,790
one of my favorite sounds of all time
is the sound of hearing people think,

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,270
you know, have a hearing,

6
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:28,830
a mind kind of formulate a thought
that wasn't there until it clicks in.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,100
Yeah. That's just an
MP, a beautiful sound,

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,160
especially when the mind that you're
listening to is a person who has shaped

9
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:39,990
you, has shaped the show. Sure. So, uh,
today a little bit of a departure, um,

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,020
a couple of months ago I got connected
to a guy named bill Hayes as a mutual

11
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:46,560
friend, sort of put us in touch.

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,130
He wrote a really good book
actually about anatomy. Really good.

13
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:54,270
I gave it to my son. Really? Yeah.
He is a writer and a photographer

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,000
and I was the partner of
the late Oliver Sacks.

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,490
And together we made tapes or recordings
of conversations in the last year

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,140
of his life. Now, all of our Sachs, one
of the great, great writers of science,

17
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,970
masterful, masterful writer, you know,

18
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,150
we here at radio lab have grown
up with him and his style of,

19
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:21,151
of combining sort of clinical scientific
observation with deep humanity and

20
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:26,320
poetry. I feel like we're always trying
to walk in his footsteps in some way.

21
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,770
Can we do what we do? And certainly we
know we've had him on the show many,

22
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:32,740
many, many times. So his voice
will be familiar to a lot of you.

23
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:37,741
But what you hear on these tapes is
an altogether different portrait.

24
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,620
And why, why did you
start these recordings?

25
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,573
Well,

26
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,580
Oliver got his diagnosis of a
terminal cancer in mid January,

27
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,360
2015

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,590
he had had cancer about nine years
earlier, dealt with it, but it was back.

29
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,090
It's spreading through his body.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,240
The prognosis was six to 18
months and it was shattering

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,410
shortly after bill says they were
sitting at the kitchen table talking like

32
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,710
I, uh, I, I knew that he had things
on his mind that he wanted to write.

33
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,810
And I said, well, what do you,
what do you thinking about writing?

34
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:15,811
This was about four days after he got
his diagnosis and he paused and then he

35
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:18,520
looked at me and he said, uh,

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,780
something like a month ago I
felt that I was in good health,

37
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,830
even robust health at 81.
I still swim a mile a day,

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,320
but my luck has run out. And
uh, I said stop right there.

39
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,280
And I grabbed a pad and a
pen and I said, start over.

40
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,170
And I began writing as fast as I could
as he dictated virtually the entire

41
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:45,130
essay. Wow. Just sort of spilled
out like that. Yup. And uh,

42
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,310
so we had the idea of getting
a little audio recorder,

43
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:51,970
a digital recorder so that it
could be on hand at any time,

44
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,150
whether to record what he wanted to
write or reminisce or to collect stories

45
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,880
after his, I put the
recorder in a drawer and um,

46
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,420
didn't pull it out again until over
a year and a half after his death.

47
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,870
I didn't even listen to it, any
of it to write my own memoir.

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,070
I had been kind of very nervous about
listening to them cause I thought it'd be

49
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:18,670
very sad and just so that it would
just make me depressed and sad.

50
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,871
But I took it,

51
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:24,400
I took the recorder out of the drawer
where it had sat for 18 months and I

52
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:25,001
pushed play.

53
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:28,540
And of course it didn't work because
the batteries were dead because I had to

54
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,740
scramble to find batteries. And
when I did and then pushed play.

55
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,030
Okay.

56
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,030
This is a recorded
conversation between o w s and

57
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,590
Billy Hayes. Um, on February six,

58
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,930
the hairs on my arms went up.

59
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,560
It was as if he was alive. This was
the first recording you made with them?

60
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,570
It was a during dinner.

61
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:59,930
We're eating at the time and he
began telling me about his dream,

62
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,860
um, dreams.

63
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,120
I ain't been having a look of
strangely Arthur titled Reading

64
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,920
[inaudible] I have to make,
yeah, getting lost. Um,

65
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,380
and getting found full of supplies.

66
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,250
There's the maybe go through a door,

67
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:22,830
which I think will be a door
to another one, but there's a,

68
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,630
don't want to have a
mountain landscape. Um, um,

69
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,310
sometimes frightening with
Enes or, or habitat edge long,

70
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,110
very narrow ledgers,

71
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,510
but then finally come into
some gracious heavenly

72
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,280
mounting meadow and then waking dreams
about doing this and approaching him.

73
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:52,560
And um, it's a journey
from where to where,

74
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,390
this was February 6th,

75
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,390
2015 so about three weeks after Oliver
got his diagnosis of a terminal cancer

76
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,950
and his immediate impulse was to write

77
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,613
and yet

78
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,060
[inaudible] finance has
been forced into my mind

79
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,540
framing the evidence past two weeks,

80
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,010
Oliver was quite deaf,

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,240
even louder than he realized he
would whisper words to himself

82
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,310
as he wrote them down on the pad
and he wrote with a fountain pen.

83
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,743
Okay.

84
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,450
For Oliver, writing was a form of
thinking and the primary activity.

85
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,450
Yeah. For a human being,

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,620
I know my normal health

87
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,140
stay to health and energy at least such
health and energy as a fits as a fit and

88
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:14,381
active 81 year old ruled to enjoy in this

89
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,250
despite having,

90
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,580
I know the previous month and liver
full melanoma test to see this

91
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,390
thing is all out. This is from there out.

92
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,820
What I'm going to do is just leave that
all there so you can look at it again.

93
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,190
You asked her, no, no, nothing was
with a strong intent. I'm a creature.

94
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,410
Multiple drafts as you know,

95
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,880
specific symptoms,

96
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,960
feeling meaning

97
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,593
screws with the

98
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,380
screws with them and which may be hungry.

99
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:23,860
Severe tolerably, serious,

100
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:28,100
severe susa creations.

101
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,610
Fictions patients, patients.

102
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,580
We're known for death. We known for death

103
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,550
magnifying glass. Yeah. I haven't had,

104
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,280
Oliver was the kind of guy who would
take dictionaries to bed to read with a

105
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:58,680
magnifying glass. Can you bring my chain
mistakes? Real look up a word for me. I

106
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,440
need a magnifying glass
and I have one here.

107
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,860
I also feel the missing
magnifying glass. There it is.

108
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,660
Can you see if there's a
word visit piece of all VSI

109
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,281
yes,

110
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:24,080
there is change to a better
frame of mind to be wise.

111
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,970
To be wise. Um, can you pull
out the big Dick screened CFU.

112
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Com find any. So impulse in particular.

113
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:35,820
I want to know whether
overturned to health. Okay.

114
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,160
Here's a man with a huge
vocabulary and love of writing,

115
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,810
but still every day you'd be struck
by a word that he wanted to look up.

116
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,450
Well,

117
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,450
it immediately says repentance for
misconduct or to do say repentance for

118
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,220
misconduct, recognition of errors,

119
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:59,790
committed return to a
better mind or opinion.

120
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,610
What's the origin of the word?

121
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,750
To recover one senses
come to oneself again.

122
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,270
Hope to learn some skills. I think
Russell credit the word I want.

123
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,740
Can I take

124
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,670
[inaudible]? Mistasis is coming back.

125
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,310
It's coming back.

126
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,480
[inaudible] trans through crest.

127
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,260
Christine say thank you very much.

128
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,400
Ranted for contingently.

129
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,090
You can expect it had happened for health.

130
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,860
Who [inaudible] through some harm

131
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,313
please.

132
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,873
Okay.

133
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,780
[inaudible] [inaudible] yes.

134
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,740
A general feeling of disorder. It is,

135
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:23,210
especially when things are going wrong
internally when homeostasis is not being

136
00:10:23,211 --> 00:10:24,044
maintained.

137
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,680
When the autonomic balance starts
listing heavily to one side or the other,

138
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,870
that is core consciousness. The feeling
of how one is takes on an intrusive,

139
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,100
unpleasant quality, and now
one will say, I feel ill.

140
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,250
Something is amiss at such times one.

141
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:44,480
Indeed everything comes and goes and
if one could take a scan or inner

142
00:10:44,481 --> 00:10:46,370
photograph of the body at such times,

143
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,140
one would see vascular beds
opening and closing Paris dialysis.

144
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,350
Accelerating or stopping is the rest
squirming or tightening in spasms,

145
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,210
secretion. Suddenly increasing
or decreasing is if the
nervous system itself,

146
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:01,580
we're in a state of
indecision instability,

147
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:05,480
fluctuation and oscillation are of
the essence in the unsettled state.

148
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,220
This feeling of disorder, we lose
the normal feeling of the procedure.

149
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,480
They're relatively benign,

150
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,570
would lead to the death of a
huge mass of melanoma cells.

151
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,830
These in dying would give off a variety
of unpleasant and pain producing

152
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:22,730
substances. Soon after
waking from the embolization,

153
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,030
I was to be a sale by feelings
of excruciating tiredness
and proxy Isms of sleep

154
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,050
so abrupt they could pull axe me in
the middle of a sentence or a mouthful.

155
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,910
[inaudible]

156
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,230
delirium would seize me within seconds.
Even in the middle of handwriting,

157
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,590
I felt extremely weak and inert.

158
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,660
On Day 10 I turned a corner.

159
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,090
I felt awful as usual in the morning,
but a different person in the afternoon.

160
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,150
This was delightful and wholly unexpected.

161
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,800
I suddenly found myself full of physical
and creative energy and euphoria,

162
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,540
almost akin to Hypomania. Exuberant
thoughts rushed through my mind.

163
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,870
How much of this was a reestablishment
of balance in the body?

164
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,370
How much an autonomic rebound after
a profound autonomic depression,

165
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,170
how much other physiological factors
and how much the sheer joy of writing,

166
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,303
I do not know,

167
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,080
but my transformed state and feeling
where I suspect very close to it.

168
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:30,670
Nietzsche experienced after a period of
illness and expressed so lyrically in

169
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:31,540
the gay science

170
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:33,110
[inaudible]

171
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,700
gratitude pours forth continually as
if the unexpected had just happened.

172
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,960
The gratitude of a convalescent
for convalescence was unexpected.

173
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:47,630
The rejoicing of strength
that is returning of a
reawakened faith in a tomorrow

174
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,840
and the day after tomorrow of a sudden
sense and anticipation of a future of

175
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,350
impending adventures of
seas that are open again,

176
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,170
where's the ways the microphone
on this bloody thing? Well, okay,

177
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:11,120
you all recording this right?
The, the time is nine 20. Um,

178
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,280
in New York it would be
five hours difference with
Greenwich Mean Time and it is

179
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:17,510
Monday the ninth.

180
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,550
And that's the say the 20th
day after my embolization.

181
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,940
And just 48 hours till the next one.

182
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,670
End of recording pause.

183
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,070
On March 11th, Oliver had the
second embolization surgery,

184
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:39,720
which would cut off blood supply
to the tumors growing in his liver.

185
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,640
With the idea of that it would
give Oliver more time, more energy.

186
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,110
We'd been together six years.
I knew him well and yet, uh,

187
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,490
I'd never seen him

188
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,300
with such focus.

189
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,300
[inaudible] all right.

190
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,810
All right. Question.

191
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,330
Just constantly writing. Yeah. I
don't know what to call this piece.

192
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,230
They can title it [inaudible] half
on your own. Did glorious forest.

193
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,570
Well, I like the future. I still never
know. Sorry. I oh, that's excellent.

194
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,770
Yeah, that's it. Um, and
I think I need to put in,

195
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,860
otherwise I'm does to indicate why
they should have and I say to Billy,

196
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,930
who is a good deal younger,

197
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,200
who's younger than who is a
good deal younger than I am.

198
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,260
Originally I put who was
two thirds my age, um,

199
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,470
how I have to be precise. I like that.
Okay. It's really precise. Okay. Chris.

200
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,830
Exactly. Two thirds my age. Okay,

201
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,670
so that's that piece
for the New York Earth.

202
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,390
Yes. Okay. Have some insurer
and I'll hear students. Okay,

203
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,563
sure.

204
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:19,040
I like the idea of saying [inaudible]
is exactly two thirds of my age.

205
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:25,460
It's not, it's not a fraction that
you expect to see three quarters. Yes,

206
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,920
yes, but not two thirds.

207
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,060
I like the idea of putting a
tiny arithmetical conundrum.

208
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,930
Ninth Avenue, Reverie
published March 20th, 2015

209
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,220
[inaudible]

210
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,450
driving down ninth avenue,

211
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,190
choking on diesel fumes from a truck just
ahead of us. I say to my friend Billy,

212
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,230
he's exactly two thirds my age.

213
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,860
I wonder whether you will see the
end of internal combustion engines,

214
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,140
the end of oil, a cleaner world.

215
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,890
The thought zooms me away from
ninth avenue to a forest world

216
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,240
in particular to the one
described in that glorious forest.

217
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,830
So Ghillean Prance his book about his
39 visits to the Amazon in the past 50

218
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:11,710
years. He sees what we are doing
to the Amazon and its many peoples.

219
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,120
He speaks for conservation, sanity
reason before we destroy it all.

220
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:17,630
[inaudible]

221
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,300
I went to that glorious forest in 1996,

222
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,030
11 days of botany study and hiking,

223
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,090
seeing hundreds of different
species of trees in a single acre.

224
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,610
I'd planned before I became ill to go
to Madagascar to see its forests and its

225
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:34,820
unique font and other wildlife,
especially the lemurs.

226
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,540
I love Lemurs. One has to see them,

227
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,960
study them to grasp the
origin of our primate nature.

228
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,400
But most of the forests on Madagascar
have already been obliterated and not a

229
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:48,170
naturally lemurs are dying.

230
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,050
Honking horns bring me
back to ninth avenue.

231
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,730
I seem to have spent hours lost in
reverie thinking about the Amazonian and

232
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:04,620
Madagascan forests, lemurs the time
machine. But we have scarcely moved,

233
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:10,060
are still behind the stinking lung
destroying truck. Not In my life.

234
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,170
Billy answers.

235
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,910
Um, I, yes, I'm a,

236
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,820
yeah, I, I'd been reading a
lot of it allowed to Billy. Um,

237
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:29,830
this is according where Oliver is talking
on the phone to Lawrence Weschler aren

238
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:34,820
Weschler but anyhow, he,
um, I was due to have a, um,

239
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,110
a cat scan follow up on Thursday.

240
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,080
I was terrified to this. In fact,

241
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:46,560
what it did show was that 80% of
the metastasis in the liver, um,

242
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,460
had been destroyed by the
embolization. With luck.

243
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,080
I should have two or three
good months after this.

244
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:57,760
Um,

245
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,760
well I just hope that I come see friends
and white and maybe travel a little at

246
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,070
yeah. And I think next
month if I'm up to it,

247
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:13,071
I'm gonna go to London to say
hello and possibly farewell to um,

248
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,900
friends and family and um,

249
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,390
I can't think ahead beyond that.

250
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,760
Six, seven is still one short.

251
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,010
I don't want to assume, um,

252
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,910
semantics,

253
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,690
semantics

254
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,460
and then

255
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,413
treatments

256
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,070
inseparability into its
relation. Who I want to hear.

257
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:21,071
I want to hear over the years I filled
upwards of a thousand notebooks that

258
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:24,830
contents of a various,

259
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,840
but three of them have had a special
function to record abnormalities of

260
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:33,980
perception during times of sensory
impairments or deprivation.

261
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,740
The column notebook is a very
modest affair. It is quite small.

262
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,720
It slips easily into a pocket crucial
because I need to have it with me at all

263
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:48,320
times increasing deafness.

264
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,350
I'm more prone to miss
hearing what people say,

265
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,700
but miss hearings deceive on
entirely. You accept what you hear.

266
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,260
You accept what you see.

267
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,300
Every miss hearing is a novel surprise
and concoction and never gets used to

268
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:02,900
them.

269
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,900
The hundredth is as fresh as absurd and
as thought provoking as the first Ms.

270
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,670
Herring became miss hearing.

271
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,820
Take the car for a spin became
take the car for a swim.

272
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:19,240
I've noted that your hummus can

273
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,560
[inaudible] on carbs. Taylor
poems, sick time published.

274
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:29,060
It was heard as a big time cuttlefish.
Did you say a poetry bag and you said no.

275
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,040
I said a cool, sweet.

276
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,590
I love the idea of a poetry that yes,
I'm inclined almost to put them all in.

277
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,940
I think they should all be. We'll meet.

278
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:45,380
We'll make the point that
sound Trump central thing,

279
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,380
one surroundings, one's
wishes and expectations.

280
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,550
Conscious and unconscious can certainly
be coded terminance and mishearing,

281
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,530
but the real Mr flies at lower levels
in those parts of the brain involved in

282
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:04,570
phonological analysis and decoding,

283
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,140
doing what they can with distorted
or deficient signals from our ears.

284
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,710
These parts of the brain managed
to construct real words or phrases,

285
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,060
even if they are absurd.

286
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,750
And yet there's often a sort of style
or wit a dash and these instantaneous

287
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,194
inventions,

288
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,180
they reflect to some extent one's own
interests and experiences and I rather

289
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:27,790
enjoy them only in the
realm of mishearing.

290
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,860
At least my miss hearings can a
biography of cancer become a biography of

291
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,330
Kantor. One of my favorite mathematicians,
Taro cards can turn into Taro pods,

292
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,760
a grocery bag into a poetry bag,

293
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,120
all or numbness into oral numbness.

294
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,210
And a mere mention of Christmas Eve,

295
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,580
a command to kiss my feet.

296
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,340
Oops. No wonder I criminal rights anymore.

297
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,170
I must get more cartridges have
grown through this too quickly.

298
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,780
I want to reassure you all of these
thoughts are already in the drought.

299
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,613
[inaudible] okay,

300
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,660
so I think it's time to let
your weary mind rest. Yes.

301
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,850
Okay. You see each other
in the morning? Okay.

You want some of this?

338
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,130
You look very happy.

339
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,330
Which one of these jackets appeals to
you? Um, if you're going to pick one,

340
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:21,950
let's go to the start. Of course. I
have to take my own unfortunate shape.

341
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,420
No, no, no. I know. I want you to
respond to them. Which one is, oh,

342
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:27,830
I see you like this,

343
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,760
I think is fond of this sort of
routine jackets for this pockets.

344
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,720
Flaps functional though. It is.

345
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,160
I don't know where I got picture. Sorry.

346
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,260
It's so hot. Hot, hot. Do
you know that word sexy?

347
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,110
Yes. Right. You're very handsome.

348
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,070
You haven't had anything to, you
should have something to read.

349
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,043
I might go out

350
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,550
sort of enjoy that on Sunday night.

351
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,380
[inaudible] get a little stoned
and I go out into the neighborhood.

352
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,813
Do you mind?

353
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,913
I don't know the time.

354
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,850
Good from [inaudible]
environment or girl rejoice.

355
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,363
Um,

356
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,610
I wasn't counting how many
to do rubric counts there.

357
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,780
Oliver had enjoyed a couple of really
good months of feeling well and fit and

358
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,070
uh, getting lots of writing done. You

359
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,640
had completed not only a general
feeling of disorder, the short piece,

360
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,270
ms hearings, his autobiography
on the move was published.

361
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:56,190
He worked on a piece on the evolution of
the eye and he'd completed a major case

362
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:58,380
history on the performer, Spalding gray.

363
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:03,530
We'd made this wonderful trip to London
for 10 days after we returned from the

364
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:04,440
trip.

365
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,580
He knew that he would have to get another
cat scan to see how things were going.

366
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,120
And I, I would say that we kind of
had a feeling, an optimistic feeling.

367
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,890
He seemed to be doing well. So he
went into that hoping for the best,

368
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,560
but it was exactly the opposite.

369
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,260
The cancer had spread beyond
the liver to other organs. Um,

370
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,450
that it, uh, was looking very bad indeed.

371
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,080
Oliver more than anyone I think
knew that time was running out.

372
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,290
[inaudible] um, um,

373
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:59,160
I wonder if I could ask you to look
up something on the little box. Sure.

374
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:04,110
Uh, the 10 come on was, yeah,
in particular the warm about,

375
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,220
um, PV is definitely
heavily, I know, sure.

376
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,120
What did I say exact exact wording is

377
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,780
remember the sabbath day to
keep it holy. That's fine.

378
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,590
To be is right down that town.

379
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,060
Exactly what I want

380
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,840
to take the time to finish

381
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,760
this show up us,

382
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,620
he was having a lot of discomfort and
had to have a catheter implanted in his

383
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:50,850
abdomen to drain off fluid that
was accumulating from the tumors,

384
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,580
which was around August 4th or fifth.

385
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,180
It was really the only solution and, uh,

386
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,880
it was quite uncomfortable and
it had to be drained daily.

387
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,520
Um, and it also unfortunately
ended his swimming.

388
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,510
He was a great swimmer and he loved
to swim, but he didn't complain.

389
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,050
Swimming had come to an end,

390
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:20,820
so he put his head down basically
and began working on this essay.

391
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:21,340
Sabbath

392
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,430

393
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,343

398
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,430
What'd you do? She, Tom was doing,
I knew it. I just wanted to talk.

399
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,270
Good morning. Good morning.
I miss the dramatic reading.

400
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,790
Just started a little
while ago. How are you?

401
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,960
Is Longtime assistant editor
Kate, what are you writing about?

402
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,333
[inaudible] Yup.

403
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,450
And spiritually. Personally.
[inaudible] okay. [inaudible]

404
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,850
why don't you come to share? I
drove from how to you're doing room.

405
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:59,720
I liked standing was better. Okay, fine.
Stamp Man. That shit loom over here.

406
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,500
Okay. My mother has 17 drugs. Is this,

407
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,920
how's an orthodox figuring out old
photographs of that father? Show him.

408
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,490
Wear a Yamaka and I was
told that he woke up.

409
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:18,950
You fixed her last year in February.
So funny. I love that. My Shaw,

410
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,710
the two K for the Orthodox
back, clairvoyant,

411
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,420
but they were very conscious
of the six. Come on.

412
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,560
Remember the facade of the
t t probate. I'm sure those,

413
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,130
as we call this proud bitch, fuck wait,

414
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:38,630
is entirely different from the rest
of the week. When shoppers came in,

415
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,430
my mother would light capitals. How
could lift favors from that happens?

416
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,330
Have you ever been afraid

417
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,370
like gradually became more
distant pull in different,

418
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,740
just different to Jewish
life. That's to their guard.

419
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,160
Let's talk about this to
the Croc in particular.

420
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,410
There was no particular

421
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,410
[inaudible] shop until I was 18

422
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,440
which was the French Chava

423
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:19,760
[inaudible] compelled me to four years.

424
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:25,340
I haven't dominated shirt. I said,
it's just a feeling. I don't tell him

425
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,300
[inaudible] [inaudible] he did tell her

426
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:37,160
the dex water. She came down with
the look of horror on her face.

427
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,950
I'm shrieked. You're in a folder nation.

428
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,150
I was sure this would be both the
backs of a sniff eventually. Then

429
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:53,810
under cordiality love was
refills. What's her fruitful,

430
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,610
hateful words? Her crows,
Reiki hated Judaism.

431
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,480
Fully relational in that capacity

432
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,850
for any humor, bigger
tree groups, brutal to

433
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,730
determine. Part two, a self pay to

434
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,140
so secure seven plus it over six or

435
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:25,610
so. Alright, filtered Vishal, clear four.

436
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,740
This is your partner with
adults. Athlete is bright enough.

437
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:36,020
[inaudible] your mom does would still
echoes with primer and Billy too was

438
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:42,490
warmly received and the stroke at
the terror bigotry of 60 [inaudible].

439
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,800
This was very funny too.

440
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,650
Afraid, afraid, eager and she was fed.

441
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,700
Her piece of the song stopped for a long

442
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:09,100
time. Upside tide. Your

443
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,660
[inaudible] process consists
of this bizarre and of course

444
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,500
that's how you get able to trust hard
to probably life can be conformed,

445
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,950
trained, exploration of bisects round.

446
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,660
I was fine until the
closeups facing the world.

447
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,440
Goofy fee. [inaudible]
locked up and sorry,

448
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:39,870
I know. Week short of dress. All right,

449
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,420
what's for Brussels? Melted
away probably carrots

450
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,680
and my force increase degree,
not of the supernatural.

451
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:55,010
This has been for base trips
today. Partial divorces,

452
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,790
great fight and different
food works for our life.

453
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,100
Achieving a sense of peace.

454
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,270
We do work so I framed my fault.

455
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,160
What's happened in your
day of rest? Several food

456
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:18,480
capsules separate from three when
one could feel work to start.

457
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,160
I'm on the baby food crops. It's waste.

458
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,050
On August 14th, Sabbath was
published in the New York Times.

459
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,800
That same day he began to dictate the
table of for the river of consciousness,

460
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,860
the collection of essays which he
knew would be published posthumously.

461
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,280
It was getting his house in order.

462
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,183
Um,

463
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,190
I don't know that I'm capable of much
writing and nor that I want to do any

464
00:35:55,191 --> 00:35:59,190
writing part. I hope
[inaudible] I said what?

465
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:03,080
Think aloud to you and
to Kate, you a quarter

466
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:07,280
home hospice, um,

467
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,910
fatality well require an amount of care

468
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,390
today,

469
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:22,390
intravenous nursing things beyond
what you and Kate can provide.

470
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,700
And this in turn should reduce you

471
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,590
who knew to be

472
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,630
my friends and comforters.

473
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,600
Oh, one last scar. Attempting my appetite.

474
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,840
Can you bring me in and
disrupt the top category?

475
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,580
Just to mention there
is also chicken soup.

476
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,510
Yes. All right. I probably
should have some dick quit.

477
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,033
Throw a little of each

478
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,000
[inaudible].

479
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,480
Two weeks later on August 30th, 2015,

480
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,460
Oliver sacks died at home

481
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,950
in the last seven months of his life,
he wrote and published nine pieces,

482
00:37:47,951 --> 00:37:51,430
and there were many, many more that
he started, wasn't able to finish.

483
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,730
And some of the essays he wrote are now
in a new collection published after he

484
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,710
died called the river of consciousness.

485
00:37:57,711 --> 00:38:00,830
And that's just out the readers
that you heard in the story. Uh,

486
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,480
we're re radio labyrinth,

487
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,760
enemy Q and Simon Adler and Bethel hop
t thanks also to Mike Pash cash for

488
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:10,820

was produced by Carla Murphy.
