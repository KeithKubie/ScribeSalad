00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.350
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.050
And today I'm learning
more about Article VI

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.100
of the US Constitution.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.150
Article VI is, as we'll soon see, kind of

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.280
a constitutional grab bag.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.050
It covers debts, religious
tests for office,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.820
and it establishes the
constitution as the supreme

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.880
law of the land.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.210
To learn more about what binds
these diverse ideas together

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.310
I sought out the help of two experts.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.140
Kermit Roosevelt is a
professor of law specializing

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.220
in Constitutional Law and conflict of laws

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.320
at the University of
Pennsylvania Law School.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.530
And, Michael Ramsey is
professor of law and director

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.270
of International and
Comparative Law programs

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.030
at the University of
San Diego School of Law.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.740
So, let's start out
talking about the debts

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.700
portion of Article VI.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.010
Professor Roosevelt, why were the framers

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.150
so interested in debt?

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.600
What was the historical
context that led them

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.154
to explicitly address debt in Article VI?

00:00:58.154 --> 00:01:00.340
- [Kermit] Debt is important
generally because nations

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.850
often need to borrow money.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.170
And specifically, with
the constitution and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.630
the Articles of Confederation
the US Government

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.080
had been borrowing money to
pay for the Revolutionary War.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.300
So, there was a question,
we're moving from a sort of

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.770
loose confederation almost
like a treaty between nations

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.130
under the Articles of
Confederation to a single

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.670
unitary country with a
stronger national government

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.090
under the constitution.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.350
And, there's a question, is
it still the same country?

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.510
Will the new United States pay the debts

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.390
of the old United States?

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.790
- [Michael] Now, there's
a general principal

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.000
of international law that
a successor government

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.500
undertakes the obligations
of the predecessor.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.050
So, you wouldn't necessarily
think this would be a problem,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.060
but I think they were
particularly concerned because

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.050
the idea of a republic
was a somewhat new one,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.030
at least in the 18th century,
a somewhat unusual one.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.180
And, the change of a
republican government might

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.380
cause some worries in Europe
where this money was owed.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.760
So, I think they just
wanted to reassure all

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.220
of the creditors that
even if they were changing

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.980
their method of government
that that wasn't going to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.170
effect any of the debts.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.260
- [Kim] What might have
happened if they decided not

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.920
to pay those debts?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.230
- [Kermit] If they decided
not to pay the debts than

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.040
other countries would probably
have been much less willing

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.440
to lend money to the new United
States because they might

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.100
have thought, "Well,
you know, another change

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.190
"in government could occur."

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.860
- [Michael] There was
substantial question throughout

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.070
the world whether the United
States would be able to survive

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.350
in the face of all the
challenges that they had

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.490
after gaining their independence.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.790
So, in order to make it
seem that the United States

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.300
was a country that could be
trust, a country that could

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.630
be expected to stick around
and not collapse into chaos

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.300
or revert to colonial status
one of the most important

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.240
things for them was to show
that the debts would be honored

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.180
because a failure to
honor debts would suggest

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.330
that the country did not, in
fact, have a true sovereignty

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.790
and it was not prepared to be an actor on

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.970
the international stage
that could be trusted.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.770
- [Kermit] Another interesting
thing to contrast this to

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.560
is the treatment of debts
after the Civil War where,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.200
of course, the United States,
the federal government

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.610
paid its own debts but
there's a provision in

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.840
the 14th Amendment explicitly repudiating

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.070
the Confederate debt.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.860
So, if you loaned money to the
Confederate States of America

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.840
you're never getting that back
because we didn't treat that

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.540
as a valid government that would
be continued going forward.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.980
- [Michael] Another thing
that it illustrates is that

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.100
the constitution, in some
respects, was a visionary

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.660
document that was concerned
with a long term future

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.530
of the United States.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.230
But, in other respects it
responded to very immediate

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.420
practical problems that the
framers faced in their day.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.060
They were thinking about not
just the future of the country

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.150
for the ages, they were
thinking about that,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.123
but they weren't thinking just about that.

00:03:47.123 --> 00:03:50.130
They were also thinking about
reassuring France with respect

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.640
to the debts that existed
right at that moment.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.430
- [Kim] So, there's a lot
going on in Article VI.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.150
And specifically, it talks
about the constitution

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.070
as the supreme law of the land.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.530
So, what's important about that statement?

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.330
- [Kermit] What's important
about that is that means

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.160
the Constitution is our highest law.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.580
It prevails over any other
kind of law in a conflict.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.740
So, one thing that that
means is the constitution

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.240
is supreme over state law.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.320
And then, the constitution
actually goes on to

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.550
talk about that a little bit more.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.270
But, it also means the
constitution is supreme

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.290
over federal law.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.580
So, everyone is bound by the constitution.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.110
The states can't go against it.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.850
Congress can't go past it.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.550
The president can't violate
constitutional restrictions.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.600
The constitution is really the last word.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.890
It's the pinnacle or
the keystone of the arch

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.780
of American democracy.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.360
- [Michael] And, that's
why we can say that things

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.330
are unconstitutional, that
laws are unconstitutional

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.270
and therefore invalid.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.930
And, most importantly,
it's why the Supreme Court

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.930
can say that laws are
unconstitutional and invalid.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.560
It creates a superior
law that limits the laws

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.160
that can be passed by the
other parts of the government.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.350
It creates a hierarchy of laws.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.350
And, in doing so, it assures
that we have a single set

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.070
of rules that applies to all the states

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.780
and to the federal government.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.610
And, it can't be changed
except by an amendment,

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.490
which is relatively difficult to do.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.180
There's a procedure in
the constitution for how

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.730
you can amend the
constitution, but until amended

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.640
the constitution, as
written, is our superior law.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.040
And, that was different from the way that

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.580
the rules that the framers were used to

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.810
under the English system
where they didn't have

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.520
a written constitution.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.070
They had an unwritten
constitution, but that constitution

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.290
was subject to change by parliament.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.810
- [Kim] So, has the
supremacy of the constitution

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.500
been tested over time?

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.820
- [Kermit] There haven't
been a lot of claims

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.790
that the constitution is not supreme.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.590
So, generally speaking
everyone gives, at least,

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.980
lip service to this idea.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.660
What's been tested is more the question of

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.400
who gets to decide what
the constitution means

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.910
and when something conflicts with it.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.210
So, if you want the
constitution and federal law

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.260
to be supreme, probably
you would want to have

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.870
someone in the federal
government deciding when

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.070
there's a conflict, say with state law.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.030
And, the forms that
resistance that has taken

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.940
over the years are more states saying not,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.880
"We can go against the
constitution, we're above

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.750
"the constitution," but
states saying, "We don't think

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.990
"what we're doing violates
the constitution," right,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.280
"And you at the Supreme
Court, you think it does

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.840
"but you're wrong."

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.460
- [Michael] In the 19th century
just before the Civil War

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.700
the Supreme Court decided
in the Dred Scott case

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.900
that African Americans
could not be citizens to

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.810
the United States, even
if they were freed slaves.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.930
And, President Lincoln
believed that that was wrong.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.540
He said that there was
nothing in the constitution

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.030
that denied that, the ability
of them to be citizens.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.980
And, he said that the Supreme Court had

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.650
misinterpreted the constitution.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.580
And, he would accept the
Supreme Court's ruling

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.700
in that regard.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.640
Later, in the 20th
century, the Supreme Court

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.150
held that the constitution
barred segregation,

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.300
particularly in schools
in the Brown versus Board

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.830
of Education case.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.170
But, many southern governors
and other institutions

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.840
throughout the south thought
that the Supreme Court

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.880
had gotten that one wrong.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.550
And, they refused to abide
by what the Supreme Court

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.610
had said the constitution means.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.970
- [Kermit] What they said
was not the constitution

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.010
doesn't bind us, but we know
what the constitution means

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.190
better than you, Supreme
Court, you're wrong.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.480
You're making this up, it's
political, it's not judging.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.380
- [Kim] Another thing that
Article VI talks about

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.580
is religious tests.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.110
Why were the framers so
interested in preventing

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.460
religious tests in government?

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.900
What sort of historical evils
were they trying to prevent?

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.560
- [Kermit] So, this is
connected to the basic idea

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.400
of the separation of church and state.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.370
And, you separate church
and state really to

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.040
protect both of those things.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.280
So, you wanna protect
religion from being corrupted

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.860
by political considerations,
but you also want to

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.380
protect your political system
from being a battleground

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.200
between rival religions.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.610
- [Michael] So, where
this comes from is that

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.860
in England they had had a series of what

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.610
they called Test acts.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.930
And, what the Test Acts
did was it required

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.040
that for people to be eligible
for government offices

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.300
that the people had to be
members of the Church of England.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.490
And, that other religious
groups they were barred

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.240
by the Test Act from
holding government office.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.060
So, actually many of
those minority religions,

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.340
many adherents of those ended up coming to

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.360
the American colonies to gain some measure

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.310
of religious freedom.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.770
The pilgrims were an example of that.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:02.060
There was a Catholic colony in Maryland.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.040
And, just generally
speaking many of the people,

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.040
many of the colonists
who came over were people

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.000
who were not part of the main
established church in England.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.630
And so, you can see why they
would not wanna have something

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.030
like the Test Acts.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.500
And, they wanted to make
clear that in the new

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.500
national government that
any religion or no religion

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.120
would be allowed for
government office holders.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.210
- [Kim] Do you think it's
true that we don't have

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.730
religious tests or oaths
in the United States?

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.080
How about the practice
of swearing on a Bible

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.740
during the presidential inauguration?

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.340
- [Kermit] Well, the practice
of swearing on a Bible

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.710
is very interesting, as
is the fact that when the

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.960
president recites the oath
of office every president,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.390
going back to George
Washington, has added on to

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.400
the end of it, "So help me God."

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.890
There's actually an
oath in the constitution

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.430
the president has to swear
to preserve, protect,

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.790
and defend the constitution.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.340
But, the constitution doesn't
say, "So help me God."

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.750
The presidents just add
that on on their own.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.100
And actually, that sort
of illustrates the way

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.400
in which the constitution
treats religion, which is

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.150
it can't be part of government
in an official sense,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.610
but we know that members of
government are also people.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.380
And, they have religious beliefs
that are important to them.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.230
And, we don't demand that
they exclude religion

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.370
from their lives, we just
demand that it be separated

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.140
from government authority.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.710
So, you can swear on a
Bible if you want to.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.660
You don't have to.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.480
You can swear on some
other religious book.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.510
We had a member of congress
take an oath of office

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.060
on a Quran.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.300
So, individual government
officials are allowed to

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.500
include religion in so far as
it's about them personally.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.070
What you think is appropriate
to mark this occasion,

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.400
what solemnifies this oath
for you, you can do that.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.620
But, we can't require
it, and they can't make

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.950
the exercise of their
power religious in nature.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.780
So, you can't, as a government
official, exercise your power

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.350
on religious grounds.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.820
- [Kim] Something that
strikes me about Article VI

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.160
is that it addresses so
many different things.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.150
Do you have a sense of why
debts and constitutional

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:23.170
supremacy and religious
tests are all in one article.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.080
- [Michael] Article VI, as
you said, is a little bit

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.913
of a grab bag.

00:11:27.913 --> 00:11:30.650
It's not entirely clear
how these different pieces

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.760
of Article VI relate to each other.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.270
And, I think they were just
things that the framers

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:38.710
wanted in the constitution
and didn't know, for sure,

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.100
where else to put them.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.900
- [Kermit] I'm not exactly
sure why the debts are there.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.850
If I had to say something about Article VI

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.610
it would be it's sort
of the glue that holds

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.200
the constitutional architecture together.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.860
So, maybe the debts
are in there to explain

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.810
the continuity between
the US government under

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.000
the Articles of Confederation
and the US government

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.270
under the constitution.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.830
Then, the supremacy clause
explains how all of the

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.960
different parts of the
federal system are supposed

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.630
to fit together.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.150
And, what the supremacy clause
is saying the constitution

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.460
is above all of them.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.130
The constitution connects them all.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.980
Everyone has to abide by the constitution.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.600
And, it tells you the
constitution is the highest law,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.970
then you've got federal
law, and then below that

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:24.850
is state law.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.080
So that, if there's a
conflict between federal law

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.770
and state law, the
federal law is gonna win.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.980
And then, the last part
of Article VI is sort of

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.470
doing the same thing.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.940
Because, what holds a country together?

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.600
What binds people into a single people?

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.450
In a lot of countries at
the time of the founding

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.930
it was religion, right,
religion was the glue

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.460
that held the society together.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.440
And, if you weren't a
member of that religion

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.120
you were an outsider or you
were a second class citizen.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.420
You would be shunned and
not given equal rights

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.340
in some ways.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.620
The last clause of
Article VI says something

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.460
sort of similar about
America, except it explicitly

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.070
says it's not religion that
binds us together, right?

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.660
No religious tasks can be
required but you do have

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.493
to take an oath.

00:13:07.493 --> 00:13:08.810
What do you have to pledge to support?

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.910
You have to pledge to
support the constitution.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.150
So, there again, it's
telling you the constitution

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.420
is what we all have in common.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.040
That's what makes us Americans.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.670
That really is the glue that
binds our society together.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.720
- [Kim] So, we've learned
that Article VI is,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.930
as Professor Roosevelt put
it, the glue that binds

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.240
the country together.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.720
In assuming the debts from
the era of the Articles

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.680
of Confederation Article VI
established the continuity

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.230
of the U.S. government.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.150
It also placed the
constitution, not religion,

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.880
as the supreme law of the United States.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.020
