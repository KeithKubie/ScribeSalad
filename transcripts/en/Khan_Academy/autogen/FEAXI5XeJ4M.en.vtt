00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.450
 In the previous video we talked about it 

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.990
 how important is glucose as a simple sugar. 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.950
 We also talked about its molecular structure. 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.890
 In this video we'll look at how the Gucci 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.930
 can be a building block 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.420
 more complex sugars and more complex carbohydrates. 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.330
 Here I am 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.090
 two molecules of glucose, we can number their carbon atoms. 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.700
 It's number one, two, three, four, five, six. 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.020
 One two three four five six. 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.710
 The molecules are in their cyclic form. 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.390
 Now we will see 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.120
 what will happen if this oxygen atom here - 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.250
 I will paint him in the manga, 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.660
 if this atom uses one of its free electronic pairs, 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.020
 to participate 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.200
 in the so-called organic chemistry 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.530
 nucleophilic reaction with the first carbon atom 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.120
 of the glucose molecule on the left. 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.050
 This can happen, 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.090
 because the first carbon atom here 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.120
 is connected to two oxygen atoms. 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.490
 Oxygen is highly electronegative. 

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.220
 Oxygen atoms attract electrons to themselves when they engage in a covalent bond. 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.620
 That's why this carbon atom will have 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.450
 partial positive charge. 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.450
 This oxygen atom is highly electronegative. 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.520
 It will attract electrons from this hydrogen atom 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.290
 and carbon atom number four 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.890
 in the glucose molecule on the right. 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.860
 This will give him a partial negative charge. 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920
 Therefore, the reaction is nucleophilic. 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.420
 Will be attracted by 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.590
 the nucleus (nucleus = nucleus) of the carbon atom from the partially positive charge 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.990
 right here. When this happens, 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.920
 the oxygen atom will use its free electron pair to form a bond. 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.550
 You will share it with the atom, 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.190
 and the carbon atom will be released from another bond. 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.290
 He will be released 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.990
 of the two electrons in this connection. 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.720
 Now you can decide that they simply 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.150
 are returned to oxygen to give a hydroxide anion? 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.650
 Maybe it will be used first, 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.990
 to form a hydroxide ion 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.620
 or maybe that link right away 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.220
 is bound to hydrogen ion from the solution 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.890
 by another hydroxone ion in the solution. 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.690
 Can be used for connection 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.520
 with this hydrogen ion, 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.950
 which is simply a proton. 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.420
 We remove an electron from the hydrogen atom 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.800
 and a proton is obtained. 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.250
 What will happen then? 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.250
 These two molecules will be linked. 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.720
 They'll connect like that. 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.720
 It is important to follow the molecules here. 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.820
 This oxygen atom is this oxygen atom. 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.920
 Here is this. 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.220
 That relationship between carbon atom number four 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.920
 to the right of this oxygen atom 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.820
 is this link here. 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.650
 And here we have an electronic couple, 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.320
 to form the bond with carbon atom number one, 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.790
 I will color it in the guy. 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.620
 This connection here is here. 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.820
 This oxygen atom is now that oxygen atom here. 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.750
 And this e-pair has now formed a relationship 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.350
 with this hydrogen atom, 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.020
 I will color it in blue, 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.890
 this is the link here. 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.990
 On my drawing 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.120
 this oxygen atom is 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.230
 linked to carbon atom number one here and 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.480
 number four here. 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.490
 We've already done it here. 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.990
 Carbon atom number one in the left molecule 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.050
 and number four on the right. 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.890
 But we also connected it 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.690
 with a hydrogen atom. 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.520
 As I drew it here, 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.690
 is still connected to hydrogen. 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.430
 There will be a common positive charge. 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.153
 It was neutral here. 

00:03:52.153 --> 00:03:53.520
 It was neutral here, but 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.490
 now shares his electrons. 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.120
 Now he shares these two electrons 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.850
 in a covalent bond. You can imagine that 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.090
 gives its electrons to this carbon atom 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.350
 and now has a positive charge. 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.620
 But to return to neutrality, 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.250
 water molecule 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.720
 can take that ion, maybe this one. 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.750
 It can be connected to this hydrogen. 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.720
 These electrons, both - 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.450
 It will only snap the hydrogen nucleus of the proton 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.320
 and these two electrons will return 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.520
 with this oxygen, which will become neutral. 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.350
 So we will get the following, 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.700
 I will delete this. 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.810
 This hydrogen atom is now connected 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.290
 with this oxygen and we have a hydroxone ion. 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.320
 This is logical. 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.320
 We had a hydroxone ion. 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.127
 We had a hydrogen proton here, and we still have it. 

00:05:02.127 --> 00:05:03.720
 It is now connected with water, 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.620
 so we took a proton and returned a proton, 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.990
 so we have no added charge 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.890
 or discharged from the system. 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.590
 The important thing is that 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.890
 when these two things came together, 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.690
 we lost the molecule of water. Generally 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.820
 this system lost the molecule of water. 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.990
 Get a charge to do it to create a molecule of water. 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.190
 But the thing that really disappeared from 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.590
 these two molecules are 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.720
 this is here. 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.990
 This H is this, this oxygen is this one. 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.920
 And this hydrogen atom is this one. 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.190
 Type of reaction in which 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.250
 we synthesize a more complex molecule, 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.190
 a longer chain of glucose molecules, 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.130
 is called dehydration. 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.550
 What we did here 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.360
 is called dehydration. 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.320
 Why do we call it that? 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.890
 Because we have separated the molecule of water. 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.460
 If you imagine you lose water, 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.790
 you imagine dehydration. 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.720
 At the same time, we associate two things, 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.050
 to synthesize a larger molecule. 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.120
 Sometimes this is called condensation. 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.590
 Condensation. 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.350
 When they connect, these two molecules 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.950
 form a disaccharide. 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.720
 Each in itself was a monosaccharide, 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.150
 the one on the right is monosaccharide. 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.920
 What does monosaccharide mean? 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.750
 Mono means single or one, 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.050
 and saccharide comes from the Greek word for sugar. 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.650
 The Greek word for sugar is - 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.420
 I will do it wrong - sakcharon. 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:14.950
 When people say something is sugar, 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.788
 it is very, very sweet. 

00:07:16.788 --> 00:07:19.250
 The Greek word for sugar is sakcharon. 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.690
 Therefore, saccharide means sugar, monosaccharide - a single sugar. 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.150
 This means sugar. 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.120
 The general term saccharide means 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.150
 not just simple sugar such as monosaccharides, 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.960
 can also mean two of these things that come together. 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.920
 There are other simple sugars, fructose and others. 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.710
 It can mean several of those connected together. 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.190
 We may have polysaccharides. 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.550
 The whole class, saccharides, 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.720
 is associated with carbohydrates. 

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.720
 We started with these two monosaccharides here. 

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.620
 And this is disaccharide. 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.220
 This is disaccharide. 

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.390
 We have two related monosaccharides. 

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.990
 This is disaccharide. 

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.070
 This disaccharide is just maltose. 

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.750
 The point of this video was to see 

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.720
 how can we start with these simple sugars, 

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.690
 these monosaccharides and form disaccharides. 

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.110
 In fact, you can continue. 

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.590
 You can continue the reactions of dehydration 

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.850
 or condensation and add 

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.690
 more and more monosaccharides, to build 

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.720
 longer and longer chains. 

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.050
 If you continue, 

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.790
 if you continue to extend the chains, 

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.550
 you will reach the world of polysaccharides. 

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.450
 Polysaccharides consist of very simple sugars, 

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.853
 many monosaccharides linked together. 

00:08:43.853 --> 00:08:46.020
 This is also the case with sugar, 

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.150
 you will see that often in chemistry, 

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.450
 we have one building block, this single sugar here, 

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.220
 more generally, we can call it 

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.320
 monomer. 

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.020
 If we connect several monomers to each other, 

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.020
 a polymer will be produced. 

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.520
 Polysaccharides are also extremely important, 

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.790
 you probably ate some polysaccharides today. 

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.150
 I'm sure you have polysaccharides, 

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.850
 stored in their cells at the moment. 

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.990
 If we bind glucose molecules between them, 

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.890
 and continue the process, 

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.730
 we will get a polymer 

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.786
 often encountered in plants 

00:09:27.786 --> 00:09:30.020
 such as starch. 

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.350
 Polysaccharide, which you can find in plants 

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:37.640
 is the staple, which consists of related glucose molecules. 

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.790
 For cells to have instant access to stored energy, 

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.720
 several molecules of glucose form glycogen. 

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.810
 Polysaccharides 

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.560
 consist of simple sugars, 

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.250
 of several related monosaccharides. 

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.260
 They are often found in biology. 

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.050
 You probably tried them and stored them 

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.720
 in your body at the moment.
