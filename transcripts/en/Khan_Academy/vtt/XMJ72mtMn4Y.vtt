00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.800
A line goes through the points (-1, 6)

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.333
and (5, 4). What is the equation of the line?

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:12.133
Let's just try to visualize this. So that is my

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.800
x axis. And you don't have to draw it

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.200
to do this problem but it always help to visualize

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.733
That is my y axis. And the first point is (-1,6)

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:29.400
So (-1, 6). So negative 1 coma, 1, 2, 3, 4 ,5 6.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.400
So it's this point, rigth over there, it's (-1, 6).

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.400
And the other point is (5, -4). So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.133
And we go down 4, So 1, 2, 3, 4

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:46.400
So it's right over there. So the line connects them

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.000
will looks something like this. Line will

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.333
draw a rough approximation.

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.467
I can draw a straighter than that. I will draw a dotted line maybe

00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:57.533
Easier do dotted line.

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.733
So the line will looks something like that.

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.600
So let's find its equation. So good place to start

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.000
is we can find its slope.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Remember, we want, we can find the equation

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.801
y is equal to mx plus b.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:12.733
This is the slope-intercept form where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:16.467
We can first try to solve for m. We can find the slope of this line.

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:21.133
So m, or the slope is the change in y over the change in x.

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:26.216
Or, we can view it as the y value of our end point

00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:29.467
minus the y value of our starting point over

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:33.467
the x-value of our end point minus the x-value of our starting point.

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:36.000
Let me make that clear. So this is equal to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.267
change in y over change in x wich is the same thing as

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:45.867
rise over run wich is the same thing as the y-value of

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:49.267
your ending point minus the y-value of your starting point.

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:53.400
This is the same exact thing as change in y and that over

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.200
the x value of your ending point minus the x-value of your starting point

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.933
This is the exact same thing as change in x.

00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:02.533
And you just have to pick one of these as the starting point

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:05.411
and one as the ending point. So let's just make this over here

00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:07.467
our starting point and make that our ending point.

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:10.400
So what is our change in y?

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.049
So our change in y, to go we started at y

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.000
is equal to six, we started at y is equal to 6.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.133
And we go down all the way to y is equal to negative 4

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:24.733
So this is rigth here, that is our change in y

00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:26.634
You can look at the graph and say, oh,

00:02:26.634 --> 00:02:29.978
if I start at 6 and I go to negative 4 I went down 10.

00:02:29.978 --> 00:02:33.267
or if you just want to use this formula here it will give you the same thing

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:37.315
We finished at negative 4, we finished at negative 4

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:40.380
and from that we want to subtract, we want to subtract 6.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.000
This right here is y2, our ending y and this is our beginning y

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.067
This is y1. So y2, negative 4 minus y1, 6.

00:02:53.067 --> 00:02:55.933
or negative 4 minus 6.

00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:57.800
That is equal to negative 10.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.303
And all it does is tell us the change in y

00:03:00.303 --> 00:03:01.667
you go from this point to that point

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:05.000
We have to go down, our rise is negative

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.012
we have to go down 10. That's where the negative 10 comes from.

00:03:08.012 --> 00:03:10.867
Now we just have to find our change in x.

00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:13.133
So we can look at this graph over here.

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:16.400
We started at x is equal to negative 1 and we go all the way

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.400
to x is equal to 5. So we started at x is equal to negative 1,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.533
and we go all the way to x is equal to 5.

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:26.200
So it takes us one to go to zero and then five more.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.049
So are change in x is 6.

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.200
You can look at that visually there or

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.400
you can use this formula same exact idea,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.667
our ending x-value, our ending x-value is 5

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:41.634
and our starting x-value is negative 1.

00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:46.533
5 minus negative 1. 5 minus negative 1 is the same thing as

00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:52.037
5 plus 1. So it is 6. So our slope here is negative 10 over 6.

00:03:52.037 --> 00:03:55.400
wich is the exact same thing as negative 5 thirds.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:02.067
as negative 5 over 3 I divided the numerator and the denominator by 2.

00:04:02.067 --> 00:04:05.733
So we now know our equation will be

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:10.067
y is equal to negative 5 thirds, that's our slope,

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:16.333
x plus b. So we still need to solve for y-intercept to get our equation.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:20.333
And to do that, we can use the information that we know

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:23.384
in fact we have several points of information

00:04:23.384 --> 00:04:27.133
We can use the fact that the line goes through the point (-1,6)

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.067
you could use the other point as well.

00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:31.200
We know that when is equal to negative 1,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.933
So y is eqaul to 6. So y is equal to six when x is equal to negative 1

00:04:36.933 --> 00:04:41.800
So negative 5 thirds times x, when x is equal to negative 1

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.200
y is equal to 6. So we literally just substitute this x and y value

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.867
back into this and know we can solve for b.

00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:52.733
So let's see, this negative 1 times negative 5 thirds.

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:58.133
So we have 6 is equal to positive five thirds plus b.

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:01.667
And now we can subtract 5 thirds from both sides of this equation.

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:04.733
so we have subtracted the left hand side.

00:05:04.733 --> 00:05:07.400
From the left handside and subtracted from the rigth handside

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.800
And then we get, what's 6 minus 5 thirds.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.561
So that's going to be, let me do it over here

00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:17.867
We take a common denominator. So 6 is the same thing as

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:23.291
Let's do it over here. So 6 minus 5 over 3 is the same thing as

00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:27.867
6 is the same thing as 18 over 3 minus 5 over 3

00:05:27.867 --> 00:05:36.933
6 is 18 over 3. And this is just 13 over 3. And this is just 13 over 3.

00:05:36.933 --> 00:05:39.533
And then of course, these cancel out. So we get

00:05:39.533 --> 00:05:43.400
b is equal to 13 thirds. So we are done. We know

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.867
We know the slope and we know the y-intercept.

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:49.000
The equation of our line is y is equal to

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.200
negative 5 thirds x plus our y-intercept which is 13

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.329
which is 13 over 3. And we can write these as mixed numbers.

00:05:59.329 --> 00:06:02.733
if it's easier to visualize. 13 over 3 is four and 1 thirds.

00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:05.267
So this y-intercept right over here.

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:09.800
this y-intercept right over here. That's 0 coma 13 over 3 or

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.200
0 coma 4 and 1 thirds. And even with my very roughly drawn diagram

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.467
it those looks like this. And the slope negative 5 thirds

00:06:19.467 --> 00:06:22.177
that's the same thing as negative 1 and 2 thirds.

00:06:22.177 --> 00:06:25.067
You can see here the slope is downward because the slope is negative.

00:06:25.067 --> 00:06:27.667
It's a little bit steeper than a slope of 1.

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:32.333
It's not quite a negative 2. It's negative 1 and 2 thirds.

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:35.133
if you write this as a negative, as a mixed number.

00:06:35.482 --> 99:59:59.999
So, hopefully, you found that entertaining.
