MAKING RETRO-STYLE TOASTERS

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:11.167
IS THIS BRITISH COMPANY'S
BREAD AND BUTTER.

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:13.200
WHILE SOME OF ITS MODELS
ARE NEW DESIGNS

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.667
IN A VINTAGE STYLE,

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.434
THIS ONE IS AUTHENTICALLY RETRO,

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:24.334
IN CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION
SINCE THE 1960s.

00:00:24.334 --> 00:00:28.501
THEY INSTALL
THE BREAD EJECTOR.

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:30.334
NEXT, THE HEATING ELEMENTS.

00:00:30.334 --> 00:00:31.801
BEING A HIGH-END TOASTER,

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:35.133
THE ELEMENTS ARE SHEETS
OF PURE MICA,

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:39.000
A MINERAL THAT'S HEAT-RESISTANT
UP TO 1,800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.534
THEY CONNECT THEM WITH

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:43.200
ELECTRICALLY
CONDUCTIVE COPPER LINKS.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.434
THEY MOUNT THE SWITCH

00:00:44.434 --> 00:00:48.634
THAT SELECTS THE NUMBER
OF BREAD SLICES TO TOAST.

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:51.267
THEN THEY INSTALL A RED NEON
LIGHT THAT ILLUMINATES

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:53.601
WHEN YOU START THE TOASTER
AND TURNS OFF

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:56.434
WHEN THE TOAST TIME HAS ELAPSED.

00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:58.033
THE TIMER SWITCH HAS A BELL

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:00.701
THAT SOUNDS WHEN
THE TOAST TIME IS UP,

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:05.067
AT WHICH POINT THE SWITCH CUTS
THE CURRENT TO THE ELEMENTS.

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:07.801
THEY ATTACH THE DIALS
FOR THE SLICE SELECTOR

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.467
AND TIMER SWITCHES

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:11.901
AND CONNECT THEIR WIRES
TO THE MAIN POWER CORD.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.100
THEN, THEY PLACE
THE TOASTER COMPARTMENT

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.033
INTO THE BODY AND SCREW ON

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.200
THE TOASTER'S
STAINLESS-STEEL TOP,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.534
THE PROTECTIVE FILM NOW REMOVED.

00:01:29.968 --> 00:01:32.133
THEY FLIP THE TOASTER
UPSIDE DOWN

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.968
AND WIRE UP THE ELEMENTS.

00:01:38.234 --> 00:01:40.067
THEY INSTALL THE EJECTOR KNOB,

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:44.033
POSITIONING ITS SPRING
AGAINST THE BREAD EJECTOR.

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:47.601
WHEN THE BELL RINGS,
INDICATING YOUR TOAST IS READY,

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:52.434
YOU MOVE THE KNOB TO RAISE
AND RETRIEVE YOUR SLICES.

00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:55.367
A TECHNICIAN TESTS THE TOASTER
THOROUGHLY, ENSURING

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:57.767
THAT ALL OF THE ELEMENTS HEAT
TO THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE,

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:00.667
THAT ONLY THE SELECTED
SLOTS HEAT UP,

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:02.567
THAT THE TIMER IS ACCURATE,

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:07.067
AND THAT THE BELL RINGS
WHEN THE SELECTED TIME ELAPSES.

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:08.400
[ BELL DINGS ]

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.701
THEY INSTALL THE REMOVABLE
CRUMB TRAY,

00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:12.701
THEN CLOSE UP THE BOTTOM
OF THE TOASTER

00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:15.334
WITH A VENTILATED BASE PLATE.

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:18.834
NYLON FEET ELEVATE
THE TOASTER FOR VENTILATION

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:20.968
AND TO PREVENT THE SCREWS
ATTACHING THE BASE

00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:23.267
FROM SCRATCHING
YOUR KITCHEN COUNTER.

00:02:23.267 --> 00:02:26.167
THE STYLE MAY BE RETRO,

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:29.934
BUT THIS 1960s-DESIGN TOASTER
WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:32.467
WITH ITS ENERGY-SAVING
SLICE-SELECTOR FEATURE

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:34.634
THAT STOPS THE TOASTER'S
EMPTY SLOTS

00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:37.300
FROM HEATING UP UNNECESSARILY.
