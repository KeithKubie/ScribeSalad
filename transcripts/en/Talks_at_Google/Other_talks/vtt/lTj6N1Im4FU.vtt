MALE SPEAKER: I met
Clint after a TED talk

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.530
that he gave a few weeks ago.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.520
I found the talk
incredibly touching.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.070
I have young children.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.780
They are 13 and 15.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:34.630
And it reminded me, again, how
much we have to go as a country

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.080
in truly creating an environment
where kids could be kids,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.960
and we all just had
a world in which

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.530
we were judged by our actions.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.470
And there we could
aspire to be everything

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.440
that we wanted to be.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.900
I don't think Clint needs
a special introduction.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.310
He is presented at some
of the most amazing stages

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.190
in the world, including TED.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.920
He's a PhD candidate
at Harvard and a winner

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.740
of the of the 2014 national
poetry slam championship.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.290
And I'm sure we're going to have
both an amazing talk from him

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.600
and a great Q&amp;A session that
Damien's going to mediate.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.585
With that, Clint.

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:27.277
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:27.277 --> 00:01:28.485
CLINT SMITH: I appreciate it.

00:01:28.485 --> 00:01:31.820
Thanks so much.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.920
How's everybody doing?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.830
Come on, you guys
work at Google.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.901
How's everybody doing?

00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:36.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.562
There we go.

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.228
You should be like,
ah, this is awesome.

00:01:38.228 --> 00:01:39.782
Food is free everywhere.

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:41.240
So thank you so
much for having me.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.781
Like he said, my
name is Clint Smith.

00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:45.890
I'm currently a PhD Student
at Harvard University.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.590
Just finished my first year.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.930
I have many more
Cambridge winters to go.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.644
But it's good to be
out in California

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.060
for a little bit
and kind of shake

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.337
off the blizzards that have
just become immersed in my skin.

00:01:58.337 --> 00:01:59.670
But I'm really happy to be here.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.795
I'm going to do some poems.

00:02:00.795 --> 00:02:05.611
So who here has experienced or
seen spoken word poetry before?

00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:06.110
OK.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.610
Solid.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.630
So about half.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.830
So what we like to say for those
of you who have not experienced

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.288
spoken word, for
those of you here,

00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:13.780
for those of you watching,
is that spoken word is not

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.745
like golf.

00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:16.120
And so when we
say that, we mean,

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.340
traditionally when
people think about poetry

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.525
they think you sit there
and you're just like, hmm.

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:24.465
Mm.

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:26.410
Mmm.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.620
And then you go like that.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.760
Right?

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.420
No, that's boring.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.860
That's wack.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.500
That's no fun.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.541
We don't want to do that.

00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:32.344
So can everybody snap?

00:02:32.344 --> 00:02:33.010
All right, snap?

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.560
Two fingers?

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.070
Snap?

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.361
So if you like something
during the poem, you can snap.

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:37.890
If you really,
really like something

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.460
we say you do the
delicious chocolate

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.540
noise, which means you go, mmm.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.490
Like on the top of
mouth and tongue.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.270
Just like, mmm.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.097
Everybody go, mmm.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:45.680
AUDIENCE: Mmm.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.290
There we go.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.300
And if you really, really like
something, like something just

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.510
happens, it blows you away.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.050
You're like, oh my gosh,
that happened to me,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.070
or I felt that way.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.810
I never thought of it that way.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.440
We say you do Jesus,
but with a shhh.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.740
So it's like, sheezus.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.690
And you fall over on
the person next to you,

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.070
and it's just like, oh my god.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.903
But please check with
the person next to you

00:03:03.903 --> 00:03:06.260
before, because people
got issues with space,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.840
and these are your colleagues.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.030
There's HR people here.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.684
So let's not get into that.

00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:13.100
But I'm really
excited to be here.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.230
And so I'm going to
just hop right into it

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.170
and do some poems.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.003
And then we'll have
some time for Q&amp;A, which

00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:20.070
is always my favorite part.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.920
I'll definitely stick
around at the end

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.705
and would love to
chat with you guys.

00:03:23.705 --> 00:03:26.080
So I always like to start with
this poem, because I think

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.990
it really represents why I do
my work as an educator, why

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.180
I do my work as a researcher,
and why I do my work as a poet.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.090
And this idea of speaking
into the silences

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.890
and speaking into the voids
that exist in our worlds

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.480
and making sure that I'm never
complicit in someone else's

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.640
suffering, that I'm never
complicit in violence

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.630
being exacted on any group
of people in any sort of way.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.390
And so this is a means
of holding myself

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.210
accountable to
the type of person

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.800
that I try to be for
my students and really

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.880
pushing myself to ensure that
I'm not either, again, been

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.460
complicit or perpetuating
injustice anywhere,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.230
in any form, in all
of its manifestations.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.100
As a kid in a Catholic
family in New Orleans,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.360
during Lent, I was always part
of the most meaningful thing

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.529
one could do was to
give something up,

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.405
Sacrifice something you
typically indulge in

00:04:21.405 --> 00:04:24.410
to prove to God you
understand his sanctity.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.690
I've given up soda, McDonald's,
French fries, French kisses

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.050
and everything in between.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.130
But one year I gave
up speaking, thinking

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.300
the most valuable thing I could
sacrifice was my own voice.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.400
But it was like I hadn't
realized that I had

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.700
given that up a long time ago.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.897
I spent so much on my
life telling people

00:04:43.897 --> 00:04:45.480
the things they
wanted to hear instead

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.854
of the things they needed to.

00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:49.020
Told myself I wasn't meant
to be anyone's conscience

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.080
because I still had to
figure out being my own.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.420
So sometimes, I
just wouldn't say

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.430
anything, appeasing
ignorance with my silence,

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.470
unaware that
validation doesn't need

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.340
words to endorse its existence.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.120
When Christian was beat up for
being gay, I put of my hands

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.650
in my pocket and
walked with my head

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.259
down as if I didn't even notice.

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.800
Couldn't use my locker for weeks
because the bolt on the lock

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.970
reminded me of the one
I had put on my lips

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.680
when the homeless
man on the corner

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.160
looked at me with
eyes up, merely

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.435
searching for an affirmation
that he was worth seeing.

00:05:16.435 --> 00:05:18.810
I was more concerned with
touching the screen on my Apple

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.280
than actually feeding him one.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.140
When the woman at the
fundraising gala said,

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.360
I'm so proud of you,
it must be so hard

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.290
teaching those poor,
unintelligent kids,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.925
I bit my lip,
because apparently we

00:05:27.925 --> 00:05:30.580
needed her money more than my
students needed their dignity.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.800
We spend so much time listening
to the things people are saying

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.040
that we rarely pay attention
to the things they don't.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.400
Silence is the residue of fear.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.580
It is feeling your flaws gut
wrench guillotine your tongue.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.459
It is the air retreating
from your chest

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:49.250
because it doesn't feel
safe in your lungs.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.370
Silence is Rwandan genocide.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.890
Silence is Katrina.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.980
It is what you hear when there
aren't enough body bags left.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.310
It is the sound after the
noose is already tied.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.270
It is charring.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.100
It is chains.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.020
It is privilege.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.679
It is pain.

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:04.220
There was no time to pick your
battles when your battles have

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.011
already picked you.

00:06:05.011 --> 00:06:08.170
I will not let silence wrap
itself around my indecision.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.605
I will tell Christian that he is
a lion, a sanctuary of bravery

00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:12.230
and brilliance.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.020
I will ask that homeless
man what his name is

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.960
and how his day was, because
sometimes all people want to be

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.610
is human.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.530
I will tell that
woman that my students

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.040
can talk about Transcendentalism
like their last name was

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.540
Thoreau.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.790
And just because you watched
one episode of "The Wire"

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.820
doesn't mean you know
anything about my kids.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.830
So this year, instead
of giving something up

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.360
I will live every day as if
there were a microphone tucked

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.880
under my tongue.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.390
I stage on the underside
of my inhibition.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.250
Because who has to have
a soapbox when all you've

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.720
ever needed is your voice?

00:06:45.924 --> 00:06:47.295
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:47.295 --> 00:06:48.670
So you can clap after the poem.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.242
People always get confused.

00:06:50.242 --> 00:06:51.474
They're like, oh, yeah, yeah.

00:06:51.474 --> 00:06:53.670
No, you can clap after the
poem, snap during the poem.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.170
You got it.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.210
So that's the warm up.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.900
Yeah, and so I'm from New
Orleans, born and raised.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.610
And there's nothing
like that place.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.691
And I'm a big family guy.

00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:05.190
Right?

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.400
Like all my family's down there.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.330
We have some New
Orleans people here?

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.530
Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.230
Hey.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.230
Yeah, there we go.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.730
And there's nothing
like that place.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.960
My family means so much
to me, and so many of them

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.720
are still down there.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.400
We've rebuilt and sort
of reinvented our lives

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.929
after the storm, which
will be a decade coming up.

00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:25.970
I was a senior in high
school when that happened.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.530
And so it's kind of
crazy to think of all

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.837
that's transpired since then.

00:07:30.837 --> 00:07:32.920
But like I said, my family's
been part of my life.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.240
And my father has had
chronic kidney disease

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.030
for my entire teenage
and adult life.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.760
And he's had two
kidney transplants.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.720
And two years ago, he had
his second kidney transplant

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.612
at John Hopkins in Baltimore.

00:07:46.612 --> 00:07:48.570
And he had some complications
with the surgery,

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.420
and we weren't sure what
was going to happen after.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.140
And for any of us who've had
family members or people that

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.960
are close to us become
deeply sick or deeply ill

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.520
or even passed away, the
idea being confronted

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.070
with the mortality of
someone that we almost

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.510
think of as immortal, in some
sense, especially a parent,

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.610
is deeply unsettling.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.900
And for me, it really forced
me to step back and reevaluate

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.580
and reflect on who
this man was in my life

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:19.240
and what he meant to me in a
way that I never had before.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.330
And so this poem is
for and about my dad,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.610
and really stepping
back and trying

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.320
to figure out who is this
man in the context of my life

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.252
and who I've become and
who I hope to become.

00:08:32.252 --> 00:08:33.210
And so this is for him.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.140
In New Orleans,
seafood is as much

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.620
a part of life as
changing tides.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.420
I was raised between shrimp
etouffee and fried catfish,

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.260
learned to walk on
crab legs and was

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.700
baptized in a pot of
Crawfish before I even

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.340
knew what one was.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.170
Still, I was always
disgusted by the oysters.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.296
But see, my dad loved them.

00:08:57.296 --> 00:08:59.670
He said that the zinc in the
meat was good for your hair,

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.630
and if I had seen the
hairlines on the men

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.970
on my momma's side
of the family,

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.070
I'd better start eating up.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.280
I would later learn that an
oyster's pearls were formed

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.990
from foreign parasites
that had reached

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.720
the boundaries of its shell.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.530
To protect itself
from the danger,

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.010
the oyster cocoons the
substance in coats of calcium

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.190
until the very thing that
was trying to destroy it

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.010
becomes the thing that
makes it most beautiful.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.300
Mother Nature has a
funny way of teaching us.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.960
See, last summer
while visiting home,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.564
I went to check on
my dad to see if he

00:09:29.564 --> 00:09:30.520
knew the score of the game.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.120
But when I opened the
door to his bedroom,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.370
I saw him laying on the
ground like a broken promise

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.870
genuflecting in
front of a prayer.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.485
My father held his
stomach as if he

00:09:37.485 --> 00:09:39.730
had been stabbed by the
very person entrusted

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.540
to protect him.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.970
Betrayal has never
been so silent.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.540
There is no treason like
that of your own body

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.490
turning against
itself-- a Benedict

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.210
Arnold with a bayonette in your
bloodstream, a Judas kissing

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.330
your kidneys goodbye
for 30 pieces of silver.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.527
See, chronic kidney disease is
deep sea diving with no oxygen,

00:09:56.527 --> 00:09:59.110
drowning underwater waiting for
a transplant to bring you back

00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.820
to the surface.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.770
But my father is an oyster,
wears shell hardened

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.920
by going up in a place
where expectations never

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.120
rose above low tide,
has a coral reef

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.310
of a mother with the echo of
an unborn ocean on her breath,

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.240
taught him that when
the waves of this world

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.885
try to wear you down, it's OK.

00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:15.510
We are all just a
little bit weathered.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.760
And she has taught me that if
an oyster can turn a parasite

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.700
into a pearl, then
it is no surprise

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.220
that my father can turn a
kidney into calligraphy.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.405
See, when I was 14 and
he was first diagnosed,

00:10:26.405 --> 00:10:28.790
he wrote me a
15-page letter saying

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.103
that if anything happened,
I had to be ready to become

00:10:31.103 --> 00:10:32.180
the man of the house.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.020
He wrote, Clint, though it
hasn't always looked like it,

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.740
I've always put God first.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.230
I know you complain because
Clinton Ward Smith the Third

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.870
makes it sound like you're the
heir to a British monarchy,

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.580
but never doubt, you are a king.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.690
Understand that I gave you
your grandfather's name

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.030
because the most sacred
things I have ever

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.320
known come in trinities.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.330
Clint, love your mother
like a stained glass

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.550
window in a war zone.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.400
She can be both shield
and shard, both weapon

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.160
and protection.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.080
Treat every woman like
you would want a man

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.050
to treat your sister.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.140
This ocean already
has enough sharks.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.800
Clint, don't be another shark.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.130
My father is an oyster, clasped
down tightly on the things

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.030
he loves the most, his
family and his God.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:13.120
He is a calcium encrusted heart
cradled tightly in his chest,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.200
bears scars worn from
waves that have tried

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.870
to erode him of this world.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.660
My father is an oyster,
and I pray that when

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.320
he is pulled from
the ocean that those

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.640
who live above the
surface will see

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.835
the brilliance of his pearls.

00:11:29.152 --> 00:11:35.044
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.220
And so my father,
to apply context,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.270
is a lovely, wonderful,
wonderful man.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.840
I'm from South, and he's
very much prototypical,

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.910
strong silent type.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.980
My mom was always the
koochi koochi coo.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.770
I love you.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:51.530
Muah, muah, muah.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:52.030
Right?

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:57.540
And so I would score a goal,
or do well in a track meet,

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.120
or get an A on a test, and
my mom would come hug me,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.450
and she'd be like, oh,
I'm so proud of you.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.283
You're so wonderful.

00:12:02.283 --> 00:12:02.920
You're amazing.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.550
Blah, blah, blah.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.050
Muah, muah, muah.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:05.000
Koochi koochi coo.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.333
And dad would come up to me,
and he would walk behind me

00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:08.940
and be like, good job, boy.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.190
And he slapped me on the butt.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.220
And like, all
right, that's cool.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.026
You could tell me
you love me, too.

00:12:14.026 --> 00:12:15.978
I love you dad. love you, Dad.

00:12:15.978 --> 00:12:17.990
But it was like, OK, cool, cool.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.040
And so we were in the
hospital, and I did that poem.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.300
And I've been blessed to perform
on many stages in many places

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.140
across the world.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.060
But I feel like the
most important reading

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.300
of a poem I ever did was for
my mom, my dad, my younger

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.280
brother, and my younger
sister of this poem

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.860
that I had written on
Christmas Eve of that night,

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.240
two years ago.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.120
And I did the poem,
and my mom came up

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.180
and she was super weepy eyed.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.600
And she came home and hugged me.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.350
Koochi koochi coo.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.062
I love you.

00:12:48.062 --> 00:12:48.770
Muah, muah, muah.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:49.760
You're so amazing.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.060
And my dad was in his hospital
robe, and he got out of bed.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.410
He walked over to me.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.740
And he looked at me, and
he was like, good job, boy.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.950
And I was like, oh, Dad.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.410
Come on, man.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.770
I just poured my
heart out for you.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:07.607
But no, what it's done,
though, has very much

00:13:07.607 --> 00:13:09.565
allowed us to recalibrate
our own relationship.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.740
It's helped me and
him, I think, push back

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.430
against our own socialized,
preconceived notions

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.440
of how men are supposed to show
love and affection for another.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.530
So I tell my father I
love him all the time

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.529
when we're on the phone.

00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:25.790
He does the same.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.460
And it's unfortunate that
it will take something

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.670
like that sometimes to do that.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:35.190
But I think it's been a
huge lesson for each of us.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.860
And I'm so grateful that
I could learn that lesson

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.206
without having to lose
him and transfer that

00:13:41.206 --> 00:13:43.330
into all the other
relationships I have in my life.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.620
Because we have examples every
day of how precious life is.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.630
And growing up, my
parents knew that.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.320
And especially in the
context of this past year

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.800
and all that has transpired
with regard to unarmed black men

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.560
and women being killed
by police and vigilante

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.660
in a way that is
not necessarily new,

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.170
it is only new in the
context of that we

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.760
live in a hyper-documented
era in which everyone

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.510
has camera phones.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.010
And these are things that black
people have been saying have

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.830
been happening for a long time.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.230
But now, everybody has
an iPhone or an Android,

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.420
and it's brought to the
forefront of our attention

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.370
in a way that it hasn't before.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.600
So my parents were accutely
aware of this going up.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.670
And I think for
them, it was always

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:29.110
a wrestling of how
do you reconcile

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.510
the tension between wanting
your child to be a child

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:38.560
and to run around and play and
be curious and make mistakes,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.070
also knowing that the way
I had to navigate the world

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:45.820
was drastically different
than my white friends,

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.540
and that we couldn't
do the same things.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.248
We couldn't act the
same because they had

00:14:49.248 --> 00:14:50.470
very different implications.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.344
And I've been thinking
a lot about this year,

00:14:52.344 --> 00:14:54.410
the pedagogy of black
parenting and what

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.130
it means to raise a
child in a world that

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.970
is often taught to fear them.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.920
And so I had the privilege
of speaking at TED

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.100
a few weeks ago.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.200
TED's a crazy
experience, because you

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.130
have the virtual reality corner
over there, the 3D printing

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.460
corner over there.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.620
Al Gore's hanging
out at the salad bar.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.940
It's just crazy.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.200
Bill Gates is walking
around in a bowling suit.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.290
It's wild.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.460
I was afforded the
opportunity to present there.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.950
And for me, I was like, well,
if I'm going to go speak at TED,

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.590
a place that very
much represents

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:36.670
a different stratosphere of
wealth and power and influence,

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.974
I want to bring a
message that I'm not sure

00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:42.015
would otherwise be there.

00:15:42.015 --> 00:15:49.910
And I don't want people to
not know that this exists.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.260
I think that there
are people who

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:57.290
decide to purposely not
engage and to ignore things.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:01.502
But I wanted to bring at least a
part of what this broader Black

00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:03.960
Lives Matter movement is about
to the forefront of people's

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.600
attention who might
not be receiving

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.780
that message in other ways.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.900
And so I've presented it
and was immensely thankful

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.790
for the opportunity.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.640
And it's out in the world now.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.890
And this is it.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.510
One night when I was 12 years
old on an overnight field trip

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.480
to another city, my friends
and I bought super soakers

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.220
and turned the hotel parking
lot into our own water-filled

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.630
battle zone.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.730
We hid behind cars, running
through the darkness that

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.310
lay between the streetlights,
boundless laughter ubiquitous

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.130
across the pavement.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.420
But within 10 minutes,
my father came outside,

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.970
grabbed me by my forearm,
and led me into our room

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.130
with an unfamiliar grip.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.120
Before I could say
anything, tell them

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.330
how foolish he had made me
look in front of my friends,

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:57.370
he derided me for being so
naive, looked me in the eye,

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:02.790
fear consuming his face,
and said, Son, I'm sorry,

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.640
but you can't act the same
as your white friends.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.720
You can't pretend to shoot guns.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.910
You can't run
around in the dark.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.190
You can't hide behind anything
other than your own teeth.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.579
I know now how
scared he must been,

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:19.486
how easily I could have fallen
into the empty of the night,

00:17:19.486 --> 00:17:23.230
that some man would mistake
this water for a good reason

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.712
to wash all of this away.

00:17:25.712 --> 00:17:27.420
These are the sorts
of messages I've been

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.680
inundated with my entire life.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.680
Always keep your hands
where they can see them.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.850
Don't move too quickly.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.780
Take off your hood
when the sun goes down.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.820
My parents raised
me and my siblings

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.580
in an armor of advice,
an ocean of alarm bells

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.010
so someone wouldn't steal
the breath from our lungs,

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.190
so that they wouldn't make
a memory of this skin,

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.415
so that we could be kids,
not casket or concrete.

00:17:46.415 --> 00:17:48.790
And it's not because they
thought it would make us better

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.820
than anyone else.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.020
It's simply because they
wanted to keep us alive.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.670
All of my black friends were
raised with the same message,

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:56.439
the talk.

00:17:56.439 --> 00:17:57.980
Given to us when we
became old enough

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.070
to be mistaken for a
nail ready to be hammered

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.110
to the ground, when
people made our melanin

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.870
synonymous with
something to be feared.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.040
But what does it do to a child
to grow up knowing that you

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.780
cannot simply be a child, that
the whims of adolescence are

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.570
too dangerous for your breath?

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.020
Then you cannot
simply be curious,

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.840
for you are not afforded the
luxury of making a mistake,

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.300
that someone's implicit
bias might be the reason you

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.540
don't wake up in the morning.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.477
But this cannot be
what defines us,

00:18:24.477 --> 00:18:26.810
because we have parents who
raised us to understand that

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.250
our bodies weren't meant
for the backside of a bullet

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.260
but for flying kites and
jumping rope and laughing until

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.120
our stomachs burst.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.140
We had teachers who taught us
how to raise our hands in class

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.515
and not just to
signal surrender,

00:18:37.515 --> 00:18:39.431
and that the only thing
that we should give up

00:18:39.431 --> 00:18:41.740
is the idea that we aren't
worthy of this world.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.640
So when we say that
black lives matter,

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.064
it's not because others don't.

00:18:45.064 --> 00:18:46.480
It's simply because
we must affirm

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.600
that we are worthy of
existing without fear

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.912
when there's so many things
that tell us we are not.

00:18:50.912 --> 00:18:52.870
I want to live in a world
where my son will not

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.328
be presumed guilty
the moment he is

00:18:54.328 --> 00:18:56.700
born, where a toy in
his hand isn't mistaken

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.680
for anything other than a toy.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.900
And I refuse to accept that
we can't build this world

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.510
into something new, some place
where a child's name doesn't

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.090
have to be written on a
t-shirt or a tombstone,

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.680
where the value
of someone's life

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.880
isn't determined by
anything other than the fact

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.190
that they had lungs, a place
where every single one of us

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.580
can breathe.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:20.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.090
And so I care deeply
about the issues

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.530
of racial and social justice.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.680
And I think, for
me, as an educator,

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.940
I'm deeply invested
in ensuring that we

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.280
have honest conversations
moving forward

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.970
about what racial justice
is and looks like.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.480
And I think that's
the thing that

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.110
happens in the corporate world,
in academia, in non-profits,

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.640
where everyone's
talking about diversity.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.470
Diversity conversations, we all
just need to have conversation.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.270
And we can be inundated
with that language

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.240
to the point where it
becomes meaningless.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.050
What are we actually saying?

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.120
We need to have a conversation.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.536
What does diversity
actually mean?

00:20:00.536 --> 00:20:03.940
We've become a
world of euphemisms.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.637
And for me, I deeply
believe that we

00:20:07.637 --> 00:20:09.470
can't have an honest
conversation about race

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.430
moving forward
unless we're being

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.080
honest about the
socio-historical context

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.530
of race in this country at large
over the last 300, 400 years.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.260
For me, as an educator, I'm
really interested in this idea

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.420
of revisionist history
and pushing back

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:29.715
against this myopic view of
what our country is, what

00:20:29.715 --> 00:20:31.842
our country has
done, specifically

00:20:31.842 --> 00:20:33.550
to marginalized
communities, and thinking

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:36.130
of when we read our
American history

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.950
textbooks, what
voices are we hearing,

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:39.230
and what voices aren't we?

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.730
How are certain
people be betrayed,

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.188
and how are others
being portrayed?

00:20:42.188 --> 00:20:47.520
Or how are certain
social phenomena

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.460
or legislative phenomena being
conveyed as successes when they

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.950
were only successes for
certain groups of people

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.800
and were specifically
created to be

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.690
unsuccessful for other
groups of people?

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.280
So I think a lot about that,
and a lot of my research

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.090
is around how that
happens as a grad student.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:13.200
And so a few months ago,
I spent some time reading

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.906
Thomas Jefferson's
memoir, "Notes

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:16.480
on the State of Virginia."

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.270
And in it, he says
very explicitly

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.710
that the slave is
incapable of love,

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.350
and taht black
people are inherently

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.440
inferior to white people.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.190
The slave is incapable of love.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.550
The slave is incapable of
possessing and sustaining

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.100
complex emotion.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:35.180
And so what does that mean
for the person who was largely

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.390
the intellectual founding
father of this country,

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.307
responsible for, in large
part, the conception

00:21:39.307 --> 00:21:40.723
of the Declaration
of Independence

00:21:40.723 --> 00:21:42.600
and the Constitution,
to have not thought

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.760
that I was fully human,
to have not thought

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.860
that I could love my
mother or my father

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.830
or my sister or
my partner or art,

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:53.450
that I could have passions,
that I was inherently

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.830
incapable of those things?

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.210
And when we think
about that, how

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.360
does that fit perfectly into the
narrative arc of this country's

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.480
history of dehumanizing
black and brown bodies?

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.590
This is a new thing.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.890
I think that's my
point, is that a lot

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.600
of people who were inundated
with my Mike Browns

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.790
and the Eric Garners
and the Walter Scotts

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.270
and the far too many names.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.760
And people were like,
where did this come from?

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.830
Why did police just start
killing black people?

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.680
There have been state sanctioned
dehumanization and violence

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.159
against black people since
the inception of this country.

00:22:29.159 --> 00:22:31.700
And so again, I think if we're
going to move forward and have

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.600
a conversation about how we
eradicate state sanctioned

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.650
violence against
black people, we

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.900
have to have a conversation
about the state sanctioned

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.150
violence that has happened
against black people

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.330
for centuries and centuries.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.020
And I'm interested
in it making sure

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.740
that we're
representing and giving

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.430
a holistic account
of our history

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.350
and of the different
players in our history.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.400
And so this poem is about
some of our founding fathers

00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:00.130
and trying to give a more
fully representative account

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.200
their transgressions,
so to speak.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.590
Letter to five of the
presidents who owned slaves

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.490
while they were in office.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.292
George Washington, when
you won the revolution,

00:23:14.292 --> 00:23:16.750
how many of your soldiers did
you send from the battlefield

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.030
to the cotton field?

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.567
How many had to trade in
their rifles for plows?

00:23:20.567 --> 00:23:23.150
Can you blame the slave that ran
away to fight for the British

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.340
because at least
the Red Coats were

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.590
honest about their oppression?

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.464
Thomas Jefferson, when
you told Sally Hemings

00:23:27.464 --> 00:23:30.120
that you would free her children
if she remained your mistress,

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.280
did you think there was
honor in your ultimatum?

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.820
Did you think we wouldn't
be able to recognize

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.120
the assault in your signature?

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.630
Does raping your slave when
you disguise it as bribery

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.187
make it less of a crime?

00:23:39.187 --> 00:23:41.145
When you wrote the
Declaration of Independence,

00:23:41.145 --> 00:23:42.974
did you ever intend
for black people

00:23:42.974 --> 00:23:44.390
to have freedom
over their bodies?

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.210
James Madison, when
you wrote to Congress

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:47.820
that black people
should count as 3/5

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.194
of a person, how long did you
have to look at your slaves

00:23:50.194 --> 00:23:51.370
to figure out the math?

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.659
Was it easier to chop them up?

00:23:52.659 --> 00:23:54.700
Do you think they'd be
happy being more than just

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.360
half human?

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.460
James Monroe, when you proposed
sending slaves back to Africa,

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.710
did black bodies feel
like rented tools?

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.920
When you branded them, did
the scar on their chest

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.580
include an expiration date?

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.062
When you named the
country Liberia,

00:24:06.062 --> 00:24:07.270
were you trying to be ironic?

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.500
Does this really
count as liberation?

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.230
Andrew Jackson, was the Trail
of Tears not enough for you?

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.380
Was killing Cherokee, Choctaw,
Creek, Seminoles not enough

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.140
to quench your imperialism?

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.520
How many brown
bodies do you have

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.540
to bulldoze before you
can call it progress?

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.450
Mr. Washington, Jefferson,
Madison, Monroe, Jackson,

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:25.940
when you put your
hand on the Bible

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.490
and swore to protect
this country,

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.490
let's be honest in who
you were talking about.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.670
When the first Independence Day
fireworks set the sky aflame,

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.520
don't forget where we
were watching from.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.300
So when you remember
Jefferson's genius,

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.675
don't forget the
slaves who built

00:24:37.675 --> 00:24:39.190
the bookshelves in his library.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.350
When you remember
Jackson's victories in war,

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:43.480
don't forget what he was
fighting to preserve.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.970
When you sing that the country
was founded on freedom,

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.470
don't forget the
duet of shackles

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:48.830
dragging against the ground.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:53.420
My entire life, I've been taught
how perfect this country was.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.420
But no one ever told me
about the pages torn out

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.080
of my textbooks, how black
and brown bodies have been

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.740
bludgeoned for three
centuries and find

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.030
no place in the curriculum.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.440
Oppression doesn't disappear
just because you decided

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.540
not to teach us that chapter.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.690
If you only hear one side
of the story, at some point

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.934
you have to question
who the writer is.

00:25:12.934 --> 00:25:16.782
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:18.614 --> 00:25:19.530
I appreciate you guys.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.821
I'm going to do one more
poem, and then hopefully we'll

00:25:21.821 --> 00:25:23.480
have some time for questions.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:28.650
And so I do a lot of poems
about ostensibly heavy subject

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.540
matters.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.689
I talk a lot about race
and class and gender,

00:25:32.689 --> 00:25:34.480
and all these different
facets of identity.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.110
And I often do in the
context of my students.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:40.050
I talk about my students and
the communities they come from,

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:43.300
and their families, just
wonderful, wonderful people.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:48.370
And I want to always be
clear that, in discussing

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:54.150
these issues and thinking about
the contemporary realities that

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:58.690
exist in the context of race
and class and our history,

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.840
it's important not to conflate
the structural realities

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.350
with people themselves.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.180
And so I think oftentimes even
well intentioned people will

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.330
go in and say, oh, we have to
fix these communities, which

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:11.830
is really them
thinking that we have

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.704
to fix the people in
these communities, which

00:26:13.704 --> 00:26:15.847
is misguided.

00:26:15.847 --> 00:26:17.430
There's nothing wrong
with the people.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.970
There's nothing wrong
with people in communities

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:19.928
we're seeking to serve.

00:26:19.928 --> 00:26:23.580
It's that they've been subjected
to, again, state sanctioned

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.550
violence in both a metaphorical
and quite literal way,

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.140
in that they're existing
in structurally deficient

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.780
communities that we have
failed to serve adequately

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.564
for many, many years.

00:26:34.564 --> 00:26:36.230
And so I'm always
careful in making sure

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.063
that we're using language
that's asset based

00:26:38.063 --> 00:26:39.410
rather than deficit based.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:44.090
And that when we're talking
about students, for example,

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.360
when we say something is
wrong with the school,

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.980
we're not actually
saying the children

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.215
in the school or the
teachers themselves,

00:26:50.215 --> 00:26:55.014
because we can't look at any
of these things in isolation.

00:26:55.014 --> 00:26:57.180
We can't think about education
without also thinking

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.170
about mass incarceration,
without also thinking

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.660
about housing discrimination,
but also thinking

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.450
about immigration policy.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:06.510
All of these things are
deeply, deeply connected.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.080
And so this poem is a
way to remind myself

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.610
that the young
people I work with

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.500
are brilliant and
amazing and wonderful.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.900
And it's everything
around them that we

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.910
need to work in
partnership with them

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:22.250
to fix instead of this
idea of fixing them.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.150
When the world thinks
about my students,

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.810
too often they see
caricatures of pity,

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:34.266
metaphors of misery that can
do nothing for themselves.

00:27:34.266 --> 00:27:36.710
But every day, I see resilience.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.140
I see boys and girls turn
into young men and women

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.790
right in front of my face.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:43.340
I see students who walk to
school on street corners

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.350
where policeman can make them
feel more terror than talent.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.570
But they still show up
for tutoring at 6:30

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.840
in the morning.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.710
So often we focus so
much on the quicksand

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.790
that we fail to see what
has refused to drown.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.800
So when you think about
my kids, don't just

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.309
think about what
holds them down.

00:27:59.309 --> 00:28:01.100
Think about how they
overcome it every day.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.350
Think of Janya, who turns my
classroom into a coliseum,

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.550
every word she speaks
coded in creativity.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.950
Her poetry would have
brought Homer to his feet.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.709
Think of Anna, who
became an honor roll

00:28:10.709 --> 00:28:13.000
student when the world wanted
to free and reduced lunch

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:13.520
define her.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.797
She is more than a form.

00:28:14.797 --> 00:28:15.880
She is more than a number.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.380
Think of Chris, who
has been working

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.120
every day since he was 13.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.320
That money helps his
mother keep the lights on

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.260
so that their world isn't
covered in darkness.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.730
My students have
turned my classroom

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.060
into a symphony
of second chances.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:29.814
Every day we write
to right the wrongs

00:28:29.814 --> 00:28:31.230
that have been
done to communities

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:32.290
that never had a choice.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.015
We read to learn how to
tell our own stories,

00:28:35.015 --> 00:28:37.640
because no one can define who we
are if we are the ones holding

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.360
the dictionary.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.930
So don't tell my kids
aren't brilliant.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.270
Don't tell me that they
aren't walking miracle.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.460
My students have taught me how
to relearn every part of me.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.290
I carry their stories like
a back pocket full a prayer.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.090
And I leave my classroom
a better person every day.

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:56.000
So when we speak of them,
let us speak of humanity.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.840
Let us speak of perseverance.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:59.510
Let us speak of
how funny they are.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.350
Let us speak of how
courageous they are.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.190
Let us not focus so
much on the shadow

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.990
that we fail to see
what stands above it.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.650
Let us celebrate
the best of our kids

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:12.436
as we would want anybody to
celebrate the best of us.

00:29:12.436 --> 00:29:13.102
Thank you, guys.

00:29:13.102 --> 00:29:16.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:20.134 --> 00:29:22.300
DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: Hi
to everybody in the room.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.133
Hi, everybody who's
joining via live stream.

00:29:24.133 --> 00:29:25.890
My name is Damien
Hooper-Campbell,

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.660
proud member of Google's
Black Googler network,

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.615
and also a member of
the diversity team here.

00:29:32.615 --> 00:29:34.240
I'm going to be quick,
because I really

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.115
want to hand the remote
control back over to you

00:29:36.115 --> 00:29:36.948
all in the audience.

00:29:36.948 --> 00:29:39.250
I think your questions are
probably better than mine.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:41.320
But I want to ask you a
couple quick questions,

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.486
and then we'll pass it over.

00:29:42.486 --> 00:29:45.730
So the first one is,
when did this happen?

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:46.480
CLINT SMITH: Yeah.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.771
DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: You're
a very talented brother.

00:29:48.771 --> 00:29:51.890
But when did you just
know, I got this talent.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.930
Bring us back to that moment.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:55.305
How did this all happen for you?

00:29:55.305 --> 00:29:57.430
CLINT SMITH: I've always
loved reading and writing.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.260
I was a strange
big-headed child.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.307
And so when I was
in third grade,

00:30:04.307 --> 00:30:05.640
we had our third grade yearbook.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.334
And everybody could
say, what did you

00:30:07.334 --> 00:30:08.500
want to be when you grow up?

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.660
And so, eight years old,
most third graders say,

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:12.990
I want to be an
astronaut or a fireman

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.480
or a ballerina or
a football star.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:20.520
And mine was like, I want to be
a Newbery Award winning author.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.160
I was so lame.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.870
Reading and writing
were directly

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.060
associated with this
notion of discovery.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:35.194
My parents had
these encyclopedias

00:30:35.194 --> 00:30:36.360
that they kept in our house.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.480
And if I ever had a question,
my mom would say, look it up.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.030
So I was always just
a deeply curious kid

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.930
and learned that
spending time with words

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:50.775
was how I could figure out how
I would navigate the world.

00:30:50.775 --> 00:30:52.400
But I also played
sports my whole life.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.627
And I ended up getting a
soccer scholarship to college.

00:30:55.627 --> 00:30:56.960
But I didn't play a lot college.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.330
And so I kind of had this
19-year-old existential crisis

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.230
where this thing
that had largely

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.830
been the way I was
identified my entire life I

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.120
wasn't good at anymore.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.850
I was sitting on the bench.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.239
I would later
learn that I should

00:31:11.239 --> 00:31:13.280
have known, because New
Orleans isn't necessarily

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.870
a hotbed of soccer talent
to compare yourself to.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.390
But yeah, so then I had an
internship in New York City.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.040
And I went to a place called
the Nuyorican Poetry Cafe,

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.550
the Lower East
Side of Manhattan.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.080
And it changed my life.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.040
I'd never experienced
art in that way.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.112
So Nuyorican Poetry Cafe
is a small poetry spot

00:31:33.112 --> 00:31:34.070
on the Lower East Side.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:35.960
But it's like the
mecca of spoken word,

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.590
well known throughout the
country and the world.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.200
And the first poem
I ever heard was

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:44.080
a woman who did a poem
about having Cerebral Palsy.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.110
Disability wasn't
something that was ever

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:48.390
at the forefront of
my consciousness.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.180
But in three minutes,
the way I thought

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.280
about an entire demographic
of people completely changed.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.810
And to me, that was remarkable,
someone could get on stage

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:56.920
and tell their story.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.490
And I entered the room thinking
about the world one way

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.782
and leave that same room
thinking about the world

00:32:01.782 --> 00:32:02.740
completely differently.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:03.930
And I was like, I don't
know what this is,

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:04.888
but I'm going to do it.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.410
I mean, I'm a
pretty awkward dude.

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.800
I was never the kid who was
excited to share in class.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.391
I was a fairly quiet kid.

00:32:17.391 --> 00:32:19.890
And so the idea of standing in
front of a group of strangers

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:26.180
and being vulnerable
was unsettling.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.555
But I knew the end product
and what it could do

00:32:28.555 --> 00:32:31.615
and what art at its best
could do in that form.

00:32:31.615 --> 00:32:34.610
And yeah, I was fortunate
to go to Davidson College,

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.170
a small liberal arts college.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:37.889
Steph Curry was my classmate.

00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:38.680
Shout out to Steph.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.510
I see you.

00:32:42.485 --> 00:32:45.600
And yeah, liberal
arts colleges, it's

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.640
all about the journey
and not the destination.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.280
I came back, and
I was like, guys,

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.860
I'm gonna be a spoken word poet.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.440
And they were like, OK, Clint.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.857
You write your poems.

00:32:57.857 --> 00:32:59.440
But I just worked
on it, and I decided

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.650
it was something I really
wanted to be great at.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:03.941
I became an English major.

00:33:03.941 --> 00:33:07.090
I just took every opportunity
I could to go to Charlotte

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.240
and spend time in the
open mic community,

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.789
and just decided
this was something I

00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:13.080
wanted to be a part of my life.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.060
And I could have
never anticipated

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.670
that it would become what it's
become, but I'm very grateful.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:18.878
DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: Yeah.

00:33:18.878 --> 00:33:21.472
We are very grateful
that you visited

00:33:21.472 --> 00:33:25.100
the Nuyorican Cafe and the whole
nine, because you are very good

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:25.600
it.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.300
You brought me back to the
movie "Love Jones" for a while.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.044
CLINT SMITH: No
Nia Long, though.

00:33:32.044 --> 00:33:34.460
DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: So you
touched on it a little bit,

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.130
about impact and influence.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.700
At Google, shout out
to Google a little bit.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.200
On the diversity
team, we talk a lot

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.655
about expanding the
pool of technologists.

00:33:42.655 --> 00:33:44.030
We look in, we
say, well, we only

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:47.102
have 2% of our workforce
in the United States

00:33:47.102 --> 00:33:49.950
at Google is black,
and 3% are Hispanic.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.530
And then if you really
start to distill that

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.330
by who are in tech roles
and non-tech roles,

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:56.720
the number becomes even crazier.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.515
And we know technology's
running everything right now,

00:33:59.515 --> 00:34:01.129
and for the foreseeable future.

00:34:01.129 --> 00:34:02.670
You're on the ground
though, brother.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:05.730
You're there with
students every single day.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:07.150
So think about impact.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:14.380
How does the tech world
connect with the students who

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.199
are in Baltimore,
who are in Ferguson,

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:20.440
and help them to get excited
about this the same way

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.540
that you get them excited
about spoken word, et cetera?

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.310
How do we impact?

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:25.143
How do we influence?

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.478
CLINT SMITH: Yeah, no,
that's a great question.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.462
I think of myself.

00:34:30.462 --> 00:34:32.420
I've never been a tech
person, but like I said,

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.010
I always loved writing.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:37.610
But growing up, I didn't see
a lot of black male writers.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.300
I didn't really know many.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.030
I wasn't exposed
to many growing up.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.199
And there was one main
writer, Walter Dean Myers.

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:49.989
He wrote a lot of books with
young black male protagonists.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:51.969
And if it wasn't
for him, I don't

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:55.440
know that I would have ever
been able to envision myself

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.600
as a writer.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.810
And I've never had the
pleasure of meeting him.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.290
He passed away last year.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:05.860
But I wish I could tell him
how deeply he impacted my life.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.340
And I think it's because I was
able to see myself, someone who

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:14.620
looked like me, in a role that
either implicitly or directly I

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.910
was told wasn't for me.

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.292
When I say I want to be a
writer, it's, in some ways,

00:35:20.292 --> 00:35:22.750
almost the same as saying I
want to be a basketball player,

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.300
I want to be a football--
people are like, oh, well, OK.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.620
That's not something
that is seen

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.380
as attainable in some sorts.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:35.000
But because I had an image
of someone who was doing it,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.940
who was doing it well, and
who I could see myself in,

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.040
it was just hugely,
hugely important

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.290
in a way that I'm only really
beginning to understand.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:47.540
And so I think,
with regard to tech,

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.745
I imagine that it's the same.

00:35:50.745 --> 00:35:51.620
I taught high school.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:59.620
Kids are deeply
imaginative individuals,

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:02.320
but they're also human.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.450
And so if you don't see
someone who looks like you,

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:08.970
or if you don't see
someone who looks like you,

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.900
or are not told ever that this
is something you can or should

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:14.429
do, then you don't
even know that that's

00:36:14.429 --> 00:36:15.720
something you should reach for.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:20.680
If all you know of
Google is a bunch

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.840
of people who don't
have brown faces,

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.480
then you don't ever envision
yourself working at Google.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:29.524
And so I think part of what--
and I imagine, hopefully

00:36:29.524 --> 00:36:31.940
you all are doing something
like this before-- but I mean,

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.130
just literally
putting people who

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:39.200
look like so many of our kids
in front of our kids and saying,

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.380
you can do this.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:40.940
You can.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.020
I've done it.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:44.880
And even if it's different
lived experiences,

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.050
because black people are a
very heterogeneous community,

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.080
and we all come from various
backgrounds and experiences.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.970
But just the simple act
of being able to-- like,

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:56.730
if you came into my classroom,
and I looked at you,

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.320
and I was like, OK.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.480
I could work at Google.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.650
I might not tell you
that, because I'm

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.840
a stubborn 14-year-old and
I'm like, man, whatever.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.370
I ain't got the time.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:06.610
But that's what I would feel.

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.960
And so I think it's really
just about showing young folks

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.902
that you belong
here, and then making

00:37:12.902 --> 00:37:15.026
them feel like they belong
here once they get here.

00:37:15.026 --> 00:37:15.430
DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: Cool.

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:16.120
Thank you.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.869
Last question, and
then we'll turn it over

00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:19.095
to you all in the audience.

00:37:19.095 --> 00:37:22.020
I spent some time watching
your TED talks this weekend.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.370
And I literally was ironing
while I was watching one.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:28.420
And I put it on for three times
because it was so powerful,

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:30.110
and I didn't want
to miss anything.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.470
And we do good work here,
at least I feel like we do.

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:34.940
And I felt inspired.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:39.067
But I guess there was one
part-- the one about silence--

00:37:39.067 --> 00:37:40.900
where you said you had
talked about spending

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:45.410
so much of your life telling
people what they wanted to hear

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:47.990
versus what they needed to hear.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:49.550
You look out into
the audience, there

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.600
are brilliant minds here--
black minds, white minds,

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.310
Hispanic minds, just everything.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:57.230
You have a captive
audience here.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:01.380
What do we actually need to
hear, as members of Google?

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:06.370
And how we can create impact
to address many of the problems

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:07.400
that you talk about?

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.150
CLINT SMITH: Yeah.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:12.590
Well, I mean, the first is to
recognize the immense leverage

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.340
that an organization
like Google-- I mean,

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.970
Google is one of the most
powerful organizations

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:17.880
in the world.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.720
I was having a conversation
with some folks earlier,

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.010
and they said, as soon
as you tell someone,

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.680
I work at Google, then
almost the way they interact

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.260
with you completely changes.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.500
And so there is power there.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.940
And so I think it goes
back to recognizing

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.020
there's a level of influence,
both as an individual who

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:42.360
represents this organization and
the organization holistically.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.010
And touching back on what I
said before, making sure we're

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:47.160
having honest conversations.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:51.120
I think it's so important
for every single person

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.510
to be an ambassador
of racial justice.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.320
We all, once we leave here,
once we leave Google, like

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:07.190
all exist and navigate and exist
in these different communities,

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:10.170
and some of which have
these conversations a lot,

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:12.100
some of which never have
these conversations.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.290
And I think for so
long I was always

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:17.750
scared of making people
feel uncomfortable,

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:24.570
or taught to tiptoe around, just
to like not ruffle feathers.

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:28.570
But I had to sit back
and say, in doing so,

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:35.910
am I only perpetuating the
status quo that's unacceptable,

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:40.650
a status quo that is like
very helpful to certain groups

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:43.220
of people and very
dangerous for others.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:48.970
And how can I engage in this
conversation in a way that's

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.630
not going to immediately put
someone on the defensive,

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.580
but also leaves them unsettled?

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.080
Because these are
unsettling issues.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:01.200
I don't want somebody to sit
there after my TED talk poem

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.360
and just feel good.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.879
You shouldn't feel good.

00:40:04.879 --> 00:40:06.420
The stuff that's
happening is not OK.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.400
So I think we all have to
get it out of our brains

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.250
that this should be
a comfortable or safe

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:12.960
conversation.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.849
We say we want to
create a safe space,

00:40:14.849 --> 00:40:16.390
and we want people
to be comfortable.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.330
But what do we really mean
when we're saying comfort?

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.560
And who are we talking
about being comfortable?

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.780
And who are we talking
about not being comfortable?

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.210
So yeah, I think
stepping out of this idea

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:30.410
that these conversations
shouldn't be unsettling,

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:31.920
because I think they should.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.210
But at the same time, having
a level of empathy to say,

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:37.974
let's meet somebody
where they're at,

00:40:37.974 --> 00:40:39.390
because otherwise,
we're not going

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.098
to move this conversation
forward at all.

00:40:41.098 --> 00:40:43.349
And I think that
conversation clearly

00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:44.640
should be happening internally.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:52.160
But also, this is a
hugely diverse room.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:56.100
Many of you might interact with
people of different backgrounds

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.960
in a way here at Google
that you don't in your life

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.280
once you leave here,
and with people who

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.657
don't have the same
opportunity to engage

00:41:03.657 --> 00:41:05.490
with people from such
different backgrounds.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.620
And I think that's a
certain level of capital

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:13.110
that you should bring to dispel
caricatures and stereotypes

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:16.770
and pathologies and ensure that
you're speaking up in a way

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:21.740
that, if your coworker was
standing right next to you

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:27.387
when somebody said something
negative about their community,

00:41:27.387 --> 00:41:29.720
that they would expect you
to speak up for them in a way

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.377
that you would want them
to speak up for you.

00:41:31.377 --> 00:41:32.710
DAMIEN HOOPER-CAMPBELL: Love it.

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.776
Thank you for answering
those questions.

00:41:34.776 --> 00:41:36.525
Now I want to turn it
over to the audience

00:41:36.525 --> 00:41:38.934
to see if anybody
else has questions.

00:41:38.934 --> 00:41:40.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.430
I really enjoyed
your presentation.

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:45.690
My question is, you
talked about reactions,

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:47.380
people's reactions
to what you do

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.100
and the work that
you bring about.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:50.540
What have been your experiences?

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.300
How do people react,
especially when

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.130
you're in audiences
that maybe it's

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.114
a little uncomfortable
for them to hear this?

00:41:56.114 --> 00:41:57.780
What have been those
reactions from some

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.950
of those kind of
top-tier people?

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:02.280
CLINT SMITH: Yeah.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:06.210
They certainly
span the spectrum.

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:10.320
But for example, at TED,
after I did that poem,

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.410
I had a lot of folks come up
after me kind of in tears,

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.350
or really emotional.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:17.220
And they were
like, I could never

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:20.560
imagine having to have that
conversation with my child.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.370
I'm so sorry.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.470
And I don't want them to
apologize to me necessarily,

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:30.680
but I think there is
a real gap in terms

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.960
of just an understanding of
how certain people navigate

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.730
the world as compared
to your own life.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:39.480
And for me, it was
very much like, I'm not

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.670
trying to get up here and
accuse anyone of anything.

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:46.700
I don't think that's
necessarily productive

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.460
as much as it's like,
this is something

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.700
that is real in my life.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.610
And I'm always ensuring that
I'm speaking specifically

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:55.957
for my own life, because I
can't speak for other people.

00:42:55.957 --> 00:42:57.790
But I know that this
is an experience that's

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:00.460
similar for a lot of people that
I grew up with, a lot of people

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:01.930
that I know.

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:05.530
And very much having
it be something

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:08.420
that someone can't sweep
aside, because this is real.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.170
And it's personal.

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:14.830
And it's grounded in a very real
lived experience that I had.

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:16.600
And as an audience
member, I want

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.450
you to understand that
and grapple with it,

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:22.490
and think of how does that
manifest itself in your life?

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.160
Have you seen
something like this?

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.350
When you are with a colleague
or a coworker or friend

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.450
of a different race,
do you ever think

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:33.540
about how they might have
to interact with people

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:37.145
and navigate the world in a
different way than you do?

00:43:37.145 --> 00:43:43.480
Are you cognizant of that in
sort of everyday situations?

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:48.570
And so really, just trying to
plant this idea in their mind

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.220
and ensure that
it's not something

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:54.250
that they can necessarily
be naive of or ignore.

00:43:54.250 --> 00:44:00.445
And so most people give
me very positive reactions

00:44:00.445 --> 00:44:01.750
and say, thank you so much.

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:04.350
I have no idea.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:06.190
The internet's full
of trolls, right?

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.719
So it will be like, Clint
Smith hates white people.

00:44:08.719 --> 00:44:10.010
And it's like, all right, guys.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.676
That's not true.

00:44:10.676 --> 00:44:12.422
My best friend is white.

00:44:12.422 --> 00:44:14.417
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:14.417 --> 00:44:15.250
Don't ever say that.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:19.240
No.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.426
But I'm thankful
that people listen.

00:44:23.426 --> 00:44:25.550
And the thing about art is
that once you put it out

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:27.190
in the world, I have
no control over how

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:28.314
someone's going to hear it.

00:44:28.314 --> 00:44:30.410
They're like, however
many people in this room,

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:34.110
I'm sure that everybody got
something different from some

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:35.262
of the poems that I did.

00:44:35.262 --> 00:44:37.220
And that kind of just
comes with the territory.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.030
But I just know that I
want to put something out

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:41.980
into the world that's
honest, and that's real,

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.910
and that will hopefully
be thought-provoking

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:45.890
in some regard.

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:48.570
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sorry, I'm
taking a Ping question now

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:49.560
from Erin Ross.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:53.260
She wants to know, "What is
your take on activism in 2015?

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.100
Is social media the answer?

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.880
Or from your research
and experience,

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.560
do you believe it
takes much more?"

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.440
CLINT SMITH: I think what
something like social media,

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.350
like Twitter and
Facebook, have done

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:10.600
has really democratized
this idea of what activism

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:14.500
is and looks like and has
decentralized who can engage

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:15.910
and who can't
engage in activism.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:20.185
I think there's a lot of people
kind of try to rag on hashtag

00:45:20.185 --> 00:45:23.880
activism, so to speak, or
online activism as this armchair

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.380
activism where you
don't necessarily

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.460
have to invest anything
personally into it.

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.900
You can just click or post.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:33.650
But I would argue
that everything

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:37.110
that has transpired with regard
to the Department of Justice

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:40.680
going down to Ferguson, with
regard to the new police task

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:43.280
force from the White House
that just came out today

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:46.280
that has dramatically
demilitarized

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:50.530
the police from a federal
level, all of these things,

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:52.710
in many ways,
manifested themselves

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:55.480
from protests that
were organized

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.850
via online and
social media spaces.

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:03.584
And I think, for me,
I'm fortunate to go

00:46:03.584 --> 00:46:05.250
to one of the best
schools in the world.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.460
And I'm deeply grateful and
learn so much every day.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:11.340
But I'd probably learn
just as much, if not more,

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.270
from my Twitter timeline
as I do in my classes.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:18.620
I mean, there's so
many smart people

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:24.810
who are creating knowledge and
facilitating ideas and engaging

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:28.900
with one another in a
constant, 24/7 sort of way.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.400
So additionally,
what it's also done

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.454
is really decoupled
this idea of what

00:46:32.454 --> 00:46:34.870
it means to be well educated
as compared to well schooled.

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:39.650
And so often in
social movements,

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:42.070
we feel like it
has to be someone

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:44.660
who has a PhD, or someone who
went to this certain school,

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:49.520
or someone who dresses this way,
or has this sort of education.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:54.390
And it's like, no, actually
anyone who has something to say

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:56.234
can say it and can engage with--

00:46:56.234 --> 00:46:57.650
I mean, you get
on Twitter and you

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:00.780
see like professors
at Ivy League schools

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.990
engaging with
activists in Ferguson,

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:04.910
and coordinating and
supporting one another

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:06.960
and affirming one another.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.990
So I think, [INAUDIBLE], I
think it's hugely important.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:13.130
I don't think it, in and
of itself, is an end.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.770
But I think it has
really opened up

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.460
the space in terms of
who has the ability

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:22.840
to engage in this sort of
movement-building work, which

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:23.700
takes all of us.

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.640
It can't be just a few people.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.357
I think we have this
ahistorical misconception

00:47:29.357 --> 00:47:31.690
around how the civil rights
movement actually went down.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:36.170
We're like, oh, Rosa
Parks sat down on the bus.

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:38.650
And then they went on a
march, and Martin Luther King

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:39.311
had a dream.

00:47:39.311 --> 00:47:40.560
And then everybody could vote.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.270
And it was great, right?

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:45.770
It turns into like this
week-long festival.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.310
And that's not how it was.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:51.180
It was like a lot of
people beyond Dr. King,

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:57.350
beyond SNCC, beyond these
individuals and organizations

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:01.440
that we kind of lift up who
were engaging every single day

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:03.680
for a very long time.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.430
AUDIENCE: I picked the wrong
spot to sit and ask a question.

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:12.160
So I've been doing this
stuff for a long time,

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.200
obviously from a very different
vantage point than you.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.550
Is there any reason to hope?

00:48:16.550 --> 00:48:19.500
And it's not supposed to
be yes and no question--

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.815
answer rather.

00:48:21.815 --> 00:48:23.940
CLINT SMITH: No, I think
it's an important question

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:24.990
to grapple with.

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:35.000
I think I'm someone who, while
there are certainly problems

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.830
that exist, that have existed
in this country for a long time

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:45.030
and continue to exist in sort
of different manifestations

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:48.050
of themselves-- racism.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:51.480
Racism still exists and is
very pronounced in our society.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.250
It doesn't look
like it did in 1965.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:57.280
It doesn't look like
in did in 1905, 1865,

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.460
but it still exists.

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:05.050
But even amid that,
we would be misguided

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:07.160
if we didn't
recognize that there

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.990
had been immense strides made.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:20.140
If you told someone not so long
ago that this group of people

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.123
would be sitting
in this room at one

00:49:23.123 --> 00:49:25.480
of the most powerful
companies in the world,

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.720
they would have laughed
you out of the room.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:35.330
And so I think that while we
know and we cannot ever think

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:39.890
that the problems of the past
have simply been swept away

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:45.117
or are gone, we also know that
things have gotten better,

00:49:45.117 --> 00:49:47.200
and that they can, and
that they will continue to.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.340
And that there are people who
have committed their lives

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:54.690
to this work, who
have like in the past

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:57.870
and who are doing so now
and who will continue to.

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.117
I just think if you
don't have hope,

00:50:00.117 --> 00:50:01.450
I don't know what else you have.

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:03.650
Every day I wake up hopeful.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:08.160
I deeply believe that we can
build a new world, that we have

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.706
and that we will continue to.

00:50:10.706 --> 00:50:12.080
It's going to take
a lot of work.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.390
It's going to take
probably a lot of time,

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:20.310
because we are pushing
back against centuries

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:30.320
of pathology and deep,
deep hatred and violence

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.700
that has been exacted
against a lot of people,

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:38.260
and clearly exist in its
own form again today.

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.740
So yeah, I'm not someone who
believes that the US is doomed

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:50.790
or that we are destined
for never moving

00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:54.370
beyond the sort of
socially stratified place

00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:56.270
that we exist now.

00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:59.170
I think the work that
has to be done now

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:02.430
is to make sure that every
single person is invested

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:05.150
in that, that we can't afford
to have people on the sidelines.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.566
We can't afford to have it so
that people are saying like,

00:51:07.566 --> 00:51:09.705
oh, well, there's some
people doing social justice

00:51:09.705 --> 00:51:11.940
or racial justice work.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.980
But you know, I work at Google.

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:16.220
And so that's just
not my-- there

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:18.550
are lots of different ways
to engage in that work.

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:21.290
Whether it's simply having a
conversation with your family

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:24.700
that might not otherwise would
have happened around Baltimore.

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:29.110
Or, if you're in the
picket line in the streets.

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:31.520
I think that this
work can be done

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.190
in all different sorts of ways.

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.930
And it has to.

00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:37.760
And I think it's going to
have to take all of us.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.945
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
when generationally we

00:51:39.945 --> 00:51:41.960
see favorable improvements,
the challenges

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.730
of being a black male
seem to be unchanged,

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:47.660
how do we, as fathers,
brothers, uncles, et cetera,

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:52.150
educate our sons about the
world without burdening them

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:55.600
with the past so they feel
empowered to make a difference?

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.520
CLINT SMITH: Yeah.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.420
Clearly, that's
been a question I've

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.640
been thinking
about and grappling

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.430
with in some way my entire life.

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:09.200
But certainly, very, very
acutely over the course

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.000
of the past year.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.730
I don't have a son.

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:17.930
And if I'm fortunate enough
to have a son one day,

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:21.630
I imagine that I will
make sure that he

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:26.540
knows that he is beautiful and
brilliant and capable of doing

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:30.180
anything that he wants
to do in the world

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:35.010
while also having there be
a certain level of reality,

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:37.400
not in terms of what
he is capable of,

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.030
but in terms of how other
people will perceive him,

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:44.010
and to also assure him that
that has nothing to do with him.

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:48.470
The way people think about you,
or dehumanize you, or think

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:52.630
you are capable of x
or not capable of y

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.870
is something that they
have to grapple with.

00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:59.630
And that is not because
of anything you have done,

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:01.940
and it's not because
of who you are.

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:08.380
And I think once a young
person recognizes that,

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:12.114
then it kind of opens
up the possibilities

00:53:12.114 --> 00:53:14.280
of how they imagine themselves
navigating the world.

00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:17.600
Because even for
me, I'm continuously

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.080
unlearning so many
things that I grew up

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.840
thinking about my own
community and myself

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:30.610
about what I was and wasn't
capable of in these ways

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:32.760
that we wouldn't even
necessarily recognize.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.260
But I'm spending my days
sitting in libraries

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.670
for like 12 hours a day
thinking about this stuff now.

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:43.370
And I'm sitting with some
of these thoughts and ideas

00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:48.210
and recognizing I inundated
and was socialized

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:51.620
under certain pathologies about
what black masculinity was

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.670
and how I should
be in the world.

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:57.950
And so every day, I'm
trying to step out of myself

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:01.140
and make sure that I
am not accepting that.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:05.280
And I want to have a
conversation with my sons

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.540
and my nephews and my cousins.

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:13.200
Hopefully, sharing
with them these things

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.420
that I am constantly trying
to unlearn for myself.

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:22.325
Because again, the
problem is not the child.

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:24.910
The problem is the
world that perceives

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:26.480
the child a certain way.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.460
Again, like my final poem, we
don't have to change the kids.

00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:32.212
We have to change the world.

00:54:32.212 --> 00:54:33.720
That sounded so cheesy.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.494
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:34.494 --> 00:54:35.660
FEMALE SPEAKER: It was good.

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:36.280
OK.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:41.700
AUDIENCE: So your art
is very inspiring.

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:43.831
Activism is another
tool that can really

00:54:43.831 --> 00:54:44.830
address a lot of things.

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:48.900
But another tool that I don't
think a lot of people discuss

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.980
is policy change from
governments and powers that be.

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:53.830
But a lot of their
decision making

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:57.330
happens with vetted data.

00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:02.030
And a lot of what is fed to
them is anecdotal in some sense.

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:05.150
Do you feel that companies,
large tech companies

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:09.280
like Google, have an
ethical and moral obligation

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.220
to take our resources
and the power

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:16.190
that we have at our disposal
and illuminate this ground data,

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:19.030
this ground truth, so that
policymakers can actually

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:20.750
make more informed
decisions about what's

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:23.360
happening to their people?

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.020
CLINT SMITH: I would argue yes.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:30.490
I think the nature of
capitalism and the free market

00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:33.510
might dictate otherwise.

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:36.110
The question always
becomes, is this

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:37.777
helpful for the bottom line?

00:55:37.777 --> 00:55:39.110
Are we going to make more money?

00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:40.200
Are we going to expand?

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.230
Are we going to scale?

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:48.150
And for me, it's a question
of, both individually

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:51.710
and on a more macro
level, what type of person

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:54.180
and what type of organization
do you want to be?

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:56.580
Just like on certain
terms of core principles.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.180
Because there's certain
ways that companies

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:02.502
can and should act if they just
want to make a lot of money.

00:56:02.502 --> 00:56:04.960
It's very clear that there are
certain things you should do

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.610
and certain things
you should not do.

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:09.070
But the question
is, here at Google

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:13.920
and around the world is, what
type of organization and what

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.680
type of things do we want to
represent as an organization

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.670
to the broader world that
might not necessarily

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:21.670
be quantifiable?

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:24.630
That might not necessarily
show up in the quarterly report

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:27.950
and aren't going to
be in an Excel sheet,

00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:35.990
but that are going to send
a message to our employees

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:39.686
and to the world at large that
we are committed to something

00:56:39.686 --> 00:56:40.810
much bigger than ourselves.

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:45.240
Because at the end of the day,
if you make a lot of money,

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.240
you make a lot of money.

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.040
But then, we're all mortal.

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.960
And we're all going to
move on to something else

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.440
after this life.

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:59.880
And for me, it's like, what
do I want to leave behind?

00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:03.520
And how can I leave
something behind that

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.100
represents something
that's bigger

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:10.190
than myself, both as a person
and for the institutions

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:14.090
that I represent?

00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:17.600
I don't know too much about
the infrastructure of Google

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.050
in that regard,
but I've certainly

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:23.930
heard some hopeful
anecdotes and some stories

00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:29.070
that sound like you
have a group of people

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:32.470
who are at least committed
to thinking about that.

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:33.170
I'm here.

00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:36.490
I'm sitting here, so
that must mean something.

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:38.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, thank
you so much for your time.

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:41.280
My phone has been blowing
up with questions and people

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.690
saying that they loved the talk.

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:43.900
And is it being recorded?

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:44.930
Is this being captured?

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:47.074
Like, we need to have
these conversations here.

00:57:47.074 --> 00:57:48.240
So thank you for coming out.

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.790
We have a little gift for you.

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:50.700
CLINT SMITH: Oh, wow.

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:53.240
The best gift is a Google gift.

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.851
Thank you so much.

00:57:54.851 --> 00:57:56.600
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
for those in the room,

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.020
Clint has some
books for purchase

00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.640
and he'll be signing
them outside.

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:00.931
So thank you so much everybody.

00:58:00.931 --> 00:58:02.260
[APPLAUSE]
