00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.235
- It's You Up, with Nikki
Glaser.

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:03.302
Two guests in the studio now,

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.138
two huge guests, oh my gosh.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.174
Pete Holmes, Judd Apatow,
welcome to the show.

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:10.243
- I'd like to talk about
Blink for a second.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.611
- I have Blink-182.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:12.779
- You do?
- Yeah.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:16.616
- I don't like the fact that
there's cameras everywhere

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.718
because there's things I wanna
do

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.421
that I don't want seen on video.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:24.157
So I assume like the street
where I live,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.591
everyone has cameras.

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:26.726
But what if I'm mad at a
neighbor

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:27.827
and wanna slash their tires,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.462
can I not do that now?

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:30.396
- I think you still can.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.098
- You can?
- That's what the burlap sack

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:33.299
is for.

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:36.402
- That's true, and you can
watch yourself do it later on.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:40.073
- Okay, I can still harass
people somehow.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.074
- Yes.
- Yeah, no you can still

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:42.708
be the vandal that we
know and love you as.

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.210
- Okay, good.

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:46.579
(rock music)

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.249
- Judd is a real rascal.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:51.350
- Is he?
- He'll throw bricks

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:52.518
at corporations.

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:54.120
(both laughing)

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:55.088
He's lit me on fire more than
once.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.856
- Are you like a prankster,
Judd, at all?

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.057
- He's a prankster.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.293
- I would never do it, but I
like the idea that I could.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.227
- I hate pranks.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.096
- I hate pranks--
- Can we swear on this?

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.498
- So much, yes.
- Fuck you, prank!

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.468
(goofy voice) Hey Pete,
uh there's a package

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.536
outside for you.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:10.770
(normal voice) I open the
door, there's nothing.

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:12.105
(goofy yelling)

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:13.473
- I hate 'em.
- You're a liar,

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:15.108
you're a dick and I believed
you.

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.376
You took advantage of my
open heart, shame on you.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.612
- You know when people
prank people and they go,

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.314
"Oh and I'm just kidding!"

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.449
I'll never forget when I
didn't know you were kidding.

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:24.650
(Pete laughing)
And that will stay with me

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:27.220
forever and color the way I look
at you

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.688
and interact with you the rest
of my life.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:29.389
- That's right.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.523
- I didn't trust you for the--

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:33.526
Even if you go, "You look
ugly today, just kidding!"

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:35.862
That second of being like.
(gasps)

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.564
- Adam Sandler used to do
this thing, back in the day,

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:41.400
when we lived together
when we were young kids.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:44.504
Which it bugged me so much,
which is,

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.139
he would call me

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:49.275
and he would try to, he
would show interest in me,

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:50.543
in my life,

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:54.780
and try to get me to
open up about something,

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:57.283
and then as soon as I got
emotional and opened up

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:58.317
he would hang up on me.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.385
(Nikki laughing)
- Oh...

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:00.920
- And he would do it all the
time.

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:04.323
And it was always like could
he just trick me into thinking

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:05.457
it wasn't happening.
- God.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.558
- So it would be like, "So
what happened with Wendy,

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:09.462
did you guys talk, like did
you find out why she was

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:10.696
so upset?"

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.698
And then I'd go, you know I
don't know we're just struggling

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.367
and then I'd just hear click.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.403
- Wow, that's what we lost
when we lost the click.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:20.907
Humel will do that to me, he'll
text me and he'll be like,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.442
"Oh my god I was just doing
a show and they just couldn't

00:02:23.475 --> 00:02:25.778
stop talking about how you
are their favorite comedian."

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:28.247
And he'll do that for like
thirty minutes.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.483
He'll be like, "I can't
remember, I can't remember."

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:31.617
And then I'll be like, "Who was
it?"

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.452
"Oh right, it was my mother."

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:34.554
(both laughing)
And he was just like,

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:35.455
"Fuck you!

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:39.692
Fuck you, you think it's
gonna be John Mayer?"

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:41.594
I want that sweet Mayer, not
your mother.

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:43.729
(both laughing)
Mayer not mother!

00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:46.332
- You want to hear that Mayer's
a big fan?

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.434
- I'm sure you've met
John Mayer doing comedy.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:49.435
- Well we all want Mayer's
approval.

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:53.539
- I mean Val is up for
it, and Johnny go ahead.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:55.708
Bring some picks, 'cause
she's gonna wanna hear

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:56.943
a song afterwards.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.345
- God everyone wants
that Mayer, what is it?

00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:00.346
- Dude, I understand.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.548
He's dreamy, he's got
the one dangerous arm,

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:03.650
the one regular arm.

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:05.350
You know what I mean.

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:07.553
He's got rings, like Johnny Depp
rings.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:08.888
One of the rings is like around
his neck.

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.457
I get it, I'm not even
roasting him, he's dreamy!

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.494
- I was at a charity event
and they were auctioning off

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:19.565
John Mayer will sing Your
Body's A Wonderland right now,

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:20.666
to you.

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:25.371
And so I bid and won it for
him to do it to my wife.

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:26.906
And so they put a chair on the
stage,

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.575
and this is on YouTube
if you wanna see it,

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:32.645
and he starts looking in my
wife's eyes.

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:33.779
- Oh no.
- Oh my god.

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:35.013
- And it was gettin' intense.

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:38.918
And then I just got on stage
and stood right behind my wife.

00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:41.621
- That's hilarious.
- To ruin the effect,

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:42.689
I think you could find that on
YouTube.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:43.923
- What I don't understand
are all the young girls

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:46.792
that love John and think he's
like their dream boyfriend.

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:49.028
And I'm like, you realize
he's having sex with tens

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.963
of thousands of you guys, right?

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:53.599
It's like, "He's gonna whisk me
away!"

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:55.334
No, no he's not.

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:56.736
- They don't wanna be
whisked, they just want to be

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.670
one of them.

00:03:57.703 --> 00:03:59.305
- I get it, I take it back.

00:03:59.338 --> 00:03:59.972
- Yeah maybe they do.

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:01.173
- I take it back.

00:04:01.206 --> 00:04:03.276
- But I think you're right,
there is something that like

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.911
you convince yourself no he
would just settle down with me.

00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:07.012
- That's what I mean.

00:04:07.045 --> 00:04:08.714
There's a fantasy, especially
with younger people

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:11.751
that are like, "No, no I
could tame the bad arm."

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.753
- It's like how I felt about
Cheryl Tiegs.

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:14.654
- Yes!

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:15.621
- Or Sheryl Crow!

00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:16.722
- Yeah.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:18.824
- Any of the Crow, Sheryl's.

00:04:18.857 --> 00:04:19.959
I said the wrong one!

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:23.396
Any of the Crows, Russell.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.563
But I made it up.
- Cameron.

00:04:24.596 --> 00:04:25.898
- Cameron.

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.967
Oh M G.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.536
No question mark on the You Up?

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:31.237
- No.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.071
- 'Cause it's that kind of text.

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:32.938
- It's just You Up.

00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:33.872
- You Up.

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:34.773
That's a good touch.
- We're tellin' you.

00:04:34.806 --> 00:04:36.942
- Oh, you're saying, it's
declarative.

00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:37.977
- You better be up.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.512
- But it's also You Up question,

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:41.380
I'm presuming it's a guy texting
you,

00:04:41.413 --> 00:04:43.316
he doesn't even throw in
punctuation.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:44.784
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Where we're going baby

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:45.918
we don't need punctuation.

00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:48.387
(all laughing)

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.891
- Yeah, that's just so
disrespectful to not even have

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:53.859
a question mark with the You Up.

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:55.661
He's just giving it that little
effort.

00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:57.596
- It gets less sexy
when you're like married

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.434
and you're sending it to
your husband or your wife

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.436
at 6:30 in the morning
and it's like, "You up?

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.638
Okay then, can you drive
the kids to school today?"

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.406
(Pete and Nikki laughing)

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.809
- I just had a baby so I'm
constantly checking if she's up.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:11.877
'Cause you check if they
breathe, it's like a real thing.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.045
People are paranoid.

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:15.715
You get up to pee and you're
like oh everything's fine,

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:16.982
I'm sure she's fine, she's in
her crib.

00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:18.984
And then you're like,
what if that's the time?

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:20.085
- Yes.
- You gotta check.

00:05:20.118 --> 00:05:22.421
You could be super dad,
it's a real fear obviously.

00:05:22.454 --> 00:05:24.523
- Do you ever get tempted
to text your baby?

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:26.659
- I text my baby. (laughs)

00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:28.694
- Do you ever like?

00:05:28.727 --> 00:05:29.929
I remember when I got a dog I
was like

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.597
I just wanna text my dog.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.932
- That's hilarious.
You have that instinct

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:33.933
that you can't do.

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:35.468
- I have a joke in my
new special about that.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.869
I said if my dog had a
cellphone,

00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:38.104
I would have 384 missed calls
right now.

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.272
(Nikki laughs)

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:43.142
And 7,000 texts of the bone
emoji and the walk emoji.

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:46.912
- You should get a
phone for your baby now.

00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:51.817
Text just all the time and
then one day she'll just be

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.588
able to turn on the phone,
and she'll be able to read,

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:56.455
and she'll have years--

00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:57.123
- Of our texts!

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:58.157
- Of your texts.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.725
- Like you don't remember
sending these to me?

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:00.826
- Well that's kind of a great
idea.

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:02.528
- Wait, I'm a genius.

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:03.763
- You kind of, I mean.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.433
I love going back through my
baby book and like reading

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:09.969
funny things that I said that
my parents just had the--

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:12.171
- Aw!
- Wherewithal to jot down

00:06:12.204 --> 00:06:13.339
in that moment.

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.975
- My parents called me Paul
for the first four years.

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:18.778
Which is weird 'cause
they made up the name!

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:20.112
Paul!

00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:22.581
- Are you keeping track
of the cute, funny things?

00:06:22.614 --> 00:06:24.083
- What are some that you said?

00:06:24.116 --> 00:06:27.052
No, I mean, our baby's
only three months old.

00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:28.721
- Oh okay, so not doing a lot.

00:06:28.754 --> 00:06:31.157
- Well she's yeah.
- I can't believe three months

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.525
Pete, congratulations.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:33.726
- Thank you.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:34.360
I was just gonna say, nobody
gives a shit about your baby

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:35.194
that's what I've learned.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.029
- That's true, that is very
true.

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:38.097
- I was talking to Rob Riggle
about it

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.499
and he was like, especially
in L.A., he's like.

00:06:40.532 --> 00:06:42.134
No, I understand that you care.

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:43.268
- I thought you're not
supposed to feel that,

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:45.171
I thought we were supposed
to keep that to ourselves

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:46.005
that we don't care.

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:47.807
I didn't know that you knew
that.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.674
- We know.

00:06:48.707 --> 00:06:49.842
- You know how we know,

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:53.813
it's how long people will
pretend to look at your baby

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:54.914
when you show them the picture.

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.649
- You need to find other new
parents,

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:57.950
those are the only people that
maybe

00:06:57.983 --> 00:07:00.019
and all we wanna do is
look at your baby and go,

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:00.953
"Not as cute as my fucking
baby."

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:02.121
- Not as cute as mine.
- Fuck your baby.

00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:03.456
- You get jealous too.

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:04.957
Like your baby's very cute.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.926
So there's a part of you that's
just like,

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.561
"How do you get a cute baby?"

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:11.497
- Were you so excited when she
was cute?

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.199
- It is, we kept saying.
- You know she was gonna be

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.767
cute anyway, come on.
- That's so fun.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.635
We kept going like,
"It's not just us, right?

00:07:16.668 --> 00:07:17.870
This is like a fucking cute
baby."

00:07:17.903 --> 00:07:19.071
Like you have to go it's not us.

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:20.139
- Yeah, yeah.

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:21.807
And people are telling you
your baby should model,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.542
like that's I feel like the
general thing.

00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:24.710
When I see a--
- Your baby should model.

00:07:24.743 --> 00:07:27.847
- Like not model, but like
it should be on diaper bags

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.782
and stuff.
- She does, she could move

00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:30.883
some mashed up carrots.

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:31.717
I think so.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.752
There's also that great Seinfeld
bit,

00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:36.555
"No one wants to go to your
wedding!"

00:07:36.588 --> 00:07:37.990
Isn't that great?

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:41.260
I don't know the whole
bit, just the premise.

00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:44.263
That's what I'm looking
for in stand-up comedy.

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:46.632
No one wants to go to your
wedding.

00:07:46.665 --> 00:07:48.968
Like a secret that you
think, like we all thought

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:51.003
that people getting married
didn't know that we all

00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:52.938
fucking don't want to go to your
wedding.

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:54.807
(Judd laughing)
He outed us.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.509
That's the greatest feeling you
can get

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:57.510
at a stand-up comedy show.

00:07:57.543 --> 00:07:59.879
- Well your baby looks
so much like you that--

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.714
- It feels impolite.

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:02.548
It really did!

00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:05.818
She came out and I was like, "Oh
no!"

00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:06.819
(laughing)

00:08:06.852 --> 00:08:09.922
You're supposed to go
50, 50 with your wife!

00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:12.658
You're supposed to puff,
puff, pass but like a little

00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:15.094
slimy me came out and I was just
like

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.896
well, it's mine.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:18.831
Like it was fucking weird.

00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:21.267
As she's gotten older she
looks a little bit more like

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.836
the mom, but I look like my
wife.

00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:24.904
We're like twin-cest.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:25.905
Have you ever heard of
twin-cest?

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:30.042
Apparently I know what
I'm into and it's me.

00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:32.111
(laughing)

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:33.612
- It makes sense, Pete.

00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:34.780
You're a narcissist.

00:08:34.813 --> 00:08:35.714
We all are.
- Dude, I know

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.983
I was like let's just throw the
dog a bone

00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:39.885
- I love that.
- I think that's more

00:08:39.918 --> 00:08:44.891
comfortable than me where you
know I just look like a beast

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.226
and just nothing.

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:51.997
Then the kids really hate if
anyone says they look like me.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.867
There's no bigger insult
to them than to be like,

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.135
"You look a lot like your dad!"

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:57.169
It's like, "What?"

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.605
That hurts.
- I get that a lot too

00:08:59.638 --> 00:09:00.472
with my dad,

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:01.140
the older I get.
- But Maude is beautiful

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:02.908
and she does look like you.

00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:04.276
Like you can see.
- Well I think that is

00:09:04.309 --> 00:09:05.744
why she looks beautiful.

00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:06.812
(Pete laughing)

00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:08.147
- Judd, I have never been
able to tell you this,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.215
but you're very beautiful.

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:13.886
- They don't wanna take
on the Jewish, goofy side

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.854
of their genetic heritage.

00:09:15.887 --> 00:09:16.989
- (goofy voice) Tell them that
Jewish goof

00:09:17.022 --> 00:09:18.724
bought this house!

00:09:18.757 --> 00:09:20.259
My dysfunction, I don't
know why it's Kennedy,

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:22.761
my dysfunction and my goofy
appearance

00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:24.663
is why I wrote those films.

00:09:24.696 --> 00:09:26.031
- (goofy voice) It's because I'm
Jewish!

00:09:26.064 --> 00:09:27.165
(Pete laughing)

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:29.368
- This Judaism is what brought
the cable guy from a rom

00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:30.869
into a dark comedy.

00:09:30.902 --> 00:09:33.105
(all laughing)

00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:34.173
I don't know why Kennedy.

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:36.609
- People do look like the
people they end up with.

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:38.077
A lot of times.
- Or they start

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.978
looking like them, right?

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:40.079
- Or yes, yes.
- Right?

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.647
I mean but it can go both ways.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.748
- Yeah.

00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:45.117
In all seriousness, there's
a lot I love about Val

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.385
and it does not have to do with
the fact

00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:47.619
that she looks like me.
- No of course not.

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:51.190
- Every Instagram people are
like, "You fucking yourself?"

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:53.692
- Really?
- "Ay, you found you a tits?

00:09:53.725 --> 00:09:54.626
Ay!"

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.130
- Did you post one of those
2018, 2008,

00:09:58.163 --> 00:09:59.231
ten year part things?
- No!

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:00.465
- I didn't either.

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:03.669
- I couldn't find a picture
of me passed out at an Arby's.

00:10:03.702 --> 00:10:05.671
- The worst part about that
is in the last ten years

00:10:05.704 --> 00:10:07.172
I've completely crumbled.

00:10:07.205 --> 00:10:08.373
It's all fallen apart.

00:10:08.406 --> 00:10:10.876
So my wife, we have like a
wall of photos over the years

00:10:10.909 --> 00:10:11.877
in the hallway.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.879
And my wife just looks
the same for decades,

00:10:13.912 --> 00:10:15.414
she's like a female
Paul Rudd or something.

00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:17.850
- She is.
- And I'm just losing hair

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:19.952
and going gray and falling
apart.

00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:23.689
- It's the stress of being
with a statuesque woman.

00:10:23.722 --> 00:10:25.791
- Yes, yes, she's...
- It's your beauty!

00:10:25.824 --> 00:10:29.294
- She's a healthy person, and
I'm not.

00:10:29.327 --> 00:10:31.830
And now she's just looking
at me like, "Are you ever

00:10:31.863 --> 00:10:32.964
gonna get it together?"

00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:35.834
- She does have some like,
there's something going on

00:10:35.867 --> 00:10:36.802
with your wife.

00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:37.736
- I've seen your fridge.
- That is reversed.

00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:39.838
- There's a lot of antioxidants
in there.

00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:40.706
- She said,
- There's a lot of

00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:41.940
sweet fruits.

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:45.110
- She said, "When we go out,
it looks like an old weird man

00:10:45.143 --> 00:10:47.046
paid for a very expensive
Russian hooker."

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:50.115
(Pete and Nikki laughing)

00:10:50.148 --> 00:10:52.184
- I wanna be in that
relationship.

00:10:52.217 --> 00:10:55.220
- Yeah you can either have
twin-cest or hooker and.

00:10:55.253 --> 00:10:56.087
- I'm gonna have it all.

00:10:56.121 --> 00:10:58.457
- Prostitute, forgive me, and
pimp.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.759
- We always, whenever we go to
restaurants

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:01.927
or out.
- Pimps will never be like,

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.095
"Don't call us pimps."

00:11:03.128 --> 00:11:04.263
By the way, they'll always
be like, "No, we're pimps."

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:08.167
They're not like, "We are
sellers of fine, nighttime,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.768
evening style sex."

00:11:09.801 --> 00:11:10.703
(all laughing)

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:12.104
They're like, "No, we're pimps!"

00:11:12.137 --> 00:11:13.305
- Whenever we go out to clubs,

00:11:13.338 --> 00:11:14.306
not we don't go to clubs,

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:15.908
but like restaurants,

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.243
we always look around and
for some reason my wife

00:11:18.276 --> 00:11:21.246
always thinks that the women are
hookers.

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:23.315
She's like, "I think that's
a hooker with that guy."

00:11:23.348 --> 00:11:25.350
Like she doesn't believe in the
couple.

00:11:25.383 --> 00:11:26.485
- Oh yeah.
- She thinks there must be

00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:28.120
a financial arrangement.

00:11:28.153 --> 00:11:29.288
- Yes.
- And she's always sniffing

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:30.356
that out.

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.458
I'm like is that really
happening in these places?

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:33.659
- I think so.

00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:34.493
- Have you ever done crowd
work and realized in the middle

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:35.428
that the guy's with a
prostitute?

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:37.496
- No, really?
- I have, I've been like,

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:39.231
"Hello sir, that's your date?

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:41.033
She's looking sparkly.

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:42.000
What's your name?

00:11:42.033 --> 00:11:43.135
Mercedes?

00:11:43.168 --> 00:11:44.770
Wait a minute."

00:11:44.803 --> 00:11:47.206
Like I'm moving on!

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:49.775
(rock music)
