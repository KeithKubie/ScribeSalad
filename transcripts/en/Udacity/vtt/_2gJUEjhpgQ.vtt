00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this problem for Unit 5, I want you to implement the control algorithm that you saw

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in sections 2 and 15 of Unit 5 for the hydraulic braking system.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We've set up a number of important values for you, as always,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
including two things called low slip and high slip.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
These are both possible values for the real slip.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If the real slip gets smaller than low slip, we want you to decrease the pressure of the brakes.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Similarly, if the real slip gets higher than high slip, we wan you to increase the pressure.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Increasing and decreasing the pressure like this leads to rate of change called hydraulic speed

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
in the strength p of the brake.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Hydraulic speed is shown right here while p the braking strength which you can see right here

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is measured as the deceleration of the velocity at the rim of the wheel

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
if there is no friction from the road.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Possibly logical, the strength of the brake cannot be a negative number

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and we've set the maximum value that it can take on with this constant called max brake right here.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You're going to need most of the contents of the for loop inside this function,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but there are a couple of line left that we want you to write.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We want you to model how the brake pressure changes between these maximum and minimum

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
values that we outlined above, and using these, how the brake acceleration changes step by step.

00:01:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This might require a little bit of creativity, so if you need some hints, come to the forums.
