00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:04.971
Voiceover:Which numbers
are greater than six?

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:08.892
Select all that apply.

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:11.962
We see six here on the number line,

00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:13.853
so the numbers that are greater than six

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:16.374
are going to be the ones
that are to the right of six

00:00:16.374 --> 00:00:17.219
on the number line.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:19.399
We see that we're increasing beyond six

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:20.750
as we go to the right.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.008
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:24.297
Seven is greater than six,

00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:25.286
eight is greater than six,

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:26.472
nine is greater than six,

00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:27.868
and 10 is greater than six,

00:00:27.868 --> 00:00:28.795
and we could keep going.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:29.677
11 is greater than six,

00:00:29.677 --> 00:00:31.271
and 12, and on and on and on.

00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:33.331
Which of these are greater than six?

00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:35.589
Well we see 10 is to the right,

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.706
is on the right hand side of six,

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:40.898
eight is also to the right of six

00:00:40.898 --> 00:00:43.130
but four is to the left of six.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.586
Four is less than six.

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:48.413
These are the two numbers
that are greater than,

00:00:48.413 --> 00:00:51.714
the two choices that are greater than six.

00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:53.829
Which numbers are less than six?

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.809
Well that's all of these
numbers right over here.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.435
The numbers to the left of six.

00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:02.207
Nine is definitely not less than six

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:03.691
but four is.

00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:05.923
Notice four is to the left of six

00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:08.451
and three is even more to the left of six,

00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:12.303
so four and three are
definitely less than six.

00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:15.110
When every day life
when you're thinking of

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.149
well if you have four things,
or you have three things

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.550
you have less than someone
who has six things.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.349
In every day life if you have 10 bananas,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.778
you have a greater number of bananas

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:28.181
than someone who has six bananas.
