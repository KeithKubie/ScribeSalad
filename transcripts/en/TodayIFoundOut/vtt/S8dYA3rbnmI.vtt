00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:02.870
The Real Moby Dick

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.939
While you’ve probably at least heard of
the fictional great white whale, Moby Dick,

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.670
you may not know that it was actually partially
inspired by a real life white whale that destroyed

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.250
over 20 whaling ships and reportedly survived
encounters with another 80 or so.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.480
The massive 70 foot long albino sperm whale
was named Mocha Dick and was one of the two

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.100
whales that inspired the novel Moby Dick.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.220
Mocha Dick was given his name as he was first
sighted off the coast of Chile near Mocha

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.050
Island; the latter “Dick” part of the
name is thought to have simply been after

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.980
the practice of naming certain deadly whales
common names like “Dick” or “Tom”.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.290
The whalers that first spotted him attempted
to kill him, but he survived the encounter.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.760
Over the course of the next 28 years, Mocha
Dick earned a reputation as one of the most

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.040
cunning and feared whales in the ocean.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.719
During that span, he was spotted and attacked
by at least 100 whaling ships.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.140
He successfully destroyed around 20 of those
ships that attacked him, escaping all but

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.629
the last.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.830
According to famed explorer and writer Jeremiah
N. Reynolds, Mocha Dick finally met his downfall

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.650
after observing a mother whale whose calf
had just been killed by whalers.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.479
The mother whale first attempted to herd her
calf away from the whalers after it had been

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.900
harpooned, but soon the calf went belly up.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.510
When the whale realized her calf was dead,
she turned on the whalers and attempted, unsuccessfully,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.430
to destroy their ship.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.030
Instead, she herself was harpooned and mortally
wounded before she was able to strike the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.030
ship.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.110
Upon observing all this, Mocha Dick decided
to get in on the fray and also attacked the

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.130
whaling ship directly after the missed hit
by the mother.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.110
Mocha Dick successfully destroyed one of the
smaller whaling boats, but was injured in

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.369
the process by a harpoon.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.210
Here is the account of what happened after,
according to Reynolds who collected the story

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.190
from the first mate of the whaling ship that
finally took down Mocha Dick:

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.189
“Making a leap toward the boat, he darted
perpendicularly downward, hurling the after

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.750
oarsman, who was helmsman at the time, ten
feet over the quarter, as he struck the long

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.780
steering-oar in his descent.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.400
The unfortunate seaman fell, with his head
forward, just upon the flukes of the whale,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.950
as he vanished, and was drawn down by suction
of the closing waters, as if he had been a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.950
feather.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.599
After being carried to a great depth, as we
inferred from the time he remained below the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.599
surface, he came up, panting and exhausted,
and was dragged on board, amidst the hearty

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.169
congratulations of his comrades.

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:27.450
Overpowered by his wounds, and exhausted by
his exertions and the enormous pressure of

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.971
the water above him, the immense creature
was compelled to turn once more upward, for

00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:37.430
a fresh supply of air, And upward he came,
indeed; shooting twenty feet of his gigantic

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.609
length above the waves, by the impulse of
his ascent.

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.859
He was not disposed to be idle.

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.790
Hardly had we succeeded in bailing out our
swamping boat, when he again darted away,

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.299
as it seemed to me with renewed energy.

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.819
For a quarter of a mile, we parted the opposing
waters as though they had offered no more

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.670
resistance than air.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.159
Our game then abruptly brought to, and lay
as if paralyzed, his massy frame quivering

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.339
and twitching, as if under the influence of
galvanism.

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:11.290
I gave the word to haul on; and seizing a
boat-spade, as we came near him, drove it

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.879
twice into his small; no doubt partially disabling
him by the vigor and certainty of the blows.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.499
Wheeling furiously around, he answered this
salutation, by making a desperate dash at

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:22.809
the boat’s quarter.

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:28.049
We were so near him, that to escape the shock
of his onset, by any practicable manoeuvre,

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.090
was out of the question.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.389
But at the critical moment, when we expected
to be crushed by the collision, his powers

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.730
seemed to give way.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.389
The fatal lance had reached the seat of life.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.230
His strength failed him in mid career, and
sinking quietly beneath our keel, grazing

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.389
it as he wallowed along, he rose again a few
rods from us, on the side opposite that where

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.750
he went down.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.879
‘Lay around, my boys, and let us set on
him!’

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.629
I cried, for I saw his spirit was broken at
last.

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.989
But the lance and spade were needless now.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.169
The work was done.

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:05.379
The dying animal was struggling in a whirlpool
of bloody foam, and the ocean far around was

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.900
tinted with crimson.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.010
‘Stern all!’

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.079
I shouted, as he commenced running impetuously
in a circle, beating the water alternately

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.039
with his head and flukes, and smiting his
teeth ferociously into their sockets, with

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.430
a crashing sound, in the strong spasms of
dissolution.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.650
‘Stern all I or we shall be stove!’

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.490
As I gave the command, a stream of black,
clotted gore rose in a thick spout above the

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.620
expiring brute, and fell in a shower around,
bedewing, or rather drenching us, with a spray

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.620
of blood.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.080
‘There’s the flag!’

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.220
I exclaimed; ‘there! thick as tar!

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.250
Stern! every soul of ye!

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.630
He’s going in his flurry!’

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.060
And the monster, under the convulsive influence
of his final paroxysm, flung his huge tail

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.979
into the air, and then, for the space of a
minute, thrashed the waters on either side

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.280
of him with quick and powerful blows; the
sound of the concussions resembling that of

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.840
the rapid discharge of artillery.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.580
He then turned slowly and heavily on his side,
and lay a dead mass upon the sea through which

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.370
he had so long ranged a conqueror.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.360
‘He’s fin-up at last!’

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.189
I screamed, at the very top of my voice.

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:19.759
‘Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!’

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.729
And snatching off my cap, I sent it spinning
aloft, jumping at the same time from thwart

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.080
to thwart, like a madman.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.720
We now drew alongside our floating spoil;
and I seriously question if the brave commodore

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.070
who first, and so nobly, broke the charm of
British invincibility, by the capture of the

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:43.060
Guerriere, felt a warmer rush of delight,
as he beheld our national flag waving over

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.310
the British ensign, in assurance of his victory,
than I did, as I leaped upon the quarter deck

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.159
of Dick’s back, planted my waif-pole in
the midst, and saw the little canvass flag,

00:05:54.159 --> 00:06:00.199
that tells so important and satisfactory a
tale to the whaleman, fluttering above my

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.189
hard-earned prize.”

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.509
The other whale that helped inspire Moby Dick
was a huge sperm whale that destroyed the

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.080
Essex in 1820 around 2,000 miles west of South
America.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.500
Herman Melville learned of the story of the
Essex when the whaling ship he was on, only

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.110
100 miles from where the Essex was destroyed,
encountered another whaling ship, which had

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.460
the son of the Essex’s first mate, Owen
Chase, aboard.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.080
After the Essex was destroyed, the 21 man
crew took refuge on three small whaling boats

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.669
that had almost no supplies to sustain them.

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.099
Their choice at this point was to head for
known habitable islands that they feared were

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:41.889
populated with cannibals, 1,200 miles away,
or head for South America 2,000 miles away,

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.669
but about 4,000 miles by the quickest sailing
route due to the winds that time of year.

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.909
Despite this distance, they chose South America.

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:53.719
Ironically, as you’ll read shortly, their
choice of not choosing the much shorter route

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:58.449
for fear of cannibals, resulted in some of
them resorting to cannibalism.

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.159
During their journey, they did at one point
encounter an island that they more or less

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:04.629
stripped of its resources to help sustain
themselves.

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:09.270
They also left three men behind there, at
the time thinking likely to their doom, to

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.789
help conserve supplies and increase the chances
the others would make it back.

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:16.229
What followed was an incredibly gruesome tail.

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:19.370
As they traveled, they steadily lost crew
due to lack of nourishment.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.409
At a certain point, they were forced to give
up burying their men at sea and, instead,

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:26.779
began eating them and drinking their blood.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:31.349
They eventually even had to resort to not
waiting for someone to die, but, rather, drew

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:35.439
lots for who was to die and nourish the others
with their body.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:40.639
In the end, 95 days after their ship was destroyed,
they were rescued with only five left alive

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:45.129
aboard the two remaining small ships (one
was lost along the way with the crew never

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:46.150
heard from again).

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.689
Miraculously, the three left on the depleted
island, though near death when eventually

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:52.949
found, survived the event.

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:55.469
Bonus Facts:
• While today Moby Dick is considered a

00:07:55.469 --> 00:08:02.159
great work of literature, in its day, it wasn’t
very successful and only earned Melville $556.37

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:08.289
and less than 3000 copies were sold over the
40 years or so between publication and Melville’s

00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:09.289
death.

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:13.629
• A common whaling nickname in the early
19th century for whales that spout blood after

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:19.129
being harpooned (meaning they were likely
soon to die) was “Dennis”.

00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:23.629
• Jeremiah N. Reynolds not only helped inspire
Moby Dick through one of his narratives, but

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:28.969
also helped inspire Edgar Allan Poe’s The
Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket.

00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:45.050
This was through Reynolds’ lectures on his
notion that the Earth was hollow.
