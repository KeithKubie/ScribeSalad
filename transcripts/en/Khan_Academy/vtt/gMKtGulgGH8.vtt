00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.520
Let's think about what might
happen if we had a molecule of

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.010
butanoyl chloride.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.170
So one, two, three,
four carbons.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.190
That's where the but-
comes in, and then

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.180
it's a butanoyl chloride.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.015
So it's an acyl halide or
it's an acyl chloride.

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.710
Let me write this down
just to give us some

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.780
practice with namings.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.260
This is butanoyl chloride.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.810
We saw a couple of videos ago
that acyl halides, you just

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.130
count the main number
of carbons.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.020
One, two, three, four carbons.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.410
That's where butan-
comes from.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.880
And then this is an acyl
chloride, so the acyl chloride

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.770
part, this part, gives
us the -oyl.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.590
Or I guess you could look
at even the carbonyl.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.190
We could even say this whole
part over here, we know it's a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.790
carboxylic acid derivative.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.690
It's in an acyl chloride.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.340
So that's why we have the -oyl
here and the chloride.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.420
So let's think about what would
happen if we have a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.020
molecule of butanoyl chloride or
if we had a solution, even

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.340
better, of butanoyl chloride,
and for every molecule of

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.870
butanoyl chloride, we had two
molecules of dimethylamide, or

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.600
sorry, dimethylamine.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.440
Let me draw that.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.390
So dimethyl, so two
methyl groups.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.875
One, two, and then we have one
hydrogen, and then we're going

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:23.490
to have two molecules of this
for every one molecule of our

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.585
butanoyl chloride.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:27.110
So let me copy and paste this.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.840
So edit, copy.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.990
And edit, paste.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.810
So let's think about what would
happen in a solution

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.190
with these reactants in
this ratio right here.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.830
And just as a bit of review,
this right here is dimethyl.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.980
We kind of have a tie for our
longest chain attached to the

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.230
nitrogen: dimethylamine.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.950
You could pick one of these as
the longest chain and then it

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.600
would actually be
N-methylmethylamine.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.840
Either one, this is the
one that you're

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.880
more likely to see.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.710
But this video isn't about
naming, this video is to think

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.080
about what's likely to happen.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.870
So what are we dealing with?

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.280
We have amine here and then
we have an acyl chloride.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.790
And if we look at our hierarchy
of stability that we

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.800
looked at in the last video,
we saw that when an amine

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.470
reacts or a carboxylic
derivative from an amine,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.060
which is an amide, is
much more stable

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.340
than an acyl chloride.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.860
This is the least stable.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.310
So if we're starting with an
acyl chloride and we have the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.090
ingredients for an amide, this
reaction will probably end up

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.940
with amide.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.470
So let's see how we
can get there.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.430
What we know from previous
videos when we studied amines,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.610
that they are pretty good
nucleophiles, so they could

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.840
have a nucleophile attack
on this carbonyl

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.260
carbon right over here.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.650
So you can imagine this amine
right here, this nitrogen,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.480
gives an electron to this
carbonyl carbon.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.980
This carbonyl carbon can then
let go of this electron to

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.960
this top oxygen over here.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.920
It was already hogging
it to begin with.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.110
And so the next step of our
reaction would look like this.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.260
What was the butanoyl chloride
will now look like one, two,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.660
three, four carbons.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.570
Now you only have
a single bond.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.240
This oxygen up here now
has a negative charge.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.920
Since it took an electron from
this central carbon right over

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.900
here, you are still bonded
to this chlorine.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.570
And actually let me do that in
a different color so we can

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.010
keep track of it.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.790
You are still bonded to this
chlorine atom and then the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.440
nitrogen has been bonded.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.850
So this bond I'll drawn green
because we're giving this

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.270
green electron to form the bond,
and then the rest of the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.260
dimethylamine is still
over there.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.250
Let me do it in that
same color.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.460
The rest of the dimethylamine,
so you have CH3, CH3 and then

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.950
you just have your hydrogen.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.420
And then this nitrogen gave away
an electron, so it has a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.390
positive charge.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.410
Now, the next step, and this
is chlorine, it's fairly

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.350
electronegative.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.540
It's a not-so-bad
leaving group.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.430
It will want to hog this
electron that is on the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.480
central carbon.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.080
So you can imagine in the next
step that this oxygen gives

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.120
back an electron to reform the
carbonyl group at the exact

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.010
same time that this chlorine
takes an electron and forms a

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.370
chloride anion.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.050
So the next step in this will
look like-- so the molecules

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.670
will now look like--
you have there one,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.960
two, three, four carbons.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.990
That's one of the bonds to that
oxygen, but now you've

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.005
now formed another bond.

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:39.660
That electron was given back to
that central atom and now

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.180
you have the bond to the
nitrogen, this bond right

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.940
here, and then the nitrogen is
bound to one methyl group, two

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.930
methyl groups, and a hydrogen.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.330
And it had given away an
electron so it has a positive

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.870
charge, and the chloride anion
has been bumped off.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.800
The chloride anion, it took an
electron from that central

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.260
carbon, so now it has
a negative charge.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.480
Now, we still have that other
dimethylamine molecule, or for

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.310
every one of these, we should
have two of these.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.140
We've only use one of them, so
let me bring the other one

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.150
into the mix, and this one could
just be in the mix to

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.850
make this other molecule neutral
now, and this could go

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.660
in either direction.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.600
This part right here could
go in either direction.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:34.400
This guy's not so weak or it's
not a bad base, so this guy

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.750
could give an electron to this
hydrogen proton, and then the

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.260
hydrogen proton's electron, or
that hydrogen atom's electron,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.680
can be taken back by this
nitrogen to make it neutral.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.760
And I'll make this go
in both directions.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.870
So this could go in
both directions.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.750
So then this molecule over here
will look like one, two,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.040
three, four carbonyl group.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.120
And let me color code it the
same way just so we know what

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.030
parts are which parts.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.590
We have this green bond to this
nitrogen, which has now

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.640
lost a proton.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.730
It was able to take
back an electron,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.410
so it is now neutral.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.170
It is bonded to one,
two methyl groups.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.500
This dimethylamine
took a hydrogen.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.290
So let me draw it over here.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:31.010
So it's nitrogen one, two, and
then it already had one

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.700
hydrogen and now it's gaining
another hydrogen.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.090
It's gaining this hydrogen
right over here.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.240
So now it's bound to
that hydrogen.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.000
It gave an electron to get that
hydrogen nucleus so it

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.120
now has a positive charge.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.190
And, of course, we can't forget
about that chloride

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.440
anion that's floating around.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.860
And these might be attracted
to each other.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.290
One's positive, one's negative,
form a salt.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.930
So what are we left with?

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.320
And then once again, this
is a little bit

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.220
of practice of naming.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.980
We started with an acyl chloride
and we ended with an

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.490
amide because we now have this
nitrogen group attached.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.720
So what is this?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:16.880
This has one, two, three, four
carbons so it's butan-, but

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.200
it's an amide.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.390
So this part tells us that we're
dealing with an amide.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.210
It's butanamide, but to specify
what type of amide, we

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.990
see that we have two methyl
groups attached to the

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.420
nitrogen there, so we would call
this-- let me put another

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.910
color here.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.790
We have one, two methyl groups
attached to the nitrogen, so

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.500
we would call this N comma
N-dimethylbutanamide.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.760
This N comma N let's us know
that the methyl groups are

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.880
attached here as opposed to on
the butyl group, I guess we

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.550
could view it this way.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.280
So we end up with
N,N-dimethylbutanamide, which

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.520
is an amide, one of the most
stable carboxylic acid

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.340
derivatives.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.160
And then this right here,
this salt, what is this?

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:17.520
This right here is dimethyl,
and this is now no longer

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.000
dimethylamine.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.670
We now are a positively charged
cation, so this is

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.920
dimethylammonium.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.100
We get that from the fact
that we have four bonds.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.419
We have a positive charge.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.330
This dimethylammonium, and then
we have this negative

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.669
anion, dimethylammonium
chloride.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:39.970
I'll just go to the next line.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.620
Dimethylammonium chloride.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.140
But I really just wanted to show
you a mechanism here of

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.680
how you could go from a less
stable or one of the least

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.150
stable carboxylic acid
derivatives to one of the most

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.210
stable, going from an acyl
chloride, which butanoyl

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.310
chloride was, to an amide.
