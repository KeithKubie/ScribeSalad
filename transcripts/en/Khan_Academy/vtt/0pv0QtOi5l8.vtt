00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.430
Welcome back.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.870
In the last video we were just
figuring out the volume under

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.990
the surface, and we had set
up these integral bounds.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.280
So let's see how to
evaluate it now.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.400
And look at this.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.510
I actually realized that I can
scroll things, which is quite

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.790
useful because now I have
a lot more board space.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.290
So how do we evaluate
this integral?

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.030
Well, the first integral I'm
integrating with respect to x.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.280
Right?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.770
I'm adding up the
little x sums.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.670
So I'm forming this
rectangle right here.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.960
Right?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.550
Or you could kind of view it
I'm holding y constant and

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.730
integrating along the x-axis.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.630
I should switch colors.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.660
So what's the antiderivative of
x y squared with respect to x?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.000
Well it's just x
squared over 2.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.080
And then I have the y
squared-- that's just a

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.900
constant-- all over 2.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.890
And I'm going to evaluate that
from x is equal to 1 to x is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.660
equal to the square root of y,
which you might be daunted by.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.930
But you'll see that it's
actually not that bad

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.630
once you evaluate them.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.540
And then let me draw the
outside of the integral.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.620
This is y is equal to
0 to y is equal 1.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.830
dy.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.640
Now, if x is equal to 1
this expression becomes

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.400
y squared over 2.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.470
Right?

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.030
y squared over 2, minus-- now
if x is equal to square root

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.320
of y, what does this
expression become?

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.120
If x is equal to the
square root of y, then

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.250
x squared is just y.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.870
And then y times y squared
is y to the third.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.180
Right?

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.210
So it's y to the third over 3.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.830
Fair enough.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.870
And now I take the integral
with respect to y.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.520
So now I sum up all of these
rectangles in the y direction.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.420
0, 1.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.620
This is with respect to y.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.910
And that's cool, right?

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.820
Because when you take the first
integral with respect to x you

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.030
end up with a function of y
anyway, so you might as well

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.120
have your bounds as
functions of y's.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.510
It really doesn't make
it any more difficult.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.850
But anyway, back
to the problem.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.440
What is the antiderivative
of y squared over 2 minus

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.380
y to the third over 3?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.430
Well the antiderivative of y
squared-- and you have to

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.130
divide by 3, so it's
y cubed over 6.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.670
Minus y to the fourth--
you have to divide by 4.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.480
Minus y to the fourth over--
did I mess up some place?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.385
No, I think this is correct.
y to the fourth over 12.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.530
Oh wait.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.480
How did I get a 3 here?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.330
That's where I messed up.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.360
This is a 2, right?

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.520
Let's see.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.800
x is square root of y.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.270
Yeah, this is a 2.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.150
I don't know how I ended up.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.510
Right?

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.270
Square root of y squared
is y, times y squared

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.575
y to the third over 2.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.030
Right.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.900
And then when I take
the integral of this

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.590
it's 4 times 2.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.240
8.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.670
Got to make sure I don't make
those careless mistakes.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.440
That's the tough part.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.500
I just want to make sure
that you got that too.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.620
I hate it when I do that.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.350
But I don't want to
re-record the whole video.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.340
So when I evaluated
this-- right.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.490
This is right, and then I take
the antiderivative of y to the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.430
third over 2, I get y
to the fourth over 8.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.550
And now I evaluate
this at 1 and 0.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.540
And that give us what?

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.290
1/6 minus 1/8 minus-- well both
of these when you evaluate

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.410
them, are going to be 0's.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.700
So this is going to be
another 0 minus 0.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.530
So you don't have to
worry about that.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.000
So what's 1/6 minus 1/8?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.930
Let's see.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.310
24.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.070
That's 4 minus 3 over 24, which
is equal to 1/24-- is the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.600
volume of our figure.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.280
So this time, the way we just
did it, we took the integral

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.486
with respect to x first, and
then we did it with

00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:02.950
respect to y.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.930
Let's do it the
other way around.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.520
So let me erase some things.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.390
And hopefully I won't make
these careless mistakes again.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.670
I'll keep this figure, but
I'll even erase this one.

00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:21.704
Let me erase all of this stuff.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.430
We have room to work with.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.150
So I kept that figure.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.510
But let me redraw just the
xy plane, just so we get

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.300
the visualization right.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.400
It's more important to
visualize the xy plane in

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.070
these problems than it
is to visualize the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.090
whole thing in 3-d.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.350
That's the y-axis,
that's the x-axis.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.230
OK.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.720
Our upper bound, you can
say, is the graph y is

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.460
equal to x squared.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.848
Or, you could view it as
the bound x is equal to

00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:02.000
the square root of y.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.510
That is x is equal to 1,
that's y is equal to 1.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.930
And we care about the volume
above the shaded region.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:10.190
Right?

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.750
That shaded region is this
yellow region right here.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.800
And let's draw our da.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.520
I'll draw a little
square actually.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.025
And I'll do it in magenta.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.190
So that's our little da.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.160
And the height is dy.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.370
That's a y.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.260
dy.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.240
And it's with this dx.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.870
Right?

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.290
So the volume above this little
square-- that's the same

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.680
thing as this little square.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.620
Just like we said before, the
volume above it is equal to

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.850
the value of the function.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:44.090
Right?

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.210
The height is the value of the
function, which is x y squared.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.390
And then we multiply it
times the area of the base.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.700
Well the area of the base, you
could say it's da, but we know

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.490
it's really dy times dx.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.680
I didn't have to write
that times there.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.450
You can ignore it.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.800
And I wrote the y first
just because we're

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.490
going to integrate with
respect to y first.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.310
We're going to sum
in the y direction.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.300
So what does summing in
the y direction mean?

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.920
It means we're going to
add that square to that

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.828
square to that square--

00:06:14.828 --> 00:06:16.070
[COUGHING]

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.800
Excuse me.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.290
So we're adding all the
dy's together, right?

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.230
So my question to you is, what
is the upper bound on the y?

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.600
Well once again, we
bump into the curve.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.970
Right?

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.000
So the curve is the upper
bound when we go upwards.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.130
And what is the upper
bound on the curve?

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.680
Well we're holding x
fixed, so for any given

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.300
x what is this point?

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.730
Well that's going
to be x squared.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.000
Right?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.940
Because this is the graph
of y equals x squared.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.700
So our upper bound is y
is equal to x squared.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.800
And what's our lower bound?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.310
We can keep adding these
squares down here.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.550
We're adding all the
little changes in y.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.610
So what's our lower bound?

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.730
Well our lower bound is just 0.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:57.575
That was pretty
straightforward.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:06.600
So this expression, as it is
written right now, is the

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.110
volume above this rectangle.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.940
Right?

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.790
Let me draw it.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.860
Is the volume above
this rectangle.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.890
These are the same rectangles.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.730
The volume above
that rectangle.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.790
Now what we want to do is add
up all the dx's together, and

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.670
we'll get the volume above
the entire surface.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.880
So that rectangle, now
we'll add it to another

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.240
dx one, dx one like that.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.920
So what's the upper and
lower bounds on the x's?

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.070
We're going from x is
equal to 0, right?

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.650
We don't bump into the graph
when we go all the way down.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.950
So we go from x is equal to 0.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.060
And then our upper bound
is x is equal to 1.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.520
So x is equal to 0,
x is equal to 1.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.630
And in general, one way to
think about it is when you're

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.020
doing kind of the last sum or
the last integral, you really

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.160
shouldn't have variable
boundaries at this point.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:07:59.520
Right?

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.120
Because our final answer has
to be a number, assuming

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.360
that we're not dealing with
something very, very abstract.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.980
But our final answer is
going to have a number.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.760
So if you had some variables
here you probably

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.740
did something wrong.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.640
And it's always useful, I
think, to draw that little da

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.160
and then figure out-- OK,
I'm summing to dy first.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.320
When I go upwards I
bump into the curve.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.210
What is that upper bound
if x is constant?

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.380
Oh, it's x squared. y
is equal to x squared.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.260
If I go down I bump into the
x-axis, or y is equal to 0.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.410
And so forth and so on.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.910
So now let's just evaluate
this and confirm that

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.110
we get the same answer.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.600
So we're integrating with
respect to y first.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:40.040
So that's x y to the
third, over three.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.990
At x squared and 0.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.050
And then we have our outer
integral. x goes from 0 to 1.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.050
dx.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.490
If we substitute x
squared in for y.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.190
x squared to the third
power is x to the sixth.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.800
x to the sixth times
x-- let me write that.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.300
So we have x times x squared
to the third power, over 3.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.540
That equals x to the seventh.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.750
Right? x squared to the third--
you multiply the exponents, and

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:16.350
then you add these. x to the
seventh over 3, minus this

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.790
evaluated with y is 0.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.940
But that's just going to be 0.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.410
Right?

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:26.400
And then we evaluate
that from 0 to 1, dx.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.680
We're almost there.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.620
Increment the exponent.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.370
You get x to the eighth over 8.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.950
And we already have a 3 down
there, so it's over 24.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.760
And you evaluate
that from 0 to 1.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.290
And I think we get
the same answer.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.100
When you evaluate it at
1 you get 1/24 minus 0.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.180
So once again, when we
integrate in the other order

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.340
you still get the volume of
the figure, being 1/4,

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.290
whatever, cubic units.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.760
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
