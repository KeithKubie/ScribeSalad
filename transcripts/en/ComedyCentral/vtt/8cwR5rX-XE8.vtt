00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:04.304
It is time to play
The Symptoms. The Symptoms.

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:08.242
-CHORUS: â™ª The Symptoms
-WOMAN: (coughs)

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:10.911
-Yeah.
-Very nice.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.614
Who needs a doctor to tell you
that a zit on your back

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:15.549
is cancer when Google
will do that for you?

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.551
Just type in your symptoms
and good old Goog

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:18.886
will provide a soothing
watercolor

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.922
of rare, exotic diseases
that you wish you had,

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.157
but probably don't have.
You're probably okay.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.026
So comedians, I'm gonna show you
a Google illustration

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.461
of some sick sickies
and their symptoms

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.663
and for 250 points I want you
to tell me what they have.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.566
All right, first up, this one...

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.835
looks a little swollen.
I don't know what that is.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:36.303
What is that?
Uh, Shelby.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.272
Oh, she used to be
so cute syndrome.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.277
Points.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.012
Points. Blaine.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.549
Well, obviously, Chris, this
young girl filled up on glands.

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.851
-All right, points.
-I'm... Chris, Chris,

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.353
I'm-I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Uh, this child

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:56.623
-has terminal mom haircut.
-All right, points.

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:57.691
Points.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.193
-Terminal?
-She does.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.195
Uh, Patton.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:05.098
Chipotle cheek.

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:07.301
All right, points to Patton.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:09.503
Next one, this one...

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:12.472
Well, this looks fun.
Patton.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:14.441
Cancer of the snuggles.

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.180
-Oh...
-It's incurable.

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:22.449
He's got a little cancer
to snuggle!

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.251
If your snuggle
lasts more than four hours...

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:26.086
-That is... Oh, you...
-Points. Shelby.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.989
Aw, he's got a bad case of the
first ten minutes of <i>Up,</i> Chris.

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.425
-Yeah, all right, points.
OSWALT: Oh...

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:33.126
-No, you don't.
-Yes!

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.562
-And she does.
-All right, next one.

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:38.332
Next one.
This one looks uncomfortable.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:39.800
Uh, Patton.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:43.737
Early onset Ted Cruz.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.439
That's not curable.
I don't think that's curable.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.808
-It's really... Poor kid.
-Yeah, you're right.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.710
You're right.
It-it spreads easily.

00:01:49.743 --> 00:01:51.512
-It, uh, really does.
-Yeah.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:53.547
At least that's
what your mother said.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.215
-Yeah!
-(exclaiming)

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.684
Oh, snap!

00:01:57.718 --> 00:01:59.753
HARDWICK:
Damn.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.556
My mom will totally (bleep) you
by the way. I don't know if...

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:03.657
-Oh, okay.
-All right.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.893
Well then, good-bye. I...

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:07.861
(whooping, applause)

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.735
The... Sorry, the joke was

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:17.938
that I left to (bleep) your mom.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:20.174
No, the joke was
that you did it that fast.

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:22.109
-Oh... Mm...
-Oh.

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.377
Blaine.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.279
Well, Chris, I don't know
about these kids,

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:28.749
but it looks like their father
has explosive diarrhea.

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.087
FERO:
He's just smiling through it.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.827
I'm kidding, Chris.

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:40.928
They have leukemia.
