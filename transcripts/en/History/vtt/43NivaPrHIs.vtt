00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.293
- What is this?

00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:04.796
TOM: That's a bench and a table.

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:06.506
Tell me about this.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.300
I started making
these benches in 1999.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.761
It's a history of not only
the Los Angeles Dodgers,

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.346
but going back to Brooklyn.

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.098
And I was commissioned by
another major league team

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.641
to make an autograph
bench, and that's

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:18.184
where this idea came from.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.310
Yeah, but it
looks like garbage.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.395
[laughs]

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:21.396
No, seriously.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.273
It says Dodgers all over it.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:24.899
TOM: Not a Dodgers fan.

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.069
The San Francisco Giants.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.279
TOM: I'm coming
into the pawn shop

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.407
today to sell my
Los Angeles Brooklyn

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:34.200
Dodgers autographed
baseball bat bench

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.077
with a matching coffee table.

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:38.455
I've slowly collected
these autographs

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:41.124
and finally have it put
together as a whole piece.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.543
My goal was for all
of these Dodgers

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.421
to have touched this bench
and touched the table.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.715
And it's almost
religious in a way.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.551
So how many cards and
everything do you have?

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:55.013
TOM: There are about 170
autographs altogether.

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:56.639
OK.
That includes the bats?

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.100
TOM: Yes.
Bats and baseballs.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.019
One thing you got me
massively concerned here,

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.479
you took all the
bats and the balls,

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.147
you drilled holes in them.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:08.526
Which is, as far as a condition
goes, is not really great.

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:10.320
If you understand
what I'm saying.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.907
And you want to sell all this.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:16.242
TOM: I want to sell
the set as one.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:17.911
OK, and how much
do you want for it?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.412
- I want $60,000.
- Ooh.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.542
Quite frankly, I have no idea
if your price is right or not.

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.920
Let me call up a buddy and have
him take a look at this stuff.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.254
Let me get an idea from him.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.465
I mean, you just have
so much stuff here

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.175
and I need a little help.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.802
So if you don't mind hanging
out, I'm going to get him down,

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.637
he'll look at
everything, and we'll

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:37.096
try and figure something out.
- OK.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.848
- All right?
- Thank you.

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:42.435
Hearing that an expert is coming
in is going to be a good thing.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.521
It will help me understand
what the real value

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.147
is for this piece.

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:50.026
He wants a whopping
$60,000 for this.

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:51.736
I think that's way
out of left field,

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:53.863
but maybe he's just
starting real high.

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.114
So I called Jeremy
down to see what

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:56.658
this thing is really worth.

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.952
So we have a
Dodgers furniture.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.621
I'd figured I'd have
you take a look at it.

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.164
He wants a lot of
money for them,

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:04.541
but there's a lot of stuff here.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:05.792
Just from what I can
see here real quick,

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:07.335
this is absolutely fantastic.

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:09.629
So what are some of the
best pieces we have in here?

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.173
Well, Charles Ebbets, I
think, is the number one.

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:14.759
I found out there is
only one other photograph

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.219
that he had signed.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.973
And then Jackie Robinson,
that was dated 1954.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.516
Well, just like
he said, by far

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.768
and away, the best piece
in this entire collection

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.728
has got to be the
Charles Ebbets autograph.

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:27.480
This is, by far, the
most scarce autograph

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.857
in the entire collection.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.942
Ebbets owned the team
in 1900 and opened

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.735
Ebbets Field in 1912.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:34.863
Being that he passed
away in the 20s,

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:36.865
that autograph-- especially
on a photo like that--

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:38.366
is exceedingly rare.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.076
On the bottom row
right here, there's

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.537
six different cards in the 1955
season that are autographed.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.455
55 being the key
year for the Dodgers.

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:46.249
Their first World
Series victory.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:49.919
So this is just one
hell of a collection.

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.088
I'm assuming I'd have to
break this up to sell it.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:55.258
It would be a shame to, but it
would be incredibly difficult,

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.801
in my opinion, to
find somebody that

00:02:56.801 --> 00:02:59.178
would be spending top dollar
on something like this.

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:00.930
And I mean, I can think
of thousands of collectors

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.142
and fans that would just love
to have an authentic autograph,

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.060
from the 50s, of
Jackie Robinson.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.104
The problem is you're not going
to really find too many people

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.772
that are going to pay you
premium so they can have

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:12.358
autographs of Wally Moon,
Rick Monday, and some

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.319
of the other Dodgers from
throughout the history

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.737
of the club.

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:18.615
So what do you think
all this stuff is worth?

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.241
Well, the
autographs themselves,

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:22.118
they all have
considerable value,

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:25.038
but beyond that, quite honestly,
I'm at a loss of words.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.790
What you've done here to
the bats and the balls,

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.418
in my industry, it's extremely
careless and quite honestly,

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:31.836
it's sacrilegious.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:33.630
You're not supposed to
alter signed memorabilia

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.298
when you have it.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.966
So as far as the value, because
of the condition, the fact

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.302
we have about a 1/2 inch drilled
through the entire section

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:43.765
of bats and balls, maybe
about $10,000 to $12,000

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.683
is what we're looking at.
- Thanks, man.

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:47.477
I appreciate it.
- You got it, man.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:48.937
Thank you for showing it to me.
- OK.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:50.688
With sports memorabilia,
the one saving grace

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:53.358
is no matter what you have, how
rare, how unique, how obscure,

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.234
there's always somebody out
there looking to buy it.

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:56.819
With this piece in
particular, there

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.571
would be people that would
absolutely pay top dollar

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.823
to have it, but we're
talking about a very limited,

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:03.117
very small market out there.

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:04.494
All right.

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.037
What you've got here
is really, really neat.

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:07.872
It's a great collection.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.124
But I would have
to break this up.

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:11.334
I understand.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.169
When it comes down
to making money,

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.879
that's what you got to do.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:21.803
So I don't think you're going
to take $8,000 for all this.

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.429
Not at all.
No.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.847
I have a lot more.

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:26.933
I have three times that,
just in the autographs.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.685
It's a neat set,
there's a lot of history.

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:29.560
It's really, really cool.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.520
But I got to make money.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.356
So thanks.
- Thank you.

00:04:33.356 --> 00:04:35.024
Thanks for looking at it.

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:38.236
I'm very surprised by the
value the expert has given me.

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.363
It's a one of a kind art piece.

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:41.990
I know there is
a buyer out there

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.825
that would pay
what I want for it,

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:44.826
and that's what I'm going for.
