00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:01.630
- [Voiceover] So we
have the sum negative 50

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.788
plus negative 44, plus
negative 38, all the way,

00:00:04.788 --> 00:00:09.223
we keep adding all the way
up to 2,038, and then 2,044.

00:00:09.223 --> 00:00:14.223
So see if you can pause this
video and evaluate this sum.

00:00:14.377 --> 00:00:16.606
So let's work through this together,

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:18.325
and let's just think
about what's going on.

00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:20.507
So the first term here is negative 50,

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:22.179
and then we go to negative 44,

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.478
so the second term is negative 50

00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:29.478
plus 6, and then the third
term, we add 6 again.

00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:33.208
Negative 44 plus 6 is negative 38, and we

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:35.367
go all the way to here, we keep adding 6,

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:39.175
and to go from 2,038 to 2,044,
to get to that last term,

00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:42.263
we add 6 once again.

00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:44.655
And so each successive term is just 6

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:46.513
more than the term before it.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:48.416
So we are dealing right over here,

00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:52.015
this sum is an arithmetic series.

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:55.104
It's a sum of an arithmetic sequence.

00:00:55.104 --> 00:00:58.145
Each term is 6 more, is a constant amount

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:01.767
more than the term before that.

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:03.578
So we know how to take the sum of

00:01:03.578 --> 00:01:05.181
an arithmetic sequence.

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:06.922
We know that if we have,

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:08.849
if we are taking the sum of,

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:10.242
let me do this in a new color,

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:12.100
just to have a little bit
of variety on the screen,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.886
if we're taking the sum of,

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:19.832
of the first n terms of
an arithmetic sequence

00:01:19.832 --> 00:01:21.295
or, if we're taking

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:23.965
or if we're evaluating the
first n terms of an arithmetic

00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:25.915
series, I could say,

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:28.910
it's going to be the first term

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.675
plus the last term

00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:31.743
divided by 2.

00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:33.833
You could view this of
the average of the first

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:34.854
and the last terms,

00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:37.966
times the number of terms

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.359
that we're dealing with.

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.983
So over here, we know what
our first and last terms are,

00:01:41.983 --> 00:01:43.028
we know this right over here.

00:01:43.028 --> 00:01:45.024
That is a1,

00:01:45.024 --> 00:01:47.996
and this is our last term, 2,044,

00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:50.016
so that is our a-sub-n,

00:01:50.016 --> 00:01:52.617
so the other question is, well, what is n?

00:01:52.617 --> 00:01:55.032
How many terms do we actually deal with?

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:56.378
And to think about that, we just say,

00:01:56.378 --> 00:01:58.840
well how many times do we have to add 6

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.158
to go from negative 50 to 2,044?

00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:07.686
Well, 2,044 minus negative 50,

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:10.589
minus negative 50,

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:14.814
well that's the same
thing as 2,044 plus 50

00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:18.971
or 2,094, and the whole
reason I calculated this

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.712
is I want to figure out
how far do I have to go

00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:23.382
from negative 50 to 2,044?

00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:26.099
I have to go up 50 just
to get back to zero

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.189
and then go up another 2,044.

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.837
So I have to go 50 just
to get back to zero,

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:31.695
then go up another 2,044

00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:34.574
so I have to go up by 2,094,

00:02:34.574 --> 00:02:35.433
so if I'm going,

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:37.848
if I'm adding 6 on every term,

00:02:37.848 --> 00:02:39.380
how many times do I have to add 6

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.399
to increase by 2,094?

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:46.230
Well, let's just take
2,094 and divide it by 6

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.692
to figure that out.

00:02:47.692 --> 00:02:49.829
So 6 goes into 20 three times,

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.477
3 times 6 is 18,

00:02:51.477 --> 00:02:54.078
subtract, 20 minus 18 is 2,

00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:55.610
bring down the 9,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.605
6 goes into 29 four times,

00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:00.974
4 times 6 is 24,

00:03:00.974 --> 00:03:04.015
subtract, 29 minus 24 is 5,

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:05.478
bring down the 4,

00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:06.755
we have 54,

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:09.449
6 goes into 54 nine times,

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.863
9 times 6 is 54

00:03:11.863 --> 00:03:13.907
and we are done.

00:03:13.907 --> 00:03:16.484
So to go from negative 50 to 2,044,

00:03:16.484 --> 00:03:20.780
I have to add 6 to 349 times,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.009
so I add it once, I add it twice,

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:24.007
and then this right over here,

00:03:24.007 --> 00:03:27.397
this is the 349th time that I'm adding 6,

00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:29.556
so how many terms do I have?

00:03:29.556 --> 00:03:32.668
Now, you might be
tempted to say 349 terms,

00:03:32.668 --> 00:03:35.199
but really, you have 349 plus 1 terms.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.310
You have the 349 for
every time you added 6,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.866
so this is the first time you added 6,

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:40.864
second time you added 6,

00:03:40.864 --> 00:03:43.511
all the way to the 349th time you added 6,

00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:44.347
so let me make it clear,

00:03:44.347 --> 00:03:45.810
this, this is,

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.433
oh, actually, this is the
349th time I added 6 to get

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:51.173
to this, but we haven't counted
the first term just yet,

00:03:51.173 --> 00:03:52.288
so we're going to have,

00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:53.658
so we have 300,

00:03:53.658 --> 00:03:57.419
we have the first term and
then we add 6 349 times,

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.854
so we have 350 terms in this sum,

00:04:01.854 --> 00:04:06.382
so in this case, n is
going to be equal to 350.

00:04:06.382 --> 00:04:10.073
N is equal to 350.

00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:13.765
And so we can say the
sum of the first 300...

00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:16.343
I'll do this in green,

00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:20.034
the sum of the first 350 terms

00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:22.867
is going to be equal to the
average of the first and last

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:25.561
term, so negative 50

00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:30.228
plus 2,044 over 2,

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.737
over 2,

00:04:31.737 --> 00:04:34.314
times 350,

00:04:34.314 --> 00:04:35.313
so let's see,

00:04:35.313 --> 00:04:38.261
negative 50 plus 2,044,

00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:39.260
that's going to be what?

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.698
2,094,

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:46.698
2,094 divided by 2

00:04:46.713 --> 00:04:48.153
times,

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:49.430
times 350,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.567
so let's see, if I just take,

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:54.236
so this is going to be, 'cause
right, this is 294 times,

00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:54.724
let's see,

00:04:54.724 --> 00:04:57.347
350 divided,

00:04:57.347 --> 00:04:58.694
oh, sorry, not 294,

00:04:58.694 --> 00:04:59.600
what am I?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.807
My brain is not working.

00:05:00.807 --> 00:05:02.223
2,000,

00:05:02.223 --> 00:05:03.779
this is 2--

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:08.376
actually, this is going to be 1994.

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:11.743
My brain really wasn't
working a little while ago,

00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:16.743
so this is going to be
1994 divided by 2 times 350

00:05:16.851 --> 00:05:18.500
and so let's see,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.217
350 divided by 2 is 175,

00:05:21.217 --> 00:05:24.746
so this is going to be 1,900--

00:05:24.746 --> 00:05:29.413
1,994 times

00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:32.338
175.

00:05:32.338 --> 00:05:33.453
Which is equal to,

00:05:33.453 --> 00:05:35.241
and I'll use a calculator for this one,

00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:37.447
so, let me get the calculator out,

00:05:37.447 --> 00:05:41.974
so, I have 1,994

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:45.062
times 175

00:05:45.062 --> 00:05:48.963
gives us 348,950.

00:05:48.963 --> 00:05:53.444
348,950.

00:05:53.444 --> 00:05:55.534
And we could express this
in sigma notation now,

00:05:55.534 --> 00:05:57.043
now that we know what the n is.

00:05:57.043 --> 00:05:59.365
We found our answer, this
is what we were looking for,

00:05:59.365 --> 00:06:01.084
but just in case you're curious,

00:06:01.084 --> 00:06:02.987
we could write this as the sum

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:05.797
from, let's say, k is equal to 1

00:06:05.797 --> 00:06:10.797
to k is equal to 350 of,

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:13.854
let's see, we could write this as,

00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:17.523
as negative 50,

00:06:17.523 --> 00:06:22.523
negative 50 plus 6 times k minus 1,

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.114
'cause the first term,
we don't want to actually

00:06:26.114 --> 00:06:27.414
add the 6,

00:06:27.414 --> 00:06:28.528
and then the last term,

00:06:28.528 --> 00:06:31.268
we want to add the 6 349 times.

00:06:31.268 --> 00:06:33.474
Which we saw, so we're
going to add it 349 times,

00:06:33.474 --> 00:06:34.426
and there you have it.

00:06:34.426 --> 00:06:35.123
That,

00:06:35.123 --> 00:06:39.325
this arithmetic series
written in sigma notation,

00:06:39.325 --> 00:06:41.113
so hopefully you enjoyed that.

00:06:41.113 --> 00:06:43.342
Pardon my little mental error earlier.

00:06:43.342 --> 00:06:45.589
I don't know what was
going on in my brain.
