00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.540
I received a problem
from Bradley.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.220
I don't know his last name.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.300
I'm assuming it's a he.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.050
I don't know where he lives.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.670
But the problem he
gave is interesting.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.980
And I don't think I've
covered this before.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.090
So I think it's worth covering.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.730
So the problem he gave, if I
read his note properly, is

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:25.310
this: 3 sine squared of x is
equal to 1 plus cosine of x.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.730
So at first cut, this seems
like a difficult problem.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.270
How do I-- You
can't solve for x.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.350
You would have arcsines
and the square roots

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.950
and cosines et cetera.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.500
Et cetera.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.070
So the way I approached this
is-- Any time that if I see a

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.880
cosine x here but then I see a
sine squared x here, I start

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.860
thinking of what trig
identities are at my disposal.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.970
And what trig identities
involve a sine squared x?

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.280
Well the most basic trig
identity, and this comes out

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.420
of the unit circle definition
of trig functions, is that

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.530
sine squared x plus cosine
squared x is equal to 1.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.510
And that comes out of the fact
that the equation of a circle

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.500
is x squared plus y squared is
equal to the radius squared.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.100
But it's the unit circle.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.650
It's equal to 1 squared.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.170
But anyway.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200
Hopefully you have this
memorized if you've already

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.410
been watching the trig videos.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.070
So what does sine
squared x equal?

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.280
Well let's solve for it.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:23.270
So sine squared x is equal to 1
minus cosine squared x, right?

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.700
So we could substitute this
term right here with this.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.630
And what does that get us?

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.880
Well we're just playing around
at this point, but at least

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.620
that way, everything is
in terms of cosine of x.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.310
So let's do that.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.860
Let's substitute.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.680
So we get 3 times
sine squared of x.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.520
We just showed that sine
squared of x is the same thing

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.075
as 1 minus cosine squared of x.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.730
Is equal to 1 plus cosine of x.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.560
We can simplify a little bit.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:05.480
3 minus 3 cosine squared of x
is equal to 1 plus cosine of x.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.910
I don't know.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.990
Just for kicks, let's put
everything onto the right

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.550
side of the equation.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.620
And you'll see it
wasn't just for kicks.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.870
0-- right?

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.230
I'm just going to --is equal
to-- let's put this onto

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.150
the right side --3
cosine squared x.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.810
And then-- Let's see.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.940
We have to subtract
3 from this side.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.570
Well let's just
write the cosine x.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.260
Plus cosine x.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.400
And then 1 minus 3 is minus 2.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.910
Let me make sure I didn't
make a careless mistake.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.870
We have negative 3 here.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.493
We added 3 cosine x--
3 cosine squared of x

00:02:35.493 --> 00:02:36.960
to both sides, right?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.500
We subtracted 3
from both sides.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.360
Minus 2 and this cosine
x is this cosine x.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.950
Now what can we do?

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.410
Well this is where it
gets interesting.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.740
Because this looks an awful lot
like a quadratic equation

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.920
except for the fact that
instead of having ax squared

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.400
plus bx plus c, we have
a cosine squared x.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.360
So instead of just having an
x squared, we have a whole

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.940
cosine of x squared.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.470
So what do I mean by that?

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.720
Let me make a substitution.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.760
And then I think it'll
all become clear to you.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.030
Let's make the substitution
that a-- and I'm just picking

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.430
the letter a arbitrarily
--is equal to cosine of x.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.836
So if we were to take the
cosine x's of this and replace

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.450
them with a, what do we get?

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.760
And I'm just going to
switch it around.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.790
So I want to put the
0 on that side.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.340
Equal 0.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.875
So we get 3-- Well
cosine squared x.

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:36.040
That's the same thing as
cosine of x squared, right?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:47.840
So we get 3a squared plus
a minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.870
Well now we have a
pure quadratic.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.500
And we can solve it using
the quadratic equation.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.690
So what's the
quadratic equation?

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.760
Let me write it up here.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.080
Negative b plus or minus
the square root of b

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.700
squared minus 4ac.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.560
All of that over 2a.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.550
So what are the roots
of this equation?

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.400
Well what's minus-- And
remember this a is

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.440
different than this a.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.040
Maybe I shouldn't have
used a as a letter.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.410
But these-- a, b, and c in
the quadratic equation

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.460
represent the coefficients.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.360
So this is a.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.500
b is 1.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.340
And c is just minus 2.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.080
So what are the roots of this?

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.780
So the a's that solve
this. a can equal--

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.780
And I know I confused you.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.190
I could-- Let me actually
write it different.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.630
Let's make this, instead of
a is equal to cosine x, let

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.610
me say that-- I don't know.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.540
Let me pick a good letter
that's not involved in

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.540
the-- Let me say d.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.920
So 3d squared plus
d minus is 2.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.250
So now the a's, b's and c's are
definitely the coefficients.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.390
So the solutions to this are
d-- because I didn't want to

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.060
use a, b, or c --d is
equal to minus b.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.350
Well, b is 1.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.730
Minus 1.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.600
And if this is completely
foreign to you, you should

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.010
review the videos on
the quadratic equation.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.560
Minus b squared.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.690
Well that's 1 squared.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.030
Minus 4ac.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.220
So minus 4 times a,
times 3, times c.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.590
Well c is minus 2, right?

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.630
So we get a-- That
minus cancels there.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.780
And we have a 2 there.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.550
All of that over 2 times a. a
is 3, so we have it over 6.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.700
So this equals minus 1
plus or minus the square

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.250
root-- What is this?

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.480
4 times 3 times 2.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.240
24 plus 1.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.900
25.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.950
Oh.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.820
This works out cleanly.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.290
Over 6.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:46.160
So that equals minus 1
plus or minus 5 over 6.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.480
And so what are the roots?

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.760
The roots are-- What's
minus 1 minus 5?

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.670
That's minus 6 over 6.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.510
So it's minus 1.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.420
What's the other one?

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.850
Minus 1 plus 5 is 4.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.840
4 over 6 is 2/3.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.260
So the solution is to
the equation-- Let me

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.490
clear up some space.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.210
Hopefully it'll let me
clear up some space here.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.600
Let me see.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.170
What was I doing?

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.580
Oh.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.780
Maybe I want to leave--
I can get rid of this.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.210
You know the identity.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.380
And you also know the
quadratic formula.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.840
Let's see.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.310
Actually, let me get
rid of this too.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.860
Clear up a bunch of space.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.410
I wanted to leave this here
because this showed how this

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.380
turned into a quadratic, but
instead of having it in terms

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.560
of just a variable, we have
it in terms of cosine of x.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.550
And then we made this d
is equal to cosine of x.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.030
Anyway.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.970
So the solution to this
equation is that quadratic.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:57.080
Is d is equal to minus
1 or 2/3, right?

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.700
But, of course, we made the
substitution long ago that

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.500
d is equal to cosine of x.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.240
So the solution to this
equation, in terms of x, is the

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.840
solution to this equation.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:17.500
Cosine of x is equal to minus 1
or cosine of x is equal to 2/3.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.850
Well this one's easy, right?

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.590
x is equal to
arccosine of minus 1.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.690
I always forget if there's two
c's when you do arccosine.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.330
Anyway, so what-- At what
degree or radian value does the

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.020
cosine of x equal minus 1?

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.040
Well it's at pi, right?

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.895
So x could equal pi, which
is also or 180 degrees.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.390
This one is not as easy.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.010
I think I will have to use
a calculator for this.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.330
Unless I'm-- whoops.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.520
So you may not realize it,
but Google is actually

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.110
a calculator.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.540
And a far more advanced
calculator than most.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.555
So we could use Google
to figure out the

00:08:01.555 --> 00:08:03.660
arccosine of 2/3.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.790
Let's do that.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.090
Arccosine-- and I don't
know if I'm spelling it

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.230
right --of 2 over 3.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:21.370
Google tells us that it's
0.841 and a bunch of numbers.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:27.160
So x is equal to
arccosine of 2 over 3.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:35.070
So x is equal to 0.84106.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.950
Let's see if they work.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.660
Let's, just for fun, let's
just see if this one works.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.180
Let's see if we substitute
pi into this equation we

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.320
get the correct answer.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.810
Well what's sine of pi?

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.240
Let me erase all of this
is so we can check it.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.140
I'm only going to check pi.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.680
The 0.84.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.220
And I don't know.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:52.800
That's messy.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.870
But you could do that
in your own time.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.318
So let's check pi.

00:08:58.318 --> 00:08:59.480
x equals-- No.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.680
That's not what I wanted to do.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.030
So what is-- Let's make
sure this works with pi.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:17.510
3 sine squared of pi is equal
to 1 plus cosine of pi.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.900
Well what's sine of pi?

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:24.570
This is equal to 3
sine of pi squared.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.760
This is equal to 1
plus cosine of pi.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.940
Well sine of pi is 0, right?

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.320
The y-value when you
go 180 degrees is 0.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.180
So this is 0.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.360
And what's cosine of pi?

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.890
Cosine of pi is negative 1.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.100
So 1 plus minus 1.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.400
Well this is true.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.790
So pi worked in that equation.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.600
I think if you substitute
that 0841068 whatever, you'd

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.990
also find that that works.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.550
So thanks Bradley
for sending this.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.430
I thought this was a neat
problem because it looks

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.660
like it's trigonometry.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.190
And it was trigonometry but
you had to know a little

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.840
bit of identities.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.020
And then you had to recognize
it as a quadratic equation.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.590
I will see you in
a future video.
