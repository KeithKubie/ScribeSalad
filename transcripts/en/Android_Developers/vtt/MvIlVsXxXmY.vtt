00:00:00.186 --> 00:00:01.810
MALE SPEAKER: You
tap the launcher icon

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.550
for your app, your app launches.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.880
Sounds easy, right?

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.750
What's happening
behind the scenes

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.342
is a little more involved.

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.710
It turns out the
activities in your app

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.310
don't live in a vacuum,
but instead exist

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.720
as part of one or more tasks.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.080
Now, a task, in and of itself,
isn't very complicated.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.680
It's simply a stack
of activities.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.990
As you call start activity,
that pushes a new activity

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.760
onto the task's back stack.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.870
The Back button reverses
this, calling finish

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.850
on the current activity,
popping it from the stack,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.610
and taking the user
back to where they were.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.270
Hence the name.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.650
This symmetric push-pop model
also applies to fragments.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.280
When specifying a
fragment transaction,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.560
you can call add to back
stack to add the fragment

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.510
transaction to the back stack.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.130
Then, when the user hits
the Back button, instead of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.140
your activity being finished,
the fragment transaction

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.560
is reversed.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.890
Only when there are no
more fragment transactions

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.310
will the Back button
finish your activity.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.820
Now, if instead of
hitting the Back button,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.090
you were to hit the Home
button, the whole task

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.490
is put in the background.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.080
If you then tap
the launcher icon,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.350
the system brings the task
back to the foreground,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.725
right where you left it.

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:20.890
The same thing
happens if you select

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.520
the app's task from
the overview screen,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.380
the task is brought
to the foreground.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.830
For many apps, this default
behavior is all you would need.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.110
No touchy.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.520
Nice, consistent,
symmetric operations.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.100
But there are two specific
cases where you might

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.510
want to do something special.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.550
First, if you're calling start
activity with the activity

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.350
you're already on.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.790
This might be the case where
you're on a search results

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.620
page, and search again.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.320
Instead of piling up
activity after activity,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.290
and requiring multiple
presses of the Back button,

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.070
you can add a launch
mode of single top

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.920
to your activities
manifest entry.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.710
Or include flag activity
single top in your intent.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.610
Instead of a new instance of
your activity being created

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.070
every time you call
start activity,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.800
you get a call back
to on new intent.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.920
And users will be able to
hit the Back button just once

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.020
to return to the
previous activity.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.280
The second case is
around notifications.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.420
We talked about how the Back
button pops the back stack.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.250
A natural corollary is that
the Back button shouldn't

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.580
cross into different
tasks-- a convention

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.450
since the days of Android 3.0.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.540
It's just a single stack from
where you are to the launcher.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.870
Remember, there's that
fancy overview screen

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.090
for switching tasks.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.930
So for a notification
that points

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.880
to an activity deep
within your app,

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.890
you really don't want that
first press of the Back button

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.660
to take you immediately
to the launcher.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.760
Not when every other time you're
looking at that same screen,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.620
the Back button does
something different,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.090
like go back in your app.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.010
That's where
TaskStackBuilder comes in.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.290
It builds a synthetic, i.e.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.400
fake, back stack.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.770
By default, based on
the parent activities

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.440
you attached to each activity
entry in your manifest.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.160
Although you can
customize it any way

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.960
you want, adding extras,
whatever you need.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.950
This ensures that even if there
is no task when the user taps

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.500
the notification, they're
exactly where they

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.220
expect to be in your app.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.130
As if they had navigated
there themselves.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.490
You just saved them some time
and effort getting there.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.145
So check out the
blog post linked

00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:41.670
in the description for
all the details on tasks

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.620
and the back stack, plus
some of the other flags

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.190
and launch modes you
probably shouldn't use.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.860
Well, right up until
they're the perfect thing

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.150
to use to build better apps.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.066
Thanks.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.440
Wait, what was that?

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.450
The Up button?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.880
Yeah, that's totally different.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.610
Let's discuss in the blog post.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.960
