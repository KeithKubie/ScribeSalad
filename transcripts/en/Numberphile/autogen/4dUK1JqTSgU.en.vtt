00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.540
so here's a mirror of sort it's curved

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550
so here's a mirror of sort it's curved
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.789
so here's a mirror of sort it's curved
and in front of this mirror I put this

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799
and in front of this mirror I put this
 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.740
and in front of this mirror I put this
rectangular sheet with something drawn

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750
rectangular sheet with something drawn
 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.780
rectangular sheet with something drawn
on it and when you put it in front of

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790
on it and when you put it in front of
 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.600
on it and when you put it in front of
mirror and look inside a mirror you see

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
mirror and look inside a mirror you see
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.620
mirror and look inside a mirror you see
a cat you know with pointy ears and

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630
a cat you know with pointy ears and
 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.640
a cat you know with pointy ears and
sided protrusions that look like

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650
sided protrusions that look like
 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.529
sided protrusions that look like
whiskers and everything so I'm very

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539
whiskers and everything so I'm very
 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.790
whiskers and everything so I'm very
happy with this cat I'm proud of this

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
happy with this cat I'm proud of this
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.849
happy with this cat I'm proud of this
guy nice cat I will say that when I show

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859
guy nice cat I will say that when I show
 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.040
guy nice cat I will say that when I show
this to mathematician and Cisco

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
this to mathematician and Cisco
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.439
this to mathematician and Cisco
physicist colleagues some people like

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
physicist colleagues some people like
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.790
physicist colleagues some people like
this because they have good taste but

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
this because they have good taste but
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.900
this because they have good taste but
others say so well that's really sad I

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
others say so well that's really sad I
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.450
others say so well that's really sad I
hope that they didn't say so but for

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460
hope that they didn't say so but for
 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.540
hope that they didn't say so but for
those of us who would like to say so

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550
those of us who would like to say so
 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.340
those of us who would like to say so
here is the thing in front you have a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
here is the thing in front you have a
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.560
here is the thing in front you have a
mirror indeed but that's what we call a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
mirror indeed but that's what we call a
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.479
mirror indeed but that's what we call a
convex mirror so it's bulging out to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
convex mirror so it's bulging out to
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.700
convex mirror so it's bulging out to
order in the back inside of the tube

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710
order in the back inside of the tube
 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.340
order in the back inside of the tube
there is a concave mirror which is

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
there is a concave mirror which is
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470
there is a concave mirror which is
building away from us so now I'm going

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
building away from us so now I'm going
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.060
building away from us so now I'm going
to put another cat inside and look at

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070
to put another cat inside and look at
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.040
to put another cat inside and look at
what happened and if you look from the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
what happened and if you look from the
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.590
what happened and if you look from the
correct angle you see another cat inside

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600
correct angle you see another cat inside
 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.569
correct angle you see another cat inside
by the way some people might wonder how

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
by the way some people might wonder how
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.420
by the way some people might wonder how
many reflections are bouncing off before

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
many reflections are bouncing off before
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.850
many reflections are bouncing off before
it reaches eyes but in fact it's just

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
it reaches eyes but in fact it's just
 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.719
it reaches eyes but in fact it's just
one reflection

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
one reflection
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.000
one reflection
it's circling on the back side and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
it's circling on the back side and
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.160
it's circling on the back side and
they're coming out so you have a cat on

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
they're coming out so you have a cat on
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.070
they're coming out so you have a cat on
the inside now a slightly odd thing is

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
the inside now a slightly odd thing is
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.280
the inside now a slightly odd thing is
that cat on the inside looks very much

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
that cat on the inside looks very much
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.780
that cat on the inside looks very much
like the cat on the outside

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
like the cat on the outside
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.240
like the cat on the outside
although the cats on the outside is from

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250
although the cats on the outside is from
 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.969
although the cats on the outside is from
a convex mirror where is the cat from

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
a convex mirror where is the cat from
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.100
a convex mirror where is the cat from
the inside is from a concave mirror so

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
the inside is from a concave mirror so
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.810
the inside is from a concave mirror so
convex and concave I mean there are

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
convex and concave I mean there are
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.580
convex and concave I mean there are
opposite things and you might expect a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
opposite things and you might expect a
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.230
opposite things and you might expect a
bit distortion in fact be the opposite

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
bit distortion in fact be the opposite
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.090
bit distortion in fact be the opposite
but they look very very similar so

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
but they look very very similar so
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.620
but they look very very similar so
that's quite interesting it's not much

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
that's quite interesting it's not much
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.569
that's quite interesting it's not much
of a hint but one thing that has to do

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
of a hint but one thing that has to do
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.819
of a hint but one thing that has to do
with this effect is the following this

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
with this effect is the following this
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.149
with this effect is the following this
arrow is pointing from left to right and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
arrow is pointing from left to right and
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.330
arrow is pointing from left to right and
if you look at its image reflection in

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
if you look at its image reflection in
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.330
if you look at its image reflection in
the mirror in front the convex part it's

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
the mirror in front the convex part it's
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.249
the mirror in front the convex part it's
still pointing from left right but let's

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
still pointing from left right but let's
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.980
still pointing from left right but let's
look at it on the inside on the camara

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990
look at it on the inside on the camara
 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.280
look at it on the inside on the camara
it's pointing right to that so that's

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290
it's pointing right to that so that's
 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.469
it's pointing right to that so that's
quite interesting it reversed its

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
quite interesting it reversed its
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.080
quite interesting it reversed its
direction so it's a matter of where with

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090
direction so it's a matter of where with
 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.700
direction so it's a matter of where with
respect to focus you are placing the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
respect to focus you are placing the
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.040
respect to focus you are placing the
arrow as I move the arrow inside or

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
arrow as I move the arrow inside or
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.980
arrow as I move the arrow inside or
equivalently

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990
equivalently
 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.130
equivalently
the mirror you see the arrow changing

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140
the mirror you see the arrow changing
 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.850
the mirror you see the arrow changing
its shape and somehow it sort of blurs

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860
its shape and somehow it sort of blurs
 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.760
its shape and somehow it sort of blurs
out and eventually at the end you come

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770
out and eventually at the end you come
 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.800
out and eventually at the end you come
to the point where you see really the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810
to the point where you see really the
 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.410
to the point where you see really the
image next to the the original arrows so

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420
image next to the the original arrows so
 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.390
image next to the the original arrows so
you can do something like this with a

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400
you can do something like this with a
 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.640
you can do something like this with a
spherical mirror and little rectangular

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650
spherical mirror and little rectangular
 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.320
spherical mirror and little rectangular
sheets of paper when I first sort of

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330
sheets of paper when I first sort of
 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.700
sheets of paper when I first sort of
this you know I thought something like

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710
this you know I thought something like
 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.470
this you know I thought something like
this might be interesting to try the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480
this might be interesting to try the
 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.750
this might be interesting to try the
major problem I said to us where do you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760
major problem I said to us where do you
 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.400
major problem I said to us where do you
find a cylindrical mirror I mean if you

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410
find a cylindrical mirror I mean if you
 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.130
find a cylindrical mirror I mean if you
have a flat mirror you know slightly

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140
have a flat mirror you know slightly
 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.170
have a flat mirror you know slightly
bowing out the bulging in so that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180
bowing out the bulging in so that
 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.390
bowing out the bulging in so that
changes the size of your image and so on

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400
changes the size of your image and so on
 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.950
changes the size of your image and so on
where you can find that in cosmetic

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960
where you can find that in cosmetic
 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.350
where you can find that in cosmetic
shops and so forth but where do you find

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360
shops and so forth but where do you find
 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.450
shops and so forth but where do you find
a cylindrical Mir a two black mirror and

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460
a cylindrical Mir a two black mirror and
 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.550
a cylindrical Mir a two black mirror and
I thought and so and finally I went to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560
I thought and so and finally I went to
 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.020
I thought and so and finally I went to
the Stanford Shopping Center and the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030
the Stanford Shopping Center and the
 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.050
the Stanford Shopping Center and the
found on these are cookie cutters it's a

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060
found on these are cookie cutters it's a
 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.030
found on these are cookie cutters it's a
cookie cutter you know values like a

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040
cookie cutter you know values like a
 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.860
cookie cutter you know values like a
cookie dough and then cultures so you

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870
cookie dough and then cultures so you
 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.330
cookie dough and then cultures so you
can buy one for $1 and with that you can

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340
can buy one for $1 and with that you can
 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.150
can buy one for $1 and with that you can
make a cut in the mirror catching a

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160
make a cut in the mirror catching a
 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.570
make a cut in the mirror catching a
cookie cutter that's

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580
 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.430
one not talk to the other by 90 degrees

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440
one not talk to the other by 90 degrees
 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.280
one not talk to the other by 90 degrees
and in this toy model you'll see exactly

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290
and in this toy model you'll see exactly
 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.530
and in this toy model you'll see exactly
what happens if I support those two

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540
what happens if I support those two
 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.960
what happens if I support those two
objects like this they stick together

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970
objects like this they stick together
 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.010
objects like this they stick together
because the stiff one is at the bottom
