00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.344
And when we graph this, it looks about like

00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:05.965
this. It’s a big function that has the highest

00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:09.736
value at the center, nineteen and then falls

00:00:09.736 --> 00:00:13.492
down in some interesting way that looks awfully

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:16.097
much like the way the previous exercise fell down.

00:00:16.097 --> 00:00:17.757
So even for this different experiment with

00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:20.342
the die, we get about the same phenomenon that

00:00:20.342 --> 00:00:23.969
the sum of those seems to have a distinct high

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.587
probability for what’s the most likely outcome

00:00:27.587 --> 00:00:30.868
four and then it falls off in some interesting way.

00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:33.386
So this is effectively what’s called the central

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:35.473
limit theorem. And this sounds complicated and

00:00:35.473 --> 00:00:38.501
in fact it is, but here is the simple version

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:41.269
to remember. Suppose you’re doing many

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.578
experiments. Each of these experiments over

00:00:43.578 --> 00:00:45.146
here have some distribution, we don’t care,

00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:48.119
it has to just be reasonable and you sum those

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:51.830
all up for some very large number and if N is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.195
large then the joint distribution of the sum of

00:00:55.195 --> 00:00:59.869
those with approach a function it looks like this.

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:02.057
That’s called a Gaussian. We discuss the

00:01:02.057 --> 00:01:04.587
Gaussian in depth. It has its own formula and

00:01:04.587 --> 00:01:07.886
typically if N is as big as thirty that is maybe

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:10.051
your test thirty people whether they have

00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:12.827
cancer or not, that’s usually good enough to

00:01:12.827 --> 00:01:15.853
approximate this really complicated binomial

00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:17.873
over here with this relatively simple Gaussian

00:01:17.873 --> 00:01:20.346
function. We’ll learn more about this later,

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.235
but the key thing to remember is we take many

00:01:23.235 --> 00:01:28.380
experiments, you add them up and outcomes a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.600
function just like this. That’s called the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.000
central limit theorem.
