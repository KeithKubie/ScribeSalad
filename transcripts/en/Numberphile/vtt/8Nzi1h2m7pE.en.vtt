00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.220
Okay, calculator fanciers!

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.200
Today we have some, you know, from the bleeding edge of calculator innovation, some brand new calculators from Staples.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.210
Let's open this up and see what we've got.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.649
So we'll make the traditional incision on one side of the logo, as to not ruin

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.090
the actual picture there. Slice that open, and we have

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.300
oh, okay, first calculator out of the bag

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.480
is already on, and look at, um, okay,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.140
there's no further unboxing to be done, but it is a flexible,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.800
a limp, some would say, calculator. You can see there, branded with Staples. No box, no instructions?

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.859
And what if I want to read how to use my calculator in a variety of different languages?

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.169
Classic: don't do calculation in a bin, that's good. And you can see it is a flexible calculator.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.049
Let's take it for a spin, and see, see what it can do.

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.829
So, what do we have? We've got the normal

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.719
add, subtract, multiply, and divide. We also have, this is random.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.689
It'll add OR subtract, if you're doing calculations

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.760
and you want element of random chance and luck.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.660
We got percentage, and we've got M on and M off.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.979
Okay, so let's divide by zero.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.780
One, divide by, zero, equals, error! Oh, okay, fantastic.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880
And I assume, let's just check all the calc, where one,

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.079
divided by seven, equals, a bunch of numbers, times, seven, equals,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.840
Oh, okay, so there's some rounding errors going on in there, but that's,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.880
I mean, otherwise it's great.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.089
And it'd be really useful for all those situations where you haven't got the space for a normal rigid

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.579
calculator. So that if you're, if you're traveling, you can, you can roll, you can roll, look at that!

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.129
You can roll that up like that, right? And you can have that on your person, at, at a moment's notice,

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:49.380
you're like, let's calculate!

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.800
It is flexible. You could sew it into your clothes. Sewables are all the rage. You can put this right into a coat.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.140
Or, if you can't afford an Apple or other smart watch, it actually, the contours, look at that!

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.859
match the arm, and so you could just tape the two ends together there, and you've got a full on calculator-

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.379
bracelet. And what I quite like is on the back, you can see right through there, look at the circ-

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.840
I mean it pleases me immensely.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.340
I mean

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.880
I almost feel a little, little, a little indecent being able to see all the circuitry like, you can see the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.280
connections there when you hit the button. I mean that's oh, that's too much.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.780
Let's just leave that for now.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.940
Scores for the Staples flexible calculator. The display, eight digits. I'm gonna give it a six.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.320
Functionality, it's very down the line. That's a five.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.279
Accuracy, a mere three. Ergonomics,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.100
it's got to be a ten. Cred is flexible, depending on a lot of factors, with this calculator.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.429
So I'm going to give it a six, with a standard deviation of two. And finally, for durability,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.229
That is a ten, for a total score of 40.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.300
Okay, up next we have- oh, thankfully, something to unbox,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.950
a binder calculator.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.500
Wow, as you can see, anything is "better with a binder"!

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.440
It's got a number in the corner. In case you're stuck

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.540
for what number to do a calculation with, they provide you with an example number on the front. That's very nice of them.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.449
And on the back, they remind you, it is better,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.290
it's so better! What percentage could they guarantee your satisfaction with? That would be 100% satisfaction guarantee,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.840
which is there. Doesn't work in any sized bin, which is good to know, unless, unless you give it a hug.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.320
Okay, so what I'm going to do is very carefully cut around the calculator,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.820
[grunting]

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.320
leaving the rest of the box intact.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.380
If anyone collects, for example, Star Wars figures, or like,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:51.060
original baseball cards, this is the traditional way to open them carefully. Let's get the bottom bit off there. Nice.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.660
So now you can display separately the silhouette of where it came from, and now conveniently, this whole thing, just, have like an

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.540
exploded bit in your display case, like that, to illustrate how it all went back together.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.340
Okay, so let's get rid of all that. So, you can see this is not just a calculator. Staples,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.089
you know, they figure this one's rigid, very disappointing, we'll make up for it.

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:19.960
You can measure on one side how long you've been calculating for, and then over here,

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.880
you can attach a variety of calculator bling on this side.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.880
Or put it in a binder.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.800
Let's turn it on for us. Oh here we go, okay.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.760
Look at that, okay. So we're on!

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.860
And you can see, it's a solar panel one.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.819
But we'll just double check. Even if you lose light, you can continue calculating during an eclipse.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:45.049
That's good to know. We've got a square root key, so let's give it a quick square root test. Two, square root, times, two, square root,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.460
equals disappointment.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.420
Okay, let's just test out the number that, the example number, the serving suggestion on the packet there, so

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.020
2, 4, 0, 8, 9.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.980
Yep...

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.620
Okay, there's woefully inadequate instructions for what to do. Oh, actually, I see what they're testing.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.209
This, it actually displays little commas. But unlike, you know, they're not at the bottom, they're at the top, like a little jaunty little

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.209
apostrophe or something. So that once again, Staples,

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.549
innovation in the field of calculators, put the comma at the top. I mean pointless innovation in this case, but, you know,

00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:25.760
they're trying everything. Final scores for the Staples Better Binder calculator.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.940
For display, it's got eight digits, so I would give it a six. But, for innovations in apostrophes,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.940
I'll make that a seven,

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.680
apostrophe.

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:40.840
Functionality, it is a calculator, but it's also got a ruler on one side, you can put it in your ring binder,

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:44.149
I mean, with a ruler I'm gonna have to give it two straight lines, eleven.

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.879
Accuracy, not great, four.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.980
Ergonomics, it's nothing but pointy edges, three.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.300
Cred, I'd give the calculator aspect a five,

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.920
but the fact that it shows you that you keep your calculator locked away in a binder, and not on display,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.560
I think it negates that, zero.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.240
And for durability...

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.840
Okay, that's, that is unfair. I think, I think a five.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.940
And finally at the bottom of the Staples sack, we have, oh my goodness!

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.280
That is a party in calculator form!

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.420
So it's not in a box.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.620
I can't open it up, very sad, but I can turn it on, right? And let's give it a quick test.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:40.900
Let's go with, let's do a divisibility test. So I'm going to do 75, I'm going to divide that by 14,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.680
and I get five and a remainder,

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.140
now I subtract the 5, and then multiply that back up by 14, and I get, aww! four point nine nine nine nine

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.980
nine two. So the storage is not great.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:00.740
And I guess the great thing about this calculator is if you get tired of this, or it starts to cause a seizure,

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.680
you wanna do something else, you can flip it over, on the back, there's a maze! Look at that!

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.920
You got a little ball there. You can try and get that... here we go... I can do this, hang on.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.650
Wait, hang on.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.840
Okay, this maze, harder than it looks. Again Staples. They are all about innovation.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.100
They're not happy to just make a calculator, they gotta put a maze on the back

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.020
for no obvious reason.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.560
I would, I wish I could have seen the meeting. Like, what are we going to put in the back, like a snow globe?

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.220
Or should we have like, a maze! let's put a maze! That'll do it. Unbelievable.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:38.979
Okay, now I'm a little annoyed, I mean Staples, amazing, brand new range of calculators, but they've not given me anything to unbox.

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:42.999
So I'm not taking that lying down. I'm gonna unbox the calculator itself.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.720
And four, okay, and you can see the calculator is still on during all of this.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.600
It is a live dissection. Let's unbox it there! and so, oh okay, so there's the front

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:12.130
transparent part of the calculator. Inside we have, this is where all the disco is kept in a variety of buttons.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:17.640
Here we have the battery and the board. And oh, hang on, does that come out? Oh my goodness. Okay hang on.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.240
There we are! Okay!

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.680
So now I can just solve the maze by picking up the ball and putting it there!

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.240
Scores for the Staples maze calculator.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.460
Display, and I guess in terms of display, it's not just the display, really, it's, I mean the whole thing is on display.

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:36.479
I'm gonna give that a ten.

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:39.099
Functionality, six.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.129
Accuracy, not great, a four.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.950
Ergonomics, it's a little bit

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.300
iPod- iPhone-

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.980
inspired, so I'm gonna give that an eight.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:56.280
Cred, I mean, it's pretty funky. I'm gonna give that an eight. And for durability...

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:05.000
Okay, I don't even know what that's meant to be showing. Okay, I'm gonna give it a, oh, goodness, a three?

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.520
point nine? For a total score of 39.9.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.020
So there you are! The new range of calculators from Staples, who are pushing forward

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.669
the frontier of what's possible in calculators, putting in all new features that

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.730
absolutely nobody has asked for.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.740
Still working.
