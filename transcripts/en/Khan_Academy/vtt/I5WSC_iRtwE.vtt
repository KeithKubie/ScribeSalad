00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.830
- [Instructor] Jude was curious
if the automated machine

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.450
at his restaurant was filling
drinks with the proper amount.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.450
He filled a sample of 20 drinks
to test his null hypothesis,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.550
which is the actual population mean

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.210
for how much drink
there was in the drinks,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.530
per drink is 530 milliliters,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.450
versus his alternative hypothesis is

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.010
that the population mean
is not 530 milliliters,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.830
where mu is the mean filling amount.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.130
The drinks in the sample

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.140
contained a mean amount of 528 milliliters

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.530
with a standard deviation
of four milliliters.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.200
These results produced a test statistic

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.970
of t is equal to negative 2.236

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.720
and a P-value of approximately 0.038.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.650
Assuming the conditions
for inference were met,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.840
what is an appropriate conclusion

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.810
at the alpha equals 0.05

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.880
significance level?

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.020
And they give us some choices here.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.550
And like always, I encourage
you to pause this video

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.160
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.000
All right, so now let's
work through this together.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.420
So let's just remind
ourselves what's going on.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.160
So you have some population of drinks,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.990
and we care about the
true population mean.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.970
You have a null hypothesis around it,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.300
that the true mean is 530 milliliters,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.900
but then there's the
alternative hypothesis

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.910
that it's not 530 milliliters.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.000
So to test your null
hypothesis, you take a sample.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.580
In this case, we had
a sample of 20 drinks.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.820
And using that sample, you
calculate a sample mean,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.680
and then you also calculate
a sample standard deviation.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.850
They tell us these things right over here.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.880
And then using this information

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.870
and actually our sample size,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.520
you are able to calculate a t-statistic.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.350
You're able to calculate a t-statistic.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.400
And then using that t-statistic,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.370
you are able to calculate a P-value.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.000
And the P-value is what is the probability

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.600
of getting a result at least this extreme

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.100
if we assume that the
null hypothesis is true?

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.610
And if that probability

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.740
is lower than our significance level,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.040
then we say, hey, that's
a very low probability.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.700
We are going to reject
our null hypothesis,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.570
which would suggest our alternative.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.320
So the key to this
question is just to compare

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.610
this P-value right over here
to our significance level.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.050
And as we see, the P-value 0.038

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.450
is indeed

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.510
less than 0.05.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.290
And so, because of this,

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.770
we would reject the null hypothesis.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.610
We would reject the null hypothesis,

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.470
which would suggest the alternative,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.960
that the true mean

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.350
is something different
than 530 milliliters.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.860
And so if we look our choices here,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.130
so the first choice says
reject the null hypothesis.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.050
This is strong evidence
that the mean filling amount

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.700
is different than 530 milliliters.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.200
Yeah, that one looks good.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.930
This suggests this is strong evidence,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.260
this suggests the alternative hypothesis,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.900
which is that right over there.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.220
But let's read the other
ones just to make sure

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.053
that they don't make sense.

00:03:14.053 --> 00:03:15.730
So this is rejecting the null hypothesis.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.840
That looks true so far.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.490
This isn't enough evidence to conclude

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.160
that the mean filling amount

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.480
is different than 530 milliliters.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.890
No, not, the first one is
definitely much stronger.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.640
Fail to reject the null hypothesis.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.310
No, we are rejecting the null hypothesis

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.220
'cause our P-value is lower
than our significance level.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.810
Fail to reject, no we'd
rule that one out as well.
