00:00:01.046 --> 00:00:03.336
&gt;&gt;Brittany German: You would be
surprised at the amazing things

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:06.556
that fifth graders can learn that
you would never think was possible.

00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:09.516
They will meet expectations
beyond your wildest dreams.

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:10.436
&gt;&gt;Dr. Dave Miller: So what do you think?

00:00:11.016 --> 00:00:11.506
Questions?

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:12.756
Lots of them, right?

00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:14.096
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:23.766
&gt;&gt;Dr. Dave Miller: So the dimensions from
one point to the next has a number

00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:26.106
of inches or feet and inches.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.926
&gt;&gt;Dr. Dave Miller: So a learning partner is
somebody that brings their own expertise

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:32.936
into the school environment
for the benefit of the kids.

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:35.036
&gt;&gt;Brittany German: Some of our
learning partners come in weekly,

00:00:35.386 --> 00:00:39.026
and they do lessons with the kids,
and experiments and activities.

00:00:39.026 --> 00:00:42.556
They definitely give us
a hands-on experience

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:45.316
that most kids will never
get to be part of.

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:47.536
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, it's pretty cool,
whenever we have him come,

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:50.566
he teaches about like science and stuff,

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:54.236
and he always teaches us something
we never have thought about.

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:55.596
&gt;&gt;Dr. Dave Miller: What else isn't
going to be going

00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:57.566
on at 1:00 a.m. for making a shadow?

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:58.926
&gt;&gt;Students: The sun.

00:00:58.926 --> 00:00:59.196
&gt;&gt;Dr. Dave Miller: Ohhhh!

00:00:59.196 --> 00:01:02.126
&gt;&gt;Brittany German: I think after a
while, we kind of all realized

00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:04.806
that we just really can't
be experts at everything.

00:01:05.026 --> 00:01:09.346
And in order to give the kids what's
best, this is the way we can do it.

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:12.676
&gt;&gt;And flip to the paper
that says "Sundial."

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:15.836
&gt;&gt;Actually Dr. Dave came up
with the idea of the sundial.

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:17.996
And we're like, "Ooh, we could
teach math, we teach angles,

00:01:17.996 --> 00:01:19.216
we could teach protractors."

00:01:19.656 --> 00:01:21.716
And so, of course it became a project.

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:24.746
So Ms. McCauley taught
a lesson on angles.

00:01:24.746 --> 00:01:25.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Forty-five.

00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:28.596
&gt;&gt;Brittany German: And then Dave taught
a lesson on light refraction.

00:01:29.136 --> 00:01:31.986
And then I taught a lesson
on earth rotation.

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:35.256
&gt;&gt;Tre: Well, first we started
learning about seasons and the position

00:01:35.256 --> 00:01:39.496
of the sun, and like, in spring we
learned about how the days are longer,

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:41.666
'cause the tilt of the earth.

00:01:42.086 --> 00:01:44.786
&gt;&gt;Dr. Dave Miller: Because when you're standing here, your shadow's the shortest.

00:01:45.056 --> 00:01:46.406
Summertime shadow's going to be short.

00:01:46.696 --> 00:01:48.786
&gt;&gt;Brittany German: So now we're to
the stage where they're going

00:01:48.786 --> 00:01:51.076
to take all those pieces
and put them together.

00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:56.286
&gt;&gt;Dr. Dave Miller: And we decided this was going to be the center of our sundial.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.976
We found which way was north, then
we found which way was east and west.

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:03.206
So this is how we're
going to make our ellipse.

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:10.156
And now what we're going to do
is put the markers for the hours.

00:02:10.336 --> 00:02:11.886
What's the distance to eight?

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:14.896
&gt;&gt;Student: Four inches and
three-and-seven-eighths.

00:02:15.816 --> 00:02:16.606
&gt;&gt;Dr. Dave Miller: Four feet--

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:19.476
&gt;&gt;Brittany German: So the basically the lesson today, let's try to figure out kind

00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:22.026
of our plan, where we're
going to go from here.

00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:26.266
Do you think that maybe after
we're done designing the sundial

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:29.206
that we would be able to
go out and use a protractor

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:31.716
to find the different
angles between the months?

00:02:32.146 --> 00:02:32.746
&gt;&gt;Dr. Dave Miller: Tell you what we'll do

00:02:32.746 --> 00:02:35.306
that might be real effective
is I have that pivot stick.

00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:36.276
&gt;&gt;Brittany German: Oh, yeah!

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:40.226
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: Learning partners help the kids go much deeper in that content

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.706
than we would ever be able to go.

00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:46.236
&gt;&gt;Sarah Deacon: As a learning partner, I can share personal experiences with them,

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.866
it exposes them to a different delivery
of the curriculum content, really.

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:52.896
We're still covering the
life cycle of a plant,

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:54.786
we're just covering it
in a different way.

00:02:55.906 --> 00:02:56.516
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:58.156 --> 00:03:02.406
&gt;&gt;Carrie Hordubay: The change in my kids from basic understanding of what soil is,

00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:05.076
being able to tell me what
nutrients they think they're missing.

00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:06.786
None of that would have
happened without Sarah.

00:03:06.996 --> 00:03:10.336
She was able to bring us that
information, help us deliver it,

00:03:10.336 --> 00:03:11.826
and help us build these
little scientists.

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:17.296
&gt;&gt;Student: We learned about which
light on plants is the best.

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:18.616
Plus our learning partner, Miss Sarah.

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:23.146
And so far it's been the clear
and the yellow being the best,

00:03:23.146 --> 00:03:26.286
because more light's getting in, so
that's why they're growing better.

00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:31.016
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: Sometimes it becomes sort of a co-teaching, because we have to remember

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:33.266
that these learning partners
aren't necessarily educators.

00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:37.756
So they have all this content
knowledge, but how do you bring it

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:39.476
down to an eight- and
nine-year-old level?

00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:41.556
And that's where our expertise is.

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:42.386
We know kids.

00:03:42.686 --> 00:03:46.296
&gt;&gt;Carrie Hordubay: So if we continue to put 20 in, and we kind of get these results,

00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:47.816
what would be a better thing to do?

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:50.986
&gt;&gt;Student: Maybe ten do twenty?

00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:52.536
&gt;&gt;Carrie Hordubay: It's called increments.

00:03:52.746 --> 00:03:54.396
Where you can do ten and check it out.

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:55.756
&gt;&gt;Sarah Deacon: It's like a partnership.

00:03:56.096 --> 00:04:00.246
And so I might not know how to teach
them in a way that's appropriate

00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:02.936
for their grade level, how
to calculate and average.

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:03.726
But she does.

00:04:04.106 --> 00:04:05.586
&gt;&gt;Carrie Hordubay: A hundred and thirty-five.

00:04:05.586 --> 00:04:07.816
&gt;&gt;Dana McCauley: Learning partners can be developed in two different ways.

00:04:07.876 --> 00:04:12.596
So one way might be because the kids
are expressing an interest in the birds

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:15.816
that they're seeing in the school yard,
and the teacher doesn't know anything

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:18.106
about them, that's when
you turn to the Bird Club.

00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:21.236
It can also happen where
they show up, and they say,

00:04:21.376 --> 00:04:22.516
"Oh, I hear you have gardens!

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:24.086
Would you like help with that?"

00:04:24.686 --> 00:04:27.506
&gt;&gt;Dr. Dave Miller: It sounds a little selfish,
but it's a whole lot of fun for me.

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:28.816
The kids make it fun.

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:29.686
The school makes it easy.

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:33.616
&gt;&gt;Sarah Deacon: This is like the highlight
of my week, when I get to come here,

00:04:33.616 --> 00:04:37.916
'cause I get to just totally geek
out and do really cool science things

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:39.966
with kids, and they're
really excited about it.

00:04:40.616 --> 00:04:43.036
&gt;&gt;Carrie Hordubay: They see her
as really fantastic.

00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:44.336
They see her as incredibly smart.

00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:47.746
That she is a girl, she's a scientist,
and she's doing all these things

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:50.416
that they are liking to do at
school that they think is just fun,

00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:52.396
they see her doing that as a profession.

00:04:52.576 --> 00:04:56.326
&gt;&gt;Tre: They inspire us to
do different things in life.

00:04:56.906 --> 00:04:59.396
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, it's pretty
cool, acting like a scientist

00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:00.456
and being treated like one.

00:05:01.236 --> 00:05:04.476
&gt;&gt;Brittany German: Learning partners enhance the students' learning by millions.

00:05:04.996 --> 00:05:05.986
Double's not enough.

00:05:05.986 --> 00:05:06.636
Millions.
