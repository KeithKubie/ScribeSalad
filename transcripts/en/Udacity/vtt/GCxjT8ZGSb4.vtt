00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.040
We would expect this to have the most extreme intoxicating result. Now why is

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.640
that? Well if we increase the efficiency of GABA to bind alcohol, that

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.500
actually enhances the neurotransmitter pathway causing

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.170
more relaxation, even more reduced reaction times.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.470
The feelings of intoxication, caused by alcohol presence. If we add to that the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.310
decreased metabolism of alcohol. Because the alcohol de-hydrogenates.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.240
Has a much reduced activity. Then we have

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.020
even more alcohol around to bind the more

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.460
efficient GABA. That's why we'd have extreme intoxication.
