Guns are my best friends.

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:05.338
They're cool, they're fun,

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.107
and they've never stabbed me
in the back.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.942
Except for that one
with the bayonet.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:13.579
And for a while, the media was
focused on all the students

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:16.549
and activists
trying to take my friends away.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.351
But the news cycle moves fast.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:20.019
Today, we're talking so much
about Kanye,

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:23.589
I can barely remember how many
houses Sean Hannity has (bleep).

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.792
(laughter)

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:29.295
12, I think... at least.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.864
But even if the media
has moved on,

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:34.067
our guns are still
being threatened.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.269
Don't believe me?
Get a load of this.

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:40.139
MAN:<i> Students across the U.S.
 took to the streets once again</i>

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.175
<i> to protest gun violence
 in this country.</i>

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.110
<i> The National School Walkout
 came</i>

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:47.280
<i> on the 19th anniversary
 of the gun massacre</i>

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.749
<i> at Columbine High School
 in Colorado.</i>

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:51.717
Outrageous!

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.087
How dare these kids walk
out of civics class

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.489
to put what they've learned
into practice?

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.224
(laughter)

00:00:58.257 --> 00:00:59.525
This is America.

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.127
If you want change, save up

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.729
until you can afford a senator,
like everyone else.

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.932
(laughter)

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:09.402
Opposers, we have to defend
our number one amendment:

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.003
the second one.

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.306
That's why, once again,

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:16.075
I want to salute
some of our country's

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.777
"Guardians of the Guns."

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.880
-♪ ♪
-(yelling)

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:23.850
(cheers and applause)

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:29.388
Our first guardian is singer
Alishia Wolcott,

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:32.158
who bravely refused to perform
"The National Anthem"

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.026
at a minor league baseball game

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:38.097
because the stadium wouldn't let
her carry a gun on the field.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.066
And that's a huge sacrifice.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.302
She could have gained<i> dozen</i>
of new fans from that gig.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:45.138
(laughter)

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.574
Besides, baseball needs guns
to stop criminals.

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:51.744
Do you have any idea how many
bases get stolen each year?

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:53.446
(laughter)

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.849
Thousands. They've even
given out awards for it.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.118
In fact...

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:02.555
(voice breaking): I heard of one
man stealing someone's home.

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:04.524
(laughter)

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.829
And don't give me any of this

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:13.299
"You don't need a gun to sing
'The National Anthem'" crap.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:16.536
The song is all about
the right to self-defense.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.639
It's got bombs and rockets
and ramparts...

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.474
whatever those are.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.242
(laughter)

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:25.578
I assume a kind of...
flamethrower.

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.280
I don't know.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.115
Here's what liberals
don't understand.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.684
It's possible to both respect
"The National Anthem,"

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:34.654
and make a peaceful
political statement.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.323
See? No, Chuck, not that one.
Not that one, no, no.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.592
There it is! Yes!

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:43.396
So, Alishia Wolcott, welcome
to "The Guardians of the Gun."

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.097
(gunshot, ricocheting)

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.499
Now...

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:48.601
(cheers and applause)

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:51.671
Every superhero team
has a villain,

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.339
and The Guardians of the Gun
have one

00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:58.010
who is kicking freedom square in
the Dick's... Sporting Goods.

00:02:58.043 --> 00:03:00.479
Following the deadly high school
shooting in Parkland, Florida,

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:02.014
Dick's Sporting Goods announced

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:04.116
it would stop selling
assault-style weapons

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.518
back in February.

00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:08.854
Well, now the chain is
destroying all unsold inventory

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:11.424
across its four distribution
centers nationwide.

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.459
That includes AR-15s

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:16.162
and other military-style,
semi-automatic weapons.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:18.998
Aah!
(crying)

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.300
They're destroying guns!

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:24.203
God, I feel like I'm getting
slapped in the face by Dick's.

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:25.838
I mean...

00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.541
(laughter)

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:32.945
I mean, Dick's used
to be fully engorged with guns.

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:34.614
You know, an upright,

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:36.916
rock-hard defender
of the Second Amendment.

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.285
I used to be completely
satisfied by Dick's.

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:41.153
(laughter)

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:44.156
But after Parkland, the head
of Dick's got very sensitive.

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.158
(laughter)

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:48.294
Almost painfully so.

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:50.696
Now they're pulling out
of assault weapon sales

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.065
and dumping their whole load,
melting the guns down

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:55.801
until all that's left is a hot,
sticky liquid

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:57.169
and a deep sense of shame.

00:03:57.202 --> 00:03:58.638
(laughter)

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:01.674
I know! It's disgusting!

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:03.676
And completely below the belt.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.244
(laughter)

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:07.647
You know what? I'm too upset.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.615
I need, like, ten minutes,

00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:12.818
and then I'll be ready
to go down on Dick's again.

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:16.389
But for now, Dick's,
you're the villain

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:18.557
of the<i> Guardians of the Guns.</i>

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.360
-(bullet ricochets)
-(cheering, applause)

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:23.229
(exhales sharply)

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:26.565
Luckily, some brave fighters
are standing up

00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:28.267
to corporate activism...

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.538
even when the corporate activism
isn't... actually happening.

00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:34.006 line:0%
NEWSWOMAN:
<i> Yeti, the cooler maker,</i>

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.642 line:0%

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:40.513 line:0%

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:44.850

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:46.118
Yes! Yes!

00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:48.154
That's the kind
of level-headed reaction

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:50.856
-I want from gun owners.
-(laughter)

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.726
Violent revenge
on a beer cooler.

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.430
Now, Yeti has called this story
inaccurate, saying that it

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:00.499
"was eliminating a group of
outdated discounting" programs,

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:02.935
and that "the NRA wasn't
specifically targeted."

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:04.870
But that's not
good enough for me.

00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:07.273
Yeti, you need
to take responsibility

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:10.710
for the harm you caused,
just like the NRA would do

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:13.579
if it was ever responsible
for something bad.

00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:16.682
You think just because you
didn't specifically intend

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:19.618
(chuckles): to cause harm,
that you're somehow excused?

00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:21.354
I call BS.

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:24.690
So, lady who's about to blow up
a Yeti cooler with a rifle,

00:05:24.723 --> 00:05:26.926
welcome to
the<i> Guardians of the Guns.</i>

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:30.162
-(bullet ricochets)
-(cheering, applause)

00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:33.299
That food tub you paid $300 for

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:36.035
can't hurt you anymore.

00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:39.238
Opposers, we need to fight to
keep the Second Amendment safe,

00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:40.973
because our guns are endangered.

00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:42.641
They're like chimpanzees,

00:05:42.674 --> 00:05:44.543
but they're
actually worth saving.

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:47.346
(laughter)

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.783
And if we let villains
like Dick's have their way

00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:53.086
with our guns,
we'll all be totally (bleep).
