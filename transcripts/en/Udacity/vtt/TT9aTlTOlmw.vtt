00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now it's time once again for you to show your understanding of this forwards and backwards.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've got a relatively simple grammar up here in the upper left,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but it's a grammar that couldn't be captured by any regular expression so it can't be that bad.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
P goes to open P close or P goes to nothing.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You could imagine drawing the epsilon there.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Our input is the four character string open open close close.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I said before that we'd need to annotate each of our parsing states,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I have eight of them shown here with information about which state they came from,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
what the from position was, what the starting position was.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What I'd like you to do is fill in each one of these blanks

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
with a single number corresponding to the chart position that this state conceptually starts at.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Another way to think about that is let's say that we're in a particular state like this one--

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
P goes to dot open P close.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
How many tokens must there have been beforehand for this to possibly make sense.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We know we're in chart position one, but here it looks as if there's nothing in our past.

00:01:08.000 --> 09:59:59.000
How man hidden things would there have to be in our past for this to work out?
