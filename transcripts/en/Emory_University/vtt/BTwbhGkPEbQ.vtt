00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.600
ECT which is a very viable and beneficial treatment for patients who are psychotic

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:23.360
and are very suicidal, I mean, I think it's well used and and nothing like they portrayed in the movies.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.440
But that is based on a different
science. That is electric shock that is like a hurricane to the entire brain.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.000
It wakes the whole brain up with with this one shock.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.880
TMS is very specific it's targeting an area of the brain about the size of a quarter.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.000
So it's not electricity that's administered its magnetic pulses.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.540
Those magnetic pulses do in fact create a small electrical current.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.420
But not the size of the current that is administered through ECT.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.140
Transcranial magnetic stimulation does
not put wires on your head,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:13.000
a small current is induced in the brain by
electromagnetism and crucially it

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.440
does not as generally used cause seizure.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:27.320
It's a far milder form of stimulation, it's targeted to a specific place in the left front part of the brain.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.100
It is not particularly uncomfortable. It does not alter consciousness,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.840
and when used properly it has almost no side effects.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.700
Crucially it does not require being admitted to a hospital.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.660
Electric shock therapy
for severe untreatable depression is

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.350
still one of the most effective
treatments for anything in medicine.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.720
And it doesn't look at all barbaric now.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.100
The patient receiving it is under anesthesia. It looks like almost nothing is happening.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:20.740
The problem with electric shock therapy is it still has side effects, its still terribly expensive,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.480
and so it is not a perfect solution for vast
numbers of people.
