00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.130
&gt;&gt; Martin Baron: Hello everybody.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.430
My name is Marty Baron.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.160
I'm the executive editor
of the Washington Post.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.330
The Washington Post has
been a charter sponsor

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.070
of the National Book Festival
since beginning and we're happy

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.820
to do it again this year.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.620
The Library of Congress has
been the festival's host

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.570
since the festival
began 16 years ago.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.740
And we want to thank the chairman
of the festival David Rubenstein

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.200
and the many National
Book Festival's sponsors

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.360
who made the event
possible this year.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.100
You can make a donation to this--

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.940
the festival by checking the
information in your program.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.080
There is going to be time for
questions after we're all done

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.460
and this is being filmed as
well so you should know that.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.090
So, to our speaker.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.850
The Washington Post is
gratified to have some

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.230
of the finest national security
reporters in the country.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.360
And a standout among
them is Joby Warrick.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.010
When you read "Black Flags: The
Rise of ISIS", you will see why.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.830
There's Joby's seriousness of
purpose, his relentless reporting

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.010
and impressive sourcing,

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.690
how he embraces nuance while never
losing his way in complexity.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.450
There is his eye for
revelatory detail and his talent

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.220
for commanding your attention

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.230
with the finest techniques
of storytelling.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.430
In fact, this is such a good story
that HBO has a movie in development

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.270
with Bradley Cooper as
the executive producer.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.510
We're hoping it will be made.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.820
This is as the New York Times wrote
in its review, a gripping book

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.030
of novelistic energy and
the most revealing portrait

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.200
yet of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,
founding father of the organization

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.980
that became the Islamic State.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.470
As our country aims to
destroy ISIS and as ISIS seeks

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.410 position:56%
to metastasize beyond Iraq and
Syria, there cannot be a more urgent

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.430 position:56%
and timely treatment of the subject.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.740
As ISIS and terrorism takes center
stage in a presidential race,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.190
this book offers a
refuge in actual facts.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.420
Imagine that.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.120
And in an absorbing history of our
times, and in a sober assessment

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.320
of failures across the political
and governmental landscape.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.550
For good reason, "Black Flags" this
year was awarded the Pulitzer Prize

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.470
in general nonfiction.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.050
The judges described it as a
brilliant and definitive history

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.660 position:56%
that reveals the long arc of today's
most dangerous extremist threat.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.270
All of us at the Post
were enormously proud

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.000
when the Pulitzer board recognized
the excellence of Joby's work.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.690
And it was not, by the way,
the first time they've done so.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.990
The prize for "Black Flags"
is Joby's second Pulitzer.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.700
He previously won in 1996
for a series of articles

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.590
about the environmental costs

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.080 position:56%
of North Carolina's hog farming
industry written with two colleagues

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.800
at the News and Observer
Newspaper in Raleigh.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.100
So you can see his range.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.270
In the two decades since
that book, since that work,

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.670
Joby has been a cherished
colleague at the Post.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.270
He is as soft spoken and
gracious as he is diligent,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.570
determined, and dedicated.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.380
So not just a superb reporter
but also a wonderful human being.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.510
It's a real pleasure and honor
to introduce Joby Warrick.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:45.680
[ Applause ]

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.070
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Well,
Marty, thanks a lot for that.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.720
It is a pleasure to be
with you and it is an honor

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.830
to be introduced by my boss.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.570
I've been at the Post just
as Marty said for 20 years.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.550
I've worked for some legendary
editors from the Bradlees,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.040
of course the Graham family.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.650
And I could tell you
the Post has never been

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.090
in better hands right
than it is right now.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.510
And the fact that we
here in Washington--

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.190
[ Applause ]

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.180
And I know, you know, you must
get mad at us at least once a day.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.940
And I mean, that's
part of our job too.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.900
But the fact that we have a
quality newspaper of the caliber

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.780
of the Washington Post that it
continues to be so ambitious

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.030
and so energetic, and
just so committed

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.050
to its mission is a reflection
of the people at the top.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.230 position:56%
So I feel privileged to work for
Marty and I think you're all be kind

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.750
of grateful to be in a
town and in a country

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.450
that has editors like Marty Baron.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.510
So thank you again for
those words, Marty.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.670
[ Applause ]

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.350
You know, book festivals--
And I've--

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.630
doing my paperback tour
now so I'm used to this

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.040
but they said typically authors
will tell charming anecdotes

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.840
and funny stories and I
wrote a book about ISIS.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.900
So the material doesn't really lend
itself to funny, witty stories.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.230
But the topic is important
and I think you all know that

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.980
and perhaps it's why you're here.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.010
And so you know, when I
do travel to a country,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.440
people are confused
about this organization.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.140
They are afraid and of
course they're afraid.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.690
I think our political leaders are
very confused right now just based

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.540
on the rhetoric on
the campaign trail.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.560
So, really my purpose in doing
this book was to bring clarity

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.900
and that's what I think that I--

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.890
That's my special gift
as a journalist,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.380
is I try to help take
complicated stories

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.100
and make people understand
what they're really about.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.860
So that was what I tried to do here
in the book and it's what I'm going

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.630
to try to do very briefly today.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.640
I'm going to show some
pictures, we're going to start

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.480
with a little video photo montage
which is essentially boiling

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.360
down the history of
ISIS to three minutes.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.030
So this is kind of a summary, after
this is over, we're going to talk

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.130
about some characters behind ISIS

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.020
but this is my little
video introduction.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.280
It's a-- It's ISIS so it's
dark, it's not the Goth Channel

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.080
but it's a-- but it's not that
you haven't seen before I think.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.240
So this is our little preview
of our discussion today.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.510
I hope you can all
read the subtitles.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:16.280
So, my book "Black Flags" as I try
to explain is a story of origins.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.800
It's a character sketch digging

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.670
into the histories of
the men behind ISIS.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.620
And I'm going to talk about five
personalities very briefly today

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.960
starting with Zarqawi, the man
who's probably the most important

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.050
and most innovative terrorist
personality the last two decades,

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.250
second only to Osama bin Laden.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.960
And continuing on to some other
individuals who may not be

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.430 position:56%
as familiar to us but important to
understanding what we're up against.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.070
So we start with Zarqawi,
the godfather or the founder

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.830
because he really pioneered almost
all the tactics we see ISIS using

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.670
today including the
beheadings of young men

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.290
in orange jumpsuits splashed
all over the internet.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.780
He was an original
and dispensable force.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.030
ISIS literally could
not exist without him.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.490
And in a strange way as you'll see,

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.650
Zarqawi could not have
existed without us.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.560
So let's understand him as
a way to get into our topic.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.250
Every terrorist starts out life
as a kid, a cute little kid.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.730
And here he is in 1968 with
his mom in Amman, Jordan.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.680
And the thing is he
wasn't a cute kid,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.420
he was a bad seed from
the very beginning.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.350
He was in constant trouble from
the time of middle school onward,

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.820
not just Tom Sawyer mischief
but cutting kids with razors,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.890
using drugs, he drank, he was a
violent vicious youth absolutely

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.190
headed for trouble.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.590
And by the time he was a teenager,
he was a high school dropout,

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.550
he had tattoos, anything
but a religious guy,

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:35.850
extensive criminal record.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.600
Then he gets a bit of
a religious conviction

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.180
and then even more importantly like
many other young in his region,

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.190
he decides in the late
1990s to go fight jihad,

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.460 position:56%
and that means going to Afghanistan.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.080
And this is really the cradle
of the modern Jihadist movement,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.230
this is where we get
Al-Qaeda and so many

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.210
of the groups we're
familiar with today.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.990
Well, he goes to Afghanistan,
he fails even there

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.210
because he arrives too
late to fight the Soviets.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.510
They've already gone home.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.610
But he joins the Arab army, he gets
involved in the civil war there

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.130
and then this violent young
man discovers surprisingly

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.600
that he's really good at one
thing, which is killing people.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.040
He's a ferocious fighter and his
religious fervor is being pumped

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.750
up because he's learning at
the feet of a new generation,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.430
the likes of Osama bin
Laden and his lieutenants.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.050
Then the war ends for
him and he's back home.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.750
And if you think about
the experience of a lot

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.800
of our returning veterans,
it's pretty much that way

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.380
for Zarqawi and his friends.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.680
They don't have anything to do.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.590 position:56%
They want to try to keep this fervor
going and so they start to look

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.430
for ways to build their
own jihadist cell.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.730
And so they're looking around.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.030
What are they going to
do in peaceful Jordan?

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.240
Well, they start attacking
symbols of western corruption.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.020
They go after bars and
liquor stores to get the idea

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.150 position:56%
of attacking pornographic theaters
and this is a great moment for them.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.000
They send a guy into
a porno house in Amman

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.980
with a bomb to blow the place up.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.510
The kid goes in and gets
engrossed in the movie.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.220
He forgets all about the bomb
which then blows up at his feet.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.550
He loses both his legs
and nobody else gets hurt.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.560
But these are kinds of knuckleheads
that we're dealing with here

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.010
in the late-- in the early 1990s.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.800
Well, the Jordanians obviously
get tired of these guys.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.050
This is a, you know,
it's a problem for them.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.350
So they lock a bunch of them up.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.650
They lock up Zarqawi.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.570
They lock up a lot of his
followers and these guys, you know,

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.650
who went off to war at
Afghanistan are trying

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.130
to be contained and
corralled in prison.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.800
But in jail, they end up being
kind of corralled together

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.410
because the Jordanians
are afraid if they were

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.860 position:56%
with the general population,
they'll start to infect other people

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.470
so they're off by themselves,
about 50 of them in one cell.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.630
And this becomes kind
of the jihadi university

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.150
where they sort of
egg each other on.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.450
They share ideology.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.750
They talk about tactics.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.920
It turns out to be not a very good
thing and now at this environment,

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.970
Zarqawi emerges as a very
charismatic and capable leader.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.020
Well here's where Zarqawi gets
a couple of incredible breaks.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.100
He's supposed to be sentenced
in prison for 15 years, so 2009.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.670
He spent all those years in jail.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.150
We never would have heard of him.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.520
But in 1999, something happens.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:02.160
The King of Jordan dies and there's
a tradition of amnesty in Jordan.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.300
If a king dies then
there's a general amnesty

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.600
for political prisoners.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.170
So parliament comes up with a
list of people to be pardoned.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.770
You know, the tribes come up with
their own list and then, you know,

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.900
about 2000 people end up getting
freed and among them is Zarqawi

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.910
and his entire band of followers
and out they go in 1999,

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.600
10 years ahead of schedule.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.720
So as Zarqawi goes off to the
place that he loves the most,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.860
which is Afghanistan,
and tries to unite

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.360
with Osama bin Laden, his hero.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.850
Well, it turns out that bin Laden
wants nothing to do with him

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.760
because even for bin Laden,
even for the mastermind of 9/11,

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.150
this young kid, this hothead who
doesn't know much about Islam,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.640
he doesn't really-- He's
not very smart it seems.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.940
He's very violent.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.240
He's very crude.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.850
He's too bad even for Al-Qaeda.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.150
So they reject him.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.450
They kick him out.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.870
They sent him off to the
other end of Afghanistan

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.340
to start his own little thing.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.710
So off he goes and once again,
if he had stayed out there,

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.950
we never would have heard
of Zarqawi ever again.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.140
But then a second miracle
happens for Zarqawi.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.260
In February 2003, the United States
is getting ready to invade Iraq

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.920
and we're trying to make our case
to the UN and to other people

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.600
around the world about
why we want to do this.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.900
We offered two reasons.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.200
One is weapons of mass destruction.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.500
We all know how that went.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.190
The other was the possibility
that Al-Qaeda could collaborate

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.470
with these terrible Iraqi
dictator, Saddam Hussein.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.880
If there's some kind of
collusion between the two,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.480
they can be even more dangerous.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.400
So this is the pitch
we make to the UN.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.980
Well, when Colin Powell is making
his speech, he's talking about this

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.530
and who does he cite as the
prime example of this problem

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.110
but our friend Zarqawi at
the top of the list there.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.350 position:56%
Zarqawi just based on circumstantial
evidence seems to be the right guy.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.680
He's in Iraq at the time.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.570
He's living in the border
area between Iraq and Iran.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.140
He's had contact with Al-Qaeda in
the past so he seems like this kind

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.930
of perfect poster child for this
problem that the US is describing.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.250
And so, this is the
case that's made.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.430
It turns out that entirely untrue.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.600
There was no truth to his
connection to Al-Qaeda.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.900
He wasn't in Al-Qaeda.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.900
He wasn't certainly working
with Saddam Hussein's government

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.300
but that one poster made
him a celebrity overnight.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.420
So suddenly he's receiving
arms, sort of money and support,

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.210
recruits from all around the world.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.340 position:56%
He becomes sort of overnight
celebrity in the jihadist community.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.620
He has his vision that he's
going to fight a superpower.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.150
He thinks it's going
to be United States.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.450
It's going to be in Iraq.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.260
So he moves himself to
Baghdad in 2003 to wait

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.110
for the Americans to arrive.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.640
So when he gets there, he
starts to build alliances.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.590
Here's this crazy guy that wants
to start a terrorist movement.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.290
Suddenly, he's got
all kinds of allies

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.340
because the Iraqi army has been
disbanded, all those colonels

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.930
and generals and majors
don't have jobs anymore

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.440
so they're looking to fight back.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.740
You've got the Ba'athist Party.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.810
Everybody who is a professional
in Iraq was a Ba'athist.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.000
Suddenly all those people
are looking for leadership

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.750
and Zarqawi moves into that
fact and he becomes the nucleus

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.910
for this new insurgency that we
began to see unfolding in 2003.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.100
He's got a good head for
strategy and he starts going

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.530
out after some very
important targets.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.300
He goes after the UN headquarters.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.270
He kills the leader of
the UN mission in Iraq.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.350
He goes after NGOs, the Red
Cross, all kinds of groups

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.650
that would help the United States,

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.820
who would give us the cover
legitimacy, drives them home.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:05.640
And then, more importantly,

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.590
he goes after the Sunni-Shia
divide in this country.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:13.050 position:56%
Sunnis and Shiites have been living
together reasonably well for decades

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.830
but Zarqawi decides very
deliberately to start a Civil War.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.760
So he blows up their
most important mosque.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.000
He kills their leaders and suddenly
you have appraisal killings you've

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.320
got essentially shooting back
and forth between two groups

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.550
that had gotten along
pretty good together.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.750
So strategically, you think about
what he did, it was pretty smart.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.580
He isolated us in Iraq then he
sets off a civil war around us

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.920
and we're-- By 2004, 2005, we're
in pretty bad shape in terms

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.200
of our occupation and
our plans for Iraq.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.320
So, the next thing that happened,
this is kind of background noise

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.760
for Zarqawi because he's
got bigger ambitions.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.230
He wants to become an
international star.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.890
He feels he has a destiny.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.990
And so he develops this notion that
no matter what kind of bombing,

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.770
what kind of shooting
you might be able to do,

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.360
there's nothing that's
more gripping,

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.600
that's more so viscerally horrible
than watching a single execution.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.070
So he grabs a random
American off the street,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.490
this is a kid named Nick
Berg from Philadelphia.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.240
He takes him into his cell.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.440
He sits him down with
an orange jumpsuit,

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.170
the image we were also familiar
with and he personally--

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.060
that's Zarqawi reading
the script there.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.940
He personally beheads this
young man with his own hand.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.370
This becomes his calling card.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.360
Many beheadings will follow.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.560
The violence that Zarqawi
unleashes just tears up the country

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.330 position:56%
and it's too much even for Al-Qaeda.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.050
And so that's not the
only difference.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.950
Zarqawi begins to launch a new
media campaign with himself

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:36.250
at the center using social media
platforms just becoming available.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.900 position:56%
So he got the gray-bearded Osama bin
Laden, you know, reading his sermons

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.230
from behind a, you know,
a podium, very boring,

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.990
and then you've got this
jihadist action figure,

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.130
like a black ninja
firing his machine gun,

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.320
killing Americans with
his own hands.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.870
Young jihadists around
the world eat this up.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.250
And then he's brash enough to make
up his own rules because remember,

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.260
he's not even a high
school graduate.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.010
He's not very smart but he
does understand theology

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.880
and that's liberating to him
because he doesn't bother to worry

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.020
about whether he is committing
acts that aren't very Islamic,

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.810 position:56%
like targeting innocent Muslim women
and children and suicide attacks.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.210
Then he begins to think about a
really big idea which is the idea

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.230
of restoring the ancient caliphate,

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.830
the Islamic theocratic
empire of the centuries past.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.560
He regards himself as divinely
inspired to usher in this new age

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.200
of ultra pure Islam, driving
out western governments along

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.270
with brutally destroying everyone
else that stands in his way,

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.290
from corrupt governments to
apostate sex like the Shiites.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.170
And this struggle would end in a
mighty battle, in an Armageddon,

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.630
in which armies of Islam would
finally defeat the armies

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.080
of Christianity as some
prophets have foretold.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.380
This was going to be
Zarqawi's role of history.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.370
"I am the spark," he used to say.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.840
Well, he didn't get to see
any of it because Zarqawi was

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.170
by now republic enemy number one.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.660
We poured vast resources
into this effort to stop him.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.990
It took us nearly three years to
track him down but eventually,

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:05.400 position:56%
our Intel, our ground forces special
operation teams found a formula

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.340
for defeating Zarqawi
and his network.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:08.840
We find his safe house.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.320
In 2006, we drop a
couple of bombs on it

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.230
and that's the end
of Zarqawi himself.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.640
We start dismantling the
leadership, killing number twos

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.870
and number threes,
raiding safe houses.

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.930
And just as we're figuring
all this out,

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.840
other things happened
that are helping us.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.670
The Iraqi Sunni tribes revolt
against Zarqawi's followers

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.570
and we have this thing
called the "Anbar Awakening".

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:29.320
The US troops search happens.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.730
And by 2009, all that's left
was just a few hundred followers

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.960
who have been driven deep
underground in hiding.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.020
Al-Qaeda in Iraq was
essentially beaten,

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.190
but not everybody thought so.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.130
Here's our second ISIS personality.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.640
We now know him as
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.600
He's the leader of ISIS today.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.440
In Zarqawi's time, nobody would
have pictured him as a leader.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.610
He was in many ways
Zarqawi's opposite, a scholar,

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.460
kind of shy, kind of boring.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.120
His family and friends remember
him as this kid that never spoke

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.610
to anyone, carried books around his
bicycle, wasn't very impressive.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:04.300
He has a doctor degree
in Islamic law,

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.530
his own track to becoming
a college professor

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.420
when the US invasion
takes place in 2003.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.810
Baghdadi joins Zarqawi's
gang because he feels obliged

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.870
as a good Muslim to
fight the infidel.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.750 position:56%
So he becomes part of this movement.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.240 position:56%
He ends up going to jail for awhile.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.310
Once again, he has the
prison experience exposed

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.460
to these tough guys around him.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.180 position:56%
And-- but-- then he gets-- he starts
to rise up to the ranks mostly

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:30.310
because other leaders around
him by 2010 are getting killed.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.570
And so in 2010, the leaders
of this battered organization,

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.190
mostly former Iraqi army
officers by this time,

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.990
decide they need a
different kind of figurehead.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.810
And so they pick this guy Baghdadi.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.110
He's an Islamic scholar.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.070
He happens to be from a tribe
that can trace his lineage back

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.140
to Muhammad, so he has serious
religious credentials to serve

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.930
as the head of the group that's
no longer calling itself Al-Qaeda

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.230
in Iraq.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.180
It started to call itself a
state, the Islamic state of Iraq.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.700
The state part is kind of a
joke because even to these guys,

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.330
they know there's no real state.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.210
One of the leaders [inaudible]
reacts famously to this new name

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.720
with derision, "Where is the
state you're talking about?

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.300
We're leaving in a desert."

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:12.940
But history intervenes
again in ISIS's favor.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.400
Just as Baghdadi is coming to
power, US troops are leaving Iraq

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.770
under agreement structure
in the Bush administration.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.710
And as soon as they're gone, the
Shiite government feels emboldened

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.450
to start settling old
scores with Sunni tribes,

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.450
arresting their leaders,
kicking out Sunni army officers.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.310
And so much of the Sunni
population begins to rebel

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.300
against the Baghdadi government,
finding more interest in common

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.670
with Zarqawi's people, with ISIS,
then with their own government.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.930
And then a year later,
the Civil War breaks

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.120
out in Syria as we all well know.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.000
And this is a pivotal moment
because it's an opportunity

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.040
for these guys to start
something new.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.170
They start their own
militia group inside Syria.

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.500
They have a perfect incubator
now with a lawless state washed

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.700
in violence and weapons,
and they have a new cause,

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.980
fighting an oppressive dictator,
Assad, a man who's stirring

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.020
up passions all over
the Islamic world

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:05.620
by slaughtering Sunni
Arab civilians.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.040
They renamed themselves yet again
and now they're Islamic state

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.540
of Iraq and al-Sham or ISIS and
they're extraordinarily accessible

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.040
and almost immediately because
they're battle-hardened,

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.540
they're the best fighters in
the rebel side and they start

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.010
to attract foreign
recruits by the thousands.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.740
By 2014, they're ready to break out
and they do so in dramatic fashion,

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.670
capturing the eastern half
of Syria then invading Iraq

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.340
to declare the establishment
of this Islamic caliphate.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.410
By the summer of 2014, they're
a powerhouse, 30,000 strong,

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.870
able to conquer major Iraqi
cities, overrun entire divisions

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.640
of US trained Iraqi troops.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.450
This is the ISIS we're
so familiar with today.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.240
And they're also very rich
because after capturing Mosul,

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.090
they said they have
become the wealthiest

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.050
and best armed terrorist
group of all time.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.350
They own oil wells.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.850
They own banks, universities,
hundreds of millions

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.340
of dollars in hard currency.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.880
These are resources the Al-Qaeda
would have only dreamed of having.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.670
And-- but really, beyond
their wealth,

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.930
it's Zarqawi's old organization.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.270
Zarqawi embraced violence
for its own sake.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.120
These guys do the same
thing on a grander scale.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.630
They also have this boldness

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.500
to reinterpret Islam in
any way they want to.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.550
As-- Baghdadi is a religious
scholar so he goes out of his way

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.580
to create theological arguments to
justify whatever atrocity they do.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.660
There's always a verse in the Quran
or a tradition in the hadith text

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.120
that can be made to justify--

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:30.350
make themselves appear to be pious
Muslims instead of just barbarians.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.290
And just as Zarqawi understood
that the horror can be amplified

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.310
on a massive scale using the
internet, ISIS did the same

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:37.780
and just got better at it.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.390 position:56%
They're extremely skilled in
harnessing the power of social media

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.560
for recruitment, for screening,
for indoctrination, for training,

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.860
all of which can be done

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.920
at a distance before the recruit
even sets foot in Syrian soil.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.260
But now instead of the shaky
handheld videos that Zarqawi used

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.480
to use, they have teams of
professional, videographers,

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.670 position:56%
editors, graphic artists, working on
products aimed at young men who grew

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:03.380
up on army like video
games, like Call of Duty.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.820
This formula works and the idea of
ISIS becomes a powerful attraction.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.670
Thirty-five thousand foreigners
travel to the caliphate

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.830
to join this army, far surpassing
the number of foreign fighters

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:18.170 position:56%
who joined Al-Qaeda and
Afghanistan or Zarqawi's Iraqi army.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.880
The movement metastasizes.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.230
In a year, there are nine mini
states of ISIS around the world

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:27.690
in cells and dozens of places
including about 5000 ISIS recruits

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.130
from Europe alone,
which brings us quickly

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.680
to our next personality
that defines ISIS today.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.440
You may not recognize
his name or image

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.970
but you'll remember what he did.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:40.320
This is Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who's
a 28-year-old Belgian national

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.680
who led the terrorist attack

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.050
in Paris last November
that killed 130 people.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.040
His background is actually very
close to this typical prototype

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.380
of Northern Europeans who joined
ISIS, the son of Muslim immigrants

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.650
from North Africa, so
a second generation,

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.730
a troubled youth well-known
to police.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:00.010
He lived in Islam made up of
middle class Muslim immigrants.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.990
He's a kid that truly didn't
fit in in his society of--

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.220
he's not really a religious Muslim.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.120
He's not really a modern citizen
of his family's adopted country.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.200
He ends up being radicalized in
prison and when he joins ISIS,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.800
he suddenly has two things he never
had before, a sense of belonging

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.850
and a cause, something that allows
this misbehaved misfit to feel

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.850
as though his life
counts for something.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.680
He travels to Syria and
initially he's a bit distressed

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.980
by the bloodshed.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.280
A few months later, he's
fully with the program.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:33.570
He's posting videos of himself
dragging corpses behind cars.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:35.890
He becomes a key coordinator
for the ISIS attack

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.690
in Paris as we all well remember.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.360
It was the biggest and-- his
biggest and final assignment.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.300
The two things we have to
remember about him when we think

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.880
about the story is, one, he's
emblematic of a population

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.880
that is particularly
vulnerable to ISIS's message,

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.910
nearly always second
generation, children of immigrants

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:57.330
who feel conflicted about their
identities and not well-integrated

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.630
in their societies,
struggling personally,

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.320
don't seem to have a sense
of purpose or future.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.440
They're looking for
meaning and for adventure

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.820
and ISIS offers all
those things for them.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.790
The second key thing, a
primary reason ISIS carries

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.080
out attacks abroad is it
wants young men like Abaaoud

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.080
to feel even more alienated.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.130
The more countries feel threatened
by ISIS, the greater the tendency

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.790
to crack down on young Muslims,
to profile them, to harass them,

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.670
to make them feel even
more alienated.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:24.970
How do we know this?

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.190
ISIS talks about it
in its own literature.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.220
Just before the Paris
attack last November,

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.430
ISIS's English language magazine
puts out an article that talks

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.460
about the gray zone in Europe.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.000
This is the zone where
millions of Muslims inhabit.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.680
They feel conflicted about
their identity and ISIS wants

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.450
to force them to choose sides.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.360
The article says this, "Muslims

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.180
in the west will quickly find
themselves between two choices,

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:52.170 position:56%
either they apostatize and adopt the
infidel religion or they immigrate

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.860
to the Islamic state
and escape prosecution."

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.210
This is a binary choice for
ISIS and it welcomes our help

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.230
in driving Muslims to their corner.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.600
For us in the west, the
solutions that seem easiest

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.070
and most politically
palpable are often the ones

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.460
that get us in a deeper hole.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.940
Real quickly, the fourth
ISIS personality to talk

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.390
about was never really
a member of ISIS.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.540
Yet we all associate Omar
Mateen with the Islamic state.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.770
This is the young man who
walked into the Pulse Nightclub

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.250
in Orlando last June
and killed 49 people

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.360
in the worst mass shooting
in US history.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.600
Mateen told police
he did it for ISIS.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.440
Today, there's no evidence that
he had any contact with ISIS

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.950
in a serious way and in fact,

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:33.260 position:56%
his statement suggest a very limited
grasp of ISIS's belief and ideology

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.770
and yet, ISIS gets credit
for the attack anyway

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:39.190
and it becomes a talking point
in our political discourse.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.930
Here's what's interesting again
to me about Mateen's story.

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.970
It's another young man
who fits the profile

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:47.720
of a typical Northern
European ISIS recruit,

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.370
the son of Muslim immigrant,
second generation again.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.480
A young man in his 20s
with a troubled background,

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.430
unable to find personal success
in his life and feeling excluded

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.640
and persecuted by the
dominant culture.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.980
So he embraces an extremist
ideology as a way

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.020
to feel empowered and important.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.220
Even more striking to me is that
Mateen fits another profile,

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.240
that of the typical perpetrator of
an American mass shooting event.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.870
There's an interesting
piece actually

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.760
in today's Washington Post
that makes this point.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.580
It notes that "Islamic extremist
like Mateen share many of these--

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.170
the same traits as regular mass
killers, if we can call them that.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.110
Almost all our young
men who struggle to fit

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:25.690 position:56%
in their communities, they feel
alienated and persecuted in some way

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:29.440
and they also have a boastfulness
and a craving for attention."

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.680
It's the same profile for
example as Dylann Roof,

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.500
the young man from South
Carolina who shot up a church

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.400
in South Carolina in Charleston
and killed nine people.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.910
One expert in the article
makes his observation.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:42.950
Omar Mateen has more in
common with Dylann Roof

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.750
than he does with Osama bin Laden.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.890
ISIS just offers certain young
men a different kind of excuse

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.360
for carrying out their
revenge fantasies.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.540
This is pretty dark stuff and
it's pretty depressing so I do

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.590
like to always include the fact
there are reasons to be hopeful

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.010
about our fight right now.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.020
If you follow the news, you
know the caliphate is really

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.860
from a series of attacks.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:04.970
They're losing ground about half
of what was once ISIS a territory

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.230
in Iraq is now liberated.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:11.080 position:56%
Liberating Iraq means fewer
resources for ISIS, fewer oil cells,

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.790
fewer towns and villages
they can exploit for cash.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:16.770
So you see here in this map that
the size of caliphate is shrinking.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:21.370
The area in green was once
controlled by ISIS, now it's not.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.760
They're faltering in
the public relations war

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.280
because people see the brutality.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.580
They see the hypocrisy.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.910
And even young Arab
Muslims, their core audience,

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.340
are starting to turn away.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.940
This is a look at British
Muslims who turns out.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.230
So you see just in a year's time,
support or opposition rather

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:41.020
to ISIS drop from or
[inaudible] from about 65% to 85%.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.310
It's somewhat disturbing as the
fact that this kind of small group

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:50.580
of people who embrace the ideology
of ISIS has remained pretty static.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.400
Other good news, we have
more and more seeing Muslim,

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.000
other Muslim countries, Muslim
Arabs taking on a greater share

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.660
of the fight for participation
of the Arab campaign to boots

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.240
on the ground and this
makes them going slower

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.300
but it's usually important
because Arab boots

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.130
in the ground are vastly preferable
to an occupation and invasion

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.530
by outside forces for all
kinds of obvious reasons.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.000
And it's also encouraging.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.770
We're seeing more Muslims
take a public stand

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:16.910
against this extremist ideology.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.960
One of the world's great religions
is being attacked from within

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.800
and only other Muslims have
the standing to be able

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.790
to defeat the virulence that has
affected so many young people.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:29.470 position:56%
We see the King of Jordan, Abdullah,
organizing an effort by hundreds

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:33.510
of Muslim clerics from all sects to
denounce extremist interpretation.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:37.300
Egypt's President Sisi here goes
to the top of theological seminary

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.140
in Cairo to call for an Islamic
reformation, saying to his leaders,

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.990 position:56%
"We have to take back our religion."

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.710
It's a hopeful start but we need
to see a lot more than this.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:51.100
And finally, despite the good
news on it from the front lines,

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.280
I can't be optimistic about
defeating this ideology

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.670
in the near term and here is why.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.470
I introduce my fifth
and final personality.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.610
I won't use his real name but we'll
call him Ahmad [assumed spelling].

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:02.910
He's seven years old.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.250
We met him in a refugee
camp in Germany.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.970
He was one of thousands of young
children who had lived under ISIS

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:09.870
in towns and villages
of the caliphate.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.720
He's a bright, beautiful
young boy who happened to live

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.690
in the Syrian city of
Raqqah when ISIS took over.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.930 position:56%
Within months, he was in the ISIS
trading camp, getting indoctrinated,

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.390
learning how to use a gun.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.620
He was taught that his
parents were not good Muslims

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.200
and he should report
any bad behavior

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.790
at home that wasn't Islamic.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.880
He was taught that the
greatest possible calling

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.050
for young men his age was
to be a suicide bomber.

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.580
Ahmad talked to us about
witnessing executions.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.010
He talked to us about going to a
local park and finding the bodies

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:40.190
of men with their severed
heads stacked up next to them.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.200 position:56%
Every now and then during this
interview, he would shutdown and ask

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.320
for some time-out and at one point,
he asks us for a piece of paper

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.380
so he could draw a
picture of Syria, his home.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.680
This is what he drew.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:56.110 position:56%
He was telling us a story about
something he'd personally witnessed.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:00.040
A man with one eye on the
right side was a prisoner

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.950
who was brought into
the town square.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.030
The man on the left has a
knife and he beheads him.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:10.750 position:56%
And then below, you see the one-eyed
man's head lying on the floor.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.890
We worry in this country
about ISIS recruits,

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:15.840
about people being radicalized on
the internet or traveling to Iraq

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.020
or Syria to fight but we're
facing entirely different problem

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.040
with the generation of young people
who grew up under this terror.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.000
I bring this up because when
the caliphate does collapse--

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.270
and I think we're beginning
to see the end of it--

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.290
westerners cannot afford
to look away.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.980
We can't declare victory and
go home because the seeds

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.790
of countless tragedies
are still out there now.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:38.120 position:56%
Who's going to provide psychological
counseling for these young Ahmad?

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.160
Who's going to rebuild
his city and his school?

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.750
Who's going to rebuild the
economy and offer hope for a job

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.550
and a family someday in the future?

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.880
It's overwhelming to think
about the size of this task

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.510
but it's what is important
not just for moral reasons

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:50.940
but because of our own security.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.950
Because if we don't find a
way to address this problem,

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.910
you can be assured that we'll
be hearing from Ahmad or boys

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:58.710
and girls like him in the future.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:01.850
You can be confident that the kind
of extremism and the brutality

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.670
that we've witnessed in the
last two years will come back

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.670
to us again and again.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:07.970
Thank you for your time.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.770
I'm happy to take a few questions.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:19.920
[ Applause ]

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.860
We've got microphones.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.190
All right, we'll start over here.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.660
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you for your talk.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.960
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Thank you.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.260
&gt;&gt; While depressing,
really interesting.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.560
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Thanks.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; About like several months ago,
John Kerry declared ISIS is having--

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.730
committed acts of genocide and I'm
wondering what your take on that is

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.030
because I think it's interesting

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.480
that a terrorist group
have been designated that.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.530
I don't believe another group has.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:47.480
So what the challenges does United
States has and other groups have--

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.460
other countries have
in tackling a group

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.910
that is a terrorist group
having also committed--

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.210
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.510
&gt;&gt; -- human rights atrocities.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.810
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.110
That's a really good question
and it was an unusual move.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.410
You're right.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:00.710
It's not simply typically
deal with terrorist groups.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.010
We've never declared
Al-Qaeda to be--

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.610
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: --
guilty of genocide.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:05.910
But in the case of ISIS,
it's a label that fits.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:07.210
You see what's going on in the area

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:09.740
and there is a systematic
destruction of cultures

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.590
in our communities and societies.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:15.430
It's not going to deter ISIS that
we declare them to be, you know,

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:19.650 position:56%
perpetrators of genocide but I think
just as it's an act of a community

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.420
of nations including our
Muslim allies and friends

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.510
in the region just to call
this what it is and try

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.240
to hold them accountable
in some sort

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.390
of global way I think is a
powerful message and it just--

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.640
it's something we need to do as
opposed to something that will help

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.480
in some, you know, practical way

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.640
but I think it's really
important and interesting stuff.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.940
Thank you.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.240
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.540
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Let's-- over here.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.000
&gt;&gt; I noticed in the maps
you showed that it seems

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.090
as though ISIS hasn't
made it to Morocco.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.390
Why is that?

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:49.690
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: To where?

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:50.990
&gt;&gt; Morocco.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:52.290
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Morocco.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.590
Yeah. You know, some
countries like Morocco,

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.890
like Jordan too I think
is they have a problem.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.730
They know they have local
cells and they deal with them.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:04.220 position:56%
Sometimes it's serious problems but
so far there hasn't been any ability

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.850
of these groups to organize in
serious way that we're aware of.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:09.490
And I think it's partly
reflective of the--

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.200
some security culture
in those countries.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.780
The Moroccans, the
Jordanians are really,

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.150
really good at their
internal security.

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.950
They're good at knowing
what people are doing.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.920
But also just may be
an unknown factor.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.440
I mean, every few months we see
some, you know, some disruption

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.400
of a plot in Jordan or in Morocco.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.060
So they're definitely there, they
just don't seem to have the grip

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.650
that they do in some of
these other countries.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.700
Good question.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.510
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if
you could talk a bit more

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.630
about the financials of ISIS.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:38.020
So they have access to all-- a lot
of natural resources and capital

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:41.950
but how are they actually able
to turn that into cash and to--

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.450 position:56%
like, who do they purchase from or--

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:44.750
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.050
&gt;&gt; -- how does all that work?

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.350
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: That's
a good question.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.650
Interesting about ISIS is they're
much more self-sufficient in terms

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.660
of their funding than most of other
terrorist groups we've looked at.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.400
In the very beginning,
they may have benefited

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.530
from groups throughout
the Arabs and the Gulf.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:57.990
More recently, they're been
just using what's available

00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:59.290
to them locally.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.880
They're very good at finding oil,
selling it on the black market

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.540
and they've got partners even
in places like Turkey and Syria,

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.010
countries that are officially in
war with them but they managed

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.510
to do this black market trade.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.080
They shake down local populations.

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.140
They've been doing that
since Zarqawi's time.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.730
You know, taxing local civilians,
you know, collecting fines

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.550
for just almost any offense
you can imagine is a--

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:21.650
can be a fine that
gets collected by ISIS.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:25.580
But more recently, because of their
successes in taking over territory,

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:29.010
they also have big
assets like bank vaults.

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:30.990
In Mosul what I said they have--

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:35.300
they were able to accommodate
something like $500 million

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.020
in hard currency, Euros, dollars.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.180
And so essentially it's
a cash economy anyway

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:42.300
and suddenly they've gotten more
cash than they can possibly spend.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.760
And to give you perspective, you
know, what they need obviously,

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.060
they need to pay their soldiers.

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.360
They need to do various things.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.250
But to carry out terrorist
attacks abroad doesn't really cost

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.050
that much as ISIS does it.

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.670
The estimate for the
cost start to finish

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.640
for the Paris attack is
somewhere around $10,000

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.670
because they got well more enough
than to carry out attacks and that

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.400
for years to come, unfortunately.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.700
Thank you.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.000
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joby, I have a sort of a personal
question but before that, you--

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.370 position:56%
when you went to the slide, you
pointed out a lot of the individuals

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:18.270
who are just angry and, you know,
they just wanted explosives.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:20.820 position:56%
They just wanted to be in the press.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:26.020
OK. Now, the people said, the
fellow who had dropped the--

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:29.160
let the bombs in New York were
not related to any of these

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.670
but he was that kind of person.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.970
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:36.360
&gt;&gt; And so maybe this could
propagate a lot encouraging.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.510
Now the personal question
is, are you concerned

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:45.650
that some crazy guy is going to
come to the Washington Post Office

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:50.530
and either you look at your
book as a history of ISIS

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:53.210
so they want to show it around or--

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:54.510
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.020
&gt;&gt; -- they think, "Wow, this is a
great way of getting into the press

00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.450
by destroying the person
who wrote the book?"

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.750
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: No.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.050
Well, it's a good question
and it's not something

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.350
that we blithely dismiss.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:08.360
You know, I've lived in
the suburbs with a family

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.150
so you do think about
things like that.

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:13.380
You know, Marty is a pretty big
guy so I think it's nice to work

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.390
in a pretty secure office where
we feel like nobody is going

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:17.730
to easily come in at least--

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:20.330
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: --
and do harm to us.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:21.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:22.930
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: My-- The one thing
and maybe this is sort of vain

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:27.550 position:56%
or are just, you know, overly
optimistic but I always assume that,

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.980
hey, they like publicity
in some bizarre way,

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.810
and secondly there is many more
important attractive targets

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:35.280
than a journalist from
the Washington Post.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.370
So I do-- very, very careful when
I'm going to travel to the region--

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:39.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:40.970
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: -- and otherwise,
I just try to keep my eyes open

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:45.270 position:56%
and then do take sort of a casual
review of the line of people waiting

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.540
to get their book signed and make
sure nobody is carrying anything

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.840
that looks--

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.440
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: -- that
looks like a weapon but yeah,

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.740
it's just not an idle thought.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.040
Thank you for the question.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But again,
looking at your book,

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.640
it's the history of the program.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.080
So people in ISIS can
show it around to people--

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.380
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.680
&gt;&gt; -- because you've
documented their heroes.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah, that is true.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.460
And the book, because of the
Pulitzer, it's coming out in a lot

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.780
of languages including Arabic.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.780
So that's something I think about.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.160
Thank you.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.570
&gt;&gt; I want to ask a
question as a journalist

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.630
who really admires what you do and
really appreciates the craft and--

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.930
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Thank you.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.650
&gt;&gt; -- believe that your book
ranks with "The Looming Towers",

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:23.290
an outstanding piece of
nonfiction narrative.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.960
And it's a craft question,
how did you--

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.060
it sounds like you stored it

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:33.570 position:56%
with some intelligence agents
presumably off the record in Jordan.

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:34.870
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:36.170
&gt;&gt; That's my guess.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.670
You don't have to describe your
sources, but how did you, A,

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:41.600
get access to them and
then B, get them to open up

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.550
and then widen your net to
people had been inside the ISIS

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:47.950
organization where it's--

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.250
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:50.550
&gt;&gt; -- an astounding
piece of reporting?

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.850
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Well, I
appreciate that and I thank you

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:54.640
for the reference to Lawrence
Wright's book which is he is one

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.830
of my heroes and if I-- I'm

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.050
in the same sentence
with him, I'm flattered.

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.350
So I appreciate that.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:01.650
It is a difficult challenge.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:03.620
A part of what I think
held me was the fact

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.140 position:56%
that I've been doing this for-- at
the Washington Post for a long time.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.530
So for a while, over time,
you build up relationships

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.330
with intelligence people and
that's-- it's not a hard--

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.540
that's not an easy thing to
develop and not just, you know,

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.630
in this country with our agencies
but the ones overseas who's going

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:18.720 position:56%
to travel to the region quite a bit.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:25.640 position:56%
I ended up getting remarkably strong
responses when I approach people

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.980
in these governments about
telling the Zarqawi story,

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.280
telling the background of ISIS

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.020
because this is an
important subject for them.

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.460
They feel like it needs
to be understood and some

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.790
of these particular
individuals were some to have--

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:38.650
I used their [inaudible]
names, their Arab names

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.040
but not their real names
for obvious reasons.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.920
But once they got into it, they
were just thrilled to talk to me

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.090 position:56%
and I had, you know, hours and hours
and hours of conversation with guys

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:50.590
who had never spoken to
another reporter but they just--

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.480
were just blown away by getting
a chance to share their knowledge

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.490
and to tell stories that were so
meaningful and important to them.

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:00.630
And because, I guess one
of my gifts as a journalist

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.570
if I have some is just
that I'm approachable

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:06.210
and I don't have an agenda
and I just want to know

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.710
and I think I come across that way.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:11.320
And if you just really want
to know the facts, you know,

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.990
people can be surprisingly
cooperative in that regard.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.540
So I think I just gotten
lucky there.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:16.840
But--

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.140
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you very much.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.440
One quick follow-up.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.740
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Sure.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.040
&gt;&gt; Did the king of
Jordan cooperative

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.340
with you in one way or another?

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:24.640
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Is he watching?

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.430
I have to say, this
is my second book

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:30.170
and the first one was also
had a Jordanian theme.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.150
And one of the readers
of the book and someone

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:35.050
who admired it was
the king of Jordan.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.230
He actually read the book
and he commented on it.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:40.010
And, so I felt a little bit more
emboldened when it was the time

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.770
to write this book to ask him
and his government, you know,

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:44.070
I'm going to tell a story.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.890
It's very personal to Jordan.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:49.270
Extremely helpful and I just, you
know, at that, it's always better

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.870
than having a door slammed in your
face to have doors open for you.

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.170
It's like--

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:54.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it helps that the
king of Jordan is cooperating.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.340
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: He kind of
pulled some strings over there.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.640
So--

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.940
&gt;&gt; But thank you so much.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.240
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Thank you.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.540
&gt;&gt; It's really a masterpiece--

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.840
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: I
enjoyed your question.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.140
&gt;&gt; -- that will last for ages.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.440
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Thank you.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.740
&gt;&gt; It's astounding.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:08.040
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: How are we doing?

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.340
Well, we got a few minutes?

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.640
OK, three minutes but two
quick questions and I'm sorry,

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:11.940
we'll have to take
them later afterward.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.240
&gt;&gt; This will be quick.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.540
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Sure.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.840
&gt;&gt; Can you get to explain the
point of terminology, please?

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.140
You speak of ISIS.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.440
I heard some officials including
the president speak of ISIL.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:19.740
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.800
&gt;&gt; And then in addition, I've
heard others used the term dash.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.100
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.400
&gt;&gt; Could you explain
those three, please?

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.700
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.000
If I could get away with using
dash and people knew what I meant

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.650
and I was not just
talking about Morse code

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:30.430
or something, they--
I would use that.

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.620
And the reason is, it
really all boils down to--

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:36.430
an attempt to transliterate Arabic,
which doesn't always happen easily.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.360
So what ISIS calls itself is
now just the Islamic State

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.960
but it's the Islamic
State of Iraq and al-Sham.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.080
It sounds like an S for the
second S in the abbreviation,

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.360
which might be Syria, but
it's not really Syria.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.620
Sham is this big region,
essentially ignoring history

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.190
of the last century, ignoring
countries that were created

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:57.020
like Syria, Jordan and Israel
that didn't exist 110 years ago,

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:01.740
and just lumping it together in
this ancient place called Sham.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.030
And so when you hear ISIS,
people are saying Sham.

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.190
If you're ISIL people
are saying Levant

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:10.220
which is essentially the English
term that translates to al-Sham.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.520
And so that's people call it ISIL.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:13.440
So I'm not trying to be
clever or cute or trying

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.740
to be politically correct.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.100
It's really just a struggle
to figure out a proper way

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.870
to transliterate the words.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:20.170
But, thank you for that.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:21.470
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:22.770
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Let's do one more.

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:24.070
&gt;&gt; Hello, sir.

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:25.370
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Hi.

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:27.690
&gt;&gt; My question is, what role if
any do you feel that our media

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:31.730
and in Europe play in creating an
atmosphere that makes it easier

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.920 position:56%
for groups like ISIS to recruit in--

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.220
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:40.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; -- places like, you know, Orlando
where, you know, that man was--

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.620
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: Yeah.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.440
&gt;&gt; -- very familiar with ISIS and
Western Europe and Northern Europe?

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.800
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: That's a good
question and it's something

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.630
that we wrestle with
at the Washington Post

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.130
and on up to Marty's level.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:51.420
It's-- We do take very
seriously the fact

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:55.910 position:56%
that our words sometimes can agitate
and excite as well as inform.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.560
And so we do try to be restrained.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.630
I mean, there's all kinds of,
like, we're having a discussion

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:03.130 position:56%
about an article we're trying to put
together now that involves videos.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:04.530
How much do you show?

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.040
We need to show enough to be able

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.210
to help people understand the
situation, not enough to be kind

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:13.070 position:56%
of gratuitously, you know,
pruriently, you know, obscene really

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.370
with the level of violence.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:17.810
But what I do feel now that we
have an important role to play

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:21.810
and it's this, ISIS is being--

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:23.960
They're losing ground
at propaganda war

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.850
because people are understanding
now what they're really about.

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:29.900
They might see these slick videos
that you get on the internet

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.340 position:56%
but the people coming out of Raqqah,

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:34.580
the people who are fleeing
those countries had been abused

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.890
and just see these
people as barbarians

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:38.530
who are anything but Islamic.

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:41.810
The more we can tell those
stories and set people straight

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:45.620
about what ISIS is really about
destroy their own mythology.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.930
I think that's a great
contribution to their defeat

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:49.530
and I don't mind saying that.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:50.830
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:52.130
&gt;&gt; Joby Warrick: I'm sorry
we didn't get everybody,

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.010
do you want to get this last one or
two or should we just call it up?

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.310
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:58.770
OK. So we're going to
pull the [inaudible].

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:00.670
But I encourage you
guys to come and find me

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.660
and I'm happy to talk
to both of you.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.960
Thank you so much for your time.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.260
It's an honor to speak with you.
