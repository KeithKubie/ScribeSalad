00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.050
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.220
So let's start again.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.370
So Alex is in this room to
talk with us about GAE

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.710
Simpleauth, the library he has
been doing to [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.910
App Engine.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.950
So first, Alex, can you
tell me a little

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.700
bit more about you.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.190
Who are you?

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.010
Where are you based?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.020
What are you working on?

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.350
ALEX VAGIN: All right.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.480
So I'm Alex Vagin.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.830
I worked at the University of
Trento for several years,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.420
managing internal infrastructure
and developing

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.950
in-house applications.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.710
And just recently, I left that
job to work on my own startup

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.090
with a couple of other guys.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.510
And we call it Cloudware.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.910
So the University of Trento--

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.990
so this is where I've been
living for the past 10 years.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.380
Though I'm not Italian.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.890
I was born in Ukraine.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.525
And I still have Ukrainian
citizenship.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.560
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.880
So you are a Ukrainian based
in Italy who works on

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.560
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.445
a startup.

00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:23.380
And so when you start
using App Engine?

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.355
And what are you using
App Engine for now?

00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:35.490
ALEX VAGIN: So I did have a look
at it when you guys just

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.160
announced it--

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.540
I think it was in 2008.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.640
But at the time, I didn't have
really time to start

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.300
playing with it.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.570
So I kept watching it.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.440
And I think it was a year after,
I started using it for

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.990
real, writing some
applications.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.640
Well, a couple of applications
that are are still running.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.940
One of the applications
that I liked it a lot.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.230
It was my last project while
I was working at the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.060
University of Trento.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.810
And it was a website for a local
event that's was called

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.350
[? ICD Days. ?]

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.840
And so it wasn't just
the website.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.980
It had a few registration
forms.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.550
And it also had N RSVP
thing for the PhD.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.885
And it also had an admin
part, like a little

00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:45.250
CMS or whatever system.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.400
And all of those registration
data--

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.780
they were being synchronized
with Google Spreadsheets in

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.580
the background.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.250
And the funny thing is all of
this stuff up until today,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.680
this website is running
on a free app quota.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.870
And it was kind of funny.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.440
Because the day before the event
really even started, I

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.150
was watching the free
instance average

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.750
quota going like crazy.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.070
So I did some calculations
beforehand, kind of

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.320
approximating.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.500
So I was 75% sure it shouldn't
be going over quota.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.200
But I did have my mouse button
on the Enable Bidding button.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.240
But I just wanted to experiment
and see if I could

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.030
really manage to run on
a free app quota.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.950
And it did.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.510
It went--

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.510
I don't know--

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.490
98%.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.790
But it stayed there.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.260
MALE SPEAKER: And did you use
some tricks in order to

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.950
diminish your instantiate
usage?

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.790
Or did you rely more
on caching?

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.650
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.579
So we basically started
from scratch.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.220
And at the beginning, I was
using NDB and just [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.310
with Data Store directly.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:33.510
But then as the traffic was
increasing, I realized that I

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.020
should add some caching
and stuff.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.240
And so I did.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.400
And yeah.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.990
It did decrease the
instance service.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.125
And what's probably the most
piece of instance hours that

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:54.080
was taken away, it was by these
background processes

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.960
that were calling spreadsheet
API's.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.680
Because it's an external API.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.660
So it takes much more time
to interact with.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.470
So what I found out is
that I moved that

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.520
part to the back end.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.430
And that was awesome.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.640
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.370
for back end.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.170
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.440
Exactly.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.950
There was one day I realized,
wow, I ought

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.500
to have a back end.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.230
So why wouldn't I move
it to the back end?

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.910
MALE SPEAKER: And I always have
a lot of people who are

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.490
doing that.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.907
Because that's a really
convenient way to scale back

00:05:33.907 --> 00:05:35.060
on [? test. ?]

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.300
That's just an external
[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.150
But you should definitely target
all your [? SQ ?] work

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.942
if you have the free app
to the back end.

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:43.840
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, yeah,
definitely yeah.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.580
And I think I don't know.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.260
I mean, I can only speculate.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:57.620
But it really felt like when
I moved this external API

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.290
calling to the back
end or you can

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.580
different version or whatever--

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.890
so the average of the response
time or latency--

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.130
it was kind of like the maximum
and the minimum--

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.130
they were reduced, right?

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:25.000
So I think it really helped the
scheduler not to launch

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.210
the many instances or stay
up to the right job.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.260
MALE SPEAKER: It depends
on the configuration

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.460
of your back end.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.640
But basically the [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.845
for back end is much more
simpler since you get to

00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:38.623
control the number of instances
that are running at

00:06:38.623 --> 00:06:39.690
a moment of time.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.380
And so [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.376
schedular to take for scheduling
things on back end

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:46.170
is much more simpler.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.480
And plus since it's
not [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.250
with user traffic, the scheduler
can already predict

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.400
what will happen.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.690
Because basically all this back
end what will it receive

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.620
is internal [? code ?]

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.950
from task queues.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.130
And if it's not a [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.150
back end, it's easier for one
to do the scheduling.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.600
ALEX VAGIN: Exactly.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.480
Yeah.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.450
That's what it felt like.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.530
When I moved the not user facing
requests to the back

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.880
end, this is what actually
happened.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.280
So the whole response
time for users--

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.170
it suddenly decreased.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.491
And it was pretty fast.

00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:35.250
MALE SPEAKER: When [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.800
test queue what happened is that
your test queue traffic

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.080
is competing with your
user traffic.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.000
And the scheduler will always
[? route ?] to privileged user

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.020
traffic first.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.580
So when you are on the
back end you are not

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.554
competing with anyone.

00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:50.956
ALEX VAGIN: Right.

00:07:50.956 --> 00:07:52.460
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.810
MALE SPEAKER: Your observation
was right.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.180
ALEX VAGIN: So yeah.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.180
I was pretty happy about that.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.520
Yeah.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:06.190
So basically it ran on 24 hours,
3/4, for front end, and

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.650
8 hours of back end.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.620
So that was awesome, yeah.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.690
I do have a couple of other
business-wise websites.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.500
One is--

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.030
it's a website for a
local restaurant.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.930
But it's not just
static pages.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.929
They offer online orders.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:42.049
And the owner of the restaurant,
I built for them

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:47.020
this admin interface where they
can add dishes and stuff

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.960
and prices.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.090
They also accept payments
with credit cards.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.980
And it's all running
on App Engine.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.880
And this app was running--

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.900
I think today it's 12
months, one year.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.280
And it was like the best
experience I ever had.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.715
Because even in the worst days
when App Engine [INAUDIBLE] on

00:09:11.715 --> 00:09:15.590
the infrastructure had some
maybe bad days or something, I

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.670
never had problem with
this website.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.536
It was great.

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:23.690
AMY: And your company
just launched

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.660
something, didn't you?

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.000
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:37.200
And so the biggest project
is yet to come--

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.310
so the thing that we launched
is the startup.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.630
It's an app.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.880
It's software as a service.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.190
We call it PhD Hub.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.420
So it basically helps--

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.270
there's a PhD school.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.540
And there's administrative
stuff.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.470
And from my previous experience
working at the

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.790
University, I found a real
need for some kind of

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:14.280
management software or service
that would help the secretary

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.600
and administrative staff
organize all the students,

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.050
professors, grades,
or whatever.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:28.440
And the thing is, I started
running this app

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.970
maybe a year ago.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:40.930
And at the time, when I started,
I didn't have Python

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:44.930
runtime or Java on the
infrastructure where I was

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:45.870
running it.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.580
So initially I wrote it
in Ruby on Rails.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:02.380
And then in these few months,
I actually started rewriting

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.920
it in Python.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.670
So we're slowly moving
to App Engine.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:14.550
But this app, I think it's going
to be a huge win for us.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:20.370
Because right now I still manage
this internal service

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.460
where this app is running.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.380
This one, we actually offer
it for many, many

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.420
universities right now.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.140
So we do expect a lot
of traffic on it.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:32.640
MALE SPEAKER: I was
going to ask.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.840
ALEX VAGIN: So we'll
be moving it on App

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.510
Engine for sure, yeah.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.940
It's just not that
simple case.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:47.240
There's many, many lines of
code already written.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.760
But I do have already
some admin parts

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.130
running on App Engine.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.990
And so we're basically calling
this Rails app through API,

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:01.160
extending JSON data.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.200
MALE SPEAKER: How would you
authenticate the code between

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.290
your App Engine app
and your regs app?

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.720
ALEX VAGIN: Sorry?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.310
MALE SPEAKER: How would you
authorize a code between your

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.420
regs app and your--?

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.670
ALEX VAGIN: Oh, right.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:20.070
What I did--

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.090
but it's kind of secret.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.960
But what it is--

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.920
I created a huge token.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.090
I just didn't have time.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.180
I created this huge
secret token.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:39.210
And I basically put this
token into a header.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:45.040
And this is how the Rails app
knows that this is kind of an

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.960
App Engine app.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.360
And the interface
on App Engine--

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.900
I started using End
Points API.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.740
I just got an invite.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.980
So it's pretty cool.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.920
MALE SPEAKER: But you
will be able to make

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.170
that more secure now.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.842
ALEX VAGIN: Exactly.

00:13:06.842 --> 00:13:07.148
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:13:07.148 --> 00:13:10.810
So I have a few more questions,
if you don't mind.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.380
So I would like to know what
is, in your opinion, the

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.830
greatest strength
of App Engine?

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:22.260
Like as a startup developer,
what motivates your decision

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.150
to go on App Engine or
to go somewhere else?

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.000
And if you have any suggestions
about how we

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.400
should improve the App Engine
developer experience or more

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.050
specific to request.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:36.580
ALEX VAGIN: Well for
that I have a list.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.500
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.310
ALEX VAGIN: No, just kidding.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:44.000
Well besides that, it
really auto-scales.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.530
I think it was at the beginning
was the first thing

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:54.260
that I kind of noticed
that stood out

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.810
of all of the features.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:06.770
And what I also like is that
there are so many services

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:13.320
around this platform, the user
services, whatever, a lot of

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.990
pipelining, a lot
of frameworks or

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.140
libraries around that.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.090
So you basically can do
whatever you want.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:34.600
But I remember back in 2009 or
8, what really impressed me is

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.180
when I started reading docs
about App Engine.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.750
And I eventually got to this
task queue and [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.130
jobs.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:51.310
And what I saw there is when you
actually create this task

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:57.380
queue or cron jobs
it call your URL.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.780
And before that--

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.650
so basically before the App
Engine, what I was doing

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.910
usually is that I would have a
cron jobs on Linux server.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:12.260
Or I could have ready server.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.910
And I could have background
processes.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:18.860
But still, they would execute.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.330
I would still need to launch
some of these background

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.070
process instances.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.450
And when I saw this, and
I was like, whoa.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.700
So everything could be a URL.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.980
So you can call you
application,

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.300
even for cron jobs.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.220
That was awesome.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.160
I really liked that.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.020
I was interested.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:41.212
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:15:41.212 --> 00:15:42.050
So model of App Engine
is really

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.990
based on URL and requests.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.900
And those can be a very short
request for front end or much

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.930
more request for test
queue on back end.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.920
But I also like that the
[INAUDIBLE] is web based and

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.130
more HTTP based.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.140
In the sense that everything
in App

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.740
Engine is an HTTP request.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.410
And sometimes I think it was
difficult for people coming

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.640
from, for example, an RGS
background to easily

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.770
translate to that.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.575
Because first, it's much more
like they have a process that

00:16:10.575 --> 00:16:11.930
is spreading.

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.055
And these process has
dedicated memory.

00:16:15.055 --> 00:16:17.710
And it's processing
a lot of requests.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:23.550
But they don't think about
everything as an HTTP request.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.340
They don't think about chunking
that processing into

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.730
an HTTP request.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.900
I think that's a
big difference.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.030
And that's one of the challenges
of adoption for App

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.470
Engine as well.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.735
People are used to resident
process and resident memory.

00:16:35.735 --> 00:16:36.660
And they come to App Engine.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.750
And then their quota systems
[? start ?] and stop.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.090
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:40.275
Right.

00:16:40.275 --> 00:16:41.200
Right.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:49.100
But when I realized this, it
simplified things so much.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:53.930
I was so happy that I could--

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.640
MALE SPEAKER: It's a really
easy model to put

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.610
your head around it.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:57.250
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.050
MALE SPEAKER: Like
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:59.050 --> 00:16:59.136
AMY: Yeah.

00:16:59.136 --> 00:17:01.680
When I first learned App Engine,
task queues were my

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.850
favorite thing too.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.100
It's so powerful, yeah.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:07.020
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.780
is there any project
that you are not

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:10.900
choosing App Engine for?

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.150
Is there [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.950
you [INAUDIBLE] and
you say, OK.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:16.700
I can't do that on App Engine.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.875
I will just use a dedicated
server?

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:24.730
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:33.860
Well from my experience, today,
off the top of my head,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.920
there is one thing that
I still can't

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.920
figure out how to do.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:48.650
So it actually started when
I got my laptop broken.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.590
And I had a couple of last
days' work on it.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.350
And I couldn't get to it.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:04.070
And I was thinking, well,
couldn't I just all do it on

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.940
the web, just programming?

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.000
So you have Chromebooks,
right?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.500
So you have Google
Docs, right?

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.430
Whatever happens to your
hardware, it doesn't matter.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.410
So I was thinking, well,
wouldn't it be great.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:23.730
So what it is, I created this
just simple app where I could

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.860
edit the code with a browser.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.590
I think I used CodeMirror
library.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.340
But the thing that I wanted--

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.360
because I would be missing
that a lot--

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.430
is I also need to run tests.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:48.390
And I also need to run
development depth server on my

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.080
localhost or whatever it is.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.370
So for that, I think
I've made some--

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:55.310
I don't know.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:19:05.440
I think Compute Engine would
be right for this thing.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.620
MALE SPEAKER: You can just
use [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.210
ALEX VAGIN: Oh yeah.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.070
MALE SPEAKER: Like if you had
paging app, where you have

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:11.270
your [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.940
that is sending some Python
code into some data store

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.480
[? entities ?]

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.915
and executing on the fly, this
is the kind of setup that you

00:19:20.915 --> 00:19:23.690
have to have some kind
of online [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.060
experience.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:32.200
You can have a special version
for editing and then just more

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.814
stuff to a different version
once you want to [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:35.814 --> 00:19:36.252
ALEX VAGIN: Right, right.

00:19:36.252 --> 00:19:38.430
Yeah.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.065
That's my point.

00:19:39.065 --> 00:19:39.560
Yeah.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.950
MALE SPEAKER: But that's only
possible for Python, though.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:43.200
Because [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.190
conduit for [INAUDIBLE]
or Java.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:54.340
But there is someone on the
development team that has made

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.730
an experiment where he has been
able to run App [? CAG ?]

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.010
on App Engine.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.256
ALEX VAGIN: Cool.

00:20:01.256 --> 00:20:02.100
Oh, wow.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.280
MALE SPEAKER: Which
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.266
So it's Daniel on the
[INAUDIBLE] team who has

00:20:07.266 --> 00:20:11.912
manged to deploy an App Engine
app from App Engine.

00:20:11.912 --> 00:20:12.360
ALEX VAGIN: Whoa, whoa.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.704
Yeah.

00:20:13.704 --> 00:20:14.160
That's awesome.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.350
Yeah.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.820
MALE SPEAKER: It's
very, very nice.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.300
And another way to do it
is that you could also

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:19.595
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:19.595 --> 00:20:21.360
Google Drive for that.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.690
So you could have your
App Engine app.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.140
Instead of providing
an [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.836
that is inside the app, you
could have the app fetch a

00:20:30.836 --> 00:20:36.280
file on Google Drive
and execute it.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.420
AMY: I just pasted into
this chat window.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:49.470
There's an interesting blog post
that just came out that

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:56.000
this lets you run tests and then
deploy from, say, your

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.600
github repo.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.510
MALE SPEAKER: And there is also
an online meter called

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:05.310
Code [INAUDIBLE] that allows you
to deploy to App Engine on

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.750
their platform and from there.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.760
I think you're right.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.820
There is not only one solution
for doing this.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.680
And there is a lot of different
approach and

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.040
different acts that try to
achieve the same thing.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.290
But hopefully, I hope that they
will converge [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.610
into the more [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.340
solutions, so people could just
[INAUDIBLE] in the cloud

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.290
instead of--

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.230
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.450
Yeah.

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.260
That would be awesome.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.460
Yeah.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.400
MALE SPEAKER: And do you have
any other suggestions for

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.530
improving App Engine [INAUDIBLE]
experience, or a

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.490
more specific future request,
your [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:36.000
your [INAUDIBLE] list?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.910
AMY: What are the things
that are painful?

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:41.320
We want to hear them.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.570
ALEX VAGIN: No.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.210
I knew you'd ask me this.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.760
So I prepared beforehand.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:22:03.645
What I want to say, first off,
is recently you guys are doing

00:22:03.645 --> 00:22:10.400
an awesome job at supporting
folks even on the forum.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.550
I see replies flying all the
time, like almost to any post

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.340
on the forum.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.590
I think it was one of
the missing things,

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.110
like to just support.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:29.480
But really, yeah.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.730
It's great.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:40.190
Well, about the features, the
one thing that I remember is

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:47.140
at some point there was a
monitoring API for apps

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.130
running on App Engine.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:52.020
And I think it kind of
stuck at some point.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.940
And I know you guys are probably
working on some

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.450
improvements to that.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:03.076
And well, there's
just this thing.

00:23:03.076 --> 00:23:03.500
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.620
I think that Amy knows
more about this.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.700
Because she's based in Sydney,
where the original team was

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.660
working on it.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.110
I think that they have got
some feedback from the

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.150
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.600
And they have got a
lot of feedback.

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.200
And they are trying to move
the project in a different

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.910
direction based on
this feedback.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.880
But maybe Amy has
more insight.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.100
AMY: No.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.460
That's a good summary of it.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:36.660
ALEX VAGIN: And then this
is actually, I've been

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.910
thinking a lot about.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:44.240
This is actually kind of
related to the simple

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.060
authentication.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.380
It's about the users API.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:57.730
So right now, users API-- they
support four things.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.740
You guys support Google
accounts, right?

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.290
So it's, I think,
Google accounts.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:09.745
Or I could also do OpenID
authentication.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:17.410
But the thing is, I'm not even
sure if it's a good idea.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.770
But like the way
OpenID works--

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:24.500
so I could authenticate
any user with the

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.135
external OpenID provider.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.770
I think it would be nice to be
able to do the same thing, but

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:39.520
not only using OpenID but OAuth2
or any other kind of

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.930
authentication.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:41.050
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.200
I totally agree with that.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.355
And so there is something really
frustrating when you

00:24:45.355 --> 00:24:48.300
are using OAuth on App Engine
right now is that if you want

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:53.170
to have user SO authentication
and authorization with OAuth2

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:56.040
at the same times, basically,
you have to [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.890
So when the [INAUDIBLE] login
serves the App Engine requires

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.960
permission using Google
authorization, a mechanism to

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.090
share his email address
with the

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.110
applications, that's one screen.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:11.170
And then, when you want to get
permission for Google Drive or

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.720
Spreadsheet API or Google
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.750
API, [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.590
run screen for this
permission.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:21.120
And currently, the only way mix
the two is to ditch the

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.280
standard authentication from App
Engine, and instead rely

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.500
on the user scope like you do
in Simpleauth in order to

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.660
authenticate the user.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.240
And so then you can finally
request [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.760
You can say I want the email
address using the user

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.520
[INAUDIBLE].

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.380
And I also want to be able to
read his Drive [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.995
And I would really like if there
was a building way with

00:25:46.995 --> 00:25:55.980
the user API to do basically
what you are doing now for

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.190
authentication using the user
API, but using the auth scope

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:03.090
user info and plus request an
additional set of scopes.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:09.038
So you can reduce the ground
screen to only one.

00:26:09.038 --> 00:26:09.860
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.315
Yeah.

00:26:10.315 --> 00:26:11.225
Exactly that, yeah.

00:26:11.225 --> 00:26:14.000
MALE SPEAKER: But I think you
did a very good job with

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:14.766
Simpleauth.

00:26:14.766 --> 00:26:17.600
We can talk more about it later
on that kind of provide

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.250
the same solution with
the user [? end ?].

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.970
But it's a good inspiration
for the team to be able to

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:23.800
[? transfer ?]

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.835
that and offer that
as an active API.

00:26:27.835 --> 00:26:28.120
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.860
Great, yeah.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:30.110
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:33.330
So I would like to continue
with more questions.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:34.870
I think we still
have some time.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.870
So I would like to know more
about what your day to day App

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.910
Engine development looks
like, like what

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.010
editor you are using.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.600
Are you using an ID?

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.770
Which language do you target--

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.030
Python, Java, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.280
And if you have a favorite App
Engine framework library or

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.910
[? tool? ?]

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.720
ALEX VAGIN: So actually
I like experimenting

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.870
with different IDs.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.810
So I tried like a couple
of dozen of them.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:09.010
But I used to use TextMate
all the time.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.870
But then recently, I switched
to Sublime Text.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.120
AMY: Me too.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:24.530
ALEX VAGIN: But like I said
before, the best thing would

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:29.880
be if I had some web ID where I
could do all the same things

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:36.150
that I do on my [? common ?]
line terminal and Sublime.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:40.400
But today I'm using
Sublime Text.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:45.680
So I'm mostly using Python.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.640
And I do experiment a lot
with Go these days.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:57.400
And I was just reading recent
updates on Gorilla Web.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.180
I think probably you were
working on that

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.780
with Rodrigo maybe.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.030
MALE SPEAKER: I know
of just one thing.

00:28:05.524 --> 00:28:06.830
But [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.460
to Go library was Go Auth2.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.596
So you might be interested
by it too.

00:28:11.596 --> 00:28:13.420
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.270
MALE SPEAKER: But [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.230
Go Auth2--

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.640
I mean it's a nice library,
does the job.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.000
But I think that there is some
room from improvement to make

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.010
it work better with
App Engine.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:26.960
Especially, there is not a good
story yet for selling a

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.950
token to the [INAUDIBLE]
store.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:35.020
You can go it by hand, but it
would be nice if there was an

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.200
integrated way to save
tokens [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.412
always goes to.

00:28:39.412 --> 00:28:40.340
ALEX VAGIN: Right,
right, right.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.470
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
what [? Rodriguez ?]

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:42.520
has done with Gorilla.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.690
And it's very nice.

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:44.680
I really like the [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.640
architecture, in the sense that
you can [? attack ?] any

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.980
part of it within the dragging
the [INAUDIBLE] thing.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.250
So I like the component approach
that shows instead of

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.710
a big full stack framework.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:00.134
He has this set of components
that you can use.

00:29:00.134 --> 00:29:07.140
He's been also very active on
making the templates Go

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.350
support and [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.500
Because that's something
that's it's

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.260
really attached to.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:14.250
And the story from
Go templates--

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.300
you can code [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.580
templates from other templates.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.660
And you can [INAUDIBLE]
a composition.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.106
But you still have to wire all
the templates together in your

00:29:22.106 --> 00:29:24.010
code and that's something
that we're [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:24.990
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:28.146
So he is actively working
on this too.

00:29:28.146 --> 00:29:28.590
ALEX VAGIN: Right.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.970
Cool.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:30.770
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.430
MALE SPEAKER: I like the
Go runtime a lot.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:34.425
I don't know if you've
compared the

00:29:34.425 --> 00:29:35.970
performance with Python.

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.590
But it's really interesting.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:42.970
And also what I think about
the Go runtime is that it

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:48.770
gives you basically the same
interaction process that you

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:51.185
have when you are developing
Python, but just safer with

00:29:51.185 --> 00:29:54.640
type and compiling Go.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.703
What I like is that usually when
my Go app is compiling, I

00:29:58.703 --> 00:29:59.900
know that it will work.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.330
Whereas when I develop some
Python app, I still have to go

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:04.840
into each [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.550
code path to just know that I
did not make a syntax error.

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.800
ALEX VAGIN: Right,
right, right.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.630
I was impressed when--

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.970
Oh, sorry.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.400
Amy?

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:16.820
AMY: Oh no.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.870
I was just going to say we were
thinking of having some

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.350
more Hangouts featuring Go.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.595
So it sounds like you would
be in favor of that.

00:30:24.595 --> 00:30:25.020
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.770
Yeah, definitely.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:26.790
Yeah, yeah.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:27.040
AMY: Sorry.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:27.980
Go ahead.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.120
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah.

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:36.220
I was impressed when I did try
Real Web and Go itself.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:43.440
What I was impressed with--
the first thing, I wrote

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:43.880
Simple app.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.880
And I launched in.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.650
And it was super fast.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.830
And it was like whoa.

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.220
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.930
I like the fact that Go, with
just using the storage QP

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:01.650
package, if you are not using
any of the Google App Engine

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:05.260
API, your Go app is still
a standard web app.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.560
And you can run it wherever
you want and just compile

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.830
using the [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.090
package.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.580
Because they are controlling the
language and the platform,

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.824
I like that they are really able
to get the two together.

00:31:17.824 --> 00:31:18.320
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:18.570
Right.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.470
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.490
MALE SPEAKER: And do you
have any favorite?

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.310
I mean, you were mentioning
Python before.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:26.715
Do you have any favorite App
Engine framework for Python,

00:31:26.715 --> 00:31:30.490
any libraries that you always
use in every app?

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.270
ALEX VAGIN: Oh, yeah.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:38.670
Well, the first thing that I
just love is this NDBD--

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.620
the new DB interface.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:42.990
So I like it.

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:47.900
Especially what I like is
the asynchronous API.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.570
And this task list--
this is great.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:59.040
And also Appstats is a tool that
I couldn't live without.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.910
Appstats is something that
helps me every day.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:11.290
And then what I also like
is also EReporter.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:19.980
It's a package that whenever you
have some errors, it can

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.550
make your app email you
these exceptions.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.100
So let's say you are running
a production application.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:33.910
Instead of maybe monitoring the
log files, you can also

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:37.510
set it up so that you would
get notifications by email

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.470
when something goes wrong.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:40.980
So I like that.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.130
And then Back Loader
actually helped me.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.770
I logged in.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:50.231
Pushing some legacy data
into data store.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:58.260
MALE SPEAKER: I think that the
exporting and importing data

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.890
story is getting better and
better, especially since we

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:06.145
introduced backups to Google
storage and restore.

00:33:06.145 --> 00:33:07.810
Not a lot of people
knows this.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:11.680
But if you go to the Google
App Engine project on

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.960
code.google.com, and you just
look at the SDK sources, the

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.300
sources for the backup and
restore administration

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.550
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.190
is actually there.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.610
So you can actually look
how this feature works.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:28.930
And you can easily modify it
to support importing stuff

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:34.500
from test or that doesn't come
from backup, or writing NTGs

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.320
that come from your app and
export them to Google store

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.480
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.860
But I that the framework into
there is a solid base where

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.420
people can give their
own important

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.430
exporting mechanism on.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:49.514
It's not well known that it's
open source in the SDK code.

00:33:49.514 --> 00:33:52.060
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:52.640
It's a great addition.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.890
Yeah, definitely.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.000
MALE SPEAKER: You mentioned
the Pipeline API before?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.640
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.420
I forgot.

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:01.720
Yeah.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.320
That's another thing.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.100
I think I put it on my
favorites list, yeah.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.880
I used it a couple
times, yeah.

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:26.800
Even if you had terabytes of
data, what I like about it is

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.590
that way, using Pipeline API,
you can process a huge amount

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:37.439
of data, and just not worry
about it later on.

00:34:37.439 --> 00:34:38.420
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.150
So you mentioned both
NBD and Pipeline.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.480
And there is something special
about those two libraries,

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.540
that they are not developed
inside the SDK lab.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.590
They have their own project
on code.google.com.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.484
They have [INAUDIBLE]
their online list.

00:34:51.484 --> 00:34:54.620
They have their own [INAUDIBLE]
trackers.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.280
And they get syncing to the
SDK on each release.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.330
But I was wondering what you
prefer as a developer.

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:03.555
Like do you prefer that they
are structured as an

00:35:03.555 --> 00:35:04.290
independent project?

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:08.000
Or do you prefer that everything
gets tracked into

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.712
the same App Engine product?

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:15.640
ALEX VAGIN: I don't know.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.130
I like the way the NDB--

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:25.990
the fact that it has its own
Google group, forum, where I

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.860
think it's because there
could be a lot of

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.000
questions related to that.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.660
So I think that way people
can track or ask

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.010
kind of specific questions.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:44.210
And I don't really mind
to do import from

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.640
GoogleAppEngine.ext import
NDB instead of--

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.970
so I like the way
it is right now.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:53.850
But I like the fact
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:54.780
back actions SDK.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.800
But I also like the fact that
they have their own community.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.960
And I think it's important for
the community to build and

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.250
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.830
around [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.960
I wish we were doing the same,
for example, for [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:12.340
backup and restore thing, like
if it was the right project,

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.850
we could get contributions
more easily.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:19.610
It will raise knowledge
that this is there and

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:20.580
people can use it.

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.630
Even though it's [INAUDIBLE]
inside the SDK.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:26.570
But I think that it will deserve
more visibility.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:27.370
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:33.550
And then plus there might be
some time when you could even

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:39.350
use those external projects
in some non-App

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:41.260
Engine related thing.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:45.670
You could just take that call,
then communicate your needs

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.680
and just use it.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.930
So, yeah.

00:36:51.132 --> 00:36:54.720
MALE SPEAKER: I think there is
only maybe 15 minutes left.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.470
So I will try to ask
my question.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:01.025
There's a last question
for you.

00:37:01.025 --> 00:37:04.466
AMY: Do you think we should
just switch to demoing?

00:37:04.466 --> 00:37:05.360
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.910
I think that we just have
one last section

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:09.010
before we get his demo.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.020
And I think that we are fine.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.920
Like do you have any tips?

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.560
You mentioned test queue.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.480
You mentioned using
the background.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.890
You mentioned at
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:21.150
you mentioned caching.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:23.540
Do you have any user tips that
you would like to share with

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.290
an App Engine developer?

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.540
ALEX VAGIN: Sure, yes.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.680
One thing is testing.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.700
There is nice test
bed framework.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:41.140
And I would have had to write
so much code to support my

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.290
testing environment.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.680
So this has really
helped me out.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:51.340
And the second thing
is code reviews.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.270
If you are working on some open
source project, I think

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.520
it's codereview.appspot.com.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:00.170
I think it's awesome to get
feedback from other

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.310
developers.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:04.530
And actually when I was in
there, I was working on the

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:07.870
Simple app, there was this
guy, Eric Higgins.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:09.060
I don't know if you
guys know him.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.090
I think he's ex-Google maybe.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:15.340
So I posted the link
to Go code review.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:20.360
And I just said whoever feels
like code reviewing.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:24.510
And suddenly I got it
reviewed this guy.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.430
And it was awesome.

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:29.580
He gave me so much.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.800
Like different people see
things from different

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.080
perspectives.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.505
So it really helps
in development.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.175
MALE SPEAKER: The Go project
is using code review

00:38:42.175 --> 00:38:45.385
intensively for the
development of Go.

00:38:45.385 --> 00:38:46.660
They have [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:49.850
called [? golden ?] dev, where
you can see all of the

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:51.440
contributions [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.390
And maybe that's something
we missed for App Engine.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:56.825
Maybe we should have
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:56.825 --> 00:38:59.890
mailing list, where all the
community projects that are

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:02.060
also third party libraries that
are using App Engine and

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.290
building stuff staff can
submit code review.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:07.685
So you can just watch it and
interact with people who are

00:39:07.685 --> 00:39:09.680
developing App Engine apps.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:09.960
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:10.610
That would be great.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:13.300
Yeah, yeah.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.270
AMY: Incidentally, big props to
Guido, who is involved with

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:20.490
code review and app stats
as well as NDBs.

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.560
ALEX VAGIN: Right.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.090
AMY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.340
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:34.900
And this one last thing that I
want to maybe emphasize is

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.200
I've seen a lot of blog
reports on App

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.730
Engine issue tracker.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.920
And what I found out
myself too--

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.770
because I've been on
the other side--

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:53.970
when you file a bug report,
before submitting it, try to

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:57.250
put yourself on the other side
of the guy who is going to

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.270
handle this bug report.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:03.940
And try to read what
you just wrote.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:08.310
And try to figure out whether
the guy that's on the other

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:11.480
side will actually understand
what's going on.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.610
Even better, if you
could submit a

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:18.420
patch, how to fix your--

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:19.490
because I've been there.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:25.500
And I know a lot of bug reports,
when you get this

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.340
saying, it's not working.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.080
And you just don't know
what to do with it.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.610
MALE SPEAKER: I've been doing
a lot of work on the issue

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:35.640
tracker [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:38.810
[INAUDIBLE] who try to reuse a
[INAUDIBLE] of issues that we

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:40.060
have to triage.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:45.600
There are some things that if
you can submit the test that

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.890
is reproducing the failure that
you are reporting, that's

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.450
a [INAUDIBLE] platform.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:52.715
Because something that is really
difficult to evaluate

00:40:52.715 --> 00:40:54.530
is how much time it will
take for you to

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:56.280
reproduce the issue.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.320
And a test is basically the
reporter transferring to the

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.130
one who is going to
triage [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.610
the knowledge of what you
need to do in order

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:05.700
to reproduce it.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:08.575
I think it's very [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:08.575 --> 00:41:11.295
And we should have a better
story for people crashing

00:41:11.295 --> 00:41:13.930
tests that are using test
bed [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.820
or that are [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.990
SDK in order to reproduce
a given bug.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.580
But that's something that is
very valuable to an engineer,

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:24.510
when they have a simpler way
to reproduce a problem.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:30.030
And you write about the issue
tracker, that people should

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:34.440
really to try to do
better submission.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.070
But that's something also that
is on your plate as well.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:42.180
We should try to improve and
to give more incentive to

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.100
people to do better
submissions.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.890
Like for example, the submission
templates--

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:49.280
I am in the process of
refactoring them.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.000
So it will better spell out what
you need to do in order

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.180
to submit an issue.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.840
Because is it not always clear
to people that they first have

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.080
to describe the step to
reproduce the issues.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.610
They have to describe what
they are expecting and to

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.580
describe what they
are seeing still.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.820
And just listing that in the
template would, in my opinion,

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:12.885
raise the clarity of the issues
that we get reported.

00:42:12.885 --> 00:42:14.190
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, right.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.630
Cool.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:15.940
Cool.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.120
MALE SPEAKER: I heard that you
maintain a library which is

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.080
called Simpleauth.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.480
So maybe you can talk
a bit about it.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:26.542
And maybe you have a small
demo of how to use it.

00:42:26.542 --> 00:42:27.760
ALEX VAGIN: Sure, yeah.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.830
So you know what?

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:33.410
I'm going to just do a
little quick demo.

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:36.600
And I'm going to do
a screen sharing.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:42.860
Oh, wait.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.110
I'm going to share my desktop.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:52.360
So do you guys see my screen?

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:52.760
Cool.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.370
Yeah.

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.172
So yeah.

00:42:56.172 --> 00:43:03.570
You can find the link to this
project on the Hangout

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:04.820
description, I think.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:17.670
Well first off, just one minute,
where we all started.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:23.240
So there was this website
where the [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:29.380
And what I needed to do is we
went to invite these PhD

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.350
school alumni.

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:35.145
We wanted them to RSVP if
they're coming or not.

00:43:35.145 --> 00:43:41.060
The thing is, they are spread
all over the world.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:50.520
So we didn't even know whether
they were using some social

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:54.060
networks like Google+ or
LinkedIn or whatever.

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:58.460
So what I thought is I would
just put these three buttons.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:02.460
And whenever a guy coming in.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:06.890
And they can just confirm it
with their preferred account.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:08.990
So this is where
it all started.

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.715
And I just took this
piece of code.

00:44:10.715 --> 00:44:14.670
And I put it into
the Simpleauth.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:27.335
So how I can get started is
you can go to the source

00:44:27.335 --> 00:44:28.510
through the check out base.

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:31.180
And you can copy the link.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:37.040
And then you call it.

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.000
Make it a bigger screen.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.510
So you call it.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.140
I'm opening my header.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:50.615
And so you have this example
application.

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.580
This is secrets.pi.template.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:02.030
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to copy the content of

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:08.590
this file in another one that
I just called secrets.pi.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.700
So it's the same file
only without

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.410
top template extension.

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:25.520
And in here I have client keys
and the consumer key and

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.660
secrets for different
providers.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:34.880
So I'm going to go and start
with Google APIs.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:40.420
You'll find links to where to
get a client secrets on the

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.100
home page of the project.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:46.320
Here is one for Google APIs.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.590
So I'm going to go here.

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:52.310
And this is Google
API's console.

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:55.450
And I'm just going to
create a project.

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:56.810
And it's called hangoutdemo.

00:46:05.264 --> 00:46:07.420
AMY: And you might make
your browser font

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.542
just a little bigger.

00:46:09.542 --> 00:46:12.200
ALEX VAGIN: Sorry.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:12.880
OK.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:19.685
So there is nothing I
need to enable here.

00:46:19.685 --> 00:46:23.660
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to create an auth client

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:27.900
that's called demo.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:35.990
Here I need to choose
a web application.

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:41.880
And what I'm going to do is--

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:42.140
well.

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.225
Let's say localhost.

00:46:44.225 --> 00:46:47.930
Because I'm running
on a localhost.

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:52.150
Note the redirect URL.

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:57.580
We'll need to change it
just here in a second.

00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:59.010
So here we go.

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.300
I get the client ID.

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:04.040
And I get client secret.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.460
What I need to do, though,
is change this

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.980
redirect URL or callback.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:20.330
I can either change this or I
could even add another one to

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:21.580
Google callback.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.630
This URL--

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:36.570
If you go through the Getting
Started page, you'll see why

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:39.130
it is and how it is
formed like this.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.660
So let me change this
at Google callback.

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:55.835
So I'm just going to copy client
ID and client secret.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.072
And I think it's started.

00:48:04.072 --> 00:48:08.455
So I'm going to go in
on this example.

00:48:08.455 --> 00:48:12.748
And I'm just going to run it.

00:48:12.748 --> 00:48:13.998
Try to see if this works.

00:48:18.621 --> 00:48:21.480
I'm going to go to
my localhost.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:25.370
So this is actually exactly the
same application as you

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.990
would see on the
simpleauth.appspot.com.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:39.890
And since I only put real
client ID and secrets on

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:44.030
Google API, so I'm just
going to go ahead

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:47.210
and try and log in.

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:49.470
And there we go.

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:52.150
Now it's requesting
permission.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:56.650
This is what we probably
talked about before.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:01.196
This comes from the scope
parameter that we

00:49:01.196 --> 00:49:03.190
talked about before.

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:06.010
I'm going to go ahead
and allow access.

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:07.500
And there you go.

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:15.180
We have a number of data here.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.800
So this is data and auth info.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:27.115
This is what you get
inside this method.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:36.950
And so what I do is I'll just
print it out on the page here.

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:39.690
And you can see this is
coming from Google+.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:46.260
Well, actually Google
OAuth API.

00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.560
So you have some user
profile data.

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:59.240
This is OAuth 2.0.

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:04.005
Access token is what you'd need
to interact with Google

00:50:04.005 --> 00:50:06.330
APIs in this case.

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.860
And you have this
expiration date.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:15.350
And this actually is the result
of interacting with

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.782
Google API using just
the access token.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:29.630
And just for the demo, I'm
printing out here since the

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:36.860
Simpleauth uses whatever Web App
has already implemented.

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:42.790
So it uses Web App's session
and auth package.

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:49.340
So you already have the
session thing already

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:50.590
implemented for you.

00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:06.280
So I don't think we have
too much time.

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.530
MALE SPEAKER: That was
a very nice demo.

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:12.740
For the [INAUDIBLE] coding and
getting everything more clean

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.740
at the first time.

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:16.470
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:20.820
And you can basically do the
same thing for Facebook,

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:24.220
Twitter, and any other
OAuth 2.2 or

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:29.070
OAuth 1 or OpenID providers.

00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:31.430
You can do the same thing.

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:35.450
MALE SPEAKER: And are you
persisting user creation using

00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:36.855
a Web App 2 session mechanism?

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:40.360
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah.

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.290
MALE SPEAKER: And then it's up
to the user if you want to

00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:46.910
persist the user in the database
to do it from the

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:48.480
call back, right?

00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.010
ALEX VAGIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:49.240
Yeah.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.030
So the Simpleauth actually--

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:53.130
it's not the real handler.

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:57.400
It's just kind of mixed in that
you can add to your real

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:57.980
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.700
handler.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:07.120
And what's happening outside of
auth request and response

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.270
is up to the developer.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:10.620
So he can use a different
session back end.

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:15.360
So you can use any user
model that you want.

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.330
Like the example application
uses what's

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:20.374
default of Web App 2.

00:52:20.374 --> 00:52:23.830
But you can use whatever
you want.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.100
MALE SPEAKER: So I think
that's it for the demo.

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:33.310
So thanks a lot, Alex, for
answering our questions and

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:34.500
going for Simpleauth.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.954
Is there anything you
want to add, Amy?

00:52:37.954 --> 00:52:39.040
Or any question from
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.290
I don't know if we
have the time.

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.730
AMY: Just for those who might
have tuned in part way

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:49.780
through, look at the event
description for a link to the

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:51.070
repository for this code.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:52.320
It's really very nice.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:56.615
ALEX VAGIN: Thanks, guys.

00:52:56.615 --> 00:52:57.580
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
thank you, Alex.

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.778
AMY: Thank you very much
for joining us.

00:52:59.778 --> 00:53:00.646
MALE SPEAKER: Bye.

00:53:00.646 --> 00:53:02.400
ALEX VAGIN: Thank you.

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:09.670
I want to say I hope I'll see
more Hangouts for the Go

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:11.740
runtime and stuff like that.

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:12.150
AMY: Oh, good.

00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.810
I'm glad.

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:16.500
And we'll try to do more that
are convenient for the

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:20.520
Europeans too than we
have been in past.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:20.850
ALEX VAGIN: Cool.

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:21.275
Cool.

00:53:21.275 --> 00:53:23.120
Thanks.

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:23.600
AMY: Thank you.

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.480
Thanks so much for joining us.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.440
ALEX VAGIN: All right.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.890
Bye.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.140
AMY: Bye-bye.
