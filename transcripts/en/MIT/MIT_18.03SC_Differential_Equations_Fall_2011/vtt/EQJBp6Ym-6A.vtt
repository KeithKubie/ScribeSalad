00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.619
I assume from high school you
know how to add and multiply

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:17.549
complex numbers using the
relation i squared equals

00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:23.070
negative one.
I'm a little less certain that

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.084
you remember how to divide them.
I hope you read last night by

00:00:29.084 --> 00:00:34.408
way of preparation for that,
but since that's something

00:00:34.408 --> 00:00:40.225
we're going to have to do a lot
of a differential equations,

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:45.845
so remember that the division
is done by making use of the

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:50.953
complex conjugate.
So, if z is equal to a plus bi,

00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:53.948
some people write a plus ib,

00:00:53.948 --> 00:00:57.204
and sometimes I'll do
that too if it's more

00:00:57.204 --> 00:00:59.874
convenient.
Then, the complex conjugate is

00:00:59.874 --> 00:01:03.000
what you get by changing i to
negative i.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.792
And, the important thing is
that the product of those two is

00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:09.299
a real number.
The product of these is a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.157
squared minus the quantity ib
all squared,

00:01:13.157 --> 00:01:16.950
which makes a squared plus b
squared because i

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.264
squared is negative one.

00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:22.864
So, the product of those,
that's what you multiply if you

00:01:22.864 --> 00:01:26.078
want to multiply this by
something to make it real.

00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:30.000
You always multiplied by its
complex conjugate.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.089
And that's the trick that
underlines the doing of the

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:36.056
division.
So, for example,

00:01:36.056 --> 00:01:40.303
I better hang onto these or
I'll never remember all the

00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:42.662
examples.
Suppose, for example,

00:01:42.662 --> 00:01:47.224
we wanted to calculate (two
plus i) divided by (one minus 3

00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:51.707
i).
To calculate it means I want to

00:01:51.707 --> 00:01:55.404
do the division;
I want to express the answer in

00:01:55.404 --> 00:02:00.480
the form a plus bi.
What you do is multiply the top

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.959
and bottom by the complex
conjugate of the denominator in

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.120
order to make it real.
So, it's (one plus 3i) divided

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.080
by (one plus 3i),
as they taught you in

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.479
elementary school,
that is one,

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:20.879
in a rather odd notation;
therefore, multiplying doesn't

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.439
change the value of the
fraction.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.520
And so, the denominator now
becomes 1 squared plus 3

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.000
squared, which is ten.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.723
And, the numerator is,
learn to do this without

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:40.338
multiplying out four terms.
You must be able to do this in

00:02:40.338 --> 00:02:43.414
your head.
And, you always do it by the

00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:48.352
grouping, or post office method,
whatever you want to call it,

00:02:48.352 --> 00:02:53.290
namely, first put down the real
part, which is made out of two

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.823
times one minus three times one.
So, that's negative one.

00:02:57.823 --> 00:03:01.871
And then, the imaginary part,
which is i times one.

00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:06.000
That's one, coefficient one,
plus 6i.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.396
So, that makes 7i.
Now, some people feel this

00:03:09.396 --> 00:03:12.252
still doesn't look right,
if you wish,

00:03:12.252 --> 00:03:15.803
and for some places and
differential equations,

00:03:15.803 --> 00:03:20.435
it will be useful to write that
as minus one tenth plus seven

00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:24.757
tenths i.
And, now it's perfectly clear

00:03:24.757 --> 00:03:30.176
that it's in the form a plus bi.
So, learn to do that if you

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:33.884
don't know already.
It's going to be important.

00:03:33.884 --> 00:03:38.156
Now, the main thing today is
the polar representation,

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:42.026
which sometimes they don't get
to in high school.

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:45.411
And if they do,
it's usually not in a grown

00:03:45.411 --> 00:03:49.200
up-enough in a form for us to be
able to use it.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.505
So, I have to worry about that
little bit.

00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:56.777
The polar representation,
of course, is nominally just

00:03:56.777 --> 00:04:00.969
the switch to polar coordinates.
If here's a plus bi,

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:05.000
then this is r,
and that's theta.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.968
And therefore,
this can be written as,

00:04:07.968 --> 00:04:11.659
in the polar form,
that would be r cosine theta

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.590
plus i, or r cosine theta.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.077
That's the A part.

00:04:18.077 --> 00:04:21.446
And, the B part is,
the imaginary part is r

00:04:21.446 --> 00:04:24.415
sin(theta) times i.

00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:27.704
Now, it would be customary,
at this point,

00:04:27.704 --> 00:04:33.000
to put the i in front,
just because it looks better.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.357
The complex numbers are
commutative, satisfied to

00:04:36.357 --> 00:04:38.665
commutative law of
multiplication,

00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:42.722
which means it doesn't matter
in multiplication whether you

00:04:42.722 --> 00:04:46.359
put i in front or behind.
It's still the same answer.

00:04:46.359 --> 00:04:50.345
So, this would be r cosine
theta plus i times 

00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:52.654
r sine theta,

00:04:52.654 --> 00:04:54.962
which, of course,
will factor out,

00:04:54.962 --> 00:04:59.228
and will make it cosine theta
plus i sine theta.

00:04:59.228 --> 00:05:02.376
Now, it was Euler who took the

00:05:02.376 --> 00:05:05.943
decisive step and said,
hey, look, I'm going to call

00:05:05.943 --> 00:05:10.000
that e to the i theta.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.586
Now, why did he do that?
Because everything seemed to

00:05:15.586 --> 00:05:21.388
indicate that it should.
But that's certainly worth the

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:24.933
best color we have,
which is what?

00:05:24.933 --> 00:05:29.446
We are getting low here.
Okay, nonetheless,

00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:34.280
it's worth pink.
I will even give him his due,

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.184
Euler.
Sometimes it's called Euler's

00:05:38.184 --> 00:05:40.820
formula, but it really shouldn't
be.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.607
It's not a formula.
It's a definition.

00:05:43.607 --> 00:05:46.771
So, in some sense,
you can't argue with it.

00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:50.914
If you want to call putting a
complex number in a power,

00:05:50.914 --> 00:05:53.023
and calling it that,
you can.

00:05:53.023 --> 00:05:56.036
But, one can certainly ask why
he did it.

00:05:56.036 --> 00:05:58.974
And the answer,
I guess, is that all the

00:05:58.974 --> 00:06:03.493
evidence seemed to point to the
fact that it was the thing to

00:06:03.493 --> 00:06:07.224
do.
Now, I think it's important to

00:06:07.224 --> 00:06:10.487
talk about a little bit because
I think it's,

00:06:10.487 --> 00:06:13.676
in my opinion,
if you're seeing this for the

00:06:13.676 --> 00:06:17.235
first time, even if you read
about it last night,

00:06:17.235 --> 00:06:21.092
it's a mysterious thing,
and one needs to see it from

00:06:21.092 --> 00:06:25.541
every possible point of view.
It's something you get used to.

00:06:25.541 --> 00:06:29.249
You will never see it in a
sudden flash of insight.

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:33.773
It will just get as familiar to
you as more common arithmetic,

00:06:33.773 --> 00:06:38.000
and algebraic,
and calculus processes are.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.583
But, look.
What is it we demand?

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:44.583
If you're going to call
something an exponential,

00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:47.833
what is it we want an
exponential to do,

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:52.916
what gives an expression like
this the right to be called e to

00:06:52.916 --> 00:06:57.500
the i theta?
The answer is I can't creep

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.937
inside Euler's mind.
It must have been a very big

00:07:01.937 --> 00:07:04.774
day of his life.
He had a lot of big days,

00:07:04.774 --> 00:07:08.925
but when he realized that that
was the thing to write down as

00:07:08.925 --> 00:07:12.385
the definition of e to the i
theta.

00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:15.360
But, what is it one wants of an
exponential?

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.512
Well, the high school answer
surely is you want it to satisfy

00:07:19.512 --> 00:07:22.072
the exponential law.
Now, to my shock,

00:07:22.072 --> 00:07:24.563
I realize a lot of people don't
know.

00:07:24.563 --> 00:07:27.884
In my analysis class,
these are some math majors,

00:07:27.884 --> 00:07:30.721
or graduate engineers in
various subjects,

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:34.734
and if I say prove such and
such using the exponential law,

00:07:34.734 --> 00:07:38.540
I'm sure to get at least half a
dozen e-mails asking me,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:44.988
what's the exponential law?
Okay, the exponential law is a

00:07:44.988 --> 00:07:51.262
to the x times a to the y equals
a to the x plus y:

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:54.549
the law of exponents.

00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:59.928
That's the most important
reason why, that's the single

00:07:59.928 --> 00:08:05.605
most important thing about
exponents, are the way one uses

00:08:05.605 --> 00:08:10.125
them.
And, this is the exponential

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:16.488
function, called the exponential
function because all this

00:08:16.488 --> 00:08:20.618
significant stuff is in the
exponents.

00:08:20.618 --> 00:08:25.195
All right, so it should
satisfy-- we want,

00:08:25.195 --> 00:08:31.000
first of all,
the exponential law to be true.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.605
But that's not all.
That's a high school answer.

00:08:34.605 --> 00:08:38.671
An MIT answer would be,
I mean, why is e to the x such

00:08:38.671 --> 00:08:41.357
a popular function?
Well, of course,

00:08:41.357 --> 00:08:44.962
it does satisfy the exponential
law, but for us,

00:08:44.962 --> 00:08:48.645
an even more reasonable thing.
It's the function,

00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:53.171
which, when you differentiate
it, you get the same thing you

00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:56.547
started with.
And, it's apart from a constant

00:08:56.547 --> 00:09:02.289
factor, the only such function.
Now, in terms of differential

00:09:02.289 --> 00:09:06.710
equations, it means that it's
the solution that e to the,

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:11.131
let's be a little generous,
make it e to the ax.

00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:15.631
No, better not to use x because
complex numbers tend to be

00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:20.131
called x plus iy.
Let's use t as a more neutral

00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:23.605
variable, which is standing
outside the fray,

00:09:23.605 --> 00:09:26.763
as it were.
It satisfies the relationship

00:09:26.763 --> 00:09:29.526
that it's the solution,
if you like,

00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:34.855
to the differential equation.
That's a fancy way of saying

00:09:34.855 --> 00:09:37.108
it.
dy / dt equals a times y.

00:09:37.108 --> 00:09:38.765
Now, of course,

00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:41.746
that is not unique.
We could make it unique by

00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:45.259
putting in an initial value.
So, if I want to get this

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:49.102
function and not a constant
times it, I should make this an

00:09:49.102 --> 00:09:52.879
initial value problem and say
that y of zero should be one.

00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:55.596
And now, I will get only the

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:58.313
function, e to the at.
So, in other words,

00:09:58.313 --> 00:10:00.433
that characterizes this
function.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:04.012
It's the only function in the
whole world that has that

00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:08.661
property.
Now, if you're going to call

00:10:08.661 --> 00:10:13.510
something e to the i theta,
we want that to be true.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:18.454
So, here are my questions.
Is it true that e to the i

00:10:18.454 --> 00:10:23.397
theta one, let's use that,
times e to the i theta two,

00:10:23.397 --> 00:10:29.292
see, I'm on a collision course

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:35.347
here, but that's easily fixed.
Is that equal to e to the i

00:10:35.347 --> 00:10:39.956
(theta one plus theta two)?

00:10:39.956 --> 00:10:43.869
If that turns out to be so,
that's a big step.

00:10:43.869 --> 00:10:46.826
What would we like to be true
here?

00:10:46.826 --> 00:10:52.217
Well, will it be true that the
derivative, with respect to t of

00:10:52.217 --> 00:10:56.217
e to the i theta,
I would like that to be equal

00:10:56.217 --> 00:11:01.086
to i times e to the i theta.

00:11:01.086 --> 00:11:04.150
So, question,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.600
question.
I think those are the two most

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.493
significant things.
Now, the nodes do a third

00:11:11.493 --> 00:11:14.412
thing, talk about infinite
series.

00:11:14.412 --> 00:11:18.394
Since we haven't done infinite
series, anyway,

00:11:18.394 --> 00:11:23.525
it's not officially part of the
syllabus, the kind of power

00:11:23.525 --> 00:11:28.479
series that are required.
But, I will put it down for the

00:11:28.479 --> 00:11:32.284
sake of completeness,
as people like to say.

00:11:32.284 --> 00:11:39.787
So, it should behave right.
The infinite series should be

00:11:39.787 --> 00:11:44.489
nice.
The infinite series should work

00:11:44.489 --> 00:11:48.408
out.
There is no word for this,

00:11:48.408 --> 00:11:51.804
should work out,
let's say.

00:11:51.804 --> 00:11:55.853
I mean, what's the little
music?

00:11:55.853 --> 00:12:03.820
Is that some weird music idea,
or is it only me that hears it?

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.000
[LAUGHTER] Yes,
Lord.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.038
I feel I'm being watched up
there.

00:12:11.038 --> 00:12:14.444
This is terrible.
So, there's one guy.

00:12:14.444 --> 00:12:18.863
Here's another guy.
And, I won't put a box around

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:23.098
the infinite series,
since I'm not going to say

00:12:23.098 --> 00:12:26.412
anything about it.
Now, these things,

00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:30.831
in fact, are both true.
Otherwise, why would I be

00:12:30.831 --> 00:12:37.000
saying them, and why would Euler
have made the formula?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.939
But, what's interesting to see
is what's behind them.

00:12:41.939 --> 00:12:47.068
And, that gives you little
practice also in calculating

00:12:47.068 --> 00:12:52.007
with the complex numbers.
So, let's look at the first

00:12:52.007 --> 00:12:54.002
one.
What will it say?

00:12:54.002 --> 00:12:57.992
It is asking the question.
It says, please,

00:12:57.992 --> 00:13:01.886
calculate the product of these
two things.

00:13:01.886 --> 00:13:04.071
Okay, I do it,
I'm told.

00:13:04.071 --> 00:13:09.865
I will calculate the product of
cosine theta one plus i cosine

00:13:09.865 --> 00:13:14.014
theta two-- Sine.
Sine theta one.

00:13:14.014 --> 00:13:17.327
That's e to the i

00:13:17.327 --> 00:13:19.558
theta one, right?

00:13:19.558 --> 00:13:23.277
So, that corresponds to this.
The other factor times the

00:13:23.277 --> 00:13:26.049
other factor,
cosine theta two plus i sine

00:13:26.049 --> 00:13:28.822
theta two.

00:13:28.822 --> 00:13:32.000
Okay, what does that come out
to be?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.524
Well, again,
we will use the method of

00:13:34.524 --> 00:13:36.981
grouping.
What's the real part of it?

00:13:36.981 --> 00:13:40.734
The real part of it is cosine
theta one cosine theta two.

00:13:40.734 --> 00:13:44.691
And then, there's a real part,

00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:47.011
which comes from these two
factors.

00:13:47.011 --> 00:13:50.628
It's going to occur with a
minus sign because of the i

00:13:50.628 --> 00:13:53.221
squared.
And, what's left is sine theta

00:13:53.221 --> 00:13:56.360
one sine theta two.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:01.000
And then, the imaginary part,
I'll factor out the i.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.661
And then, what's left,
I won't have to keep repeating

00:14:05.661 --> 00:14:08.619
the i.
So, it will have to be sine

00:14:08.619 --> 00:14:13.459
theta one cosine theta two.

00:14:13.459 --> 00:14:18.478
And, the other factor will be
cosine theta one sine theta

00:14:18.478 --> 00:14:22.512
two-- plus sine theta two cosine
theta one.

00:14:22.512 --> 00:14:27.263
Well, it looks like a mess,

00:14:27.263 --> 00:14:30.579
but, again, high school to the
rescue.

00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:35.525
What is this?
The top thing is nothing in

00:14:35.525 --> 00:14:41.136
disguise, but it's a disguised
form of cosine (theta one plus

00:14:41.136 --> 00:14:44.410
theta two).

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:49.179
And the bottom is sine of
(theta one plus theta two).

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:54.136
So, the product of these two

00:14:54.136 --> 00:14:58.438
things is this,
and that's exactly the formula.

00:14:58.438 --> 00:15:02.086
In other words,
this formula is a way of

00:15:02.086 --> 00:15:07.978
writing those two trigonometric
identities for the cosine of the

00:15:07.978 --> 00:15:13.831
sum and the sine of the sum.
Instead of the two identities

00:15:13.831 --> 00:15:17.242
taking up that much space,
written one after the other,

00:15:17.242 --> 00:15:20.778
they take up as much space,
and they say exactly the same

00:15:20.778 --> 00:15:22.610
thing.
Those two trigonometric

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.526
identities are exactly the same
as saying that e to the i theta

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:30.000
satisfies the
exponential law.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.469
Now, people ask,
you know, what's beautiful in

00:15:33.469 --> 00:15:36.245
mathematics?
To me, that's beautiful.

00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:39.792
I think that's great.
Something long turns into

00:15:39.792 --> 00:15:42.722
something short,
and it's just as good,

00:15:42.722 --> 00:15:45.961
and moreover,
connects with all these other

00:15:45.961 --> 00:15:49.277
things in the world,
differential equations,

00:15:49.277 --> 00:15:51.821
infinite series,
blah, blah, blah,

00:15:51.821 --> 00:15:54.674
blah, blah.
Okay, I don't have to sell

00:15:54.674 --> 00:15:56.448
Euler.
He sells himself.

00:15:56.448 --> 00:16:02.000
Now, how about the other one?
How about the other one?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.337
Now, that's obviously,
I haven't said something

00:16:09.337 --> 00:16:17.153
because for one thing,
how do you differentiate if

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:22.895
there's theta here,
and t down there.

00:16:22.895 --> 00:16:30.270
Okay, that's easily fixed.
But, how do I differentiate

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.213
this?
What kind of a guy is e to the

00:16:33.213 --> 00:16:37.250
i theta?
Well, if I write it out,

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.875
take a look at what it is.
It's cosine theta plus i sine

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:44.818
theta.

00:16:44.818 --> 00:16:47.509
As theta varies,
it's a function.

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:51.377
The variable is real.
Theta is a real variable.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:55.245
Its angle in radians,
but it runs from negative

00:16:55.245 --> 00:16:59.450
infinity to infinity.
So, if you think of functions

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.813
as a black box,
what's going in is a real

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:06.890
number.
But, what's coming out is a

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.200
complex number.
So, schematically,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.559
here is the e to the i theta
box,

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:15.640
if you like to think that way,
theta goes in,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.230
and that's real,
and a complex number,

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.960
this particular complex number
goes out.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.390
So, one, we'd call it,
I'm not going to write this

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:28.029
down because it's sort of
pompous and takes too long.

00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:33.000
But, it is a complex valued
function of a real variable.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.243
You got that?
Up to now, we studied real

00:17:36.243 --> 00:17:41.066
functions of real variables.
But now, real valued functions

00:17:41.066 --> 00:17:45.057
of real variables,
those are the kind calculus is

00:17:45.057 --> 00:17:48.799
concerned with.
But now, it's a complex-valued

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:51.876
function because the variable is
real.

00:17:51.876 --> 00:17:55.701
But, the output,
the value of the function is a

00:17:55.701 --> 00:17:58.279
complex number.
Now, in general,

00:17:58.279 --> 00:18:01.688
such a function,
well, maybe a better say,

00:18:01.688 --> 00:18:04.931
complex-valued,
how about complex-valued

00:18:04.931 --> 00:18:09.588
function of a real variable,
let's change the name of the

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:14.500
variable.
t is always a real variable.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.500
I don't think we have complex
time yet, although I'm sure

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.232
there will be someday.
But, the next Einstein appears.

00:18:24.232 --> 00:18:28.160
A complex-valued function of a
real variable,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.000
t, in general,
would look like this.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.683
t goes in, and what comes out?
Well: a complex number,

00:18:35.683 --> 00:18:38.532
which I would then have to
write this way.

00:18:38.532 --> 00:18:41.451
In other words,
the real part depends on t,

00:18:41.451 --> 00:18:44.023
and the imaginary part depends
upon t.

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:47.359
So, a general function looks
like this, a general

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:51.111
complex-valued function.
This is just a special case of

00:18:51.111 --> 00:18:54.100
it, where the variable has a
different name.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.992
But, the first function would
be cosine t, and the second

00:18:57.992 --> 00:19:01.397
function would be sine t.
So, my only question is,

00:19:01.397 --> 00:19:03.969
how do you differentiate such a
thing?

00:19:03.969 --> 00:19:08.000
Well, I'm not going to fuss
over this.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.384
The general definition is,
with deltas and whatnot,

00:19:11.384 --> 00:19:14.904
but the end result of a
perfectly fine definition is,

00:19:14.904 --> 00:19:18.559
you differentiate it by
differentiating each component.

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:22.350
The reason you don't have to
work so very hard is because

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:25.735
this is a real variable,
and I already know what it

00:19:25.735 --> 00:19:30.000
means to differentiate a
function of a real variable.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.007
So, I could write it this way,
that the derivative of u plus

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:37.946
iv, I'll abbreviate it that way,
this means the derivative,

00:19:37.946 --> 00:19:41.545
with respect to whatever
variable, since I didn't tell

00:19:41.545 --> 00:19:44.601
you what the variable in these
functions were,

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:48.608
well, I don't have to tell you
what I'm differentiating with

00:19:48.608 --> 00:19:51.461
respect to.
It's whatever was there because

00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:53.634
you can't see.
And the answer is,

00:19:53.634 --> 00:19:57.777
it would be the derivative of u
plus i times the derivative of

00:19:57.777 --> 00:20:01.104
v.
You differentiate it just the

00:20:01.104 --> 00:20:05.530
way you would if these were the
components of a motion vector.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.811
You would get the velocity by
differentiating each component

00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:12.714
separately.
And, that's what you're doing

00:20:12.714 --> 00:20:15.108
here.
Okay, now, the importance of

00:20:15.108 --> 00:20:19.390
that is that it at least tells
me what it is I have to check

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:23.235
when I check this formula.
So, let's do it now that we

00:20:23.235 --> 00:20:26.573
know what this is.
We know how to differentiate

00:20:26.573 --> 00:20:29.548
the function.
Let's actually differentiate

00:20:29.548 --> 00:20:32.869
it.
That's fortunately,

00:20:32.869 --> 00:20:37.298
by far, the easiest part of the
whole process.

00:20:37.298 --> 00:20:41.431
So, let's do it.
So, what's the derivative?

00:20:41.431 --> 00:20:45.368
Let's go back to t,
our generic variable.

00:20:45.368 --> 00:20:51.469
I want to emphasize that these
functions, when we write them as

00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:56.784
functions, that theta will
almost never be the variable

00:20:56.784 --> 00:21:02.000
outside of these notes on
complex numbers.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.405
It will normally be time or
something like that,

00:21:05.405 --> 00:21:07.652
or x, a neutral variable like
x.

00:21:07.652 --> 00:21:12.072
So, what's the derivative of e
to the i theta?

00:21:12.072 --> 00:21:16.420
I'm hoping that it will turn
out to be i e to the i theta,

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.608
and that the yellow law may be

00:21:19.608 --> 00:21:23.666
true just as the green one was.
Okay, let's calculate it.

00:21:23.666 --> 00:21:26.275
It's the derivative,
with respect to,

00:21:26.275 --> 00:21:30.550
unfortunately I can convert t's
to thetas, but not thetas to

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:33.325
t's.
C'est la vie,

00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:36.691
okay.
Times cosine t plus i sine t,

00:21:36.691 --> 00:21:40.566
and what's that?

00:21:40.566 --> 00:21:46.787
Well, the derivative of cosine
t, differentiating the real and

00:21:46.787 --> 00:21:51.478
imaginary parts separately,
and adding them up.

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:56.781
It's negative sine t,
plus i times cosine t.

00:21:56.781 --> 00:22:01.269
Now, let's factor out at the i,

00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:08.000
because it says if I factor out
the i, what do I get?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.965
Well, now, the real part of
what's left would be cosine t.

00:22:12.965 --> 00:22:15.839
And, how about the imaginary
part?

00:22:15.839 --> 00:22:21.153
Do you see, it will be i sine t
because i times i

00:22:21.153 --> 00:22:24.637
gives me that negative one.

00:22:24.637 --> 00:22:27.163
And, what's that?
e to the it.

00:22:27.163 --> 00:22:30.299
i times e to the i t.

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:35.630
So, that works too.
What about the initial

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.141
condition?
No problem.

00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:43.641
What is y of zero?
What's the function at zero?

00:22:43.641 --> 00:22:49.380
Well, don't say right away,
i times zero is zero,

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.282
so it must be one.
That's illegal because,

00:22:54.282 --> 00:23:00.141
why is that illegal?
It's because in that formula,

00:23:00.141 --> 00:23:06.000
you are not multiplying i times
theta.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.343
I mean, sort of,
you are, but that formula is

00:23:09.343 --> 00:23:12.914
the meaning of e to 
the i theta.

00:23:12.914 --> 00:23:16.106
Now, it would be very nice if
this is like,

00:23:16.106 --> 00:23:18.462
well, anyway,
you can't do that.

00:23:18.462 --> 00:23:23.097
So, you have to do it by saying
it's the cosine of zero plus i

00:23:23.097 --> 00:23:26.440
times the sine of zero.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.000
And, how much is that?
The sine of zero is zero.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.910
Now, it's okay to say i times
zero is zero because that's the

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:40.493
way complex numbers multiply.
What is the cosine of zero?

00:23:40.493 --> 00:23:42.621
That's one.
So, the answer,

00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:46.222
indeed, turns out to be one.
So, this checks,

00:23:46.222 --> 00:23:51.214
really, from every conceivable
standpoint down as I indicated,

00:23:51.214 --> 00:23:54.734
also from the standpoint of
infinite series.

00:23:54.734 --> 00:23:58.089
So, we are definitely allowed
to use this.

00:23:58.089 --> 00:24:03.000
Now, the more general
exponential law is true.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.891
I'm not going to say much about
it.

00:24:05.891 --> 00:24:09.888
So, in other words,
e to the a, this is really a

00:24:09.888 --> 00:24:13.290
definition.
e to the (a plus ib)

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:17.117
is going to be,
in order for the general

00:24:17.117 --> 00:24:21.794
exponential law to be true,
this is really a definition.

00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:26.046
It's e to the a times e to the
ib.

00:24:26.046 --> 00:24:30.639
Now, notice when I look at
the-- at any complex number,

00:24:30.639 --> 00:24:34.140
--
-- so, in terms of this,

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:38.866
the polar form of a complex
number, to draw the little

00:24:38.866 --> 00:24:42.789
picture again,
if here is our complex number,

00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:46.535
and here is r,
and here is the angle theta,

00:24:46.535 --> 00:24:51.796
so the nice way to write this
complex number is r e to the i

00:24:51.796 --> 00:24:56.343
theta.
The e to the i theta

00:24:56.343 --> 00:25:00.000
is, now, why is that?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.382
What is the magnitude of this?
This is r.

00:25:04.382 --> 00:25:10.078
The length of the absolute
value, I didn't talk about

00:25:10.078 --> 00:25:14.898
magnitude in argument.
I guess I should have.

00:25:14.898 --> 00:25:20.485
But, it's in the notes.
So, r is called the modulus.

00:25:20.485 --> 00:25:24.320
Well, the fancy word is the
modulus.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:29.469
And, we haven't given the
complex number a name.

00:25:29.469 --> 00:25:33.522
Let's call it alpha,
modulus of alpha,

00:25:33.522 --> 00:25:39.000
and theta is called,
it's the angle.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.400
It's called the argument.
I didn't make up these words.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.700
There, from a tradition of
English that has long since

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:55.299
vanished, when I was a kid,
and you wanted to know what a

00:25:55.299 --> 00:25:59.500
play was about,
you looked in the playbill,

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:05.500
and it said the argument of the
play, it's that old-fashioned

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:11.812
use of the word argument.
Argument means the angle,

00:26:11.812 --> 00:26:16.762
and sometimes that's
abbreviated by arg alpha.

00:26:16.762 --> 00:26:21.262
And, this is abbreviated,

00:26:21.262 --> 00:26:26.775
of course, as absolute value of
alpha, its length.

00:26:26.775 --> 00:26:33.187
Okay, the notes give you a
little practice changing things

00:26:33.187 --> 00:26:39.289
to a polar form.
I think we will skip that in

00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:46.337
favor of doing a couple of other
things because that's pretty

00:26:46.337 --> 00:26:50.566
easy.
But let me, you should at least

00:26:50.566 --> 00:26:55.500
realize when you should look at
polar form.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:01.843
The great advantage of polar
form is, particularly once

00:27:01.843 --> 00:27:08.656
you've mastered the exponential
law, the great advantage of

00:27:08.656 --> 00:27:15.000
polar form is it's good for
multiplication.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.838
Now, of course,
you know how to multiply

00:27:17.838 --> 00:27:20.822
complex numbers,
even when they are in the

00:27:20.822 --> 00:27:23.805
Cartesian form.
That's the first thing you

00:27:23.805 --> 00:27:27.590
learn in high school,
how to multiply a plus bi times

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:31.374
c plus di.
But, as you will see,

00:27:31.374 --> 00:27:35.377
when push comes to shove,
you will see this very clearly

00:27:35.377 --> 00:27:39.088
on Friday when we talk about
trigonometric inputs to

00:27:39.088 --> 00:27:42.000
differential equations,
--

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.028
-- that the changing to complex
numbers makes all sorts of

00:27:46.028 --> 00:27:49.491
things easy to calculate,
and the answers come out

00:27:49.491 --> 00:27:52.742
extremely clear,
whereas if we had to do it any

00:27:52.742 --> 00:27:56.204
other way, it's a lot more work.
And worst of all,

00:27:56.204 --> 00:28:00.233
when you finally slog through
to the end, you fear you are

00:28:00.233 --> 00:28:03.958
none the wiser.
It's good for multiplication

00:28:03.958 --> 00:28:07.246
because the product,
so here's any number in its

00:28:07.246 --> 00:28:09.695
polar form.
That's a general complex

00:28:09.695 --> 00:28:12.213
number.
It's modulus times e to the i

00:28:12.213 --> 00:28:16.271
theta times r two e to the i
theta two-- 

00:28:16.271 --> 00:28:19.629
Well,
you just multiply them as

00:28:19.629 --> 00:28:22.917
ordinary numbers.
So, the part out front will be

00:28:22.917 --> 00:28:26.905
r1 r2, and the e to the i theta
parts gets

00:28:26.905 --> 00:28:30.753
multiplied by the exponential
law and becomes e to the i

00:28:30.753 --> 00:28:36.000
(theta one plus theta two) --

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.206
-- which makes very clear that
the multiply geometrically two

00:28:42.206 --> 00:28:46.344
complex numbers,
you multiply the moduli,

00:28:46.344 --> 00:28:52.551
the r's, the absolute values,
how long the arrow is from zero

00:28:52.551 --> 00:28:56.896
to the complex number,
multiply the moduli,

00:28:56.896 --> 00:29:02.051
and add the arguments.
So the new number,

00:29:02.051 --> 00:29:07.636
its modulus is the product of
r1 and r2.

00:29:07.636 --> 00:29:12.308
And, its argument,
its angle, polar angle,

00:29:12.308 --> 00:29:15.955
is the sum of the old two
angles.

00:29:15.955 --> 00:29:22.224
And, you add the angles.
And, you put down in your books

00:29:22.224 --> 00:29:26.099
angles, but I'm being
photographed,

00:29:26.099 --> 00:29:31.000
so I'm going to write
arguments.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.389
In other words,
it makes the geometric content

00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:38.231
of multiplication clear,
in a sense in which this is

00:29:38.231 --> 00:29:40.641
extremely unclear.
From this law,

00:29:40.641 --> 00:29:44.106
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, whatever it turns

00:29:44.106 --> 00:29:48.550
out to be, you have not the
slightest intuition that this is

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.844
true about the complex numbers.
That first thing is just a

00:29:52.844 --> 00:29:57.212
formula, whereas this thing is
insightful representation of

00:29:57.212 --> 00:30:02.780
complex multiplication.
Now, I'd like to use it for

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:08.650
something, but before we do
that, let me just indicate how

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:14.417
just the exponential notation
enables you to do things in

00:30:14.417 --> 00:30:19.978
calculus, formulas that are
impossible to remember from

00:30:19.978 --> 00:30:23.582
calculus.
It makes them very easy to

00:30:23.582 --> 00:30:27.289
derive.
A typical example of that is,

00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:30.585
suppose you want to,
for example,

00:30:30.585 --> 00:30:38.000
integrate (e to the negative x)
cosine x.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.450
Well, number one,
you spend a few minutes running

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:45.546
through a calculus textbook and
try to find out the answer

00:30:45.546 --> 00:30:49.787
because you know you are not
going to remember how to do it.

00:30:49.787 --> 00:30:53.237
Or, you run to a computer,
and type in Matlab and

00:30:53.237 --> 00:30:55.968
something.
Or, you fish out your little

00:30:55.968 --> 00:30:59.418
pocket calculator,
which will give you a formula,

00:30:59.418 --> 00:31:03.346
and so on.
So, you have aides for doing

00:31:03.346 --> 00:31:06.363
that.
But, the way to do it if you're

00:31:06.363 --> 00:31:10.134
on a desert island,
and the way I always do it

00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:14.575
because I never have any of
these little aides around,

00:31:14.575 --> 00:31:19.351
and I cannot trust my memory,
probably a certain number of

00:31:19.351 --> 00:31:24.379
you remember how you did it at
high school, or how you did it

00:31:24.379 --> 00:31:29.407
in 18.01, if you took it here.
You have to use integration by

00:31:29.407 --> 00:31:33.011
parts.
But, it's one of the tricky

00:31:33.011 --> 00:31:37.406
things that's not required on an
exam because you had to use

00:31:37.406 --> 00:31:40.981
integration by parts twice in
the same direction,

00:31:40.981 --> 00:31:45.600
and then suddenly by comparing
the end product with the initial

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.144
product and writing an equation.
Somehow, the value falls out.

00:31:50.144 --> 00:31:53.869
Well, that's tricky.
And it's not the sort of thing

00:31:53.869 --> 00:31:58.562
you can waste time stuffing into
your head, unless you are going

00:31:58.562 --> 00:32:04.000
to be the integration bee during
IAP or something like that.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.281
Instead, using complex numbers
is the way to do this.

00:32:09.281 --> 00:32:12.531
How do I think of this,
cosine x?

00:32:12.531 --> 00:32:18.320
What I do, is I think of that e
to the negative x cosine x

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:24.109
is the real
part, the real part of what?

00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:29.898
Well, cosine x is the real part
of e to the ix.

00:32:29.898 --> 00:32:32.742
So, this thing,
this is real.

00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:34.468
This is real,
too.

00:32:34.468 --> 00:32:39.851
But I'm thinking of it as the
real part of e to the ix.

00:32:39.851 --> 00:32:45.364
Now, if I multiply these two

00:32:45.364 --> 00:32:49.755
together, this is going to turn
out to be, therefore,

00:32:49.755 --> 00:32:53.471
the real part of e to the minus
x.

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:57.862
I'll write it out very
pompously, and then I will fix

00:32:57.862 --> 00:33:00.226
it.
I would never write this,

00:33:00.226 --> 00:33:04.978
you are you.
Okay, it's e to the minus x

00:33:04.978 --> 00:33:09.612
times, when I write cosine x
plus i sine x,

00:33:09.612 --> 00:33:14.245
so it is the real part of that
is cosine x.

00:33:14.245 --> 00:33:20.533
So, it's the real part of,
write it this way for real part

00:33:20.533 --> 00:33:26.270
of e to the, factor out the x,
and what's up there is

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:33.000
(negative one plus i) times x.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.777
Okay, and now,
so, the idea is the same thing

00:33:36.777 --> 00:33:39.867
is going to be true for the
integral.

00:33:39.867 --> 00:33:43.387
This is going to be the real
part of that,

00:33:43.387 --> 00:33:48.709
the integral of e to the (minus
one plus i) times x dx.

00:33:48.709 --> 00:33:51.027
In other words,

00:33:51.027 --> 00:33:54.375
what you do is,
this procedure is called

00:33:54.375 --> 00:33:58.839
complexifying the integral.
Instead of looking at the

00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:03.046
original real problem,
I'm going to turn it into a

00:34:03.046 --> 00:34:07.424
complex problem by turning this
thing into a complex

00:34:07.424 --> 00:34:12.059
exponential.
This is the real part of that

00:34:12.059 --> 00:34:15.467
complex exponential.
Now, what's the advantage of

00:34:15.467 --> 00:34:16.745
doing that?
Simple.

00:34:16.745 --> 00:34:20.295
It's because nothing is easier
to integrate than an

00:34:20.295 --> 00:34:23.207
exponential.
And, though you may have some

00:34:23.207 --> 00:34:26.899
doubts as to whether the
familiar laws work also with

00:34:26.899 --> 00:34:30.165
complex exponentials,
I assure you they all do.

00:34:30.165 --> 00:34:34.000
It would be lovely to sit and
prove them.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.419
On the other hand,
I think after a while,

00:34:37.419 --> 00:34:41.779
you find it rather dull.
So, I'm going to do the fun

00:34:41.779 --> 00:34:46.396
things, and assume that they are
true because they are.

00:34:46.396 --> 00:34:51.354
So, what's the integral of e to
the (minus one plus i) x dx?

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:58.792
Well, if there is justice in
heaven, it must be e to the

00:34:58.792 --> 00:35:03.323
(minus one plus i) times x
divided by minus one plus i.

00:35:03.323 --> 00:35:08.635
In some sense,

00:35:08.635 --> 00:35:12.957
that's the answer.
This does, in fact,

00:35:12.957 --> 00:35:15.878
give that.
That's correct.

00:35:15.878 --> 00:35:22.537
I want the real part of this.
I want the real part because

00:35:22.537 --> 00:35:27.911
that's the way the original
problem was stated.

00:35:27.911 --> 00:35:34.960
I want the real part only.
So, I want the real part of

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.906
this.
Now, this is what separates the

00:35:38.906 --> 00:35:44.607
girls from the women.
[LAUGHTER] This is why you have

00:35:44.607 --> 00:35:48.664
to know how to divide complex
numbers.

00:35:48.664 --> 00:35:52.392
So, watch how I find the real
part.

00:35:52.392 --> 00:35:56.996
I write it this way.
Normally when I do the

00:35:56.996 --> 00:36:02.916
calculations for myself,
I would skip a couple of these

00:36:02.916 --> 00:36:05.889
steps.
But this time,

00:36:05.889 --> 00:36:09.637
I will write everything out.
You're going to have to do this

00:36:09.637 --> 00:36:12.559
a lot in this course,
by the way, both over the

00:36:12.559 --> 00:36:16.307
course of the next few weeks,
and especially towards the end

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:19.293
of the term where we get into a
complex systems,

00:36:19.293 --> 00:36:22.596
which involve complex numbers.
There's a lot of this.

00:36:22.596 --> 00:36:26.471
So, now is the time to learn to
do it, and to feel skillful at

00:36:26.471 --> 00:36:28.440
it.
So, it's this times e to the

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.489
negative x times e to the ix,

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:36.000
which is cosine x plus 
i sine x.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.233
Now, I'm not ready,
yet, to do the calculation to

00:36:39.233 --> 00:36:43.139
find the real part because I
don't like the way this looks.

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:46.709
I want to go back to the thing
I did right at the very

00:36:46.709 --> 00:36:50.145
beginning of the hour,
and turn it into an a plus bi

00:36:50.145 --> 00:36:52.367
type of complex
number.

00:36:52.367 --> 00:36:55.062
In other words,
what we have to do is the

00:36:55.062 --> 00:36:57.554
division.
So, the division is going to

00:36:57.554 --> 00:37:02.000
be, now, I'm going to ask you to
do it in your head.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.416
I multiply the top and bottom
by negative one minus I.

00:37:06.416 --> 00:37:09.500
What does that put in the
denominator?

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.750
One squared plus one squared:
Two.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:17.750
And in the numerator,
negative one minus i.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.166
This is the same as that.

00:37:20.166 --> 00:37:24.083
But now, it looks at the form a
+ bi.

00:37:24.083 --> 00:37:28.833
It's negative one over two
minus i times one half.

00:37:28.833 --> 00:37:33.267
So, this is multiplied by e to

00:37:33.267 --> 00:37:36.440
the minus x and cosine x.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.219
So, if you are doing it,
and practice a little bit,

00:37:40.219 --> 00:37:42.863
please don't put in all these
steps.

00:37:42.863 --> 00:37:46.037
Go from here;
well, I would go from here to

00:37:46.037 --> 00:37:48.682
here by myself.
Maybe you shouldn't.

00:37:48.682 --> 00:37:51.403
Practice a little before you do
that.

00:37:51.403 --> 00:37:53.821
And now, what do we do with
this?

00:37:53.821 --> 00:37:57.448
Now, this is in a form to pick
out the real part.

00:37:57.448 --> 00:38:03.052
We want the real part of this.
So, you don't have to write the

00:38:03.052 --> 00:38:05.369
whole thing out as a complex
number.

00:38:05.369 --> 00:38:08.216
In other words,
you don't have to do all the

00:38:08.216 --> 00:38:11.262
multiplications.
You only have to find the real

00:38:11.262 --> 00:38:14.639
part of it, which is what?
Well, e to the negative x

00:38:14.639 --> 00:38:16.890
will be simply a factor.

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:20.068
That's a real factor,
which I don't have to worry

00:38:20.068 --> 00:38:21.922
about.
And, in that category,

00:38:21.922 --> 00:38:25.762
I can include the two also.
So, I only have to pick out the

00:38:25.762 --> 00:38:30.000
real part of this times that.
And, what's that?

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.609
It's negative cosine x.

00:38:32.609 --> 00:38:37.137
And, the other real part comes
from the product of these two

00:38:37.137 --> 00:38:40.054
things.
I times negative i is one.

00:38:40.054 --> 00:38:42.740
And, what's left is sine x.

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.733
So, that's the answer to the

00:38:45.733 --> 00:38:48.803
question.
That's the integral of e to the

00:38:48.803 --> 00:38:52.641
negative x * cosine x.

00:38:52.641 --> 00:38:56.401
Notice, it's a completely
straightforward process.

00:38:56.401 --> 00:39:00.853
It doesn't involve any tricks,
unless you call going to the

00:39:00.853 --> 00:39:04.855
complex domain a trick.
But, I don't.

00:39:04.855 --> 00:39:08.541
As soon as you see in this
course the combination of e to

00:39:08.541 --> 00:39:11.635
ax times cosine bx or sine bx,

00:39:11.635 --> 00:39:14.334
you should immediately think,

00:39:14.334 --> 00:39:18.151
and you're going to get plenty
of it in the couple of weeks

00:39:18.151 --> 00:39:21.113
after the exam,
you are going to get plenty of

00:39:21.113 --> 00:39:25.129
it, and you should immediately
think of passing to the complex

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:27.498
domain.
That will be the standard way

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:32.744
we solve such problems.
So, you're going to get lots of

00:39:32.744 --> 00:39:37.083
practice doing this.
But, this was the first time.

00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:42.041
Now, I guess in the time
remaining, I'm not going to talk

00:39:42.041 --> 00:39:44.875
about in the notes,
i, R, at all,

00:39:44.875 --> 00:39:49.921
but I would like to talk a
little bit about the extraction

00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:54.437
of the complex roots,
since you have a problem about

00:39:54.437 --> 00:39:59.572
that and because it's another
beautiful application of this

00:39:59.572 --> 00:40:04.000
polar way of writing complex
numbers.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.978
Suppose I want to calculate.
So, the basic problem is to

00:40:09.978 --> 00:40:15.956
calculate the nth roots of one.
Now, in the real domain,

00:40:15.956 --> 00:40:21.826
of course, the answer is,
sometimes there's only one of

00:40:21.826 --> 00:40:26.826
these, one itself,
and sometimes there are two,

00:40:26.826 --> 00:40:34.000
depending on whether n is an
even number or an odd number.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.719
But, in the complex domain,
there are always n answers as

00:40:40.719 --> 00:40:45.880
complex numbers.
One always has n nth roots.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.679
Now, where are they?
Well, geometrically,

00:40:50.679 --> 00:40:54.400
it's easy to see where they
are.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:01.000
Here's the unit circle.
Here's the unit circle.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.428
One of the roots is right here
at one.

00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:09.246
Now, where are the others?
Well, do you see that if I

00:41:09.246 --> 00:41:14.990
place, let's take n equal five
because that's a nice,

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.789
dramatic number.
If I place these peptides

00:41:18.789 --> 00:41:23.236
equally spaced points around the
unit circle, so,

00:41:23.236 --> 00:41:26.479
in other words,
this angle is alpha.

00:41:26.479 --> 00:41:32.951
Alpha should be the angle.
What would be the expression

00:41:32.951 --> 00:41:37.168
for that?
If there were five such equally

00:41:37.168 --> 00:41:43.704
spaced, it would be one fifth of
all the way around the circle.

00:41:43.704 --> 00:41:47.816
All the way around the circle
is two pi.

00:41:47.816 --> 00:41:52.560
So, it will be one fifth of two
pi in radians.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:58.674
Now, it's geometrically clear
that those are the five fifth

00:41:58.674 --> 00:42:02.786
roots because,
how do I multiply complex

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:06.966
numbers?
I multiply the moduli.

00:42:06.966 --> 00:42:11.794
Well, they all have moduli one.
So, if I take this guy,

00:42:11.794 --> 00:42:16.622
let's call that complex number,
oh, I hate to give you,

00:42:16.622 --> 00:42:20.288
they are always giving you
Greek notation.

00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:23.506
All right, why not torture you?
Zeta.

00:42:23.506 --> 00:42:28.602
At least you will learn how to
make a zeta in this period,

00:42:28.602 --> 00:42:34.010
small zeta, so that's zeta.
There's our fifth root of

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:36.906
unity.
It's the first one that occurs

00:42:36.906 --> 00:42:40.525
on the circle that isn't the
trivial one, one.

00:42:40.525 --> 00:42:44.546
Now, do you see that,
how would I calculate zeta to

00:42:44.546 --> 00:42:47.764
the fifth?
Well, if I write zeta in polar

00:42:47.764 --> 00:42:51.946
notation, what would it be?
The modulus would be one,

00:42:51.946 --> 00:42:56.369
and therefore it will be
simply, the r will be one

00:42:56.369 --> 00:42:59.265
for it because its length is
one.

00:42:59.265 --> 00:43:03.139
Its modulus is one.
What's up here?

00:43:03.139 --> 00:43:06.784
I times that angle,
and that angle is two pi over

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:09.291
five. So, there's just,

00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:11.797
geometrically I see where zeta
is.

00:43:11.797 --> 00:43:15.746
And, if I translate that
geometry into the e to the i

00:43:15.746 --> 00:43:20.379
theta form for
the formula, I see that it must

00:43:20.379 --> 00:43:23.721
be that number.
Now, let's say somebody gives

00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:27.898
you that number and says,
hey, is this the fifth root of

00:43:27.898 --> 00:43:30.025
one?
I forbid you to draw any

00:43:30.025 --> 00:43:33.418
pictures.
What would you do?

00:43:33.418 --> 00:43:36.571
You say, well,
I'll raise it to the fifth

00:43:36.571 --> 00:43:39.487
power.
What's zeta to the fifth power?

00:43:39.487 --> 00:43:43.743
Well, it's e to the i two pi /
five,

00:43:43.743 --> 00:43:48.000
and now, if I think of raising
that to the fifth power,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.704
by the exponential law,
that's the same thing as

00:43:51.704 --> 00:43:54.778
putting a five in front of the
exponent.

00:43:54.778 --> 00:43:57.615
So, this times five,
and what's that?

00:43:57.615 --> 00:44:01.241
That's e to the i times two pi.

00:44:01.241 --> 00:44:06.675
And, what is that?
Well, it's the angle.

00:44:06.675 --> 00:44:13.173
If the angle is two pi,
I've gone all the way around

00:44:13.173 --> 00:44:17.633
the circle and come back here
again.

00:44:17.633 --> 00:44:22.729
I've got the number one.
So, this is one.

00:44:22.729 --> 00:44:28.335
Since the argument,
two pi, is the same as an

00:44:28.335 --> 00:44:35.088
angle, it's the same as,
well, let's not write it that

00:44:35.088 --> 00:44:39.563
way. It's wrong.

00:44:39.563 --> 00:44:52.611
It's just wrong since two pi
and zero are the same angle.

00:44:52.611 --> 00:45:01.000
So, I could replace this by
zero.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:09.267
Oh dear.
Well, I guess I have to stop

00:45:09.267 --> 00:45:22.357
right in the middle of things.
So, you're going to have to

00:45:22.357 --> 00:45:36.136
read a little bit about how to
find roots in order to do that

00:45:36.136 --> 00:45:44.403
problem.
And, we will go on from that

00:45:44.403 --> 00:45:45.403
point Friday.
