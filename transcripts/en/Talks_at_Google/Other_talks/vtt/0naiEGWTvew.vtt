BEN CHU: Hey, guys.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.950
Welcome to today's session
of Google Author Talks.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.030
My name is Ben Chu.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.445
I'm here to introduce a dear
friend of mine, whom I've know

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.760
for the last 15 years.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.390
It's been really wonderful
seeing his life's journey

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.690
unfold over the last decade.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.870
He'll be talking about something
that's pretty close

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.200
and dear to my heart, as a guy
with a kid, another kid on the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.940
way, and my wife, and--

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.220
just balancing the demands of
family versus my spiritual

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.970
passions and hobbies, and
work of course, has

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:29.870
always been a struggle.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.170
And I feel like that's fairly
common here at Google.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.250
So Gary's actually given
this talk to many

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.900
large companies before.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.980
He has a lot of experience
doing it.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.200
So I'm really excited here
it for the first time.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.670
I'm sure it will be
very practical--

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.990
lot of good wisdom here.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.620
So let's everyone give him
a warm Google welcome.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.780
Gary Kunath.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.190
GARY KUNATH: Thank you.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.200
It's really my pleasure
to be here.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.260
It's my first time on
the Google campus.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.180
So--

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.450
this is really quite a treat
to see everybody playing

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.080
volleyball.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.320
And when I started at AT&amp;T, you
didn't play volleyball at

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.150
AT&amp;T. You just came to work.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.260
And that was it-- boom, done.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.900
The reason I'm here-- and
listen, I'm not a

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.320
psychiatrist.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.820
And I'm not a psychologist.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.100
I'm not going to talk
about rainbows,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.400
unicorns, and lollipops.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.290
What I am is a business guy.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.980
And I started from
the ground up.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.790
And I was hungry.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.420
I thought net worth was the
secret to life worth.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.950
And I worked really
hard for it.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.920
But I made some very critical
mistakes along the way.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.700
And those mistakes cost me
in my personal life.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.500
And the reason I'm here, it's my
passion now, to share that

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.200
story with others.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.590
Because my goal's to have
everybody have the greatest

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.890
life they can have.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.095
I want to maximize joy
and contentment

00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:43.810
in everybody's life.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.090
And I want to share with you
how I figured it out.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.240
I was just so thankful
I figured out

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.980
before it was too late.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.960
Because some people don't.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.090
So last month, I was riding
a plane from Montreal.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.760
And I happened to sit
near this guy.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.360
And I don't--

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.080
I never really talk to people.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.400
Not that I'm unsociable,
I just--

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.010
I like to read.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.310
But the guy started
to talk to me.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.930
And he went, what you do?

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.440
What do you do?

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.660
What do you do?

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.340
That kind of stuff.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.020
That's probably why don't
talk to people.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.699
Because it's boring.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:15.080
But so we finally got to the
point where I said, well,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.890
where are you headed?

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.460
And he goes, oh man.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.680
He goes, I'm going to China.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.980
Three weeks, man.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.300
I'm going to China.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.850
He goes, it's awesome
over there.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.650
He goes, and from there, I'm
just going to scoot over to

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.180
Singapore for another
three weeks.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.980
He goes, this job--

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.620
I've seen the world.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.500
It's the best job ever.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.430
He goes, I'm going to come over
for maybe about a week,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.160
maybe three days.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.940
I haven't decided yet.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.610
And then I'm going to go to
South America for a month.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.780
Now it was funny.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.580
Because as I'm listening
to this guy--

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.990
if I was in my early 20s, I know
exactly what I would have

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.350
been thinking.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.241
I would have said, Oh,
I want to be you.

00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:55.210
You are so cool!

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.800
You're going to everywhere.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.150
It's what I dreamed of.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.010
I want that job.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.690
But I'm not my 20s.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.850
And I knew better.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.590
And I knew that what he was
giving me was what I would

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.710
call psychological camouflage
for what was really going on

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.750
in his life, which is not an
uncommon thing, by the way.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.710
And I asked him one question.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.340
I just looked at him.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.720
And I said, so tell me, with all
this travel, how was that

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.910
affected your relationship
at home with your

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.820
wife and your kids?

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.600
And it was dead silence.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.120
I'm not kidding you.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.630
The color drained out
of this guy's face.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.770
He just went, whew.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.820
He goes, I come home--

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.110
decisions are made in the
house, I have no say.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.090
He goes, I go to discipline the
kids, they look at me like

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.540
I'm a stranger.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.160
But what was amazing to me is
as I saw the pain on this

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.480
guy's face-- and here he is
trying to camouflage this, as

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.930
though he's got this
great life.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.320
But when he comes home, there's
nothing going on.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.620
And I felt bad for the guy.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.090
And I also understood the guy.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.630
Because for short period in
my life, that was me.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.740
And I knew what that was like.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.180
I know how that feels.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.190
And sometimes you convince
yourself you're doing this for

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.140
the good of your family.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.180
You're sacrificing so
your kids and your

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.310
family don't have to.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.310
You're sacrificing so they
can have a better life.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.370
And in part, that's true.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.750
But the reality this,
they just want you.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.430
So I want to talk about not so
much about making a living.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.680
I've done the corporate thing.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.110
I did the entrepreneurial
thing.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.990
I made my bones.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.550
I'm fine.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.100
But I'm going to talk
about making a life.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.280
It doesn't take that much
effort to make a living.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.860
People do it all
over the world.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.830
But making a life is
not that easy.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.140
And that's what I want
to spend some time to

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.390
talk with you about.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.000
It used to be that people
thought, including myself,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.090
that professional well being
drives personal well being.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.350
And I believed this too.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.780
I attended a retirement
party of a CEO of

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.480
a Fortune 100 company.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.100
You would know it.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.460
I won't mention it.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.980
And I listened to the CEO's
retirement speech.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.920
And I will never forget it.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.620
He got up there.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.950
And it was a room full of
maybe 300-400 people.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.910
And he sat there, and he goes,
I know many of you in this

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.930
room want to know what it
takes to do my job.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.300
He goes, and I'm going to tell
you right now what it takes to

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.300
have my job.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.810
And it was funny because
I watched the crowd.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.860
You could see the young
stallions going, all right

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.170
baby, here we go.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.260
Launch pad to the top.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.310
So they're just waiting
for this.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.070
And he goes, four weeks ago, I
walked my oldest daughter down

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.910
the aisle to give her
hand in marriage.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.680
He said, and as I was walking
her down the aisle, I realized

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.550
I couldn't tell you what
her favorite color is.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.140
He goes, I realized I couldn't
tell you her favorite book

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.410
that you ever read or any
book that she ever read.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.700
I couldn't tell you the last
name of her best friend.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.080
He goes, that's what it
takes to do my job.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.290
And if you want it,
you could have it.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.130
And what struck me about
that was this--

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.890
here's a guy who was,
no question, was

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.980
a captain of industry.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.200
No question.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.570
And yet he wasn't even a
deckhand in his own life.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.520
And he was-- it was a
combination of frustration and

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.280
anger, but mostly at himself.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.570
Because he let it get
away from him.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.030
He knew there were memories that
he was never ever going

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.350
to get to make.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.520
There was events in his life
that he was not there for.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.870
And you can't get them back.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.930
Yeah, he's got cash.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.780
He's got big, big houses, nice
cars, private schools.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.890
But he's got nothing.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.200
And I've always believed--

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.420
to me, it didn't make sense to
have to love either your work

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.020
life or love your home life.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.430
I wanted to love
my whole life.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:15.650
So I figured out for me what
the top ways are to drive

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.060
happiness and to be happy.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.200
Because I believe that it's this
equation is really the

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.870
other way around.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.260
I believe it's personal well
being the drives professional

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.030
well being.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.650
I live that myself.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.970
When I started to focus, when
I was focusing on the

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.590
professional well begin,
yeah, I was kicking it.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.560
I was-- pisch!

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.770
Money was coming in.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.500
Everything you would
ever want, I had.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.500
The problem was when I got home,
what you want there, I

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.820
didn't have.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.490
It cost me.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.760
So I said, I got to fix this.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.250
So I focused on personal
well being.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.840
And what I learned was this--

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.030
the happier you are in your
life, the better you are in

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.360
every other aspect
of your life.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.030
And that includes work.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.740
I was a smarter entrepreneur.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.880
I worked better.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.820
I was happier.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.120
I had more fun.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.840
I was more successful--

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.550
all that stuff because
I focused on

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.780
personal well being.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.500
I put that first.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.760
So let's talk more about that.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.740
You're very lucky to
be here at Google.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.700
You are.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.370
Because Google, I can see just
by the short time I've been on

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.250
the campus, values its people.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.160
Now, let's be honest--

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.600
they get their pound
of flesh too.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.420
OK?

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.850
It's not a secret why they want
you to stay 12 hours a

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.330
day and have dinner and
everything else.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.630
Because you go and bang
out some more work.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.100
I get it.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.806
But it's all right.

00:08:35.806 --> 00:08:36.799
It's OK.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:37.610
That's fine.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.600
I'm all for that.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.710
As long as you're
happy, right?

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:45.660
But, to me, it's what happens
when you leave here.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.460
Now you look at this.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.220
I'll walk through
this with you.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.260
But this is the landscape
outside of Google.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.200
"Some companies believe we can
ignore the deep realities of

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.460
human existence.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.420
We can pretend that
emotions are not

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.710
part of our work lives.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.220
We can pretend we don't have
families or health crisis or

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.500
deep worries.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.110
In essence, companies want to
take the complexity of human

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.120
life and organize it away.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.630
It's not part of the story
we want to believe.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.620
People can be viewed as machines
and controlled to

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.220
perform with the same efficiency
and predictability.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.440
And in our machine
organizations, we try to

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.370
extinguish individuality
in order to

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.710
reach our goal of certainty.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.260
We trade uniqueness for
control and barter our

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.190
humanness for petty performance
measures."

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.830
It's interesting.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.900
You look at some of these
experiential companies that

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.570
rely on the customer
experience,

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.430
for instance, airlines.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.020
What was it?

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.810
Marriott?

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.120
No.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.100
Ritz Carlton.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.340
Singapore Airlines.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.200
And there's another chain
that wanted--

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.930
they invested $6 million to
teach people how to be

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.610
themselves.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.110
You wonder where did
the wheels come

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.020
off the cart there?

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.020
At what point did they say,
no, don't be you because

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.210
nobody likes you.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.860
So be something else.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.830
Where did they gum
up the gears?

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:08.580
It's because some of these
companies try to do force fit

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.980
these people into these molds.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.090
They want-- but they hire these
wonderfully gifted and

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:12.830
talented people.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.040
And then they force them into
this mold-- say, listen, when

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.650
a customer says this,
you say that.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.850
When they say this,
you say this.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.300
You say that.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.530
And that's how it goes.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.080
And you get rid of this
individual freedom that makes

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.010
people great.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.960
So bringing humanity back to the
business is a huge issue

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.540
for many companies out there.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.430
Now you look at the landscape
of the people.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:38.440
Interesting enough, American
Psychology Association-- "48%

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.800
of employees say their employers
don't value good

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.230
work life balance." Some,
I know, don't.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.710
I've been there.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.430
I've seen it.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.700
Some pretend.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.680
They put nice posters
in a lunchroom.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.350
And it looks good for the profit
sharing plan and the

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.720
annual report.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.400
You have to get in underneath
the sea what's

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400
really going on.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.150
But this is a really
huge issue.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.950
So here's what people
are valuing--

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.370
well being of their
families, and

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.080
themselves, outside of work.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.510
And yet many of them
don't believe the

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.140
companies feel the same.

00:11:16.433 --> 00:11:18.150
The Aspen Institute--

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.710
61% of the people surveyed there
said they're not living

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:21.840
the American dream.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.620
75% think it's broken.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.255
70% of the people, and this is
out of the Families and Work

00:11:27.255 --> 00:11:30.790
Life Institute said they would
trade promotions and pay

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.890
increases for family
well being.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.070
Over 70% of Americans
over the age of 30

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.970
get no regular exercise.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:43.430
And only 14% take vacations
of two weeks or longer.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.920
Now you think, oh,
that's crazy.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.570
No, it isn't crazy.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:47.850
That's what's going on.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.450
I find people put more time
into the planning their

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.380
vacation than they do
planning their life.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.230
It boggles my mind.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.730
Why is that?

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.690
In Europe, you would never
see a 14 day vacation.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.490
If you said 14 days, you would
have a revolution.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:07.270
OK?

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:14.380
So here are what I see as some
tremendous life limiters.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.870
These are things that bring
us back and bring us down.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.450
Regret over the past--

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.310
worrying about what happened
that you can't change anymore.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:22.690
Regret over the past-- oh,
should of done this.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.330
Should have done-- oh, if
I'd only done that.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.270
You've got that go.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.470
Resentment and envy
in the present--

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.580
resentment and envy are the two
emotions that it's been

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:38.500
medically proven will literally
dissolve or

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.930
eradicate your immune system.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:44.090
They are physically unhealthy
emotions for you.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.690
And fear the future--

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.410
fear of the future
is a big one.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.460
It's why we don't do things.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.460
It's why we don't
roll the dice.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.240
It's why we don't
take chances.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.490
It's interesting.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.790
As we've evolved over the last
one and a half million years

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:05.280
our brains have developed a
capacity to simulate outcomes.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.380
We can simulate outcomes.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.050
Our ancestors could not
simulate outcomes.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.100
They would have to look
at a fire go, yeah,

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.020
that's pretty hot.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.420
My foot's burning.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.780
We can go, yeah, no.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:15.330
It makes sense.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.200
We'd better stay
away from that.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.330
We can simulate.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.570
But the problem is, even though
that's a beautiful gift

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.230
to have, the problem is when
we simulate outcomes in our

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:29.600
mind, we usually make them more
negative than they are.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.240
So we don't do things.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.240
We think they're going to be
worse than they really are.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.250
I don't know you've ever done
things, and you said, well, I

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.520
never thought I could
run a 5K.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:38.930
And then you do.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.430
And you go, whoa, can't
believe I did that.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.550
So that's just one of the
things that we do.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.560
So fear of the future is
a huge, huge issue.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.140
And it is a major
life limiter.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:55.300
Now, the science
of happiness--

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.560
Let me talk about this.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.586
Because when I used to think
about-- well, because I used

00:14:00.586 --> 00:14:01.410
to do talks--

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:03.770
and business talks,
value creation.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.150
One of the businesses I owned
was sales training, high-end

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.180
sales training company.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.380
We used to do all the sales
training for the top companies

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.230
all over the world.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:18.070
And I used to think about, OK,
well how did I not focus on

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:18.560
life worth?

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.470
How did I turn this corner?

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.200
And people would ask me that.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.440
And I would tell them, this
is what I've experienced.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.320
And this is what I know the
leads to a great life.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.510
But then they'd say, well,
what's the science behind it?

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:35.620
And it really stumped me.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.240
So I went and I did some
research on the

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.620
science behind it.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.465
And here's what I know
about happiness--

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.290
we have the capability.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.860
The other thing that our minds
have evolved into is allowing

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.700
us to have the capability
to synthesize

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.010
happiness in our minds.

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.000
And this comes out of
Harvard University.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.550
There's two forms
of happiness.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.650
There's natural happiness.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.380
You're happy when you
get what you want.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.090
OK?

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.820
Fair statement.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.340
But then there's synthetic or
synthesized happiness, where

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.400
you're happy when you don't
get what you want.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.650
That's a big deal.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.370
It gives us the ability--
and I'll show you.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:28.200
It allows us-- this one thing
allows us the ability to take

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.410
situations that aren't very
pleasant or are negative and

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.990
turn them, in our minds, into
a situation that are OK.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.850
I'll give an example.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.600
Another study, I think was out
of Villanova, where they

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.410
looked at an individual who won
a $200 million lottery and

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.030
individual became
a paraplegic.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.476
And they said, which do you
think had the happier outcome?

00:15:51.476 --> 00:15:52.660
Well, it's pretty obvious.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.400
You might say, well, of course,
the lottery winner.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.390
But the truth be told, at the
end of 12 months, they went

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.260
and measured the happiness
of each one.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.280
There was absolutely no
statistical difference in the

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.830
happiness between
the paraplegic

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:06.700
of the lottery winner.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.690
None.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.550
Because that's the
skill we have.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.530
It's almost like a psychological
immune system we

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.800
have in our head, where we can
take situations, and we could

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.220
make the best of them
regardless.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:21.340
I was at the X-Games for
the paraplegics.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.830
This guy was doing the
downhill slalom.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:25.440
And I asked him.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.320
I was fascinated.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.630
This guy was unbelievable.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.460
And he was going downhill in
the giant slalom skiing.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.320
I got to talk him.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.360
And he turned to me, and he
said, my life is better than

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.535
your best vacation.

00:16:38.535 --> 00:16:38.960
And you know what?

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.410
And he meant it.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.850
And you could look at this guy
and say, how could that be?

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.680
But in his mind, there was
not even a question.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.730
And I said, well,
well why can't

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.520
everybody feel like that.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.491
And the answer is, we can.

00:16:53.491 --> 00:16:56.890
We all have this capability
in our head.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.080
The key is some activate
it better than others.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.750
So I'm activate a better
than others.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.449
Sometimes it takes a significant
emotional event in

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:08.269
our life to really ground
us and say, what

00:17:08.269 --> 00:17:09.270
am I thinking about?

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.530
I'm worrying about
all these things.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.470
And these things aren't
important at all.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.680
So when you look at the science
of happiness, you look

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.819
at it like this.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.540
50% of your happiness
is a set point.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.270
It's like when you're born.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.010
You have green eyes.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.640
You have brown eyes.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.450
You have blue eyes.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:26.829
Done.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:27.490
I mean that's it.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.520
Boom.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.820
10% percent of your happiness
is circumstantial.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.120
But 40% of your happiness
is derived

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.880
from intentional activity.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.320
In other words, there are
literally things you can do to

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.000
be happier.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.890
And why you wouldn't want to
be happier is beyond me.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.420
But there are things
you can do.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.880
People want to be happier.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.140
But sometimes they
don't know how.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.390
So here is what I
know to be true.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.750
These are my 10 points
of life.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.550
These are the things I know
and research supports will

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.710
absolutely maximize joy and
contentment in your life.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:06.070
Now I'm going to go into the
ones that are highlighted in

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.490
red more deeply.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.240
But I'll cover them.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.100
And I'll just touch on these
for time issues.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.200
But money doesn't
make you rich.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.400
Expressing gratitude matters.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.580
Good goes around.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.340
Practicing the art
of savoring.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.190
The power of perspective.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.710
That literally saved my life.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.120
I have to tell you.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.500
The belief in something
bigger than you.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.890
Life is fun.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:33.890
And fun is good.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.190
Relationship refinement,
thinning the herd.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.650
We'll talk about that.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.530
And being your authentic self.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.270
And then, preparing a last
lecture for your family.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.500
Now let me just touch on the
ones that aren't highlighted.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.450
Gratitude matters.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.400
Gratitude is one of the single
most important things that

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.520
contribute to one's
happiness--

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.230
going and being grateful
for what you have.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:05.080
I don't know this, but sometimes
we can take for

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.840
granted things that we
have that we should

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.700
never take for granted.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.280
But because we have them, we
just overlook them because

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.530
they're part of our lives.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.050
I always.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.760
I'm a big believer in thank-you
notes, a huge

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.570
believer in thank-you notes.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.210
And I mean handwritten, not
the electronic ones.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.480
I know that's a--

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.720
to me, that's like
a drive-through

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.890
window kind of thing.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.440
I like the handwritten written
notes I make a point the write

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.400
handwritten notes thanking
people for just doing

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.700
something that mattered to me.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.880
And you know what?

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.720
It takes me five minutes or less
and the cost of a stamp.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.490
And they keep it forever.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.390
I literally have boxes
of thank you

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.580
cards that I've received.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.440
And I look at them when
I feel crappy.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.860
I read them.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.200
It's such a little
thing to do.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.970
But it's such a huge thing do.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.420
And I make that a point.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.070
All my kids have thank
you cards.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.255
Everybody has thank you cards.

00:20:10.255 --> 00:20:12.460
That's what we do.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.145
Now, believing in something
bigger than you--

00:20:16.145 --> 00:20:19.310
I'm not try to make a spiritual
comment here.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.710
But people want to be part
of something bigger than

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.780
themselves.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.810
My suspicion is that's probably
a big part of why

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.040
people join Google.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.100
You're part of something bigger
than you, something

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.880
that really is changing
things.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.300
That's a big thing.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.770
But on the other hand, on the
life side, I hate to say this,

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.360
but bad things happen
to good people.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.680
Adversity plays no favorites.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.150
And adversity finds us all.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.560
You will not miss it.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.920
It will come to you, if
it has not already.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.590
And these things can be big--

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:07.960
death, loss of a loved one,
financial ruin, addictions,

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.600
victim of a crime, disabling
accident.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.100
These things are huge.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:21.690
And I believe they're so
much bigger than us.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:25.800
So it's important for me, I
think, to believe in something

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.350
bigger than you.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.430
Because these things will
crush you if you

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.310
try to stand alone.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.190
And the truth be told, we need
and adversity in our lives.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.920
We need it.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.850
Because it's the only way
you could find out

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.070
who you really are.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.600
Look, anyone can be a rock star
when life is perfect.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.140
But when life isn't so
perfect, then the

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.010
real you shows up.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.060
That's how you find
out who you are.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:56.800
You can either be a camper, a
climber, or quitter when it

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.640
comes with adversity, if you
were to use a mountain

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.770
climbing analogy.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.220
Some people just quit in
the face of adversity.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.670
Some people camp, hole up, cover
themselves up, hoping

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.450
everything blows away.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.500
And some people climb.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.740
But we need adversity
in our lives.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.990
I can tell you.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.390
When my father passed
away- and my father

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.230
and I were very close.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.390
And he had brain cancer.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:28.985
And I was in the hospital
room with him, and--

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:36.110
I was CEO of my own company.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.360
I graduated from the best
business schools.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:44.110
I had lectured at the best
business schools.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.940
I had money.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:49.050
I had contacts I had juice.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.100
But let me tell you something.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:56.130
I was so far out of my
league on this one.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.450
I can't even describe the
feeling of complete and abject

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:03.110
helplessness fine had watching
my father die.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:07.310
And I could do nothing
about it.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:08.560
Nothing.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.810
And if I didn't believe that
there was some, something

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:18.840
bigger at play in that room, I
don't know how I would have

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.860
gotten through that.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.090
It still is a tough thing.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.790
But I'm a big believer that
believing in something bigger

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:33.390
than you will put you in a
position to come out OK on

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.720
life's adversities that
you will get handed.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.310
Being your authentic self--

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.030
when I first left--

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.410
I left AT&amp;T. And I started
my own business.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.650
It's pretty scary, right?

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:46.690
I was a single income.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:47.210
I had a wife.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:48.180
And I three small kids.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.910
If I failed, we didn't eat.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.100
Fear is a great motivator.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.470
If I failed, we didn't have
a house to live in.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.970
Failure was not an
option for me.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.870
So when I went into this
consulting business--

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:02.610
I don't know what
I was thinking.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:03.410
Maybe I was stupid.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.220
I don't know.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:12.160
Actually, my first desk was my
six-year-old son's Play-Doh

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.390
Playskool desk in my basement.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.140
And I had the little
laptop on it.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.510
I look like Schroeder
from Peanuts.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.960
And when customers would call
me, I didn't want them to

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.000
think I'm working under basement
on a Play-Doh desk.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.610
Who wants to put their sales
strategy in the hands of a guy

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.742
that's got his desk near
the canned pickles

00:24:35.742 --> 00:24:37.190
, down in the basement.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.720
So I remember, I would
answer the phone.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.820
And I'm thinking, I don't know,
consultants they have

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.360
high office buildings with
ceiling to floor windows.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.640
And they're over the park.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.000
So I've got to act that way.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.665
So when someone would call, and
I would pick up the phone,

00:24:54.665 --> 00:24:57.020
and my dog would bark.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:57.600
And would go nuts.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.270
I'd go, ah!

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:00.750
And they'd go, was that a dog?

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:01.640
And of course, I'm thinking.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.500
Well, I won't tell them
I have a dog.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.940
Consultants don't have dogs.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.050
They don't like mammals.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.140
They're not human.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.900
So I go, oh yeah, it's a dog.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.630
I'm at the animal research
center at Pfizer.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:17.620
I made stuff up just because I
didn't want them to think I'm

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.630
in my basement.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:23.000
And what was interesting to me
was after my business became

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.180
really successful, I decided
to just be me.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.660
As frightening as that is,
I decided to just be me.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.220
Because I didn't care.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.050
I didn't need business.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:36.720
I was good.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.385
So when they would call, and the
dog would bark, they'd go,

00:25:39.385 --> 00:25:40.450
hey, is that a dog?

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.200
I'd go, yeah, it's a dog.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:42.710
I have two.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.010
They're miniature long-haired
dachshunds.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:45.090
They're idiots.

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:46.990
They'd go, oh, I have a
dachshund, too, and

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.500
that dog's an idiot.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:52.590
So what I found was
being myself--

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.430
not only did it eliminate the
stress of wearing someone

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:56.680
else's face--

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.000
it was so liberating for me.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.040
And in life, it's all about
how you show up anyway.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.990
So that was a lesson
that I had learned.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.870
People like authenticity.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.010
People like that.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.060
Customers like it.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.780
Everybody likes authentic.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.750
And then last thing is preparing
a last lecture for

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.680
your family.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.620
This comes from a concept called
ethical wills and was

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.160
around a long time before Dr.
Randy Pausch of Carnegie

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.170
Mellon made it popular.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.340
You may have seen that video.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.900
And he called it
a last lecture.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.850
I had--

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.020
I think it's a good
thing to do.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.330
I did that for my son when he
graduated from college.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:37.160
I wrote--

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:37.830
because people--

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:42.140
you have wills to divide
up your stuff.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:48.570
But as a parent, I don't want my
kids guessing who I really

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.820
was, what I believed, what I
valued, what mattered to me,

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.700
what I think is important
in life.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.990
Because you can't always flip
the cards on the table.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.560
You got to show-- you got
to be a dad sometimes.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.365
So I wrote an ethical will
about what I valued.

00:27:03.365 --> 00:27:05.400
And I give them that as
a graduation gift.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.450
And actually, believe it or not,
it's printed as I gave it

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:12.090
to him in the book, and he
still has it to this day.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.380
These are some of the
10 points of life

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.330
I believe are important.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.100
But now I'll go into the ones
that are more highlighted.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:24.380
Money doesn't make you rich.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.300
Life worth versus net worth.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.880
Here's what I would tell
you about that.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.000
And let me be clear about
what I'm not saying.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.790
What I'm not saying is,
don't work hard.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.010
Not saying that.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:36.860
I worked hard.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.550
And I still work hard
when I want to work.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.660
But what I'm saying is, don't
focus on net worth at the

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.300
expense of life worth.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.610
And many people do that.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.070
Many people do that.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.630
I know people with tremendously
high net worths

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:55.840
that I would consider miserable

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.770
failures as human beings.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:00.660
And yet I know people that
barely make ends meet, are

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.580
barely paying their bills, and
they're some of the most happy

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.510
and successful people I know.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.000
What I found when I lectured to
talked a lot of executives

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.930
is net worth can be a very
intoxicating spin cycle,

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:16.850
especially when you start
seeing in the

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:18.140
money roll, the bonuses.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.625
Ah, maybe I'll stay
one more year.

00:28:19.625 --> 00:28:20.950
Maybe I'll do it.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.650
And it can get you.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:28.640
Now if you're in the early
phases of your career.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.280
And you're just starting out.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.650
And you got enough money to make
to get things, then, yes,

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:34.790
of course you focus on that.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.470
But there will be a time in your
life when you will have

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:40.260
to choose which governs which.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.840
And I'm telling you the only
reason you care about net

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.290
worth that all is to underwrite
life worth.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.830
But sometimes we forget.

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.040
I had a friend of mine
who was talking to

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.480
this other guy who--

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.460
he was a millionaire.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.660
And he was chirping
a little bit.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.980
He was going, yeah,
I have this.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:55.670
I have that.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:56.110
I have this.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.330
And my friend, who wasn't
a millionaire,

00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:59.850
was a regular guy.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:03.760
He goes, yeah, let me
tell something.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.620
I have something you'll
never have.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.240
He goes, what's that?

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.720
He goes, I have enough.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:11.960
And the guy just stopped
in his tracks.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.750
And you know what?

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.910
It was a perfect answer.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:17.350
But that's that hardest thing
for people to figure out.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.140
When do you know you've
had enough.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.340
See when I learned what really
mattered in life

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.000
and focused on that.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.670
And that happiness helped me
even more, professionally.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.660
It was when I had nothing.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.050
I had nothing when
I started out.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.840
Then I had something.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:39.130
That I lost my family because I
was a workaholic, unlike now

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.700
where I'm a workafrolic.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.190
OK?

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:44.280
And then I had nothing again.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.890
But that was the most important
lesson I learned.

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:48.760
And you're going to hear many
CEOs come in and tell you they

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.060
lost their families.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:50.630
They got divorced.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:51.270
They're not going to
tell you this.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.510
They're going to tell you
everything's great.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.140
But everything isn't great.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.390
I've seen them.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.710
I learned the most
important thing.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.540
And that was, when I had
nothing, I learned how to be

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.050
happy without anything.

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:07.280
And that was the
most important.

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.800
I learned what I did not
need to be happy.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.950
I was perfectly happy that
I didn't have a cool car.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.620
I could get around.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:19.800
But that forced me to

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.550
understand what really mattered.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.900
Life worth versus net worth.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.200
Very, very important piece.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.500
And when you come to terms with
what matters most to you,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.880
and put the priority right
spot, it's a big thing.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.730
Now this is the only
trick I know.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:35.940
I'm a old guy.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.170
This is the only trick I
know, so bear with me.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.710
No, you don't have vertigo.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.190
It is just my technological
savvy shining through.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:48.590
But here's what I want
to tell you.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:50.340
This is true.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.716
People start to live the most
after they have faced death.

00:30:54.716 --> 00:30:58.990
And I want play for you a
short video so you can--

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:11.424
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:11.424 --> 00:31:14.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:21.400
-Imagine a big explosion as you
climb through 3,000 feet.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.970
Imagine a plane full of smoke.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.160
Imagine an engine going clack,
clack, clack, clack, clack,

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.930
clack, clack.

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.780
Sounds scary.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.670
Well I had a unique
seat that day.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.030
I was sitting in 1D.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.620
I was the only one who could
talk to the flight attendants.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.370
So I looked at them
right away.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.690
And they said, no problem.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.160
We probably hit some birds.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.360
The pilot had already turned
the plane around.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.660
And we weren't that far.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.720
You could see Manhattan.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.430
Two minutes later, three things

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.460
happened at the same time.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.451
The pilot lines up the plane
with the Hudson River.

00:31:57.451 --> 00:31:59.500
It's usually not the route.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.000
-He turns off the engines.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.410
Now imagine being on the
plane with no sound.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:10.956
And then he says three words,
unemotional three words that I

00:32:10.956 --> 00:32:12.400
have ever heard.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.880
He says, brace for impact.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.020
I didn't have to talk to the
flight attendant anymore.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:21.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:22.680
-I could see it in her eyes.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.790
It was terror.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.720
Life was over.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.230
I want to share with you
three things I learned

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.920
about myself that day.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.330
I learned that it all changes
in an instant.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.140
We have this bucket list.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.480
We have these things we
want to do in life.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.020
I thought about all the
people wanted to

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.720
reach out that I didn't.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.980
All the fences I
wanted to mend.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:47.920
All the experiences I wanted
to had, and I never did.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:51.350
As I thought about that, later
on, I came up with a saying,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.790
which is, I collect bad wines.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.670
Because if the wine is ready
and the person there, I'm

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.830
opening it.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.350
I no longer want to postpone
anything in life.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.400
And that urgency, that
purpose, has

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.860
really changed my life.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.580
The second thing I learned
that day--

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.820
and this as we clear the George
Washington Bridge,

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.164
which was by not a lot--

00:33:14.164 --> 00:33:18.210
I thought about, wow, I really
feel one real regret.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:19.760
I've lived a good life.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.410
In my own humanity and mistakes,
I've tried to get

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.580
better at everything I try.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:28.700
But in my humanity, I also
allow my ego to get in.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.100
And I regretted the time I
wasted in things that did not

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.500
matter with people
that matter.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.820
I thought about my relationship
with my wife,

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.600
with my friends, with people.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.230
And after, as I reflected on
that, I decided to eliminate

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.130
negative energy from my life.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.020
It's not perfect.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.330
It's a lot better.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.100
I've not had a fight with
my wife in two years.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.610
It feels great.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:53.870
I no longer trying
to be right.

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:56.900
I choose to be happy.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.650
The third thing I learned, and
this is as your mental clock

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.580
starts going 15, 14, 13.

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.830
You could see the
water coming.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:06.010
I'm saying, please blow up.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.020
I don't want this thing to break
in 20 pieces like you've

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.780
seen in those documentaries.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.070
And as we're coming down.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:17.889
I had a sense of, wow,
dying is not scary.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.305
It's almost like we've
been preparing for

00:34:19.305 --> 00:34:21.280
it our whole lives.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.360
But it was very sad.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.070
I didn't want to go.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.949
I love my life.

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:31.380
And that sadness really framed
in one thought, which is, I

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.234
only wish for one thing--

00:34:33.234 --> 00:34:37.290
I only wish I could see
my kids grow up.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.699
About a month later I was
in the performance by my

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:44.492
daughter, first grader, not
much artistic talent--

00:34:44.492 --> 00:34:45.742
yet.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:48.770
And I'm bawling.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:49.989
I'm crying.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:52.510
like a little kid.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:55.420
And it made all the sense
in the world to me.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:59.180
I realize, at that point, by
connecting those two dots,

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.730
that the only thing that
matters in my life is

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.920
being a great dad.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.470
Above all.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.970
Above all, the only goal
I have in life is

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:10.140
to be a good dad.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:14.240
I was given the gift of a
miracle of not dying that day.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.330
I was given another gift, which
was to be able to see

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:22.750
into the future and come back
and live differently.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.720
I challenge you guys that are
flying today, imagine the same

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.920
thing happens on your plane.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.930
And please don't.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:30.750
But imagine.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.290
And how would you change?

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:34.610
What would you get done that
you're waiting to get done

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.330
because you think you'll
be here forever?

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:39.920
How would you change your
relationships and the negative

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.020
energy in them?

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.180
And more than anything,
are you being the

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.630
best parent you can?

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.930
Thank you.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:53.714
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:53.714 --> 00:35:57.618
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:57.618 --> 00:35:59.082
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:59.082 --> 00:36:00.735
GARY KUNATH: Puts things
in perspective.

00:36:00.735 --> 00:36:02.460
In fact, it was interesting.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.290
Steve Jobs said remembering that
you will eventually die

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:07.860
is the most important tool
you'll ever have to make those

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.420
big decisions in life.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.910
All fear of failure, pride,
and enormity of risk, fall

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:15.270
away in the face of death.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:18.576
The things I used to think
were such big deals, they

00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:20.490
weren't big deals.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:23.660
When I walk through a children's
cancer ward, I'm

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:28.240
ashamed of what I thought
was a big deal or

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.180
what bothered me.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.765
My son, who's your age, works
in the medical field.

00:36:33.765 --> 00:36:36.140
He's in surgeries.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.630
He had--

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.270
he was in a surgery.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:44.590
And it was a simple
bowel re-section.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:47.930
I don't know how
they are but--

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:50.310
and earlier in the week, he
had called me in sales.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:54.670
He goes, Dad, I'm really trying
to figure out how to

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.640
make my sales quota, how to
make my sales numbers.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.300
I used to run a sales
training company.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:03.825
So that was an obvious area
that I knew about, which I

00:37:03.825 --> 00:37:04.460
also though was funny.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.470
Because when we lived at home,
he wasn't worried about making

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:07.700
anything, including his bed.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.510
So I thought this was
really a very unique

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.500
conversation for him.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.800
Now he's worried about
making something.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.500
And he was really upset by it.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.320
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:15.880
hindsight.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.980
I'm not saying it
was unimportant.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.902
I'm not saying it
was unimportant.

00:37:18.902 --> 00:37:23.110
But don't lose sleep over it.

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:25.170
It's not that important.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.250
Of course, I can't tell him.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.650
Some things you just have to
experience before you get it.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:34.900
I can tell you, but it won't
register until you live it.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.200
And so we talked about that.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.260
We agreed we talk at the
end of the week.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.600
And the end of the week came.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.980
And I sensed there was a
difference in his voice.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.250
And I said, what's--

00:37:45.250 --> 00:37:46.960
tell me about what
happened today?

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.520
What was your day like?

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.760
He said we came out of
surgery today, Dad.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:54.160
He goes, there was
a guy in there.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.030
He's 32 years old.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.250
He was in for a simple
operation, should have a been

00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.560
boom, in and out.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.360
They opened him up.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.556
He was covered with cancer.

00:38:03.556 --> 00:38:08.610
He said, Dad, his wife is
in the waiting room.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.670
She had two little kids.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.170
She doesn't know that
her husband has a

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.410
month, maybe less.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:18.470
And he doesn't know either.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:20.725
And he goes, Dad, I have
two little kids.

00:38:20.725 --> 00:38:23.611
That guy's my age.

00:38:23.611 --> 00:38:26.280
And I said, well, what
you learn from that?

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.660
He goes maybe my sales
objectives

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.570
aren't that big a deal.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:35.000
And again, I'm not saying
work is unimportant.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.940
But I'm saying the power of
perspective will save you.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:40.180
It saved me.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.380
The things I thought
had to be done.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.220
They didn't have to be done.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.250
They could have waited a day.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.010
I didn't have to
miss a birthday

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:50.280
party to do those things.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.950
Are you kidding me?

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.640
Never again.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.890
Never again.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.130
Just to give you some
perspective, this is an

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.490
interesting calculation.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.260
Because I know you're young,
think you're bullet proof,

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.190
think you're going
to live forever.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.970
Think you got an inordinate
amount of Saturdays left.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:12.520
Check this out.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:18.400
Multiply your age by 365,
subtract that from 27,375,

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:24.330
which is on average the days
in a lifespan of 75 years.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.460
And what you get is the number
of days you have

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.730
left to wake up.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:33.430
Now, since I'm older
then you--

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.660
see here's how you know--

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:38.310
here's how I knew I was
getting older--

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.750
when I went into a music store
and everything I like is $1.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:43.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.080
GARY KUNATH: And I also know I'm
getting older, when I call

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:45.760
it a music store.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.880
That's another way I know
I'm getting older.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.280
But--

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.860
50 years old.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:52.940
Here's the math.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.130
I've broke it down.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:57.240
That's 1,300 Saturdays.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.420
When you think about it
like that, you don't

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:02.560
want to blow a Saturday.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.560
And let me tell you something.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:07.870
That's if you make 75.

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.120
You may not.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.800
One of the businesses that I'm
in is I own professional

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.795
baseball teams.

00:40:14.795 --> 00:40:16.890
I don't know if you saw that
in the bio, but I do.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:21.730
We had opening day at one
of my teams in Brockton,

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.450
Massachusetts, the
Brockton Rocks.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:28.290
And in the office, at the end
of the game, our mascot--

00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:29.830
We had a kangaroo
for a mascot.

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.830
Don 't ask me why.

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:33.100
Maybe we got a cheap deal
on a kangaroo outfit.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.496
I'm not sure why we have a
kangaroo and what that has to

00:40:35.496 --> 00:40:35.960
do with rocks.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.280
But anyway--

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:37.950
So he comes out.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:40.850
And he's got a Syracuse
University t-shirt on.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:41.980
And I hadn't met him yet.

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:42.910
And so I go, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.010
Get over here.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:45.500
I said, what's the deal
the Syracuse?

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.650
He goes, well, I went
to Syracuse.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.570
I go, I went to Syracuse.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:50.190
He goes, well, I was the
mascot at Syracuse.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:51.080
He goes, I was the orange.

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.160
He goes I was Otto the Orange.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.620
I go, I love Otto the Orange.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.430
So we had a great, great time.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.060
This kid was 26 years old.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.340
And we had the best time.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.740
What a delightful guy.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.270
We had a wild time.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:04.050
And we took a picture.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.990
I was so enamored with this guy,
we took a picture of he

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:10.130
and I in the front office.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:14.760
Seven months later, he
died of leukemia--

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.480
26 years old.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.480
He didn't know we had it.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.840
I didn't know he had it.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.780
His parents didn't
know he had it.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.260
Gone.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.510
26 years old.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:35.070
I keep . that picture in my
home for two reasons.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.620
One, I never want to
forget this kid.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.270
Because he was such a
vibrant life force.

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:47.093
And two, I never want
to forget that can

00:41:47.093 --> 00:41:49.090
go away like this.

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:51.150
It could be all gone in a day.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.970
You're life can change
in a second.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:58.520
And I don't want miss
one second of life.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:05.310
Top five regrets of the dying.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:09.440
This was compiled by 2000
hospice nurses.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.850
Here's what the dying said.

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:15.030
I wished I had courage to live a
life true to myself, not the

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.020
life expected of me.

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:20.050
I wished I hadn't
worked so hard.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:23.870
I wished I had the courage to
express my true feelings.

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.080
I wished I had stayed in
touch with my friends.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.150
And this last one kills
me, I wished I

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:31.310
let myself be happier.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:35.030
Top five of people dying.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.820
They can't have I do over.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:42.610
Why?

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:46.200
Why must it be then when this
comes to your mind?

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.080
That's what made me on a mission
to say, don't let that

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.330
happen to you.

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:55.910
Good goes around--

00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:57.340
another point of life.

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.080
I'm a big believer.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:02.150
Being a better giver makes you
better getter, as long as you

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:05.250
don't give to get.

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.370
I believe that with
all my heart.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:08.865
I've experienced that.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:16.770
One of my businesses now is
highly philanthropic, where

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:19.140
every 10 years our goal is to
give a billion dollars to

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.390
cause related charities.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.210
Being a better giver makes you
a better getter, as long as

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:27.630
you don't give to get.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.840
Here's how I know
that to be true.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.090
When I was first starting my
first business, The Summit

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:36.760
Group, which was the
sales training.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.590
And I was looking for
that big hat.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.550
In my neighborhood, I would
run to blow off the steam.

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.040
And I would pass this woman.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:43.800
And we'd just say, hi.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.580
Hi.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.850
And go about our business.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.070
And then one day, I got
knock on my door.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:49.640
And I opened the door.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.940
And it was her.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.000
And she was just as surprised to
see that I lived there as I

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.550
was to see that she's
knocking on my door.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.960
And I go, what's up?

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:03.630
She goes, well, I'm
collecting for my

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:05.970
neighbor, whose son has--

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:06.630
he's eight years old.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:08.140
He has leukemia.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.440
And they're taking him for
treatment at Boston.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.300
And they don't have enough money
for them to stay with

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.220
their son during this
treatment period.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.910
So I'm running to raise
money in donations.

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.570
And I'm telling you.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:21.210
I don't know what
made me do this.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:24.380
To this day, I don't know
what made me do this.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.270
I just looked at her,
and I said, well,

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:28.280
how much do you need?

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.780
And she told me.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.180
And I said, wait here.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.850
And I went in and I came back
with a check for the entire

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:38.530
amount, handed it to her.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.410
And I got a call from the kid's
parents that night.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:42.870
It was a call I'll never
forget-- crying.

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.500
They couldn't believe
a stranger had

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.840
done this for them.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.560
It was a call I'll
never forget.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:55.670
But the real part of the story
that is amazing to me is, as

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:59.330
I'm trying to build this
business, I need this one big

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.290
hit to get going.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:06.470
About 30 maybe 45 days
later, I get a call.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.030
It's from the director of
training at Southern

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:10.800
California Edison.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.630
And she's talking about
sales training.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:17.490
So we had a conversation for 45
minutes on sales training.

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:21.030
At the end of the conversation,
she goes so this

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:23.160
is the ABC Company, right?

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:27.180
And I go, no, this is
the Summit Group.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.270
So goes, I was calling
ABC Company.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.400
I go, well--

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.650
So now I'm thinking, ugh.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.430
She goes, I must have dialed
the wrong number.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:39.330
She goes, but it
doesn't matter.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:40.810
Because, you know what?

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:43.390
What you talked about,
I really liked.

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:46.130
That turned into a seven
figure contract for me.

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.300
That launched my business
at Summit Group.

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.250
You can't tell me those
things aren't related.

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:52.550
What are the odds of that?

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:54.340
What are the odds of her not
even saying, is this the

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.150
Summit Group up front
in our conversation?

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:57.910
Because if she had said,
that would have said--

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:00.040
or is this ABC company,
I'd have said, no.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:00.180
That'd have been it.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.720
She'd have hung up
and redialed.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.030
Where are the odds of that?

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:06.990
Good does go around.

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:08.460
In fact, I'd don't know
if you saw this.

00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:13.020
This was just recent, where a
woman was shopping and had a

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.980
bumper sticker saluting her
husband, who was over in

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:17.490
Afghanistan serving.

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:19.490
She came back to her car.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:21.860
This a note was taped
to her windshield

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.540
along with 40 dollars.

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.750
And it said, I noticed
the sticker on the

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.050
back of your car.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.380
Take your hero out to dinner
when he comes home.

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:32.540
Thank you both for serving,
him deployed and you for

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.900
waiting, United States
veteran, God bless.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.270
That had like two million
hits in about six hours.

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:41.300
That's how good goes around.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.660
I'm a big believer in that.

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.910
Practicing the art
of savoring--

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:54.060
one of the things that
I do every day is I

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.755
take time to read.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.560
I'll look at the stars.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.090
I'll just sit and look
at the stars.

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:04.420
I'll watch the birds.

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:05.310
My father used to do that.

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:06.640
I'd go, oh man.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.990
Now I'm my father, right?

00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:09.490
Now I'm watching birds.

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:11.560
But I just do it.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.170
Because it's easy.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:16.690
And I take pleasure
in the senses.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.220
I stop and smell fresh
cut grass.

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.430
I smell a flower on the way.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:25.910
I don't let a second go by.

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:27.980
There was a guy in the
Booneville Hotel, up in

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.330
Bonneville, New York.

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:32.160
I have a place not
far from there.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.330
And he used to come
in every night.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:37.470
And every night, he would
order bourbon.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:40.090
And he was a great guy.

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:45.500
His wife who this guy loved
passionately had passed away

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.320
several years back.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.010
And he never really
got over it.

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:49.450
They used to go out dancing
all the time.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:50.710
He would love to dance.

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.190
And I would talk to this guy.

00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:53.660
He was a delightful guy.

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.050
But then they would come a point
in the evening were he

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:58.190
would turn and go
to the jukebox.

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:02.300
And that was my cue to
give him a space.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.710
He would play one song, L7.

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:09.330
And it was "Harvest Moon"
by Neil Young.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:12.570
And he would go back, and
he'd sit in his chair.

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:15.140
And his eyes would close.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.050
And his head would do this.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:23.094
And he physically was there
but wasn't there.

00:48:23.094 --> 00:48:25.780
He was mentally transported.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.960
And he was dancing with
his wife, I am sure.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.070
And he was zoned out.

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:35.190
And it was such an unbelievably
beautiful thing

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:39.940
to see, to watch him do that,
and to see every single note

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:40.870
of that song.

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:44.220
He soaked it in, like
it was gold.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.950
And he did that every night.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:48.730
And it's interesting.

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:52.890
Poor guy passed away
this year.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.960
And I actually, evenings
at my lake house,

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.220
I'll play Neil Young.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:58.730
And I'll do one of these.

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:00.730
Because I know he's
the dancing.

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:01.980
So that's what I do.

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:08.020
But time flies very fast.

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.980
I remember exactly being
your age, exactly.

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:15.600
And it blows by like you
wouldn't believe.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.530
And the older you get,
the faster it goes.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:20.205
I know maybe your parents
say that.

00:49:20.205 --> 00:49:21.100
I look at you--

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:25.510
on average, most of you are
much younger than me.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:28.460
The three greatest gifts you
can give your family.

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:29.320
And they're free.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.600
They're budget friendly.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.300
Whether Google gives you a 10%
bonus or not, you could still

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.420
afford these--

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:39.010
time, memories, and tradition.

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.190
The three greatest gifts.

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:43.120
Give your family your time.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:43.970
Time to know you.

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:46.930
Time to enjoy you.

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:49.140
As I said earlier, I thought,
oh, I'd better get them brand

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.090
name sneakers and all that.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:50.730
No, no, no--

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:51.880
they want you.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.590
They want you.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.170
Memories--

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.980
memories, to me, are the most
powerful life force we have

00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:59.680
available to us.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.740
When you think about it,
memories have kept prisoners

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.270
of war alive.

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:07.210
Memories have brought families
together when

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:08.820
they were miles apart.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:10.260
They've helped heal the sick.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.430
They've sped up recovery
times.

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:14.010
Memories are a powerful tool.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:18.220
And frankly, in the
end, members are

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.510
all you'll ever have.

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:21.400
It's not your money.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.920
It's not your big houses, not
your nice, designer clothes.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.650
Because when you die, everything
goes back in the

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:31.840
box, including you.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.620
So memories--

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:36.740
please make, please make
memories a top priority.

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.430
If you have great memories, you
will always have a place

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:41.340
to go when times are tough.

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.150
And the last is tradition.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:46.600
Give your family something that
lives on long after you.

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:49.040
Maybe, your parents have
done that for you.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.080
That's three greatest gifts
you can give to

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:54.540
your family, I believe.

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:57.170
Now life is fun, and
fun is good.

00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:58.320
I can tell you right now.

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.190
I don't do anything anymore
that's not fun.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.970
I just won't do it.

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.330
And if I can make it
fun, I don't do it.

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:07.870
If this not fun, or I can't
make it fun, I'm out.

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:08.830
Focker out.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:09.630
OK.

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:14.100
So we run our baseball teams.

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.650
This is our--

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:18.650
we just have been approached
by a reality show on how we

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:20.450
run our business-- like we need
another one of those.

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:22.850
A reality show, the want to do
a reality show on how we run

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:23.480
our baseball teams.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.170
Because we're very famous for
how we run our baseball teams.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:27.430
We're very successful.

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:31.170
Our baseball team's in the top
10 best service companies in

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:32.180
North America.

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:33.560
We've sold every ticket
to every game for the

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.870
last 12 to 13 years.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.780
Most of people who started
with us are still there.

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:40.393
And believe me, we don't give
them Google salaries.

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.567
And when they came in and
said, well, how you it?

00:51:46.567 --> 00:51:47.450
How do you do this?

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:48.720
They said, let's see
your strategy.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.910
Where's you're 10
year strategy?

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:52.770
I go, strategy?

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:54.050
We hand them a piece of
paper that says--

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:54.700
They go, how do you do--

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.880
We hand them a piece of paper
that says, fun is good.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.080
The go, that's it?

00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.600
Yeah, if it was any
more than that.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:04.090
It wouldn't be fun I'm not going
to write more than that.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.770
So we're famous for
our promotions.

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:08.250
Here are some of the
ones we have done.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:17.410
Some of them need explanation,
I'll grant you that.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:18.060
Nobody night.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:19.330
Charleston, South Carolina.

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:20.990
We went for the lowest
attendance in the history

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:22.810
professional sports--

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:25.480
not something most professional
organizations

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:29.290
shoot for but one of our folks
said, hey, why don't we go for

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:30.410
the lowest attendance
in history of

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:31.160
professional sports.

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.820
We looked at up in Guinness
Book of World Records.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:36.100
The current record was four.

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.320
Must have been the old
Atlanta Hawks.

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.270
I'm not sure.

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.540
But--

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:42.980
so we decided to pick a game.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.070
And we didn't tell the fans.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:44.990
They just showed up.

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:46.840
And we locked all the
stadium doors.

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:47.440
They couldn't get in.

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:51.070
But outside we had bands and
carnival-like atmosphere.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:54.020
And we had the Cooperstown
Baseball

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:54.500
Hall of Fame was there.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.190
ESPN was there.

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:57.250
It was all over the wire.

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:59.480
And at the end of the fifth
inning, we let them in.

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.535
And now we have the lowest
attendance in the history of

00:53:01.535 --> 00:53:01.980
professional sports.

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.770
We have zero and we're
quite proud of that.

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:06.430
Vasectomy, not on Father's
Day, Night--

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:08.730
We weren't really going
to do that.

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:09.940
It was just a joke.

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:12.710
But unfortunately it got
carried by the UPI.

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:13.870
And people started--

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:16.410
I mean it really
got some legs.

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:17.230
And just, phew.

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:18.230
Everybody was--

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:20.210
every major news network
was on it.

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:23.390
So we're going, do I think
we should get a

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:25.250
urologist at the game?

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:28.970
You know some nut's going to
have a bag of nachos and

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:31.850
probably a bratwurst and say, I
had big beer, and I'll have

00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:33.350
a vasectomy while I'm here.

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:35.460
So we actually pulled that.

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.360
Mime Night, we did.

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:41.160
We did that in Brockton because
the umpires decided

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.620
that we could no longer so
controversial plays on the big

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.650
scoreboard.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:46.830
So people liked controversial
plays.

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:48.610
So we said, well, how are
we going to do it?

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:51.340
So we decided to hire mimes
to reenact plays

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:52.230
on the dug-out roof.

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:53.830
Because nobody likes mimes.

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.110
And there's plenty of them.

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:58.410
So we got mimes.

00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:59.200
And it was so funny.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:53:59.830
Because this is Brockton.

00:53:59.830 --> 00:54:02.210
Brockton's a tough town, the
home of Marvelous Marvin

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:04.510
Haggler, the home of
Rocky Marciano.

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:06.180
It's a tough town.

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:08.320
So this play goes on,
and these mimes

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.340
start to reenact it.

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:10.390
They're going--

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.740
like this.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:15.890
And you could see audience
going, what?

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:19.680
And then finally, one guy stands
up and flings a hot dog

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:22.280
and hits the mime right
in the head.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.640
And it was like a zillion
light bulbs went on.

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:27.152
And they go, well, must
be why they're there.

00:54:27.152 --> 00:54:28.910
They're targets.

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:32.190
Within a second, 50,000
hot dogs started

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:33.270
flying out the stands.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:35.520
We sold out of every hot
dog in 20 minutes.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.170
I'm not kidding you.

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:41.260
And after getting pelted for
about five minutes, the mimes

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.380
were gestures to the audience
that weren't very

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.270
mime-like, I might add.

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:46.160
Arthur Anderson Night--

00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.180
When Arthur Anderson
was having math

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.430
problems with the IRS--

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:53.170
they were under investigation
for tax fraud.

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:55.740
We did a tribute Arthur
Anderson that night.

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:58.490
For every ticket you bought for
$8, we give you a receipt

00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:01.780
for $30 for tax purposes, as a
tribute to Arthur Andersen.

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:04.620
At every one of our stadiums
we have a hot tub.

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:06.400
You can have a hot tub party,
watch the ball game.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.760
We have in St. Paul--

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.880
St. Paul Saints-- we
have a 90 year old

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:11.240
nun that gives massages.

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.870
I know that sounds so wrong
when I say that.

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:14.290
But it really does.

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:15.350
I get shivers.

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:17.880
But she's a licensed masseuse.

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.150
People love her.

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:19.980
We have a pig that delivers
baseballs.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:22.590
When the umpire needs a
baseball, the pig comes out

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:24.590
center field with two saddle
bags full of baseballs.

00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:27.220
And he trots from center field
all the to home plate.

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:28.195
And they give him a
sugar treat, takes

00:55:28.195 --> 00:55:28.620
the baseballs out.

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.765
And he trots all the way back.

00:55:29.765 --> 00:55:30.670
But people go crazy.

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:31.770
They love it.

00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:33.400
And then we just did Inflatable
Bat Night,

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.460
sponsored by Viagra.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.220
That seemed to go
very, very well.

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:38.280
People enjoyed that.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:41.070
But it's fun.

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:42.760
And that's why we do it.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.010
Relationship Refinement--

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:46.440
couple last things here.

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.510
What I found to be very helpful
in my life, especially

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:51.370
as I get older, I don't have
time for people who waste my

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:55.060
time, people who suck the
life force out of me.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.410
There are energy gainers.

00:55:56.410 --> 00:56:00.330
There are energy drainers,
takers, and 1%ers.

00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:03.320
Takers, unfortunately,
there's a lot of.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:06.400
1%ers are people care as much if
not more about you as they

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.760
do themselves.

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.050
Energy gainers, I like
hanging around.

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:11.860
They make me feel better
about myself.

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:15.570
Energy drainers are people that
just suck the life force

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:16.100
out of you.

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:19.490
You feel worse when they've
been around you.

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:22.100
And I try to identify
frenemies early.

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.170
I try to figure out who--

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:25.000
I don't want to waste my time.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.980
So there's four things I look at
when I decide who I'm going

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:29.760
to hang around, to try to
read the tea leaves.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.050
I look at four things.

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:35.340
One, I try to observe how people
spend their money.

00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.930
It tells me something
about them.

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:39.230
People vote with their money.

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:42.120
Do they buy things
or experiences?

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.430
Are they impulsive
or thoughtful?

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:48.070
Are they buying in abundance or
scarcity kind of mentality?

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:49.320
Then I look at their friends--

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.170
there's an old Sicilian saying,
show me who you hang

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:56.060
around and I will show
you who you are.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:57.730
That tells me what kind of
friendships they have--

00:56:57.730 --> 00:56:59.460
transactional or unconditional,
short

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:00.950
term or long term.

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.810
Then I look at how they
speak of themselves.

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:04.240
That tells me at ton.

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.240
What's their operating model?

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:05.655
Are they humble?

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:06.730
Or are they boastful?

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:07.740
Do hold a grudge?

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:08.560
Or are they forgiving?

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:10.310
Do they give credit
or take credit?

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:13.820
What's the balance of listening
versus talking?

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:14.890
We used to have a neighbor.

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:15.800
My father never liked her.

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.690
He goes, she has two gears,
talking and waiting to talk.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:22.090
And so I says, that's a
pretty good one, dad.

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:23.110
Anyway.

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:25.440
And then the last thing I look
at is I observe how do they

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:28.360
treat people and things
they don't need.

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.490
How do they treat kids,
senior citizens,

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:32.740
relatives, service people?

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:33.380
How do they do that?

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.740
I was over at one acquaintance's
house, and

00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:38.850
their 12-year-old was acting up,
was so rude at the table.

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:39.600
I couldn't believe it.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.095
And the mother thought she
needed to address it.

00:57:41.095 --> 00:57:42.360
She goes, oh--

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:43.380
he even swore at table.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.670
She goes, oh, that's
our little Timmy.

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:46.940
He's very opinionated.

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:48.430
I go, little Timmy's
is going to jail.

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:49.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.740
GARY KUNATH: You better
fix him before he

00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.490
robs me in 10 years.

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:58.560
So all I have to say is this--

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.310
you get what you
accept in life.

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:04.640
And to me, happiness is
the ultimate currency.

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.170
Those who wish to sing
always find a song.

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:09.540
The two most important days in
your life are the day you are

00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:12.680
born and the day you
discover why.

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.480
And life is like riding a
10-speed bike, most of us have

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.990
gears we've never used.

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:19.070
And the this next one came
directly from Willie Nelson.

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:20.200
He told me this.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.610
Doesn't matter how heavy
something is, what matters is

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:23.550
how long you have to hold.

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:25.160
It I don't know what he meant.

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.290
It may have been a doobie.

00:58:26.290 --> 00:58:28.990
I'm not sure what he was
thinking about there.

00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:31.240
Things that surprise me
most about people.

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:32.500
We get bored with childhood.

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.110
We rush to grow up.

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:36.740
And then we long to become
children again.

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:39.100
We lose our health to
try to make money.

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:42.240
And then we lose our money to
try to get back our health.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.490
We live as it will never die.

00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:46.830
And we die as though
we've never lived.

00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:49.040
And we don't understand that a
rich person is not the one who

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:53.830
makes the most, but it's the
one who needs the least.

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:56.120
The best things in life
are not things.

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:58.290
And what I really want you to
understand is, don't ever

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:01.550
forget why it is you
do what you do.

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:02.770
I know you work hard.

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:03.230
You do.

00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:05.140
I know.

00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:08.250
But don't forget why
you work hard.

00:59:08.250 --> 00:59:13.380
The best definition, to me,
success is applause at home.

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.630
And I'll end with this--

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.050
the eulogy.

00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:26.060
I saw a man who stood to speak
at the funeral of a friend.

00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:28.190
He referred to the dates on
the tombstone from the

00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:29.910
beginning to the end.

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:31.650
He noted the first date
was her birth.

00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:33.750
And the second was
when she passed.

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:35.390
He said, we never truly
know just how

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:37.340
long lives might last.

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:40.360
Then he paused a bit, trying
to fight back his tears.

00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:43.190
And then he said, what truly
matters, though, is the dash

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:44.680
between those years.

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.700
For that dash represents
all the time we

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.260
spent alive on earth.

00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.710
And only those who've loved you
can know what that little

00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:52.020
line is worth.

00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:54.940
Then he said, it matters not how
much we own, the cars, the

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:56.090
house, the cash.

00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:59.930
What matters most is how we live
and how we love and how

00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.780
we spend that dash.

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.450
So think about this long and
hard, are the things you'd

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:05.840
like to change.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.360
For you never know how much time
is left that can still be

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.760
rearranged.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.590
So when your eulogy is read.

01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:14.860
And your life's actions to
rehash, would you be proud of

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:18.880
the things they say about
how you spend your dash.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.610
Thank you very much.

01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:20.810
Let me turn it over to Ben.

01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:22.300
You guys have been great
to hang with me.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.580
I know you guys-- you're
running and

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.500
gunning all the time.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:24.800
But thank you.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:30.137
[APPLAUSE]
