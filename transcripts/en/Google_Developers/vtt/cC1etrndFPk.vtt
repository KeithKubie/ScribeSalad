ALEKSANDRA FAUST: Hello.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.697
It's really great
to speak here today.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.510
I want to share with you
today a story about how

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.970
I broke a social norm being
a wife, with my husband Eric.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.440
Eric and I met--
we worked together,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.930
he's also a software engineer.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.970
Really great guy, very quiet,
introvert, very supportive.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.990
He also has a
passion for history.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.550
In fact, he published two
history books on civil war.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.959
We started dating, we
got engaged-- we actually

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:43.625
got engaged here in
Chicago on the river

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.900
walk under the water
cannon, so Chicago

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.780
has a special spot in my heart.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.720
But after we got married,
I started first asking him,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.290
and slowly pressuring him, and
so on, to go to grad school.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.150
And that's not something that he
had in his sphere of interests,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.990
as I mentioned, history
was his passion as a hobby.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.380
And he was happy with his
job, didn't see a reason

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.200
why to do it.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.680
But I kept going and going,
I was getting frustrated.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.580
I was really starting
to feel trapped.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.074
And I didn't understand
why that was happening.

00:01:22.074 --> 00:01:24.690
And I was thinking,
what was going on?

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.170
And it occurred to
me, I really didn't

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.860
want him to go to grad
school as much as I

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.850
wanted to go to grad school.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.350
And him going to grad
school would give me

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.300
permission to do it.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.410
I wonder why is that?

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.540
I was raised being told you
can do anything you want,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.410
you can be whoever
you want to be,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.150
and there I was expecting my
husband to go to grad school

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.900
so I can do it.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.680
And I looked around
myself, and I

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.790
realized I didn't have a
single example, a single role

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.060
model, where wife had higher
education than husband

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.060
in a relationship.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.399
Nobody back at that time.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.100
And I was like, and why not?

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.376
Seriously, what difference
does it make, right?

00:02:16.376 --> 00:02:17.750
If that's going
to make me happy,

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.680
this is what I want for
myself and my dreams, why not?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.180
And he was very
supportive of that,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.940
so I enrolled in grad school.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.980
I went to the University of
Illinois, great two years.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.910
I graduated, and
eventually that landed

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.080
me a job in Sandia National Labs
to work on their space program.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.280
Which, again, was my
dream since I was a kid,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.230
I wanted to work on the space
program, the whole cosmos

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.390
and Carl Sagan deal.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.730
But growing up in
Serbia where I was,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.450
that was not going to happen.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.570
So it was an amazing
experience, and I was happy.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.490
I was able to do that.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.700
Now things were
not always as easy.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.320
I want to share my
second story to you

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.200
about being an immigrant and
coming to the United States.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.260
I was born and raised in
Serbia, as I mentioned.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.400
And when I was in
college, the country

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.790
was engulfed in a civil war.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.000
And civil war brought
crime and corruption.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
In particular, things
were difficult for my dad,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.400
who was a full time professor
at university there.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.520
And he witnessed a
lot of corruption

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.020
that he was not
participating in,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.710
so it was becoming
very dangerous for him.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.430
Our house was bugged,
we were followed,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.420
it was becoming
a safety concern.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.510
So he made an
unsettling decision

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.170
to immigrate to
the United States.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.420
It was a journey for
dignity and safety.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.340
Very unsettling decision, in
particular if you consider

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.900
that he did not speak English.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.550
These are my parents here.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.270
So next several years he
spent taking English classes

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.680
during the day, cleaning
restaurants and working

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.690
in the kitchen at night.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.130
My mom spoke some
English, so she

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.620
was able to work as a cashier
in a Dunkin' Donuts shop.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.930
My brother was a
freshman in college.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.209
So finances were tight.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.230
But as my dad said, honest
labor, no shame in that.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.210
Life is good, right?

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.530
We know why we came here.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.160
And then my mom started
to lose her eyesight.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.200
It started getting worse, and
worse, and got to the point

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.702
that she couldn't recognize the
bills anymore, the money bills.

00:04:42.702 --> 00:04:44.890
Which she needed for her job.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.000
So she lost her job.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.930
She lost her health
insurance with it.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.270
Then she started not
being able to wake up.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.690
She was sleeping
longer and longer time,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.150
she was almost in a coma.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.062
Eventually it turned out that
she had a massive brain tumor.

00:05:04.062 --> 00:05:07.060
She was promptly
operated on, University

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.800
of Michigan Ann Arbor.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.290
It was a 12 hour surgery.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.860
My dad was on her side when she
woke up, and she looked at him

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.620
and said, nice to see you,
I haven't seen your face

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.000
in months.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.960
They both started crying.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.800
She made a full
recovery, thankfully.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.520
My parents paid
the hospital bill

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.790
with their lifetime savings
and by selling our family

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.700
home in Serbia.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.660
It is at that time that
I graduated from college

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.410
and joined them
here in the States.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.150
So I came to the States
with no references

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.920
and from a school with
no name recognition.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.540
I took the first
software engineering

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.880
job that was offered to me.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.390
And there I was, 22 years of
age, making $23,000 a year,

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.070
and being a breadwinner
in the family.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.226
I also worked at night as
a waitress in a bistro,

00:06:05.226 --> 00:06:07.350
and on the weekends I was
working in a [? dining ?]

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.150
hall as a server.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.320
And one night I
was in the bistro,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.920
and one of the customers
was upset for some reason,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.250
and he took the liberty
of taking that on me

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.080
and slapped me on the back.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.670
I went to the owner of
the restaurant, told

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:36.100
him what happened, and he
said, what do you expect?

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.650
What do you want me to do?

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.800
You're an immigrant and you
cannot expect the same rights

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.970
as everybody else.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.226
You've got to settle for less.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:56.130
And I looked at him and
I said, I do not settle.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.282
My waitressing career
ended that night.

00:06:59.282 --> 00:07:02.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.890
I decided to focus on
software engineering.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.920
My parents eventually learned
the language, and both of them

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.275
are now university professors
here in the States.

00:07:18.275 --> 00:07:21.810
And I was able to start
my own family, right.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.900
Things are going great with
Eric and I. And we had our son.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.630
And this is my
third story to you

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.900
as how motherhood
shaped my career.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.080
So this is my son.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:42.050
He was born very high energy
boy, great sense of humor,

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.720
loves to build things,
loves mechanical stuff.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.760
That kid knew every elevator
door and what kind of mechanism

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.060
the elevator doors had,
when he was little,

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.900
just loved that stuff.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.480
He was really great.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.790
He was six years old there.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.560
But then we started
to notice that he

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:05.850
had a hard time learning social
cues and social behavior.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.990
And we started to grow
concerned about that,

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.600
so we took him
tested-- to be tested,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.060
and he was diagnosed with
an Asperger's syndrome.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.990
For those of you who
don't know, Asperger's is

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.130
a form of the autism.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.690
The kids can be bright,
can be highly talented

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.960
in math, dadada, but
they have a hard time

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.250
learning social behavior from
observing an interaction.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.260
So it was a scary time.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.240
We didn't know what to do.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.770
We started working
with a therapist,

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.900
and the therapist introduced us
to a concept of Social Stories.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.890
There's an example here.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.420
Social Stories are ways to
teach kids on the spectrum

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:55.320
how to learn social behavior by
breaking it into small steps.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.940
And she went to
proceed to teach us--

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.680
or to teach him how to greet
people because that's something

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.900
that he wasn't doing.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.110
And this is how it went,
she said, step number one,

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.660
if you see a person and it
is the first time in the day.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.730
Step number two, you
turn towards them.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.290
Step number three, you
look them in the eye.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.880
Step number four, you smile.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:32.420
Step number five, you
say hi or you say hello.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.610
And that worked, he actually
started greeting people.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.200
And Eric and I looked
at each other and said,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.461
that is an algorithm.

00:09:45.461 --> 00:09:45.960
Right?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.489
If I was going to write a
program as how to greet people,

00:09:51.489 --> 00:09:53.280
that's pretty much what
it would look like.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:53.780
Right?

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.770
There would be some routines
behind it, but that's about it.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:58.150
So it was like, OK, we got this.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.660
We can do this.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.800
And I don't mean to oversimplify
and undermine autism

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.350
by any means, It's
not that simple.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.710
But at least in that little
area with the Social Stories,

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.100
we got this.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:19.660
We're empowered, we know
how to handle this thing.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.070
But then I started
thinking, OK, we

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.560
can keep teaching him these
social behaviors one by one,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:33.070
on case by case basis, but
then what we really want

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.000
is to get us out of the loop.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.500
We want him to be able to
learn the behavior by observing

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.570
what's happening, and
trying, and learning

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.240
from mistakes, and so on.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.250
And I said, OK, if
there is analogy

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:52.000
between Social Stories and
the algorithms on this side,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.070
can I use some
expiration-- inspiration

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.030
from artificial intelligence
and machine learning to see

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.011
how they can help on that side.

00:11:01.011 --> 00:11:02.510
Because that's what
I'm going to do.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.926
I am going to learn
anything there

00:11:03.926 --> 00:11:07.290
is to learn about artificial
intelligence and machine

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:07.850
learning.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.820
I'm going to go back to school
and get my doctoral degree.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.800
The other reason for
getting doctoral degree

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.330
is that at that time I was
managing a large system

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.530
integration which required
lots of meetings, lots

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.126
of coordination, lots of travel
and so on, and at that point

00:11:24.126 --> 00:11:26.126
my son really needed me
to be there and take him

00:11:26.126 --> 00:11:27.000
to the doctors.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.640
And I needed something where
I can have more flexibility.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.530
So going back to school would
A, help me kind of inspire

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.100
how to deal and get him to
the ultimate goal, and B,

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:44.020
give me flexibility to still do
fulfilling and interesting work

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.970
where I have more flexibility
over what I'm doing.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.338
So that's what I did.

00:11:50.338 --> 00:11:53.450
I enrolled at University
of New Mexico,

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:57.030
and I learned about this method
called reinforcement learning.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.105
And what reinforcement
learning does is,

00:11:59.105 --> 00:12:01.860
it teaches optimal behavior.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.500
And the way it does
that is you have a robot

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.570
or an agent that has sensors,
can sense the environment,

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.860
it can move in the environment,
it experiments, sees what's

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.040
happening, makes observations,
is-- how the change--

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.540
if it does something, what
was the effect of the action?

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:25.800
And receives the feedback that
is how good or bad the action

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.910
is, reward or a punishment.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.610
And based on that
experimentation

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.750
it develops an optimal,
or near optimal,

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:38.670
behavior that maximizes long
term benefits for the agent,

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:44.092
even though it can make costly
mistakes at the beginning.

00:12:44.092 --> 00:12:45.050
And it was fascinating.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:50.500
It was like, I got to do this,
I absolutely-- this is perfect.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.500
So my advisor got me connected
with the professor who

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.470
presented me with the
problem of the quadrotor

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.590
delivering coffee.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:06.670
Now quadrotors are
non-linear systems.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.130
Which means that when
you do something to them,

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.120
you push, give a
force, give an input,

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.790
the connection between what
you do to them and what happens

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.570
is described with a non-linear
differential equation.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.977
Which means it's
very hard to compute,

00:13:20.977 --> 00:13:22.810
or if you're going to
do it computationally,

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.447
it's very computationally
expensive.

00:13:26.447 --> 00:13:28.030
The second problem
with the quadrotors

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.080
is that when you have an
airplane or a fixed wing

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.370
aircraft, you push
it and it glides

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.270
and you don't need to do
anything, it just flies.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.906
What happens with a
quadrotor if you let it go?

00:13:38.906 --> 00:13:41.230
It just falls down, right?

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.860
In order to make
the quadrotor fly,

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.050
you need to provide
input all the time,

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.260
150 to 100 times a second.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.970
And these are the calculations
that are computationally

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.802
expensive to do.

00:13:54.802 --> 00:13:56.510
Now when you add a
cup of coffee that you

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.194
don't want to spill while
you're delivering it,

00:13:59.194 --> 00:14:00.610
that kind of brings
the complexity

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.809
to a whole new level.

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:05.100
And he wanted to do it with
the reinforcement learning.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.771
I said, yes, I'm going to do it.

00:14:06.771 --> 00:14:09.020
I have no idea what I'm
doing, but I'm going to do it.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:16.120
So what happened then,
over the next three months,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.430
I went and learned
anything I could

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.130
get a hold of about
reinforcement learning.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.450
I did tons of
experiments, simulations,

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.190
it failed, It didn't
work, try again,

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:31.600
more simulation, try
again, dadada, didn't work,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.030
and finally I got it working.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.530
Yes.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.690
So reinforcement
learning at the time

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.060
assumed that you have several
actions, maybe 10 here.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.260
You can just go straight, back,
left, right, maybe up and down,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.480
and that's about it.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.210
In order to make
the quadrotor work

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.430
without spilling
the cup of coffee,

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.590
I had to consider over
one million actions

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:00.470
at every 50 times a second.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.210
But it worked.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:07.920
So the rest of my dissertation
was making this more efficient

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.730
and proving that it actually
did what I claimed it to do

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.380
and was not going to
crash into something.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.290
And yeah, that was
my dissertation.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.010
So-- in three sentences.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:24.000
So that eventually
landed me a job in Google

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.490
that I'm doing what is
learning behaviors, right?

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.100
Making robots learn behavior
and that remains passion.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.260
Is exactly-- I taught robot here
to deliver my cup of coffee.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.940
It is exactly the
same type of thing

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.610
that-- that I'm interested
in doing for my son.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.675
Even though, it
remains my passion.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.410
Now I have another
mission in my life.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.250
This is my daughter, who
is eight years old now.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.590
She's a girl with a grit.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.060
She's very creative
and imaginative.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.960
She loves building things.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:05.410
She's building a robot here
that uses a visual sensor

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.010
to sense when
somebody passes, when

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.220
there is a motion detected.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.980
There's a basic motion
detector and then waves.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.430
We're back to greeting.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.370
She has a whole plan
of the projects she'd

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.520
like to do when she grows up.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.350
She'd like to
build a flying car,

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.760
she'd like to build portable
wings, she really likes flying,

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.400
she'd like to be
a pilot as well.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.080
So she brought another
mission to my life,

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.540
and that's to pave a
smoother path for her.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.420
And it's because of her that I'm
here today talking to you guys,

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.580
even though, for
an introverted me,

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.920
this is very deeply
uncomfortable and very

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.500
unsettling.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.470
So thank you.
