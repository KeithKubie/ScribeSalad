00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.480
Welcome back.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.050
Well, I'm now going to prove to
you that the magnitude of

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.630
centripetal acceleration is
equal to the magnitude of the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.150
velocity when you're going
around the circle divided--

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.590
velocity squared divided
by the radius.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.590
So let's start with the drawing,
just so that we know

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.200
what we're doing, just as much
for me as it is for you.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.260
So that's the circle, and
you can guess that's

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.840
going to be our path.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.280
And let's call p our
position vector.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.820
And this is the center of
the circle right here.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.390
Let me do the position
vector in magenta.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.070
So let's say this is
p, my position.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.320
Let me draw that bolder.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.780
So that's the vector p.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.920
And let me define a few other
things over here.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.580
So let's say that the angle
that it's forming with the

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.430
positive x-axis-- let's
say this is the

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.580
positive x-axis-- is theta.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.580
That's theta right there.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.910
Let's say the radius
of the circle is r.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.580
So we have an object.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.630
It's right here.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.920
This is its position defined by
this position vector, and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.750
it's spinning around.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.130
So its position vector is
going-- at some point, the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.820
arrow's going to be pointed
there and then there.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.740
It's just going to be going
around and around the circle.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.520
But this is its position vector
at some moment in time.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.480
So what is that position vector
in our bracket notation

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.410
of vectors?

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.460
We have to figure out its
x and y-components.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:50.320
Its x-component is right here,
or you could almost say its

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.600
i-component, if we were doing
engineering notation.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.140
That's its x-component and
that's its y-component, right?

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.940
So in our bracket notation or
whatever, I always forget what

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.700
I call things, p is this.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.240
p, which is our position
vector, what's its

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.150
x-component?

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.550
It's the radius times
the cosine of theta.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.050
This should be second nature
to you at this point.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.880
Radius times cosine of theta.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.980
What's its y-component?

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.750
It's this.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.480
It's just this, right?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.020
That's its y-component.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.670
Radius times the
sine of theta.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.030
Fair enough.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.330
Hopefully, that makes
sense to you so far.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.670
I just defined its position
vector and I drew it out here

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.680
visually, and then I also wrote
it analytically in its x

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.230
and y-components, as a sum
of its x y-components.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.250
Well, that's good
and everything.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.420
So let's see if we can
figure out what its

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.330
velocity vector is.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.600
Well, what is velocity?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.890
Velocity is actually just
a change in position.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.480
Actually, now we are actually
dealing with

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.980
velocity, not speed.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.650
We will actually get a vector.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.640
So what is the velocity
vector?

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.520
So the velocity vector
is going to be

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.415
at any given point.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:04.540
I'll do it in a different
color.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.550
The velocity vector is going to
be tangent to the circle.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.530
It's going to look something
like that.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.770
That's going to be the
velocity vector.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.240
So the velocity vector is equal
to the change in the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.750
position over time.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.120
So let's take the derivative
of the position vector with

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.410
respect to time.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.500
And how do we take
a derivative?

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.220
Well, we could just take the
derivative of the x and

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.880
y-components separately, and
I'll show you how we do it in

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.520
this notation.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.540
And if you think about
it, it should make a

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.550
little bit of sense.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.870
So the radius is constant.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.040
As we go around the circle,
the radius isn't changing.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.980
Another thing to keep in mind,
we're going around.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.010
We're spinning around the circle
at a constant rate.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.410
So my speed isn't changing.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.680
My velocity is obviously
changing, because the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.920
direction is changing, but the
actual rate at which I'm

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.560
spinning, or the angular
velocity, is

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.460
going to be a constant.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.780
That's something to keep
in mind for what we get

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.820
to in the next step.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.560
But anyway, let's take
the derivative.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.260
So let's take the derivative of
the x term first. Well, r

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.050
is just a constant so
it doesn't change.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.290
We can just take the r out.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.110
And then what's the derivative
of cosine theta

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.100
with respect to time?

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.180
Not with respect to theta.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.840
Remember, we're taking
the derivative

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.209
with respect to time.

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.930
So we do the chain rule.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:27.860
It's the derivative of theta
with respect to time times the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.110
derivative of this term
with respect to theta.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.840
And what's the derivative
of this?

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.910
What's minus sine of theta?

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.560
Let me put the minus out here.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.670
Minus sine of theta.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.360
I just didn't want to put the
minus right in front of the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.320
sine, because you would think
it's minus sine theta.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.560
So it's minus r times the rate
of change of the angle with

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.620
respect to time times sine of
theta, the rate at which this

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.730
term is changing with
respect to theta.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.600
Let's do the same thing
on the y side.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.100
r is a constant.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.330
Chain rule: the rate at which
theta is changing

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.580
with respect to time.

00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:06.460
you.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.970
And then what's the derivative
of sine of theta

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:08.720
with respect to theta?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.250
Well, that's cosine of theta.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.570
This was just the chain
rule that I did.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.230
Let's see if we can simplify
that a little bit.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.690
So d theta, dt in both of these,
that's the same thing

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.000
as angular velocity.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.500
And watch the video on angular
velocity if that doesn't make

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.580
sense to you.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.170
But we can simplify this as just
w, angular velocity, and

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.060
that's going to be a constant.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.770
And we have an r there.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.120
Let's take a wr out
of both sides.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:45.450
So we have the velocity vector
is equal to-- the velocity

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.410
vector is equal to wr--
actually, let's take minus wr

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.480
out, so minus wr, And then this
term is sine of theta.

00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:03.350
And we're taking a minus wr, so
the wr goes away, and then

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.050
we introduce a minus
sign here, so it's

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.300
minus cosine of theta.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.470
Good enough.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.290
And the reason why we were able
to take-- and this w,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.730
remember, is going
to be a constant.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.070
It's not changing with
respect to time.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.630
The angle is changing with
respect to time, but not the

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.660
rate of change of the angle.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.630
It's spinning at a
constant rate.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.160
So what's the acceleration
vector going to be?

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.430
The acceleration vector, and
I'll switch colors again to

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.920
keep it interesting.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.200
The acceleration vector is just
the derivative of the

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.845
velocity vector with
respect to time.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.066
And that equals-- this is this
constant term, so let's just

00:06:44.066 --> 00:06:44.940
leave it on the outside.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.770
It's minus wr.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.040
And chain rule again.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.228
If we're taking the derivative
with respect to time, first we

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:53.950
have to take the derivative of
theta with respect to time,

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.950
and we don't know
what that is.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.240
That's just going to be w.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:03.620
d theta dt and then times this
expression, the derivative of

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.835
this expression with
respect to theta.

00:07:05.835 --> 00:07:10.160
The sine of theta derivative
is just cosine of theta.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.220
And then on the y-side, what's
the derivative of theta with

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.810
respect to time?

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.560
It's just going to be omega.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.680
And what's the derivative of
minus cosine theta with

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.520
respect to theta?

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.770
Well, that's sine theta.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.270
And once again, this
is w and this is w.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.320
We could take the w out
of the equation.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.090
We get the acceleration vector
is equal to-- take the w out

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:44.480
of the x and y-components-- is
equal to minus w squared r

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:51.470
times cosine theta sine theta.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.680
Or we could take this r and
multiply it times both of the

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.760
x and y-components, and we have
the acceleration vector

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:05.920
is equal to minus w squared r
cosine theta r sine theta.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.690
Now does this thing here
look familiar?

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:09.210
Well, sure.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.330
That was our original
position vector.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.420
So we could say that the
acceleration vector is equal

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:20.450
to minus our angular velocity
squared times

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.390
the position vector.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.390
And that makes actually a lot of
sense, because w squared is

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.630
going to be a positive term.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:32.510
And what it's saying is that the
direction of this vector

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.083
is going to be the negative
of the direction of

00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:34.580
the position vector.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.054
So if our position vector
is going outward, our

00:08:37.054 --> 00:08:40.559
acceleration vector, which I'll
draw in green, is going

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.880
to be going inward.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.789
The acceleration vector
is going to be inward.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.460
So it is what we
wanted to see.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.160
Let's see if we can express
this as a function of the

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.420
magnitudes.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.830
So we'll also say that the
magnitude of the acceleration

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.545
vector, and that's just a
without an arrow on top; I

00:08:57.545 --> 00:09:02.120
could put brackets around it,
is equal to the negative

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.050
angular velocity squared
times the magnitude of

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.860
the position vector.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.890
Well, what's the magnitude
of this position vector?

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.320
How long is it?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.470
Well, its magnitude is r
by definition on the

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.640
beginning of the thing.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.450
So this is just r.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:21.390
So acceleration is equal to the
negative angular velocity

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.210
squared times r.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.460
And what's angular velocity?

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.360
Well, we learned in that video
that angular velocity-- I'll

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.970
do it right here--
is equal to v/r.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.080
If we just talk about the
magnitudes, not the vectors.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.580
Remember, if we're not drawing
an arrow on top these

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.950
variables, they're just
scalar quantities.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:43.550
So the acceleration is equal
to-- actually, we can get rid

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.770
of the negative sign because
we're not worried about

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.940
direction right now.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.190
Well, we can keep it there.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.170
It doesn't matter.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:56.470
So we get v squared, because
the magnitude of this,

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.850
absolute value is essentially
magnitude.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.780
So you get v squared over
r squared times r.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.840
So r times r squared, you get
the acceleration is v

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.780
squared over r.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.400
And that's what we
set out to prove.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.470
And I'm out of time now.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.610
So I'll see you in
the next video.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.180
Hopefully, I didn't confuse
