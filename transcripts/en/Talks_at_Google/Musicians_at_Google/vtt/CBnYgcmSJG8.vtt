MONICA WALSH: Hello, everyone.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.810
And welcome-- welcome to this
event at Google, TalksAtGoogle.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.510
It's really exciting
to see all of you.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.720
And everyone who's on the live
stream, welcome and hello.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.840
I'm excited about
today's topic, which is

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.360
on creativity and innovation.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.780
What is creativity?

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.760
Well, creativity is no different
than what we here at Google

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.120
do every day, which is
disrupt, forge new pathways,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.650
and ultimately help our
users' lives improve.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.940
It's a constant way of
being in our tech industry.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.130
And no matter what
industry you're in,

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.140
the question is, how
do we stay connected

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.050
to that creative
force that exists?

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.590
Well, that's what we're
going to explore today.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.450
My name is Monica Walsh.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.750
And I'm a member of
the Streams, Photos,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.330
and Sharing team here at Google.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.560
And one of the really cool
things that I get to do here

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.450
is work with tons
of creative people.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.290
One of them is Bradley Horowitz,
who happens to be my boss.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.920
In his early career, he
was an innovator himself,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.880
starting his own
startup company,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.170
which was quite successful.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.970
And he's a musician
and also leads

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.390
a lot of innovative
products here at Google.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.700
I want to just take a minute
and acknowledge and thank him

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.230
because this event
was his brainchild.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.874
So thank you Bradley for
being our host today.

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:46.199
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.330
In the next couple
of hours, we're

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.230
going to go on a journey,
a musical journey.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.730
We'll have discussions.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.860
And yes, there will be music.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.820
We're exploring the theme,
unlocking creativity.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.560
And first, we're going to hear
from composer and pianist Kenny

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.220
Werner.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.000
We'll have a brief
stand and stretch

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.210
and then we'll come back
for a panel discussion.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.600
I'll talk more about
the panel in a minute.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.580
So first, Kenny.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.090
Kenny Werner is a world-class
jazz pianist and composer.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.450
He's author of a book
called "Effortless Mastery."

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.900
And the book helps artists
break through plateaus

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.011
in their creative process.

00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:40.310
He's a creative director
at the Berklee School

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.140
of Music in Boston, where he
teaches his effortless mastery

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.550
technique.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.180
I've had the pleasure of
watching Kenny perform lots

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.060
and lots of times.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.640
And his aptitude for
improvisation is mind-blowing.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.090
So we're in for a big treat.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.242
With that, let's welcome to
the stage, Mr. Kenny Werner.

00:03:06.242 --> 00:03:09.068
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:12.232 --> 00:03:13.440
KENNY WERNER: Thanks, Monica.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.648
MONICA WALSH: You're welcome.

00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:30.018
[MUSIC - KENNY WERNER]

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:43.876
KENNY WERNER: Thank you.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.640
Thank you.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.488
I decided-- I can do these kind
of things, like, for hours.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.880
And then the
problem is stopping.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.980
But in a concise
amount of the time,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.930
I thought it might be good
to be able to play and talk,

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:11.592
sort of like Victor Borge
meets Deepak Chopra.

00:11:11.592 --> 00:11:12.980
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.710
Actually it's kind of rare.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.750
Most musicians can really play.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.180
But they don't like to talk it.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.680
And there's some
people who are very

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.260
eloquent in talking about
it, but maybe their playing

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.030
is not so wonderful.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.820
And this was just a
thing I found I could do.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.150
It's almost like "Planet of
the Apes," wow, he talks.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.840
And what I started
to talk about was

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.260
a state of mind, which
I knew nothing about.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.500
But I just read it when I
was working with people.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.980
And the basis of it is this.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.480
When I'm working with musicians,
I say think about a time

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.940
when you had to play
really well and it was

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.390
really important to do well.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.140
How did you play?

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.240
And usually they kind of
look at each other nervously

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.290
and go, oh, you know, like that.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.430
So then I said, well,
now think about a time

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.470
when you were just
messing around

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.980
and it didn't matter
what you were doing.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.420
Or, for you older musicians,
you were playing a wedding

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.890
and nobody was listening.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.610
How did you play then?

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.580
And they usually say better.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.850
So I said, great.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.660
Now, the clinic is over.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.540
You just found out the most
important piece of information.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.192
All this time you've
been trying to play well.

00:12:34.192 --> 00:12:36.650
Now that you know when you try
to play well you play worse,

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.860
you're never going to
do it again, right?

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.820
From now on, you'll
never try when you play.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.410
And, of course, then
they laugh a little bit.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.230
Because we're
programmed, even if they

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.260
know that in their life when
they try harder, they do worse,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.280
they still can't help it after
about five bars of music.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.600
So then we talk about it.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.990
We talk about all
the things that

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.680
come up, especially
at music school,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.240
like, boy, that kid next
to me is playing better

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.950
than me or this guy, he
plays better than me and he's

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.790
younger than me.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:09.360
Or maybe I'm not as
talented as I thought I was

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.500
or it's really
important I play well

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.500
because I want the esteem
of the people around me.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.680
Whenever that is, the
good news is that it's

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.200
all in the realm of thoughts.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.450
And thoughts is where
most of the problem is.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.280
So I discuss moving out
of thoughts and into what

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.960
I call "The Space."

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.160
The Space is sort of a
nondenominational idea.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.140
Every religion has
its own name for it,

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:43.860
and in psychological circles,
super-conscious mind.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.650
But basically, everybody
knows this space.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.560
Everybody's had that
experience in this space,

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.120
I'll say to a
musician, did you ever

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.370
have a time you were playing
and it was just happening

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.040
and you were watching?

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.935
And most musicians
will say, yeah.

00:13:57.935 --> 00:14:00.980
And I say, and that was the
best you ever played, right?

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.160
And they say, yeah.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.130
In fact, you remember
where you were

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.650
and who you were playing with.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.570
That's how different that
was from all the other times.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.100
And they go, yeah.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.230
So the whole idea is
getting out of the mind,

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.010
or the conscious mind,
and into this space.

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:18.380
In the conscious mind,
we have the problems

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.270
with the past and the future.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.090
In The Space, you're
just in the moment.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.290
From the conscious mind,
there's all sorts of criteria

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.110
that you want to
meet when you play.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.080
From The Space,
every note I play

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.014
is the most beautiful
sound I've ever heard.

00:14:35.014 --> 00:14:37.180
That's sort of the musical
version of enlightenment.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.320
Every sound I play is
the most beautiful sound

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.640
I've ever heard.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.390
Now, it could be easy if
it was something like this.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.890
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:14:55.181 --> 00:14:57.890
But if you're in
that state of mind,

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.960
it doesn't matter
what notes you play.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.358
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.480
Every note I play is
the most beautiful sound

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.134
I've ever heard.

00:15:16.134 --> 00:15:17.800
And from The Space,
that's where you go.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.910
Instead of trying
to make music, you

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.330
have this sense of
receiving music.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.270
And that's really great
because it takes away

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.306
a lot of responsibility.

00:15:27.306 --> 00:15:27.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.650
For example, if I play a concert
and someone comes up to me

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.760
and says, wow, man
that really sucked.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.145
I could say, well,
don't blame me.

00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:39.940
It wasn't me.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:40.450
Talk to him.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.510
And I think everybody
knows about this.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.810
The question is how to employ
it when it's time to perform?

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.490
And, first, can I give
everybody just a little taste

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.430
of what The Space is?

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.470
It's very easy to go there.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.065
If you would, shut your eyes.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.080
Now, all I'd like you to do is
notice that you're breathing.

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:12.750
You don't have to
exaggerate the breathing.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.350
It's just like noticing
the traffic outside.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.100
You were breathing
already, I'm sure of it.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.178
Just notice it.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.150
And if you have a
thought, just notice that

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.470
and you just go back
to your breathing.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.502
We're going to do this
for just a little bit.

00:16:56.353 --> 00:16:58.352
And when you're ready,
you could open your eyes.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:09.150
Now, imagine playing from
there or working from there.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.585
That's what we work on.

00:17:12.585 --> 00:17:15.994
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.320
So just imagine that,
doing your work from there,

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.090
from The Space.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.400
And that's how we
work with students.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.910
Actually, I wrote this book
in 1996, "Effortless Mastery."

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:11.610
And it was kind of a
phenomenon because it

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.250
was something I
didn't care about

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.750
and didn't really intend to
do, which is why it probably

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.707
came out so natural.

00:18:18.707 --> 00:18:20.165
What happens is I
started teaching.

00:18:23.104 --> 00:18:25.520
The New School, someone called
the New School in New York,

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.726
someone called me and
said, hey, so-and-so

00:18:28.726 --> 00:18:30.100
didn't show up
this week-- today.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.580
Would you want to
take his course?

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.420
And I said, well, I'm sorry.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.170
I'm not a teacher.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.730
And he goes, it pays $150.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.207
And I said, what time?

00:18:36.207 --> 00:18:37.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.420
I mean this is when
I could use it.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.850
So I go in there.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.680
And it's a test.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.780
It's a midterm.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:47.635
I say, oh, great.

00:18:47.635 --> 00:18:49.260
I just have to sit
here like a homeroom

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.340
teacher for an hour and a half
and then go upstairs and pick

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.176
up my $150.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:55.800
So they did it.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.580
And they were all leaving.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.490
And then the guy that
asked me to come in said,

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.906
no, no, Kenny, I want you to
show them some of your stuff.

00:19:00.906 --> 00:19:02.280
And he's asking them all back.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.330
And I said, Arnie, if it was
me, I'd want to get out of here.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:06.140
I just took a test.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.170
And he said, no, no,
shown some of your stuff,

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.640
show them some of your stuff.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.430
So I looked at the test.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.020
And the first question was,
what is the first chord

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.100
to "Body and Soul."

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.540
Do you all know that song, or
some of you know that song?

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.400
It's one of the
great jazz standards.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.220
So I said, well, all right,
here's the first question.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:26.840
What's the first chord to "Body
and Soul" One of the guy's

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.510
raised his hand,
and E-flat minor.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.510
No, it's wrong.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.880
That happens to be right.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.580
Another guy said,
A-flat sus because you

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.750
could use a-- no, wrong.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.160
They came at it a few ways.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.270
Finally, they were
getting kind of angry.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.880
You know, I mean
the young musicians

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.080
can be quite opinionated.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.351
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.610
And they were kind
of yelling at me.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.318
And I don't know
exactly where I'm going.

00:19:50.318 --> 00:19:53.128
But I'm kind of enjoying that
they're getting pissed off.

00:19:53.128 --> 00:19:54.442
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.790
So I said, OK, you
ready for the answer?

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:02.240
Any chord could be the first
chord of "Body and Soul."

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.730
And they all went,
oh, that stuff.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.010
Oh, yeah.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.570
You must be a guy from the '70s.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:08.720
Yeah Yeah.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.220
Yeah.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:09.800
Yeah.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.710
I said, well, let's try it.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.405
A guy said C major, OK.

00:20:14.405 --> 00:20:15.304
I went C major.

00:20:15.304 --> 00:20:16.470
Then I went cycle of fifths.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.360
I managed to get
to the next chord.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.080
Another guy said B major.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.300
Whatever they said,
I managed to get it

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.620
to the next chord
or the cord after.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.270
And accidentally, it was
probably the best harmony

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.631
lesson they ever had

00:20:30.631 --> 00:20:32.400
So what happened
after that was I

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.970
was called to sub for everybody.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.140
It was a jazz school
and real jazz musicians.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.650
And as with the
tradition, at least

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.930
somebody didn't show
up every day to teach.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.180
This is a great tradition.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.300
So I got called every day.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.860
I did a different
class every day.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.760
And I started saying this stuff.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.301
And it seemed to make sense.

00:20:53.301 --> 00:20:55.550
And then after a while, I
did a couple of these things

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.840
for a convention.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.236
And then the word was out.

00:20:59.236 --> 00:21:04.030
This is something different and
it's a real musician saying it.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:09.106
So I started to get calls to
do lectures and demonstrations.

00:21:09.106 --> 00:21:12.740
And after a while-- it
was before the internet.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.980
I'm sure you have
all heard of that.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.917
Before the internet,
people were sending tapes

00:21:18.917 --> 00:21:20.250
to each other about what I said.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.476
I'm saying, I'm a musician.

00:21:21.476 --> 00:21:23.475
Why are you paying attention
to what I'm saying?

00:21:23.475 --> 00:21:27.790
I kind of resented
it a little bit.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.020
And then I realized that somehow
people needed this message.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.237
So about '95, '96,
I thought somebody

00:21:35.237 --> 00:21:37.820
that's making all these tapes,
they're going to write it down.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.510
I should write it down.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.210
And I did.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.380
And it's been all
over the world.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:49.610
Musicians and artists of other
disciplines seem to use it.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.560
I get calls and someone says,
hey, what's up with your book?

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.450
I just read it and I played
the best gig in my life.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.260
Oh, well, just practice
the steps in there

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.280
and start over tomorrow.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.830
So it's really weird because
I still-- I'm really, just

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.620
in my mind, a musician.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:07.920
Where am I playing next?

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.640
Where am I writing next?

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.300
And this kind of thing
keeps sort of happening.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.860
And it's great for just
kind of letting go,

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.360
which is kind of a-- you know.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.110
It's great for composing.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.254
Because I've had
composers say, how

00:22:25.254 --> 00:22:27.045
do I apply effortless
mastery to composing?

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:29.420
And I say, oh, that's easy.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.910
First of all, what is the most
nervous-- anxiety-ridden part

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.290
of composing?

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.284
It's a blank page.

00:22:38.284 --> 00:22:40.200
And the only reason that
is, is because you're

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.630
trying to write something good.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.240
So they said to me,
how do you apply

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.448
this with effortless mastery?

00:22:45.448 --> 00:22:47.480
I said, just go home
and write something bad.

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.500
You'll fill pages, and
pages, and pages really easy.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.170
And as you can imagine, going
home to write something bad,

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.740
after about two or
three bars, they

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.120
were writing
something very good.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.510
And then they got attached.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.820
And then they couldn't continue.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.410
So it's that kind of thing.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.220
Basically, I asked
the musicians why

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.260
do you think it's so
important that you play well?

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.270
And somebody will just
go, well, the tradition.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.490
Another person will say, well,
my honoring of Duke Ellington.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.690
And then I say, no.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.900
You don't want to play bad
because if you play bad,

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.130
you'll feel bad about yourself.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:27.137
So the only problem with that is
if you feel bad about yourself

00:23:27.137 --> 00:23:28.720
and you don't want
to play bad, you're

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.803
going to try to play good.

00:23:29.803 --> 00:23:32.670
And when you try to
play good, you play bad.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.070
So that's the
dysfunctional loop.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.390
So we practiced when I started
to teach people privately.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:39.430
And I did this myself.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:42.390
I had a teacher in Brazil
show me this simple exercise

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:46.720
on the piano, just
dropping my fingers

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.735
and, like not
expecting anything.

00:23:48.735 --> 00:23:51.210
[SIMPLE PIANO EXERCISE]

00:23:54.614 --> 00:23:56.905
And he told me to just do
that at the piano, right hand

00:23:56.905 --> 00:23:57.850
and left hand.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.330
And I was living with
him down there in Rio.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.340
And I was there for,
like, four months.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.080
He said, don't do anything
but that for two weeks.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.890
And I said, wow, two weeks?

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.560
Oh, I don't think--
I'll miss all this time

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.240
that I should be practicing.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.420
Meanwhile I wasn't
practicing anyway.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.380
But suddenly I was afraid I
would miss the time practicing.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:17.970
But I did it.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.298
I walked over to the
piano and I went--

00:24:20.298 --> 00:24:22.728
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.530
For two-- well,
not for two weeks.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:35.150
After six days this
Brazilian woman

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.200
called me to come to a
party and play at the party

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.760
with my friend Victor, who
I went down there with.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.900
And I said, well, I really
can't do that because I'm

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.110
supposed to be doing this
exercise for the next two

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:51.520
weeks, for another
week and a half.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.780
And she said, oh, come on.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.930
I really want you to come.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:54.980
So we went there.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.237
But after just six
days of doing this--

00:24:57.237 --> 00:24:59.025
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:25:00.366 --> 00:25:01.260
And I went there.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:05.030
And this was my
epiphanal moment.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:05.635
I sat down.

00:25:05.635 --> 00:25:07.260
And we said, what
are we going to play?

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.550
So we said, well, let's
play "Autumn Leaves."

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:16.040
And I put my hands and I
went like-- what's happening?

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:21.280
My hands were playing for
me and I was watching.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.724
And I was going, like-- and they
played a lot better than I did.

00:25:24.724 --> 00:25:25.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.541
My hands really played
a lot better than I did.

00:25:28.541 --> 00:25:30.790
And information was coming
through that I had studied,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:32.880
but it never quite came through.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:38.110
Suddenly, instead of needing 13
notes to find eight good ones,

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.100
they were just coming
out, just exactly right.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.210
And my friend was looking at me.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:42.460
He was going, what's happened?

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.127
And I said, I don't know.

00:25:45.127 --> 00:25:46.960
I could have practiced
for eight hours a day

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.030
and I wouldn't have
had such a change.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.890
And so I went back to
New York and I just

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.600
practiced that for a long time.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.160
And then people sort of
asked me, what do you doing?

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.951
It looks like so relaxed
what you're doing.

00:25:55.951 --> 00:26:00.590
And so it just kind of grew
into-- even effortless mastery

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.970
wasn't exactly my term.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.939
I had written an article before
that and the editor labeled

00:26:07.939 --> 00:26:08.980
it, "effortless mastery."

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.640
So when it was time
to do the book,

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.420
I thought, oh, maybe I'll
call it "Effortless Mastery."

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.520
And so it's been great.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.870
And it's been quite a journey.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.670
And a lot of people
have been helped.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.390
And then Berklee College of
Music kind of took me up on it.

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:26.290
And what I'm doing now is
I'm the artistic director

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.940
of the Effortless Mystery
Institute at Berklee.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.920
And they're trying to do
something about the fact

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.250
that 90% of the people that
go to music school get lost,

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.679
rather than get found.

00:26:38.679 --> 00:26:40.970
And they might have known
themselves better before they

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.450
went to music school.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.820
So the idea is they come in and
we do some of these exercises.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.680
And there's other
courses involved in it.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.210
But essentially, it's by
getting into that space

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.860
that we just sampled and
then touching the instrument.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.590
That's the embellishment
I did from the exercise

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.120
my Brazilian friend showed me.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.845
So I'll just give you
an example of that.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.168
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.770
And there is a version of
that on every instrument.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.810
So maybe I'll play
something else

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:29.360
and then I'll ask you if
you have any questions?

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.171
That's the story, more or less.

00:28:33.171 --> 00:28:36.245
[MUSIC - KENNY WERNER]

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:06.854
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:08.342 --> 00:38:09.327
Thank you.

00:38:16.244 --> 00:38:17.198
Thank you.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.190
I see by the big clock that
I'm most almost out of time.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.340
So this is a great pleasure
and a great privilege.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.450
And my good old friends,
Bradley and Monica,

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:30.320
brought me out here.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.150
And I've never done
it for anybody,

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.554
except hung-up musicians.

00:38:34.554 --> 00:38:35.666
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:35.666 --> 00:38:36.790
You all don't look hung up.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:41.580
So I'm really searching for
things-- nah, I'm kidding.

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.460
So I really appreciate
her bringing me out.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:48.600
And I think you're going
to hear a lot of really

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.920
liberated thinking in
the collection of people

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.250
that they brought today.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:55.710
So thank you.

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:58.760
