- She's just like
the Terminator.

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:04.504
She just like, gets up.

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:07.507
And I was like I should
have finished her off.

Welcome to This Is Not Happening

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.095
presents Fisticuff.

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.096
If you've never been
to this show before

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.364
it's just a bunch of comics

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:32.365
telling fun stories

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.600
about real shit that happened.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.444
- Thank you everybody.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.247
The first time, like
the very first time

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:51.518
that I physically struck,
physically struck a woman

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.888 align:start size:84% position:16%
was um,
(audience laughing)

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.089
oh, I would never fight a man.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.390
There's no advantage there.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.825
(audience laughing)

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.326 align:start size:88% position:13%
I have a clear
advantage against women.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:03.196
Why would I ever
fight not a woman?

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.299
Shaquille O'Neal doesn't
take three point shots.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.869
You know what I mean,
you stay in your zone.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.671
But the, as long as women
that are bigger than me

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:13.006
but the first one was,

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.240
I was, it was my sister.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.044
I was 13, she was 15
and she had this habit

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:21.414
of taking her hand
and just resting it,

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.850
like, inside her butt cheeks.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.153
For hours, hours at a time.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.855 align:start size:84% position:16%
Not outside the pants,
inside the pants.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.657
And then she would go
not in the ass hole,

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:32.725
but right along the ass hole.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.928 align:start size:84% position:16%
She played basketball,
it wouldn't matter.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.429
She just leave it in there.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.664
For fucking five years.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:38.932
What were my parents doing?

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.166
(audience laughing)

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.169
Why would they even allow that?

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.604
But anyway, whatever.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:45.638
They never told her anything.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.107
So she just left it there.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:50.043 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I had gotten this
jacket, this bomber jacket,

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:52.212 align:start size:94% position:6%
this leather bomber
jacket for my bar mitzvah

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.280
that I was super stoked on.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.483 align:start size:97% position:3%
It was the greatest thing
ever, it was so fucking cool.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:57.650
And I couldn't find it one day.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.052
I remember looking around like,

00:01:59.052 --> 00:01:59.919
where's my jacket, where's,

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.187
and I came downstairs.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.122
I'm like Debra, have
you seen my jacket?

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.323
And it was right next to her

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.958 align:start size:84% position:16%
and she fucking
pulls her hand out,

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.426
she goes, it's right here.

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:07.927
With the ass hand.

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:13.333
She put ass on a leather jacket.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.002
You can't get those in the rain.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:20.340
And she goes it's right here

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.909
and I just fucking lost
it and I spaz fought her

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.145
for about 10 minutes.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.913
I'll fucking kill you.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:27.814
I hate you.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.085
And my dad had to come
down and separate us.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.019
I was so mad.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.521
He was holding me back and I was

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:35.755
still trying to get kicks in.

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:37.257
Like, I don't, like
I wanna see you dead.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:40.126
(audience laughing)

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.495 align:start size:84% position:16%
And my dad had a habit
of talking to me.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.365
Like, "Ari, you can't,
you can't hit a woman."

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.001
And I was like, "Why,
why is that a rule?"

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.502
(audience laughing)

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.037 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's a stupid rule, what
are you talking about?

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:52.939
What if they deserve it.

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.042
What if they touch your jacket

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.178
with their ass hand?

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.947
What about if they deserve it?

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.148
And he goes,

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:04.117 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Oh, they'll deserve
it all the time.

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:07.420
(audience laughing)

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.323
"It's really not about that."

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.725 align:start position:0%
He said, "I almost punched
your mom on the way down here."

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.327
(audience laughing)

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.895 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was peeing, she
was halfway through,

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:17.630
I had to finish peeing
and I walked past her,

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.333 align:start size:84% position:16%
she looked at me I
was like I'll fucking.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:24.437 align:start size:97% position:3%
But you can't do it, for
some reason you can't do it.

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.005 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was like,
all right, I guess,

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.308
I'll take your word for it but,

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.776 align:start size:81% position:19%
this rule does not
make any sense.

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:33.179 align:start size:94% position:6%
I never hit a woman again
for about four years.

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:36.182 align:start size:94% position:6%
And then I went, my senior
year of high school,

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:38.484
for the second semester
we all went to Israel

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:39.986
for a semester.

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:41.988
I'm upper middle class Jewish.

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:46.092 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm not gonna apologize,
I've had a great, great life.

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.594
(audience laughing)

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:48.895
Probably, if you had it hard,

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.330 align:start size:81% position:19%
I didn't have that
same hardship.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.333
(audience laughing)

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.637
So we'd go there for four weeks,

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:58.938
for four months, excuse me.

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:00.974
My whole senior year
and I was gonna lose

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:02.842
my virginity while I was there.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.077 align:start size:81% position:19%
To this girl named
Lisa (beeping).

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.079 align:start size:88% position:13%
She was the biggest
slut in my high school.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.148 align:start size:84% position:16%
She had sex with
like one person ever.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.783
So, but she broke
up with the guy

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:12.151 align:start size:84% position:16%
like two weeks
before and I always

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.353
had a crush on her.

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:14.721 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know when you just
know, I just knew.

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.022 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was gonna lose my
virginity to Melissa Schitol.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:18.024
I even bought condoms in America

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:19.692 align:start size:84% position:16%
'cause I didn't know
if the technology

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:22.195
had reached over there.

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:23.997
Do they do rubber there?

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.165
I don't understand.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.868 align:start size:84% position:16%
So anyway, me and Lisa
and the whole class

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.803
got to Israel and
we all split up

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.538
and went to different kibbutz.

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:36.309
This is, this is
so fucking ethnic.

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:37.577
I just realized that now but

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:40.880
a kibbutz is this thing
that happens in Israel.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.949
It's a utopian society,
that's what they call it.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.450
It's one village and
it's self sustaining.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.685
So somebody works on the farm,

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.253
somebody works in
the dining room,

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:48.254
somebody takes care of the kids.

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:49.489
Everybody has a job.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.057
My job was actively
trying to get out

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:52.492
of any physical labor.

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:56.496 align:start size:97% position:3%
'Cause these hands just
don't stay soft on their own.

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:57.930 align:start size:84% position:16%
So anyway, it came
time where I was like,

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.232
I'm gonna go visit
Lisa on her kibbutz

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:00.733
and I'm gonna do it.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:05.238 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I asked my counselor
if she could give me

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:07.040
leave to go visit her

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.475
and she goes no, you can't go.

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:11.010
And I was like why?

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.412 align:start size:94% position:6%
She goes you haven't
done a single day of work

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:14.914
in two months that
you've been here.

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.549
She was like, no you can't go.

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:17.750
I was so mad.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.052 align:start size:88% position:13%
This girl, her name
Orna, that was her name.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.153
She was an ex-military.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.922
And she was like
no you can't go.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:25.725 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was like,
what, I was so angry.

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:27.293
Nothing this fucking unfair ever

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:28.695 align:start size:81% position:19%
happened to anyone
in their lives.

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:31.597 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I was so mad, I
remember working off steam.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:32.832 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was dunking, I was
outside playing basketball,

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.267
I was dunking, they had
these nine foot rims

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.703
so Jews could feel like winners.

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:38.071
(audience laughing)

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.305
You still had to
work for it though.

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:41.507 align:start size:84% position:16%
You still had to try
and I was dunking

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:43.576 align:start size:84% position:16%
and she came up just
to explain to me,

00:05:43.576 --> 00:05:45.078
just to explain like her side.

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:46.779
She goes Ari, you
know I'm sorry.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.014
It's nothing personal.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.148
I just can't, it's
a bad precedent.

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:50.583 align:start size:88% position:13%
I worked up the
courage, I'm a good kid.

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.251 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I worked up the
courage and I just go,

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.186
"Fuck you."

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.022
Did I go too far?

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.256
Nope, nope I didn't.

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:59.559
She goes all right and
she starts to walk away

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.060
and then I went
up to dunk again,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.295
I remember getting in the air

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.529
and that voice on my
shoulder was like,

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.698
"Hey, instead of
dunking this one,

00:06:05.698 --> 00:06:08.801 align:start size:84% position:16%
"why don't you chuck
it in her face?"

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:10.169
(audience laughing)

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.205
I was like that's a great idea.

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.707
I should totally do that.

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.542
So I jumped and she's
like 20 yards away,

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:18.778
and I just launched one.

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:20.279
As hard as I could, I
remember thinking like,

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.514
Lord, guide my hand.

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:24.584
And I threw it and it
had this spin on it

00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:25.952
so it started left

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:27.954
and then it started coming back.

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.222 align:start size:84% position:16%
It had a little
body language on it

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.690
like come on.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.192
And it got about four or
five feet from her face

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:35.895
and then I guess she
decided she wanted to

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.397
tell me one more thing.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:40.967
(audience laughing)

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:43.736 align:start size:84% position:16%
So Orna, she just
turned and was like,

00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:46.973
and the ball is just in the air

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:48.174
and I know it's thinking like,

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:49.342
oh, this is why I was created.

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:51.043
(audience laughing)

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:52.845
This is my moment.

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:55.481 align:start size:88% position:13%
I thought maybe one
day to play in the NBA,

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:59.485 align:start size:84% position:16%
no, it's, I don't
know what the word is,

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:01.921
but destroy this girl's face.

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:02.922
And that's what happened.

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.290
She turned and she goes boom.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.792
And it just crushes her.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:09.095 align:start size:97% position:3%
And she, you ever seen in like
a bad special effects movie

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.730
like someone gets
shot or punched?

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.132
And then like a full
second will pass by

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:15.334
and then they fly back.

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:17.703
And you're like oh, that's
horrible special effects.

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:19.071
It's not horrible
special effects.

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:21.574
That's what happens.

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:24.343
This basketball hit
her she goes ugh,

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:26.012
and then vibration went
like all the way down

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.313
and then all the way back up

00:07:27.313 --> 00:07:30.082
and then she flew backwards.

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:32.318
And my emotions were split.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:34.987
Because half of me was like oh,

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:37.557 align:start size:97% position:3%
I just chucked a basketball
at somebody's face.

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:39.692
And a woman's face, like,
that's real guilt there.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.327 align:start size:81% position:19%
But the other part
of me is like,

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.396 align:start size:97% position:3%
I just chucked a basketball
at some girl's face

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:44.831
from like 30 yards away.

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:45.965
(audience laughing)

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.667 align:start size:88% position:13%
It's one of the sickest
shots I ever had

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.402
in my life.

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:50.903
Smell the roses.

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:53.473
(audience laughing)

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.841 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I remember
sitting and thinking

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:55.908
for like two seconds like, ooh,

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:57.143
I don't know what.

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.444 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then she just
like the Terminator,

00:07:58.444 --> 00:08:00.646
she just like, gets up.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.815
(audience laughing)

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.251 align:start size:97% position:3%
And she had a little blood,
she just wiped it away

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:08.754
and stared at me
as she walked away.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:11.190
And I was like, I should
have finished her off.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.192
(audience laughing)

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:16.462 align:start size:84% position:16%
I made a huge mistake
letting her live.

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:19.098
So she didn't do anything

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:21.567
until the next day
in the dining hall.

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:23.870 align:start size:97% position:3%
She beat the fuck out of me,
just tell you what it is.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.072
But she walked right up
to my table like this,

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:27.607
I'm eating sunny side up eggs.

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:30.009
She just walks right up and
just stares at me like that.

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.611 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I looked,
everybody gets quiet

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:32.845
because they all
knew what happened.

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:34.747
And I didn't know what
it felt like 15 seconds,

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:36.015
I didn't know what to
say so then I just,

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.950
eventually I was like,
I just missed the dunk

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.918
just so you know.

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.419
It was an accident.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.787
And she just backhanded me.

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:44.290
But she like, she like
turned like this far.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.125
She bent at the waist.

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.295 align:start size:97% position:3%
I didn't even know what
that was until years later,

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.631
I was reading a golf digest.

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:55.968
And they were breaking
down Tiger Wood's swing

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:58.671 align:start size:94% position:6%
and they're like the power
comes from the waist.

00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:01.340 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's not the arms,
it's the waist.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.608
Like, here's a back hand.

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:03.643
Oh, that's pretty bad.

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.745
Oh, oh that's gonna hurt.

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:11.517 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then she dipped and just
bah as hard as she could.

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:12.985
Spun me out of my chair.

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:16.088 align:start size:97% position:3%
Sunny side up eggs were
just flying across the room.

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:18.090
It, I didn't wanna cry.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.091
I was like.

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:21.494
(whimpering)

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:23.963
That hurt.

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:26.198
And then she picks
me up by my collar

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:29.702
and she goes you touch
me again I'll kill you.

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:31.404
Bah as hard as she could.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.472
Slapped me to the ground.

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:35.841
And I never got to
see Lisa's (beeping).

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:38.210 align:start size:81% position:19%
It was, until like
a month later.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start size:81% position:19%
A month and a half
later, I went,

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:41.447
we all like met up
again in Jerusalem

00:09:41.447 --> 00:09:43.649
and then I had a
chance to bone her,

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:45.818
but she wouldn't
say she loved me

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:48.588 align:start size:81% position:19%
so I wouldn't,
God I was a pussy.

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:52.959
I said I love you and she
was like, that's cool,

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:54.894
and I was like, oh what?

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:56.128
And I couldn't just take it.

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.430
I was like, do you love me?

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.898
Like, maybe she didn't
know that was a hint.

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:01.801 align:start size:97% position:3%
She was like, no, I ain't
seen you in like three months.

00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:03.035
What are you talking about?

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:06.238
I was like, all right,
I'll just go down on you

00:10:06.238 --> 00:10:07.306
and eat you out.

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:10.309
(audience laughing)

00:10:11.477 --> 00:10:13.212
And by the way, the only
reason I used the term

00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:15.414
eating you out is
because at the time

00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:17.950
that was the only term I knew.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.586
And I'll just say it's
a very confusing term.

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:22.321
(audience laughing)

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.324
Doesn't describe
the act in any way.

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:26.692
And back in those days
when you didn't have porn

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:27.827
on every fucking internet,

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:29.629
you just confused and I remember

00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.397 align:start size:84% position:16%
looking at her vagina
and going like,

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:32.965
all right, I guess
it's time to eat.

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.266
(audience laughing)

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:36.002
Who eats like that?

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:37.003
That's what I'm saying.

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:38.838
Nobody eats like that.

00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:44.877
Who eats like that?

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:48.214
(audience laughing)

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:49.482
There's nothing you
eat like that way.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:52.485
(audience laughing)

00:10:55.354 --> 00:10:58.357
Invalids eat that
way, old people.

00:10:58.357 --> 00:10:59.959
Pudding.

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:03.262
(audience laughing)

00:11:03.262 --> 00:11:05.965
So I went down there and
I took off her underwear

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:09.001 align:start size:84% position:16%
and this fucking muff
popped out at me.

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:10.269
I remember it was
like Beetlejuice.

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:11.771
I was like oh.

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:15.207
And then I got through it,
I remember going down there

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:17.376 align:start size:94% position:6%
and looking at her vagina
and going, all right,

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:19.211
I guess and then just.

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:24.850
Biting at it like
a baby pit bull.

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.987
Just working it.

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.789
(audience laughing)

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:31.223
And she screamed.

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:35.094
She was like what are you doing?

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:37.530
I was like, giving you
the time of your life?

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.365
(audience laughing)

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.734 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I didn't lose my
virginity for five more years.

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:42.735
All right, you guys, I'm done.

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:43.736
Thank you very much everybody.

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:45.971
(cheering)

00:11:48.674 --> 00:11:50.843
Thanks for watching everybody.

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:52.645

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:55.448 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:23.709
