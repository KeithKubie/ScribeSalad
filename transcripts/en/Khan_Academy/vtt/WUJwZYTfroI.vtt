00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.810
- [Instructor] We're
told corn is used as food

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.480
and as an input in the
production of ethanol,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.040
an alternative fuel.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.020
Assume corn is produced in a
perfectly competitive market.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.290
Draw correctly labeled side-by-side graphs

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.670
for the corn market and a
representative corn farmer.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.260
On your graphs show each of the following:

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.310
The equilibrium price and
quantity in the corn market,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.580
labeled P sub M and Q sub M, respectively.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.440
The profit-maximizing
quantity of corn produced

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.110
by the representative farmer
earning zero economic profit,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.010
labeled Q sub F.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.350
So like always, pause this
video and see if you can do this

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.190
on your own before we
work through it together.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.820
All right, now let's
work through it together.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.270
So we're going to do correctly
labeled side-by-side graphs.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.300
So let me do, ooh, this is
going to be my horizontal axis

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.950
for the market.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.724
And then this is going
to be the horizontal axis

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:01.090
for the farmer.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.090
And this is going to be quantity
in the market, quantity.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.080
Quantity, and then this
is going to be quantity

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.760
for the farmer, quantity.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.710
And then this is going to
be price in the market.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.240
And whatever the market price is,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.580
that's also going to be the price

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.840
that the farmer has to take,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.340
because it says it's a
perfectly competitive market.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.913
So the farmer's going to
be a price taker here.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.400
So let me make these axes.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.290
So this is price right over here.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.700
And this is price over here.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.020
So first let's draw the corn market.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.280
So let me label this corn market.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.710
And we've done this
multiple times already.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.360
Our demand curve might
look something like this.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.333
This is our demand curve.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.290
As when price is high,
low quantity demanded.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.510
When price is low, high quantity demanded.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.530
And supply goes the other way around.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.140
So our supply curve would
look something like this.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.450
And then this point,
this helps us figure out

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.960
this is going to be our equilibrium price,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.600
so that's P sub M, P sub M.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.890
And then this is going to
be our equilibrium quantity,

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.360
so Q sub M.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.320
Now this graph over here, we
are going to draw the farmer.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.423
So this is going to be the farmer,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.980
the farmer's firm right over here.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.690
So the farmer's going to be a price taker,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.748
so whatever the equilibrium
price in the market,

00:02:33.748 --> 00:02:36.470
that is going to be the
price that the farmer

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.080
is going to have to take.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.890
That market price is going to be

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.510
the farmer's marginal revenue.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.730
Now they say the
profit-maximizing quantity

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.530
of corn produced by the
representative farmer

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.160
earning zero economic
profit, labeled Q sub F.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.560
So we're going to have some
quantity right over here.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.020
It is the profit-maximizing quantity,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.460
but it's also zero economic profit.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.210
So the zero economic profit tells us

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.210
that the price must be equal
to the average total cost

00:03:09.235 --> 00:03:11.090
at that quantity.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.210
So I can make an average total cost curve

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.053
that looks something like this.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.250
And I'm going to make its minimum point

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.600
intersect that market price,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.850
because we know from previous videos

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.440
that the profit-maximizing quantity

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.060
happens where the marginal cost

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.270
intersects the marginal
revenue, which, in this case,

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.780
would be the price that
the farmer has to take

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.613
from the market.

00:03:35.613 --> 00:03:37.380
And we know that the marginal cost curve

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.460
intersects the average total cost curve

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.430
at this minimum point right over here.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.740
So I could draw a marginal cost curve.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.290
It might look something like this.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.120
So that is our marginal cost curve.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.140
And notice, the marginal cost curve

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.810
intersects the average total
cost at that minimum point.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.660
We explained that in
multiple videos already.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.160
And we've explained in a previous video

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.350
that the profit-maximizing quantity

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.500
is the quantity at which the marginal cost

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.690
and the marginal revenue meet.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.180
And the price is the marginal revenue.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.940
Beyond that point, every incremental unit

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.410
the corn farmer's going to take a loss.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.630
It's gonna take him more resources

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.100
to produce that corn

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.020
than they're going to
able to get in the market.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.400
And we also mentioned that
this has to be a situation

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.220
of zero economic profit.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.930
So the average total cost
has to be at that price,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.470
at that marginal revenue
right at that point.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.600
So this right over here

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.600
would be our Q sub capital F.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.103
And we're done.
