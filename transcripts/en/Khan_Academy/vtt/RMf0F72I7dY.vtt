00:00:00.773 --> 00:00:02.180
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.907
is learn how to use a graphing calculator,

00:00:03.907 --> 00:00:05.973
in particular a TI84.

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:08.391
If you're using any other TI
Texas Instrument calculator

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:10.965
it'll be very similar in
order to answer some questions

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:13.414
dealing with geometric random variables.

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:15.203
So, here we have a scenario.

00:00:15.203 --> 00:00:16.900
I keep picking cards from a standard deck

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.235
until I get a king.

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:22.033
So this is a class geometric
random variable here

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:24.387
and it's important that
in this parentheses

00:00:24.387 --> 00:00:26.324
it says I replace the cards
if they are not a king

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:28.857
and this important as we
talk about on other videos

00:00:28.857 --> 00:00:32.760
because the probability of
success each time can't change.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.436
And so we could define
some random variable X

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.739
this is a geometric random
variable as being equal to

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.072
the number of picks until we get a king.

00:00:46.852 --> 00:00:50.164
When we replace the cards
if they are not a king.

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:52.151
And for this geometric random variable,

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.010
what's the probability
of success on each trial?

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.731
Remember what are the
conditions for a geometric

00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:57.237
random variable is that
probability of success

00:00:57.237 --> 00:01:00.029
does not change on each trial.

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:03.253
Well the probability of
success is going to be equal to

00:01:03.253 --> 00:01:04.886
there's four kings in a
standard deck of 52, this is

00:01:04.886 --> 00:01:07.701
the same thing as one over 13.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.953
So this first question is
what is the probability that

00:01:09.953 --> 00:01:11.958
I need to pick five cards?

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.248
Well this would be the
probability that our geometric

00:01:14.248 --> 00:01:17.163
random variable X is equal to
five and you could actually

00:01:17.163 --> 00:01:19.771
figure this out by hand,
but the whole point here

00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:21.957
is to think about how to
use a calculator and there's

00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:26.124
a function called geometpdf
which stands for geometric

00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:31.095
probability distribution
function, where what you have

00:01:31.095 --> 00:01:33.556
to pass it is the probability
of success on any given

00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:37.723
trial, one out of 13, and
then the particular value

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.126
of that random variable
that you want to figure out

00:01:41.126 --> 00:01:43.878
the probability for, so
five right over there.

00:01:43.878 --> 00:01:45.735
Now just to be clear, if
you're doing this on an AP exam

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:48.626
and this is one of the reasons
why a calculator is useful,

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:52.256
you can use this on an AP
exam, AP statistics exam.

00:01:52.256 --> 00:01:54.628
It's important to tell the
graders if you're doing it

00:01:54.628 --> 00:01:56.916
on the free response that
this right over here is your

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.284
P and that this right over
here is your five just so

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:02.454
it's very clear that where you
actually got this information

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:04.822
from or why you're actually typing it in.

00:02:04.822 --> 00:02:06.791
But let's just see how it
works, what this probability

00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:09.558
is actually going to amount to.

00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:12.283
Alright so I have my calculator
now and I just need to type

00:02:12.283 --> 00:02:15.687
in geometpdf and then those parameters.

00:02:15.687 --> 00:02:17.396
And so the place where I
find that function I press

00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:21.923
2nd, distribution right over
here, it's a little above

00:02:21.923 --> 00:02:23.846
the vars button.

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:26.039
And then I click up, I can
scroll down or I could just

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.682
go to the bottom of the list
and you can see the second

00:02:27.682 --> 00:02:31.235
from the bottom is
geometpdf, click Enter there.

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:34.715
My P value, my probability
of success on each trial

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:37.397
is one out of 13, and I want
to figure out the probability

00:02:37.397 --> 00:02:40.812
that I have to pick five cards.

00:02:40.812 --> 00:02:44.199
And so then click Enter,
click Enter again,

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:48.081
and there you have it, it's about 0.056.

00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:50.664
So this is approximately 0.056.

00:02:54.582 --> 00:02:56.923
Now let's answer another
question, so here they say

00:02:56.923 --> 00:02:59.284
what is the probability that
I need to pick less than

00:02:59.284 --> 00:03:00.117
10 cards?

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:05.701
So this is the probability
that X is less than 10

00:03:08.023 --> 00:03:10.418
or I could say this is equal
to the probability that

00:03:10.418 --> 00:03:13.085
X is less than or equal to nine.

00:03:14.644 --> 00:03:16.615
And I could say well this
is the probability that X

00:03:16.615 --> 00:03:19.451
is equal to one plus the
probability that X is equal to

00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:23.618
two all the way to the probability
that X is equal to nine.

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:27.862
But that would take a
while, even if I used this

00:03:27.862 --> 00:03:29.540
function right over here.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.880
But lucky for us, there's
a cumulative distribution

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.973
function, take some space
from the next question,

00:03:33.973 --> 00:03:38.140
this is going to be equal
to geometcdf, cumulative

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:42.667
distribution function and once
again I pass the probability

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:47.315
of success on any trial and
then up to including nine.

00:03:47.315 --> 00:03:49.550
So let's get the calculator out again.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.429
So we go to 2nd, distribution,
I click up and there we

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:56.278
have it geomet cumulative
distribution function, press

00:03:56.278 --> 00:04:00.630
Enter, one out of 13 chance
of success on any trial.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.047
Up to and including nine, and then Enter.

00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:09.869
And there you have it, it's
approximately 51.3% or 0.513.

00:04:10.837 --> 00:04:13.420
So this is approximately 0.513.

00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:17.861
Now let's do one more.

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:20.041
What is the probability that
I need to pick more than

00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:21.318
12 cards?

00:04:21.318 --> 00:04:22.783
And like I'll pause the video
and see if you can figure

00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:24.454
this one out, what function
would I use on my calculator,

00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:26.646
how would I set it up?

00:04:26.646 --> 00:04:28.832
Well the probability, this
is the probability that X

00:04:28.832 --> 00:04:32.999
is going to be greater than
12, which is equal to one

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:39.141
minus the probably that x
is less than or equal to 12.

00:04:41.832 --> 00:04:44.806
And now this we could just use
the cumulative distribution

00:04:44.806 --> 00:04:48.639
function again, so this
is one minus geometcdf

00:04:51.286 --> 00:04:55.453
cumulative distribution
function, cdf, of one over 13

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:02.037
and up to and including 12.

00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:04.196
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:05:04.196 --> 00:05:09.188
So 2nd, distribution, I click
up, I get to the function.

00:05:09.188 --> 00:05:12.949
Click Enter, and so I
already have that first,

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.549
the probability of success on
every trial is one over 13,

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:21.170
and then cumulative up to
12 and so I click Enter.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.985
And then well I could click
Enter there, but I really want

00:05:24.985 --> 00:05:28.914
to get one minus this
value, so I can do one minus

00:05:28.914 --> 00:05:33.081
2nd Answer, which would be
just one minus that value,

00:05:35.206 --> 00:05:39.543
which will be equal to there
you have it, it's about 38.3%

00:05:39.543 --> 00:05:40.376
or 0.383.

00:05:41.778 --> 00:05:45.945
So this is approximately
equal to 0.383 and we're done.
