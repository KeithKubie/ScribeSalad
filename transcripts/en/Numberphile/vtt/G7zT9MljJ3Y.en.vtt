00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.580
So a cube has perfect symmetry, right? You know what I mean. Every face is the same.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.449
And a tetrahedron has perfect symmetry. Okay, there are four faces,

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.000
and they're all the same.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.860
You can ask, and Euclid did, what are all of the symmetric

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.109
three-dimensional objects? And it turns out there are only five of them. Most people know what a cube is, and a tetrahedron.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.549
But there are also an octahedron, which has eight faces, you know, four on top and four on the bottom. And it's again, perfectly

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.250
symmetrical. Every way you twist and turn it, it looks the same, just like a cube. And then there are two others.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.940
There's the icosahedron and the dodecahedron.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.980
But that's it. So first you might think, well,

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.079
if there are so many funny ones, why aren't there lots of different ones? So I proved that in class,

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.939
I mean, it's a real theorem, and I said, therefore, there are only five fair dice.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:58.229
Because each of those dice would be fair, that is, if I wanted to generate a number between one and eight, if I rolled the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.219
octahedron, each of these faces is equally likely to come out. Somehow, intuitively,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.559
we know that. You know, that's a fair dice

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.838
which has eight sides. And a kid raises his hand in class and said, I have a thirty sided die.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.560
And I said, no you don't.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.620
And he said, yeah I do.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.200
When you first meet it, it's just some lumpy roundish thing. But in fact,

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.529
it's called a rhombic triacontahedron, and it has thirty faces, and all of the faces are the same size.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.330
They're all little rhombuses.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.019
That's why it's called a rhombic thing. Now, this die isn't as

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.790
symmetric as the other ones. This vertex has five faces that meet at this vertex.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.720
But this vertex has three faces that meet at this vertex.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.479
So it's not as symmetrical, for example, a cube has three faces at each vertex,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.080
you know, and every edge has two sides. And so there's a question, is it fair, and what does that mean?

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.820
Well, of course we know what it means in practice. We mean if we throw it

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.599
you know, it should land on each of the thirty faces a thirtieth of the time.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.140
But let me talk about that for a second. When I was a graduate student,

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.599
we had a guy who was a retired executive

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.679
who wanted to test the laws of chance. And he came into the department,

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.119
and he said, I like throwing dice when I watch television. And actually, Brady,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.859
it might be that some of your viewers might want to participate in this. And in the end, he wound up rolling a die

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.110
three and a half million times,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.710
and recording how many times did each face come out. And here are some things you learn. The first thing is that

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.120
dice, if you roll them a lot, get round. Of course they do. If you roll a die

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.040
20,000 times it, you know, bounces around, it changes. So we had to give him new dice. The notion of long-term frequency,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.480
it's actually pretty fictional. The second thing was, dice the way they're made, the dice

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.209
he was using, have pips drilled in them and filled with paint. So there's a six has six spots in it.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.669
Well, those drill holes are lighter.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.010
So the six face actually has less mass, and the one face, which is opposite, has more.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.900
You know, they weren't fair.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.440
Now, casino dice are much more carefully made. The holes are filled with paint of the same specific gravity as the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.929
surrounding material, so they really are pretty close to fair. When you start thinking about anything,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.100
even something as silly as, as, what does it mean to say a dice, die is fair, there are things to think about, of course.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.030
Okay, so I wanted to think about, what does it mean

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.239
to say this die is fair?

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.749
There's the notion of the symmetry group of a die. A symmetry of an object, any object, is the set of all

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.139
transformations I can make, like turning it a quarter, or

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.349
turning it this way, or turning it over, which bring it, atom for atom, where it was, okay?

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.320
So that's called a symmetry group. And of course, if I have one symmetry, like turning at a quarter turn, I can do it twice.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.829
I can go once, twice, right? So I can combine the symmetry of flip that way with the symmetry of a flip that way.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.320
So, we say that the symmetries of an object form a group. All that means is, you can

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.700
take one symmetry, and then take another symmetry, and compose them, do them twice. You have to be able to undo it.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.200
If I just did this

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.480
I can undo it.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.520
Brady: "What's a, what's a function you could perform on a dice, for example, that you couldn't undo just by doing it backwards?"

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.890
Suppose that the die was made out of Jell-O and I flattened it.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.460
I couldn't undo that, probably. That wouldn't be a symmetry.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.900
Brady: "Okay. That is the definition."

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.900
Right, right. Exactly, exactly.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.680
Takes it atom for atom to where it is, and, and, you know, of course you can reverse it. Different objects have different

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.350
notions of symmetry. So this tetrahedron, it has less symmetry, somehow. The number of different things I can do to it,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.379
it's less than what I can do to this. There are twelve

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.709
symmetries that I can make of this if you start fiddling,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:57.040
and there twenty-four symmetries that I can make with this die. And obviously some giant thing like this,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.420
you know, there are a lot of different things I could do to it.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.040
Joe Keller and I defined an object to be fair by symmetry if its group of transformations

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.520
was transitive on the faces. And all that means is, I can take the die

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.310
and leave it atom for atom the same, but have any face where this face is.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.549
You know, right now, the two is up in the rhombus.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.740
Well, I should be able to make the ten come up by a symmetry, and have the die

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:34.390
just exactly where it was, but have the ten up. We define the die to be fair by symmetry if its symmetries

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:41.649
act transitively on the faces, meaning I can take any face to any other face. This die, its symmetry group isn't

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.340
transitive on the vertices. I can't take this vertex,

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.369
which has five things around, it into this vertex, which has three things around it. I could move this vertex to there,

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:56.440
but the surrounding territory will be different. We did prove that this die has a

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.080
transitive symmetry group.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.600
Brady: "But not by vertex, but yes by face."

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.800
Yes by face. And not by edges, either, actually. So we did show that this die has a transitive symmetry group.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.350
Brady: "That's fair."

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:13.380
So it's fair. It sounds fair now. If every face is the same, and since the bets are gonna be on the faces,

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.320
it sounds fair.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.220
Then we had the idea, what are all the fair dice? Euclid found the

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.669
completely fair dice. That is, Euclid's Theorem is

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.419
what are all the

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:33.999
objects whose groups are transitive on their faces, on their edges and on their vertices? And the cube, of course, you could see, every vertex

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.180
looks the same, right? And similarly, every edge looks the same. Not, not this guy.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.500
And with Joe, we classified all of the fair dice.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.420
Suppose I had a five-gon.

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:49.729
And then let's put a point up here and down here, and

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:53.869
connect that point. Fill in the solid so it's got five edges.

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:59.389
And then it'll have five triangles going up, and five triangles going down.

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:01.698
That's a fair object, because these five

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:05.988
triangles all are the same, and they're obviously the same as these five triangles,

00:07:05.989 --> 00:07:12.828
and so every triangle is the same. But I could put that point wherever I want, and you'd get very different looking dice, right?

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:15.679
You'd get a kind of little tiny thing or a very long thing.

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:23.059
But, so that's a one parameter family of ten-sided dice. What we found is that there are thirty families of fair dice.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.420
We classified them, and then we found out that Archimedes had been there before us, about

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.940
twenty-five hundred years ago.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.020
Brady: "How many members does each family have? Or is it infinite?"

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.400
Infinite, infinite, because there's a continuous parameter.

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:40.368
But, it's interesting that there were, you know, two continuous parameters.

00:07:40.368 --> 00:07:44.060
We have a list. Some of the things on the list don't have a parameter in them. Some of them do.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.240
We found all the possible fair dice.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.440
Brady: "You told me you could do that with a pentagon, and I follow, that made sense,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.560
"and I could imagine you could do that with a hexagon and a seven-gon,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.020
"why couldn't you do it with a 200,000-gon?"

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.380
It, it, it's true.

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:01.909
Now, it's true what you say, and you've caught me, Brady, because that,

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:06.049
exactly, that's exactly correct. So why isn't that infinitely many, um,

00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:13.879
infinitely many fair dice? It is. And so, let me amend the statement of my theorem.

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:16.669
That's an infinite family. That is an infinite family.

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:19.309
And it has what we call

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:24.439
Dihedral symmetry, that is, the only symmetry that those dice have is,

00:08:24.719 --> 00:08:30.469
these sides are all the same, and these sides are all the same, and these sides are all the same as these sides, okay?

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:37.340
So dice with more than dihedral symmetry, that is we call them interesting dice. They have extra symmetry.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.339
Brady: "So the example I just gave is trivial to you almost."

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:45.589
Well, it's an important example. If I took this tetrahedron, and if I had another one,

00:08:45.589 --> 00:08:51.919
and I stuck them together, that would be a triangle, a point above and a point below, right? So here it is. I made one.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.320
And obviously, you know, this is a six-sided thing.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.300
Here, here are three sides,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.979
here are the other three sides. These three are all the same, these three are all the same.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.200
So this is a fair thing. Now, if you flipped it, of course you'd have to roll it, and you'd have to talk about the

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:12.559
side that lands down. Here's another six-sided die. Is there any sense in which we can say that this die is

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.220
more or less fair than this die?

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.900
That's a philosophical question, it's a math question.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.260
The symmetry group of this die, there are just six symmetries, you can twist it around

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:29.000
three things, or you could turn it over and twist it around three things. The size of the symmetry group is as small as it could be.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.260
Whereas this die has twenty-four symmetries. What does that mean?

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.996
I know, I once did a numberphile video about flipping a coin,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.140
so I got a friend with a stopwatch,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.160
and I went one two three flip! one two three flip!

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.720
and when we were talking about that,

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.400
we said, well of course, physics should come into this

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.140
description of fairness someplace. Of course it should come in with dice, and it's the same

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:59.990
physics. It's mechanics. If I roll the die very carefully, so it just goes around these four faces, on a blanket.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.120
Well, that's not very fair, because these faces could not come up.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.940
When you release the die from your hand, if you're actually rolling it, it has

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.490
velocity, and it has angular

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.510
velocities, and there's a phase space.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:19.369
What direction is it going in, and how fast, and then how fast is it turning in each of various directions?

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:27.109
And there are actually twelve dimensions of parameters needed to describe the initial conditions. What we can show, is that,

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.060
that twelve-dimensional space of initial conditions is partitioned up into six regions,

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.830
regions where, if the die leaves your hand when the initial

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.830
positions are in this part of the phase space,

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:45.199
it comes up at side one. All of the initial conditions where the die comes up at side two. It can only come up in one

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.729
of six faces. So that partitions the, this twelve-dimensional space into

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.930
regions, six different regions. The partitioning up of phase space is much finer for this die

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.210
than for this die. This partitioning is cruder. For any way of rolling,

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.839
small changes in the initial conditions, the difference

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:10.698
between your hand and your brain, make for a big difference in what side it comes up, because the

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:12.439
partitioning of the phase space is finer.

00:11:12.439 --> 00:11:19.579
So there is a sense in which symmetry isn't the only determining factor, physics and symmetry combine to allow a

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.280
reasonably satisfactory analysis of just how fair dice are.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.060
Brady: "So the cube is fairer."

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.180
The cube is fairer.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.740
Tiny little changes in just how you release it will make for the difference between side one and side two,

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:38.119
whereas the basins of attraction for side, you know, one up to six, with this

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:45.738
two tetrahedral die, are cruder. And so, it would be easier to control, for example. You know a coin is the

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.290
simplest kind of dice, the simplest kind of die, it just has two faces, right?

00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:56.029
Obviously, heads and tails are symmetric, but of course when you really flip a coin,

00:11:56.089 --> 00:11:57.410
you know, the flips matter.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:03.499
And I once had a colleague who was at a junior high school, and he called up and said, I gave my kids

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:08.629
the problem of flipping a coin, and when they flipped coins, it was very very patterned.

00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:10.969
You know, head tail head tail head tail head tail.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:17.720
And he couldn't understand it. And I went in and watched the kids flip, and they were bored out of their minds, and they were

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.720
just doing wimpy little flips.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:24.349
You know, so that it would flip once. Now of course it's going to come up head tail head tail.

00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:26.748
So, you know, how you flip can make a difference.

00:12:26.748 --> 00:12:28.580
How you roll a die can make a difference.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.380
This isn't the end. In fact, our next video will be the second part of this

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:34.389
interview with Professor Diaconis,

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:40.399
talking more about fair dice and casino dice. If you can't wait until then, there are links on the screen and in the video description.

00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:41.699
You can watch it right now.

00:12:41.699 --> 00:12:47.389
You know talking to me about dice and fairness is like talking to a California wine person about wine.

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:49.520
It can go on forever right?

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.360
So let me go back...

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.399
And as some of you know, there are plenty more dice videos on numberphile.

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:59.279
You can look at our back catalogue. And look at this one,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.360
it's coming very soon from Tadashi.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.880
Four four four four and zero zero.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.840
That's something to get excited about.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:12.620
Links on the screen and in the video description. Thank you so much, everyone, for watching our videos. We really appreciate it.
