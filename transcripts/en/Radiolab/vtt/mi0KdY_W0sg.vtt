00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.660
You're listening to radio lab from New York public radio public radio,

2
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.110
W Y Y C Huh.

3
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.973
<v 2>And</v>

4
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.393
<v 3>uh,</v>

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.270
<v 0>ah, [inaudible] live at the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul, Minnesota.</v>

6
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.710
<v 2>October 30th, 1938.</v>

7
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.141
On that night,

8
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:39.141
the United States experienced a kind of mass hysteria the we'd never seen

9
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:40.104
before.

10
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.450
And the reason which today sounds almost comical was a radio play

11
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.280
<v 4>really. I did spoken with them.</v>

12
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.680
Orson wells and the mercury set are on the air and the water of the world

13
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.710
<v 2>around 12 million people were listening. Most got the joke.</v>

14
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.240
It was Halloween after all.

15
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.010
But if you consider that about one out of every 12 people didn't get the joke.

16
00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:10.060
That's what surveys found afterwards about one out of every 12 people who heard

17
00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:14.470
the broadcast thought it was true and that some percentage of that 1 million

18
00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:18.850
people ran out of their homes, towels over their faces, clutching children,

19
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:21.610
tripping, breaking limbs will,

20
00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:26.611
that constitutes the major freak out and in the Sur first ever live hour on

21
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:33.520
radio lab here at Saint Paul, Minnesota at the Fitzgerald Theater, we ask why,

22
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.650
why do people panic? And of course we'll ask the big question as well,

23
00:01:38.651 --> 00:01:40.660
which is Canaan happened again.

24
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.970
I'm Jad Abumrad thank you all for coming in.

25
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.480
<v 4>Where's my coding much?</v>

26
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.870
So let me,

27
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.940
<v 5>let me just say at the outset, I'm just a tiny bit puzzled. Did you tell it,</v>

28
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.610
tell everyone who you are. Oh, I, yeah, I'm Robert.

29
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.870
Can you just say Robert Crawl, which is my name. And uh, uh,

30
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.220
with all due respect,

31
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.550
I mean if we had any number of things we could done in the hour,

32
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.670
we could have done sex lives of watermelons or something interesting about

33
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:12.481
chrysanthemums.

34
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:17.481
I don't know why choose a Martian invasion radio show from 1938 old old,

35
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.350
old. I'm thinking, I can't believe you wait till now to ask me question. I know.

36
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.330
I'm just thinking. So some of them might be thinking, you know, old, old,

37
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.010
<v 2>no, you don't gay. Well I guess it's a valid question you ask. Truth is,</v>

38
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.190
I actually only discovered the war of the world recently in 2001 kind of late

39
00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:41.891
2001 actually not long after that day in 2001 and it just really struck me and

40
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:50.630
it wasn't so much that the broadcast had a kind of end of the World Nis that I

41
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:52.580
guess we were all feeling in real life at that moment,

42
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:57.581
but it was more just the way that the story unfolded step by step by step and

43
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:03.820
how in the broadcast you feel like you were lost inside a newscast,

44
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.330
which is not unlike what it was like. Yeah, we were all, you know,

45
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.330
glued to the TV and real life grasping at these pieces of news,

46
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:13.240
trying to figure out what was going on. And that was very much,

47
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.750
I think what they were trying to create in the broadcast. But now,

48
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:20.500
many years later, what I'm really left with is a question, what?

49
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.970
Well,

50
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.970
if I were alive in 1938 in front of the radio and I heard this sounds,

51
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.960
what would I have thought would I have believed it would have not believed?

52
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.050
I mean, I don't know. What about you? I don't really know. I don't really know.

53
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.720
I Dunno. Okay, well let's do something. Just start us off here.

54
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:42.520
Let's actually go back to 1938 and see if we can figure out how these sounds

55
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:45.790
landed on people's ears and what information they had in their heads. So,

56
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:50.020
and I need your help with this. How would I help with that? Yeah, you,

57
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.970
I want you to go over to that seat right there. That's,

58
00:03:51.971 --> 00:03:56.830
we're going to call that seat in 1938 all right. There Nike. Okay.

59
00:03:56.831 --> 00:04:01.450
Now just, let's just all imagine there you are on your easy chair.

60
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.030
You're maybe drinking a cream soda.

61
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.030
Let's tune the dial.

62
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.110
<v 0>Okay. Were you always trying to find something here?</v>

63
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.480
[inaudible]

64
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.300
<v 6>okay, I've got something on the dial</v>

65
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.960
in the Park Plaza Hotel in New York today we bring you the

66
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.310
Munich Raymond ruck kilo. Who is Rick

67
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.940
<v 0>marginal or Raymond Rock? Hello.</v>

68
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.600
<v 6>The doctors,</v>

69
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.370
the Fetish Raymont Rick Yellow lead off with lower carpentry de [inaudible].

70
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.873
Nope.

71
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.270
<v 2>You don't know that there's no such person is removed. Rick. Hello.</v>

72
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.540
And it's just a record and a CBS studio, but it sounds professional enough.

73
00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:53.680
So you sit back, you relax. But then later go,

74
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.643
we don't

75
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.220
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>

76
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.840
<v 2>So at this point you think I'm thinking explosions on Mars,</v>

77
00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:35.210
hydrogen gas moving towards earth. A little strange.

78
00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:39.470
But how could it be so bad if I still get to listen to the fabulous notes at the

79
00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:43.220
lovely Raymond Keller and he does continue to play for another minute,

80
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.670
34 seconds. But then it happens again.

81
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.570
<v 6>Ladies and gentlemen, following on the newest,</v>

82
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:50.070
given an off bullet in the moment of golf,

83
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.070
the governor's media rheological bureau has requested the log.

84
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.980
<v 2>Hello. Now before we go ahead and leave it there for, are we going any further?</v>

85
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:01.190
Let me ask a really basic question here. I mean, we're dealing with a play,

86
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:02.660
a radio play. Yeah.

87
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.800
Why would Orson wells and his posse of have troubadours start their play this

88
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:07.460
way?

89
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.460
<v 5>The original h g well story was written in 1898 so it was really an old book at</v>

90
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:17.090
the time. And there, there is no reporter character in the book. By the way,

91
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.120
does everybody know this war of the world story or most people do?

92
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.210
The story basically is this little green creatures from Mars for a number of

93
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:24.770
reasons having to do with thirst or something,

94
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.570
have to leave their planet and they come to Earth. They're not very nice people.

95
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.590
They invade, they destroy quite a number of us.

96
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:37.790
And then ironically in the end they get killed by little viruses,

97
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.830
our smallest inhabitants of our planet, bite them and destroy them.

98
00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:44.990
And it science fiction of course. But in 1938 most kids knew this story.

99
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:47.180
It was very popular. So I don't see why.

100
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.330
<v 2>Right? And in fact,</v>

101
00:06:48.331 --> 00:06:51.720
let me bring in a clip from a Orson wells producer at the time, John Houseman,

102
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.860
uh, Austin and I chose it. We decided the time had come,

103
00:06:55.861 --> 00:07:00.480
we should be doing a science fiction show. And so we tried a few of that.

104
00:07:00.481 --> 00:07:03.750
One very easy to do in just a few days before they had to be on the air with

105
00:07:03.751 --> 00:07:04.950
their next installment,

106
00:07:04.951 --> 00:07:09.240
John Houseman pools that book off the shelf to shows it to o w says, Hey,

107
00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:12.940
what about this in Orson Welles says, yes,

108
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.520
you want me to do this?

109
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.500
<v 1>Well, he had trouble in what sense? In the sense of the design,</v>

110
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.430
you said it was no, no. He said it was boring.

111
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.760
<v 0>Uh, if it was something that happened 50 years ago,</v>

112
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.170
everybody knows it didn't happen. So, uh, who the health care, right?

113
00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.520
<v 1>If we're gonna make people care about this old story,</v>

114
00:07:32.521 --> 00:07:36.570
we've got updated not 1898, 1938.

115
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.240
And it just so happened that one month prior,

116
00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:44.241
something had happened that forever changed the world in the news.

117
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.050
What was that? We'll begin with the story.

118
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.203
<v 0>The</v>

119
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:54.870
[inaudible] [inaudible]

120
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.240
<v 1>Hitler was threatening Europe first, Austria,</v>

121
00:07:57.241 --> 00:08:01.710
then Czechoslovakia World War Two was right around the corner and CBS sent a

122
00:08:01.711 --> 00:08:04.110
team of guys to cover this story among them.

123
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.970
<v 0>Allambia continues or six events with [inaudible] European [inaudible]</v>

124
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.950
<v 1>and in September morrow and his CBS producers did something with the news that</v>

125
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.340
was kind of novel. They broke in,

126
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.700
<v 0>we interrupt this program of music by Howard Jameson,</v>

127
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.200
this orchestra who bring you a bullet in just received and the w o r and he was

128
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:22.660
wrong.

129
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.370
<v 1>Now this had happened before, but never quite like this with live reports,</v>

130
00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:28.770
eye witness account, and never quite so much

131
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.100
<v 0>square up their broadcast. Bring it up in Portland, probably at night of prep</v>

132
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.680
<v 1>in just one month. These bulletins have become so numerous.</v>

133
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.110
We interrupt our program to bring a special broadcast.

134
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.760
That bulletins were practically interrupting both.

135
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.350
We interrupt this program to bring you a special broadcast.

136
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.140
We interrupt this broadcast to bring it as important. You, me from the United

137
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.150
<v 0>leading up this program to take you to the NBC News Room. Yeah,</v>

138
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.550
it's a special of it on the end.

139
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.730
<v 1>So after weeks and weeks of hearing these constant interruptions,</v>

140
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.160
it's easy to understand why this [inaudible] gentleman

141
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.550
<v 2>following on you. It's given an awful lot in the moment of golf.</v>

142
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.160
Didn't sound like a play. Okay.

143
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.440
<v 6>The guy rolled out the there all has requested the [inaudible] of the country,</v>

144
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.310
the cap on astronomical board on any part of it that Starbucks are calling on

145
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:11.580
the planet. We have arranged an interview with another, this product,

146
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.470
my professor parents, I'm going to give out

147
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.270
[inaudible] Jersey. We're not talking about a pedal then with the Keller pillow,

148
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.143
the door.

149
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.260
<v 4>I don't know whether I need it anymore. Raymond Martello.</v>

150
00:09:27.261 --> 00:09:29.630
I need to know a little more about this Martian. Uh,

151
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.830
<v 2>isn't it interesting how slowly it starts? And by the way,</v>

152
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.460
what time do you get on your, uh, your a pocket watch there?

153
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.260
The pocket watch says eight Oh four eight oh four.

154
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.560
Tell me when it gets to eight oh five to what?

155
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.440
805-EIGHT-OH-5805.

156
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.980
You know, just let me know and no. OK. It'll five.

157
00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:00.340
This is my favorite minute in understanding one of the greatest media hoaxes of

158
00:10:00.981 --> 00:10:01.520
all times.

159
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.630
Cause the thing that's interesting is that at this moment in October of 1938,

160
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.590
Orson wells in the mercury theater of the air were not that popular.

161
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.700
They had a tiny, tiny slice of the audience.

162
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.510
And so not too many people were listening. Certainly not at the beginning,

163
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.540
from eight o'clock to eight oh four and so not too many people heard this very

164
00:10:22.551 --> 00:10:23.720
important introduction,

165
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.040
<v 6>the Columbia Broadcasting System and its affiliated stations.</v>

166
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.620
Was that the war of the world by h g? Well,

167
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.080
<v 2>well why wait, why didn't they hear that? Well, cause at that very same moment,</v>

168
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.170
the majority of people listening were tuned into this

169
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:41.740
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

170
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.850
<v 6>the makers of Jason Sanborn copied is the power of Glam, you know, is fresh.</v>

171
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.710
Resent the chase and Sandborne out,

172
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.360
<v 4>um, that chase in sandbourne hours. Now that that was good.</v>

173
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.670
That was Edberg and it had the puppet

174
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.510
Charlie McCarthy Mu who liked girls. It was rainy.

175
00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.980
It was the most popular show at the time, right opposite the murder.

176
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.510
<v 2>Every theater of the year had 10 times the audience.</v>

177
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.540
But at eight oh five host Donald beachy introduces and not so popular singer.

178
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.240
<v 6>And it's the rousing rip roaring song. The vagabonds from the Vagabond J</v>

179
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:19.890
<v 4>oh your mega la [inaudible] de la.</v>

180
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.890
And yes, at that moment, thousands. Hundreds.

181
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:26.200
We don't know how many listeners started to dial. Sir.

182
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.980
<v 2>Where are they landed on the mercury theater of the air already in progress</v>

183
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.130
where they stayed.

184
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.310
<v 6>We already know how to take you to the principle observatory at Princeton</v>

185
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.190
<v 2>because by then a strange meteor had landed</v>

186
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.560
<v 6>where Carl Phillips,</v>

187
00:11:44.561 --> 00:11:47.150
our commentator will interview with Professor Richard Pearson,

188
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.910
famous astronomer. That's it. The IB cannot questions at any time.

189
00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:54.040
It's about the no piping

190
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.103
<v 0>BIM status.</v>

191
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.400
Excellent. That's kind of the tough one.

192
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.390
<v 7>I just remembered in the other one.</v>

193
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.500
<v 2>Yeah, we've had four interruptions. Now at this point,</v>

194
00:12:13.501 --> 00:12:14.940
you've called your whole family into the room,

195
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.930
<v 8>Marge meteor's on immediately on Mars March, meteors,</v>

196
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.340
y meteors on Mars,

197
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:28.110
<v 2>and just as you are utterly confused, along comes the expert, you know,</v>

198
00:12:28.111 --> 00:12:31.200
people surveyed afterwards said, I didn't believe this thing.

199
00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:35.840
I thought it was all baloney until I heard that government official guy or the a

200
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.050
Princeton professor, and this script is chocked full of believable experts.

201
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:42.020
<v 7>Right? Or the Natural History Museum,</v>

202
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.170
Professor [inaudible] of the California Astronomical Society,

203
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.230
their General Montgomery Smith, Captain Lansing of the signal card.

204
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.860
<v 2>Maybe subconsciously that had an effect to convince people that something was in</v>

205
00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:52.694
fact happening.

206
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.010
A feeling furthered a moment later when the professor and, uh,

207
00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.710
the reporter Carl Phillips, go live to that field in Grovers mill,

208
00:13:00.711 --> 00:13:04.100
New Jersey with that media, right, or whatever it is. It's Atlantic.

209
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.060
<v 0>Hang on one sec. I'm gonna Start. Hi</v>

210
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:25.743
Papa.

211
00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.343
[inaudible].

212
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.260
<v 2>Her mouth is, that's kind of the shape.</v>

213
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.990
What's the lie that's dripping on equipment? I hate rimless lips actually,

214
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.470
as do I. Now, before we get too far into this, see,

215
00:14:10.471 --> 00:14:12.510
let me play you a another clip,

216
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.740
<v 9>right? You're providing majestically Florida like them. Great. Better. Yeah.</v>

217
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:17.643
There's no doubt.

218
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.390
<v 2>Recognize this. See this. Listen a little bit more.</v>

219
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.670
<v 9>Lining the windows, looking down the road ahead of them.</v>

220
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.540
Get a shot to get this cottage. It's fine. Edit pricing. Oh my.

221
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.560
Get out of the way please.

222
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.820
If running and bursting into flames and it's falling on the mornings,

223
00:14:32.821 --> 00:14:37.150
I have to tell him all the humanity at all. The presenters,

224
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.150
Freebie Garages,

225
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.840
<v 2>this is tape of the Hindenburg crash. It's still fresh in people's minds.</v>

226
00:14:41.841 --> 00:14:43.400
Happened one year before the broadcasts,

227
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.780
before going on the air that night after Frank Redick who played that reporter

228
00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.970
call Phillips in the field, he went to the library,

229
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:54.450
dug up this old tape or not so old and played it to himself.

230
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.610
<v 9>Oh, the Humana did all that. [inaudible] oh,</v>

231
00:14:58.611 --> 00:15:02.190
the your manna did all the feathers. [inaudible] oh,

232
00:15:02.191 --> 00:15:04.340
the humanity and all the predators

233
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:10.110
<v 2>get himself in the right frame of mind for that now famous attack scene in that</v>

234
00:15:10.331 --> 00:15:11.230
field and New Jersey.

235
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.340
<v 6>Those pitches know what that means about anything mean. Wait a minute,</v>

236
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:17.413
something happening.

237
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.020
This rising out of the pit and then they got a small beam of light against the

238
00:15:23.021 --> 00:15:27.490
mirror. What's that? Yeah,

239
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.870
the flame springs in the mirror. At least try to do that.

240
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.653
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

241
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.060
<v 2>the transmission cuts off.</v>

242
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.040
12 million people have just heard slithery green aliens.

243
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:56.480
He visceral policemen, farmers and reporters followed by

244
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.970
<v 0>nothing. Why does it go to circumstances beyond our control?</v>

245
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.050
We are going to continue to broadcast from

246
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.790
[inaudible] transmission. However,

247
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.430
we really return to that point at the earliest opportunity

248
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.241
<v 2>and when they do return,</v>

249
00:16:13.241 --> 00:16:16.510
what you learn is that that grounded flying saucer that just zapped all those

250
00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:18.970
men has now stood up. It's grown legs,

251
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.590
it's as tall as a tree and it is marching

252
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:24.190
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

253
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.390
<v 2>through the countryside,</v>

254
00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.170
stopping everything in its path and then we are taken to field reports,

255
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.560
live battle scenes between militia and positive. Before we do,

256
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.440
let me play one more clip. This one is real

257
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.800
<v 7>and one of the areas you mentioned the type of child of school age and wished to</v>

258
00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:41.940
have an evacuated.

259
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.480
You should send him to school tomorrow Friday with hand luggage containing the

260
00:16:48.061 --> 00:16:50.940
child gas mask or a change of underclothing.

261
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.990
<v 2>This is Edward r Murrow reporting from London. Same time period.</v>

262
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.160
Just to give you a sense of how scary it was to be alive at this moment in time,

263
00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.210
kids in England were being told to take gas masks to school,

264
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.740
all of which would've made the following dramatize battle scenes.

265
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:11.390
<v 0>They do now for the field headquarter, the Mulatto, there's robotic mill,</v>

266
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:12.243
New Jersey,

267
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:13.340
<v 2>all the more wheels.</v>

268
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.910
<v 0>31 me to do. You want me to come? 37 degree.</v>

269
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.930
We've got to do fire

270
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.470
here. The New Jersey militia fire on a fleet of marsh and pods

271
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.893
to no avail.

272
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.620
Their sales bounce right off in the margins in retaliation,

273
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.820
release a cloud or poisonous gas

274
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.330
which slowly overtake the soldiers.

275
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:52.470
[inaudible] [inaudible]

276
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.280
<v 7>ladies and gentlemen, I have a grave enough announcement to make incredible.</v>

277
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.190
Come on please ladies and gentlemen. Now another boat from Langland field,

278
00:18:33.191 --> 00:18:37.390
Virginia amongst it is now in control of the Middle Section of New Jersey and

279
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.240
has effectively cut the state through its center highways to the north, south,

280
00:18:40.241 --> 00:18:42.260
and West. The clog with frantic human triathletes.

281
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.970
Nami reserves are unable to control the MED flight communication lines that down

282
00:18:45.971 --> 00:18:47.500
from Pennsylvania to the let go.

283
00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.980
A tone in service discontinued except bachelor prevail throughout New Jersey and

284
00:18:50.981 --> 00:18:53.620
eastern Pennsylvania. Cutting planes report enemy machines.

285
00:18:53.621 --> 00:18:56.870
Now three a number increasing speed northbound kicking over houses and every

286
00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.260
time we take you to Washington for the sons of a nation,

287
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.880
the secretary of the interior, I shall not try to conceal the gravity bullet.

288
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:08.650
It handed me away from the box. Paul ain't going on

289
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:13.300
<v 4>with the customer at the end. Now, no more defense.</v>

290
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:16.950
Everything wiped out.

291
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:37.640
[inaudible] [inaudible]

292
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:41.630
<v 2>we don't know exactly how many people panic that night. Here's what we do now.</v>

293
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.750
The Trenton Police Department got 2000 calls in under two hours.

294
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:53.470
The New York Times switchboard received 875 calls alone from people wanting to

295
00:19:53.871 --> 00:19:54.980
know where they'd be safer

296
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.810
<v 5>on the roof or in the gas rate shelter in a cellar.</v>

297
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:00.721
We are lucky.

298
00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:04.440
We do have transcripts of what happened on the other side of radios that night.

299
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:08.400
Thanks to a Princeton sociologist who went out and conducted a series of

300
00:20:08.401 --> 00:20:12.630
interviews after the broadcast and what's amazing is how effective that

301
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:13.590
broadcast was.

302
00:20:13.591 --> 00:20:18.591
Some listeners said they actually felt like they were choking.

303
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:22.890
Others reported to police that they saw with their own eyes as they looked at

304
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:23.760
the Manhattan skyline.

305
00:20:23.761 --> 00:20:27.480
They saw a thin veil of smoke from the battle over the city.

306
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.000
Some said they saw Martian machines high,

307
00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:33.730
stepping their way down the palisade splash, splash, splash,

308
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.380
and many people when they called operators or police, they didn't say,

309
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.820
oh my God, we're being invaded by Martians. They said, oh my God,

310
00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:44.610
we're being invaded by Germans.

311
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.430
Here are some of the literal transcriptions is what real people

312
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:49.443
<v 2>actually say, right,</v>

313
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.070
<v 10>buddy? Ready? I knew it was some Germans trying to gas us all,</v>

314
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.460
but when the announcer kept on calling them people from Mars,

315
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.900
I just thought he was ignorant.

316
00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.470
I immediately called up the Maplewood police and asked if there was anything

317
00:21:01.471 --> 00:21:03.960
wrong. They answer. We know as much as you do.

318
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.540
Keep your radio tuned in and follow the announcer's advice.

319
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.730
<v 1>Yeah, I called into my husband, Dan, why don't you get dressed?</v>

320
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.040
You don't want to die in your working clothes.

321
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.290
I looked in icebox and saw some chicken left from Sunday dinner that I was

322
00:21:18.291 --> 00:21:21.590
saving for Monday night dinner. I said to my nephew,

323
00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.720
we may as well eat this chicken. We won't be here in the morning.

324
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.610
<v 11>This is Dalton wealth. Ladies and gentlemen, out of character,</v>

325
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:40.500
we'll show you that the war of the world has no further significant and at the

326
00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:42.540
holiday offering it was intended to be.

327
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.820
We annihilated the world before your very ears and utterly destroyed the CBS.

328
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.230
You will be relieved. I hope,

329
00:21:50.231 --> 00:21:54.660
to learn that we didn't mean it and that both institutions are still open for

330
00:21:54.661 --> 00:21:55.494
business.

331
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.750
<v 2>That was that Orson wells concluded the war.</v>

332
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:03.430
The world's broadcast with those words basically. Huh? Was a joke.

333
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.870
Gotcha. But it was only after he and his producer, Jon,

334
00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:11.950
has been left and read the papers the next day and they understood just how much

335
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:16.951
trouble they had caused [inaudible] disagreeable because of for at least a

336
00:22:17.351 --> 00:22:21.580
couple of hours. We believe we were mass murder.

337
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.700
<v 12>Extremely surprised to learn that a story which is become familiar to children</v>

338
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.760
through the medium of comic strips and a

339
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.410
<v 2>this as well as in the press conference that following day,</v>

340
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.040
<v 12>mini succeeding novels and adventure stories should have had such an immediate</v>

341
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:42.490
and profound effect upon radio listeners.

342
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:46.480
<v 2>So immediate and so profound that the FCC Commissioner of the time,</v>

343
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.040
George Henry Payne labeled the Mercury theater of the air,

344
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.080
get this terrorists

345
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:56.560
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

346
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.730
<v 2>radio terrorists.</v>

347
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:03.650
<v 13>But there is one thing we must not overlap all this took place in 1938 and our</v>

348
00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:08.651
less sophisticated yesterday that did not know the atom bomb guided missiles and

349
00:23:09.261 --> 00:23:11.960
rockets that may shortly fly to the Moon Edward

350
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.660
<v 1>r Murrow in 1957. Was he correct when he said that?</v>

351
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:20.420
<v 2>Where are we really so on sophisticated in 1938. I mean,</v>

352
00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:21.890
it's so different from now.

353
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.520
<v 4>Well, let's see. Huh?</v>

354
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.740
<v 10>Stay with US folks. I'm Robert Krulwich and Jana and Ron.</v>

355
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.900
We're alive at the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul,

356
00:23:30.901 --> 00:23:33.360
Minnesota radio lab will continue

357
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.720
<v 4>just a moment.</v>

358
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.680
Radiolab is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

359
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.300
the corporation for public and the National Science Foundation

360
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:51.860
<v 2>radio lab is produced by Wny C and distributed by n p. R.</v>

361
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.440
We interrupt this broadcast for some breaking news. This Justin,

362
00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.860
it seems we may have gotten a few things wrong when we, uh,

363
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:04.320
perform that show many years ago.

364
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.900
Most notably just now when I said that the FCC,

365
00:24:06.901 --> 00:24:11.901
a commissioner in 1938 called Orson Welles radio terrorists in his statement,

366
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.000
he certainly suggests that, but if you read it,

367
00:24:15.001 --> 00:24:18.660
it seems he was actually referring to a statement he made about a year earlier

368
00:24:18.661 --> 00:24:23.661
where he was calling radio producers who terrorized children.

369
00:24:24.271 --> 00:24:28.980
He doesn't actually name Orson Welles by name. I just botched that.

370
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.700
My apologies. And we have this guy to thank for bringing it to our attention.

371
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.770
<v 14>Michael Sokolow and I'm associate professor of journalism and communication at</v>

372
00:24:36.771 --> 00:24:37.790
the University of Maine.

373
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:38.783
<v 2>And uh,</v>

374
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.750
Michael Sokolow also makes an interesting argument that the panic may not have

375
00:24:42.751 --> 00:24:47.370
been as large as we made it sound. For example, uh, we stayed,

376
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.470
the 12 million people were listening on that night,

377
00:24:49.471 --> 00:24:54.060
which is a widely quoted number and it comes from polling done six weeks after

378
00:24:54.061 --> 00:24:54.761
the war.

379
00:24:54.761 --> 00:24:59.010
The world's first aired Sokoloff suspects that the actual number of listeners is

380
00:24:59.011 --> 00:25:03.120
way smaller and there's no way to know for sure, but he trusts a poll conducted

381
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:04.370
<v 14>that night.</v>

382
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:09.400
That night when the broadcast was on 5,000 Americans were surveyed by the CE

383
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.780
Hooper Company, the rating survey company.

384
00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.340
Why are we bothering with a study done six weeks later after the newspaper tells

385
00:25:16.341 --> 00:25:18.260
everybody that there was this giant panic?

386
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.440
Why don't we look at the surveys that were done that night and the survey that

387
00:25:21.441 --> 00:25:24.950
was done 12 hours later by cvs the following morning? What are the two surveys?

388
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:25.701
Immediately after,

389
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:30.701
say the CE Hooper rating survey found 98% of the respondents were not listening

390
00:25:31.851 --> 00:25:33.320
to Orson wells or war of the worlds.

391
00:25:33.321 --> 00:25:36.350
They were listening to the chase in Sanborn hour or their radios were off or

392
00:25:36.351 --> 00:25:40.640
they were listening to another program of the 2% that they found that were

393
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:41.990
listening to war of the world.

394
00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.560
Not a single respondent thought it was a phony news broadcast.

395
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:49.860
<v 2>Sokolow strongly suspects that the panic was actually trumped up by the</v>

396
00:25:49.861 --> 00:25:54.861
newspapers who were trying to sort of piss on this new medium called radio that

397
00:25:55.441 --> 00:25:57.150
was taken away their, you know, audience.

398
00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:01.160
<v 14>Exactly. Here was the opportunity and a radio.</v>

399
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.700
The radio industry and the newspaper industry had been battling for years.

400
00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:09.380
And throughout that decade, the entire newspaper industry had been losing money,

401
00:26:09.381 --> 00:26:12.620
political prestige and other things to the radio industry. You know,

402
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:13.730
some of their best employees.

403
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.230
And so they were waiting for a way to really prove to advertisers and prove to

404
00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:21.290
federal regulators, you know, they had the first amendment,

405
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.320
they understood responsibility. These are the newspaper managers.

406
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.980
These radio guys were conflating advertising with programming.

407
00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:30.680
They were frightening their viewers. They were acting irresponsibly.

408
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.401
And remember,

409
00:26:31.401 --> 00:26:35.810
this is a month after Munich when radio proved that news really works on the

410
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:39.920
radio. Well, one month after radio news, you know, comes of age,

411
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:44.940
suddenly they're conflating news accounts with and they're acting irresponsibly

412
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:46.200
and they're terrorizing the public.

413
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.710
And so the newspaper industry had the perfect thing to hang their critique of

414
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:50.480
radio on.

415
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.080
<v 2>Interesting. And that's interesting. So all those,</v>

416
00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:57.040
all those eye witness accounts that the panic and I thought it was this and I

417
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:58.690
packed my bags and whatever, whatever.

418
00:26:58.691 --> 00:27:02.230
And all this sort of reports of people miscarrying.

419
00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.740
Do you feel like that's all in memory embellished or what?

420
00:27:05.741 --> 00:27:06.410
How do you explain that?

421
00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:09.140
<v 14>Well, let me give you, let me give you an analogy. Okay.</v>

422
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.900
If you were to ask 100 Americans today,

423
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:16.880
did you see a plane fly into the World Trade Center on September 11th I think

424
00:27:16.881 --> 00:27:20.690
you would get an extremely high percentage of people saying they saw that plane

425
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:24.380
fly in. But that's because it's part of our national visual memory.

426
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.170
It's really a trauma and it's, it's,

427
00:27:26.171 --> 00:27:27.980
it's the kind of hysteria and panic we're talking about.

428
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.890
So that moment in time and our relationship to the media. Okay.

429
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:36.200
But if you were to actually find out who's TVs were on live at nine 48 in the

430
00:27:36.201 --> 00:27:38.750
morning that day and who was actually watching,

431
00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.960
there would be a discrepancy in that number. Now,

432
00:27:41.961 --> 00:27:46.280
am I saying all those people are lying? All those people are confused. No.

433
00:27:46.281 --> 00:27:51.170
What I'm saying is that the relationship of memory to the media is extremely

434
00:27:51.171 --> 00:27:52.004
complex,

435
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.370
<v 2>complex indeed,</v>

436
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.910
and we think Michael Sokolov for checking our facts and if you believe as he

437
00:27:56.911 --> 00:27:58.890
does, the 1938 panic was,

438
00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.280
well it didn't happen or it wasn't as bad as it sounds then that actually makes

439
00:28:02.281 --> 00:28:06.780
what we talked about next in our live broadcast, even more puzzling.

440
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.580
So let's get back to that. This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad.

441
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.160
I'm Robert Krulwich. We are in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

442
00:28:13.161 --> 00:28:14.870
Coming to you live from the Fitzgerald Theater.

443
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.770
Our subject today is the war of the worlds broadcast.

444
00:28:18.771 --> 00:28:21.680
Originally on October 30th, 1938

445
00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.800
<v 5>okay, now I'm gonna ask the house for a show of hands.</v>

446
00:28:24.801 --> 00:28:26.570
The question for the house is,

447
00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:31.780
do you think that somebody else could imagine the broadcast using the exact same

448
00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:35.210
script more or less? Also with Martians also invading,

449
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.400
also interrupting the musical things.

450
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:41.210
Same deal after all the publicity from the 1938 broadcast.

451
00:28:41.211 --> 00:28:46.070
Could you do it twice? Show of hands, please. Oh,

452
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:50.170
some of you don't think so. Look if we, if,

453
00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.980
if there wasn't another one of these,

454
00:28:51.981 --> 00:28:53.600
what would we be doing for the next 40 minutes?

455
00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.750
<v 2>So those of you who've raised your hands, let's say it's about 75% of you,</v>

456
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:03.430
you are correct because it has happened again. And I want to tell you a story.

457
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:04.750
It's an amazing story, really.

458
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:09.550
An underreported story of a war of the worlds reenactment happened in the

459
00:29:09.551 --> 00:29:14.500
mountains of Quito, Ecuador in 1949 we were very lucky.

460
00:29:14.501 --> 00:29:17.290
We had a reporter, Tony Fields, who happened to be traveling there.

461
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:21.510
We asked them to do a couple of interviews for people who heard it or were

462
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.960
there, and he brought back some tape and played it for me in studio. All right,

463
00:29:25.961 --> 00:29:29.870
so Tony set the scene for me. 1949 Quito. Where's Quito?

464
00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:31.460
Quito is the capital of Ecuador.

465
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:35.770
Iquitos in the middle of the mountains in the Andes mountains and small town,

466
00:29:35.771 --> 00:29:40.270
big town. Quito. Now is a big city. At the time it was a pretty small city.

467
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:44.980
It had a quarter of a million people, you know, 300,000 tops. Um,

468
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.940
the word that everybody who I spoke to use to describe the way that Quito was in

469
00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:51.340
1949 was trying Hilo

470
00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:57.940
[inaudible] and I want to see that [inaudible] like tranquil. Exactly.

471
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:00.940
It is what it sounds like. Tranquil, calm, chill,

472
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.350
and Radio Quito was the most popular radio station.

473
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.140
<v 0>Everybody was into it.</v>

474
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.950
<v 2>So those are your basic ingredients. You get a small town population,</v>

475
00:30:12.951 --> 00:30:16.730
250,000. You have one major radio station,

476
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.720
which also happened to be in the same building as the one major newspaper,

477
00:30:20.721 --> 00:30:24.740
El Comercio and the leader of the radio station. The guy who ran it,

478
00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:29.240
a devious fellow by the name of Leonardo Pius,

479
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:33.710
one day someone shows up with a script for Orson wells, not HD wills.

480
00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:37.700
Orson Welles version of war of the worlds, gives it a Leonardo pious. He reads,

481
00:30:37.701 --> 00:30:41.100
it says, brilliant, we've got to do this.

482
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.700
Hue and Quito ban certain local place names, you know.

483
00:30:43.701 --> 00:30:45.650
So instead of the Martians landing in New Jersey,

484
00:30:45.651 --> 00:30:48.830
they would land and cut the [inaudible], which is on the outskirts of Quito.

485
00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.790
They write in parts for government officials, the minister of the interior.

486
00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.310
The mayor of Tito is there. Actors are real government.

487
00:30:56.311 --> 00:30:59.450
These would be factors doing impressions, doing impressions. That's right.

488
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.040
Not only that, pious got his bosses at the newspaper,

489
00:31:04.041 --> 00:31:08.480
El Comercio to agree to run little articles in the newspaper in the two days

490
00:31:08.481 --> 00:31:10.490
leading up to the broadcast reporting.

491
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:14.800
That strange objects had been seen in a sky's over Keith though.

492
00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:17.803
<v 0>Wow.</v>

493
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:22.420
<v 2>So he set out to screw with people basically. I mean he was planting paranoia.</v>

494
00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:27.580
It really seems like he wanted people to believe what they were hearing that

495
00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:28.603
night.

496
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:32.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

497
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:37.700
<v 2>Okay, so Saturday, February 12th, 1949 the day of the broadcast,</v>

498
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:42.600
all day long listeners here and announcement windows niches and you'll notice a

499
00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:46.200
notice that there's going to be a special performance. It's like a duo,

500
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:48.700
Benitez Valencia. They need this.

501
00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:53.770
Valencia Valencia at that time were one of the most popular musical acts in town

502
00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.300
in Gladio. Quito. Why don't you cue up a track number for [inaudible]

503
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:02.830
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

504
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:07.060
<v 2>eight o'clock rolls around Beneatha's Valencia launches into their performance.</v>

505
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.620
They play a few songs

506
00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:11.930
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

507
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.360
<v 2>and suddenly there's an interruption.</v>

508
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:20.370
<v 15>Some sort of strange kind of interference like sound.</v>

509
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.740
What do you mean? Like static, static, a signals,

510
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:27.920
you know something's wrong with it. It's not coming in quite right. Wait,

511
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.200
what was that? Well, it turns out that Leonardo,

512
00:32:30.201 --> 00:32:32.510
the pies in addition to the other tricks they had up his sleeve,

513
00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:37.900
he had a salad effects guy in the corner that was creating this sounded like

514
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.133
[inaudible]

515
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.180
<v 2>like when it garrison Keillor's guys kind of a thing.</v>

516
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.790
<v 4>That's right, Tom. Keith. Everyone.</v>

517
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:55.650
<v 15>Eventually the music stops and Leonardo Paez comes on the air and says</v>

518
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.830
[inaudible] please dear listeners, excuse the technical difficulties.

519
00:33:01.831 --> 00:33:06.720
There seems to be some sort of atmosphere conditions interfering with the radio.

520
00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.650
Keep those signal. But you are the thing to radio ketosis brought to you by,

521
00:33:10.651 --> 00:33:14.800
you know, such and such. And now back to this balance here.

522
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.013
There's balance here.

523
00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:19.750
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

524
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:23.800
<v 15>so we hear another couple of songs and then there's another interruption up in</v>

525
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.440
soon. It's laying out to the payers again. And this time,

526
00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:31.060
this time it's a news flash. So now we're on script. That's right. That's right.

527
00:33:31.061 --> 00:33:36.061
They send pyres out to report from the scene and pies is doing the play by play.

528
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.370
You know, what is it? Hang on my God, the tops on school, you know,

529
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.150
come the clinicals

530
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.080
and here come the heat. Rise and Zap.

531
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.020
Hi, is this fry?

532
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.320
<v 2>You can wait, wait, wait, wait. Do we have forget reenactments?</v>

533
00:33:58.321 --> 00:34:01.530
Do we have a copy of that? The real broadcast from that night,

534
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.300
all we have are descriptions.

535
00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.350
There is no existing recording of what was broadcast that night and,

536
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.970
and you'll understand why in a second.

537
00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.320
So while I was down there in Quito,

538
00:34:14.321 --> 00:34:16.930
I interviewed a bunch of people about what happened that night.

539
00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.690
By all accounts at work

540
00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:24.611
<v 15>outside,</v>

541
00:34:24.611 --> 00:34:29.611
it was here may everything that happened next happened extremely quickly.

542
00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:32.020
People pull it out into the streets.

543
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.620
People were running but they didn't know where to run.

544
00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.710
The spaceship supposedly was in the north of the city,

545
00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:43.711
but there's black cloud of gas was in the south and a lot of them actually did

546
00:34:44.111 --> 00:34:46.000
what any good Catholic would do.

547
00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.270
They made a beeline for the church,

548
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.140
<v 2>the church, because, because they were,</v>

549
00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.660
they thought they'd be safe there or perhaps,

550
00:34:54.661 --> 00:34:58.820
or perhaps they just wanted to get right with God before the world ended there.

551
00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.720
Even reports, and I wasn't able to confirm this,

552
00:35:00.721 --> 00:35:04.020
but there were reports of men confessing to adultery right there in front of

553
00:35:04.021 --> 00:35:08.580
their wives and priests. Absolving whole crowds at once.

554
00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.730
Queue up a track track. 10

555
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.820
[inaudible] [inaudible] was [inaudible]. This is Jorge [inaudible],

556
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:22.950
who was a longtime journalist, worked for many years at the newspaper.

557
00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.850
He was listening with his family. They all believed it. They all ran outside,

558
00:35:26.851 --> 00:35:30.780
found a taxi cab to the kids in the rest of them ran behind the taxi cab.

559
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.580
They were going to [inaudible] the city, you Glen

560
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:40.530
[inaudible] and he tells that he sees going the other way. You buy this convoy.

561
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:41.100
Okay.

562
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:45.680
<v 15>Military trucks filled with soldiers. Do we? Real trucks,</v>

563
00:35:45.681 --> 00:35:46.700
real military fans,

564
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:50.720
real military vans with the real soldiers and cops behind them and they're

565
00:35:50.721 --> 00:35:54.080
screaming towards the north of the city. Where are they going?

566
00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:58.260
They're going to cut the cord [inaudible] to fight the Martians. Yeah. No.

567
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:00.640
So if you, if you had any

568
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.480
<v 2>doubt at this point that this was a, well maybe it's, maybe it's real.</v>

569
00:36:03.481 --> 00:36:07.440
Maybe it's not. Once you saw this military advance, you were like, oh, bleep,

570
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.120
I've got to get the hell out. Right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

571
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:15.120
I believe that does, does everybody in Quito believe like the army beat?

572
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.220
Didn't someone call the general beforehand?

573
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:20.520
Say Tonight we're having a broad day. The mayor or someone who sounded an awful,

574
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:23.370
like the mayor was on the radio saying Martians were invading.

575
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.840
And so if you're the army guy,

576
00:36:24.841 --> 00:36:27.240
you're going to go check it out or you have to protect.

577
00:36:27.241 --> 00:36:30.390
But the mayor didn't call the general before a no, no. So,

578
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.610
so then what happens at the end of the show,

579
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:36.870
assuming it ends with the way they always do as Omaha judge, then what?

580
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.600
Well, they stormed the radio station.

581
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.850
<v 15>Let's go ahead. By the time it broadcast ended and it was announced,</v>

582
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.730
but the whole thing was a play.

583
00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:55.120
A huge crowds were in the streets and word that it was a hoax spread pretty

584
00:36:55.161 --> 00:36:59.720
quickly. All that fear turned pretty quickly to anger.

585
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.260
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

586
00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.980
<v 15>by nine 30 is these a few hundred people outside the station?</v>

587
00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.730
At some point there's boxer shows out there just been a match in the Central

588
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:12.910
Plaza and the boxer shows up and he's driving this truck and the truck is full

589
00:37:12.911 --> 00:37:16.300
of rocks. These what? Rocks is full of rocks. Yeah.

590
00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:20.320
And people start hurling. The rocks at the station,

591
00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:24.570
at the windows and windows are shattering. They managed to break into the,

592
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.680
to the ground floor where the printing presses on.

593
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:29.650
They're smashing printing presses. At some point,

594
00:37:29.651 --> 00:37:34.240
some people in the crowd materialize and they have these flaming torches and it

595
00:37:34.241 --> 00:37:37.690
just goes up like a matched. So, so, so where people hurt during this

596
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:42.400
<v 2>six people died. Oh really? Yeah, most escaped.</v>

597
00:37:42.401 --> 00:37:45.410
There was about 50 people in the building. Most got, uh, up to the roof,

598
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:50.090
jump to adjoining buildings. But six people died according to a reporter, Tony,

599
00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:52.790
uh, one guy are stayed behind.

600
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:57.550
The last guy on the air that night was a man by the name of Louis Beltran.

601
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:00.563
Maria, are you there?

602
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:01.523
<v 16>Yes, I'm here.</v>

603
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.700
<v 2>Okay. This is Maria Beltran. Testagrossa a Lewis Bill,</v>

604
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.620
trans daughter and Maria, you are listening to,

605
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.960
to everything that just came before this. Yeah.

606
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:17.190
Tell us the story from Your Dad's perspective, uh, from here forward.

607
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.990
He was on the air. What was he doing?

608
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.660
<v 16>Uh, well he was, he was on the air. He was the,</v>

609
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:26.100
I guess hosting the music program and also doing some of the interruption with

610
00:38:26.101 --> 00:38:27.720
the, uh, with the bogus. Uh,

611
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.600
<v 2>but the point at the point in which the fire started, what was he saying?</v>

612
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.040
<v 16>Well, at that point when he realized the magnitude of situation,</v>

613
00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:41.041
he went back on the air and began pleading for help pleading for assistance from

614
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:44.860
the police and the fire department. But as you said before,

615
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.980
no help came because the police were going to fight the Morrison. Yeah.

616
00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:53.830
And uh, eventually he was the last one left and uh,

617
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.200
and he jumped out the window.

618
00:38:56.201 --> 00:39:00.940
I'd get from the either the third or fourth floor onto a second floor balcony.

619
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.680
And to break the fall, I guess it's [inaudible]. You want to break the fall?

620
00:39:05.681 --> 00:39:10.630
He grabbed onto the railing of that balcony and he was completely engulfed in

621
00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:11.680
flames at that point.

622
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.640
And the skin on his hands just remained on the balcony.

623
00:39:15.641 --> 00:39:18.400
It was like a barbecue grill. And uh,

624
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:23.020
from there he jumped to the ground, but before he jumped,

625
00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:27.820
he was pleading to the crowd to I guess catch him, but they didn't.

626
00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.960
He landed on cement, uh, broke legs,

627
00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:37.000
arm ribs, everything, and compounded by the very,

628
00:39:37.001 --> 00:39:40.120
very serious burns that he had all over his body.

629
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:43.330
<v 2>So he landed at the feet of an angry mob. What a,</v>

630
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.040
<v 16>an angry mob. And He, uh,</v>

631
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.380
he recall that as he's losing consciousness, he just heard somebody say,

632
00:39:50.381 --> 00:39:54.910
just let him die in peace. Although some of the articles that I read,

633
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:59.640
they try to throw him back into the building. Really. If someone, uh,

634
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:04.030
grabbed him and put him in a jeep to take him to the hospital, just a bystander.

635
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.620
And you know, he had so many scars here as children,

636
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.440
like my brother and I would, we'd play with his scars.

637
00:40:11.441 --> 00:40:14.350
You would trace them with our finger and ask them what happened.

638
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.830
You know how we got the scars and he would tell us about the fire that,

639
00:40:17.831 --> 00:40:21.070
you know, the building had burned and he would tell us about that.

640
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:25.190
<v 2>What would he tell you the whole story or how much of this did you know?</v>

641
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.520
<v 16>Dory, he would just give us in just in broad terms,</v>

642
00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:32.340
but he had been in a building that caught fire. Uh, he also told us, you know,

643
00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:36.560
he had been in a radio announcer, but, uh, as children we didn't really ask him.

644
00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.950
Maybe had we been older and asked them, he would have told us the whole story.

645
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.720
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

646
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.580
And we should say that your dad stayed behind to try and help other people get

647
00:40:44.581 --> 00:40:47.100
out of the building. Well, let me ask you a question though. Uh,

648
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:49.170
your dad obviously is a hero,

649
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:53.340
but given the fact that he was one of the voices that created the panic,

650
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:57.060
do you feel some sort of ambivalence about it?

651
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.190
Did he feel some sort of ambivalence about,

652
00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.620
<v 16>I don't know, in retrospect whether he did or not,</v>

653
00:41:01.621 --> 00:41:05.190
I'm sure they must have been some ambivalence. But from what I understand,

654
00:41:05.191 --> 00:41:06.420
the story was kept,

655
00:41:06.421 --> 00:41:11.421
it was very top secret so that even the employees did not know what was going to

656
00:41:11.791 --> 00:41:14.350
be broadcast during that music program. Really though,

657
00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:17.400
I don't know at what point he was informed of the detail.

658
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:19.400
So I don't know really how we felt about,

659
00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:22.260
I wish I had had an opportunity to ask him.

660
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:24.360
<v 2>Hmm. Well listen, Maria,</v>

661
00:41:24.361 --> 00:41:29.110
thank you so much for your time and joining us here and yeah, thanks. Perfect.

662
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:32.943
<v 4>Okay.</v>

663
00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.340
<v 0>Hi. Hi.</v>

664
00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.390
<v 5>Want to know what happened to the guy who planned the whole,</v>

665
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.970
<v 2>uh, well he, uh, he got out through the roof like a lot of others.</v>

666
00:41:42.971 --> 00:41:46.480
He hopped to the next building, hit out for a few days,

667
00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:49.900
and then fled the country to Venezuelan. Never to return,

668
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.350
never to return, never to return.

669
00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:58.120
But I should say that among the six people who died that night was his

670
00:41:58.121 --> 00:42:01.030
girlfriend and a nephew of his.

671
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.740
<v 5>Okay. So the 1949 kito broadcast caused a whole lot of trouble.</v>

672
00:42:06.741 --> 00:42:10.280
The 1938 New York broadcast caused a whole lot of trouble.

673
00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:13.280
Now everybody here before who raised their hand and thought that this could

674
00:42:13.281 --> 00:42:16.610
happen again. You are right. Again,

675
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.200
Lao Buffalo, 1968

676
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:22.723
<v 2>chapel</v>

677
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.100
<v 0>[inaudible] on the radio. Let me go to get it all together.</v>

678
00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:29.550
Between now and about midnight a little bit then after or whatever.

679
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.960
It's the height of the Vietnam war, Wk BW broadcast.

680
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.580
It's fascinating.

681
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.630
<v 5>The version of the war of the worlds updated for the Times.</v>

682
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:42.630
It sounds kind of like your basic DJ set until you hear this.

683
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.480
<v 12>What is his Joe down and to be something here that I'm supposed to read.</v>

684
00:42:46.481 --> 00:42:49.270
Thank you. Thank you Joe. Uh, let's see. The NASA, NASA,

685
00:42:49.271 --> 00:42:51.580
the national spacious and aeronautics administration.

686
00:42:51.581 --> 00:42:56.350
Those people have alerted all their space watch and a facilities to be on the

687
00:42:56.351 --> 00:42:59.620
alert for unusual communication difficulties tonight I suppose before the,

688
00:42:59.621 --> 00:43:03.880
a federal agency referred to the explosions on the planet Mars and study was not

689
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.090
known if they would have the same effect on earth communications as similar

690
00:43:07.091 --> 00:43:08.780
explosions on the surface of the sun.

691
00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:11.530
I guess you're talking about sun spots and things like that. So, uh,

692
00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.130
I don't know that shadow to it means that it's to be hard to hear communications

693
00:43:15.131 --> 00:43:15.930
from national. I don't know.

694
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:19.030
<v 0>Can you hear me? Daughter's South Carolina. Laura, you can hear kv whatevers.</v>

695
00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.010
You make it by communication.

696
00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.210
[inaudible] y'all can you take what you're hearing on a week night,

697
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.970
getting it all together where it is? Will you pay me double? You remember WKBS

698
00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:33.300
<v 5>WWE broadcast followed the same structure as the original broadcast.</v>

699
00:43:33.301 --> 00:43:36.920
We've heard tonight long stretches of music than the news bulletins and the sent

700
00:43:36.921 --> 00:43:38.760
me realistic field reports. Here's one of them.

701
00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:39.680
<v 0>What do you got?</v>

702
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.210
You got walking injuries or real bad or you got the same vivid descriptions of

703
00:43:44.211 --> 00:43:48.560
Martians. Hi, bike on. We all got it, Don. I got it. They all got it, Huh?

704
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.800
<v 5>And according to the station manager, Jeff K, he gets the same outcome.</v>

705
00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:54.210
People bought it.

706
00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:58.700
<v 12>The Buffalo police and telephone company reported to Wk VW that they receive</v>

707
00:43:58.701 --> 00:44:00.200
more than 4,000 phone calls.

708
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:04.460
The Canadian military authorities dispatched military units to the Peace Bridge,

709
00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.400
the Rainbow Bridge, and the Queenstown Bridge to repel invaders.

710
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.420
The story was carried the next day by 47 newspapers,

711
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.400
the country wide and on the night of the show and during the show,

712
00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.400
you're not depressed bureaus up and down the east coast of America where a

713
00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:20.240
besieged by phone calls asking about the Martian invasion in buffalo.

714
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.270
Incredible. You're absolutely right. It is incredible.

715
00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:33.020
<v 4>[inaudible] thanks to the folks at Wk BW</v>

716
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.520
<v 0>buffalo for that. What is this music, by the way?</v>

717
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.120
This is the disco version of war of the worlds 1978

718
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.640
there's a discovery. It still sells a lot of copies. You'd be surprised.

719
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.110
Here's the obvious question to ask.

720
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.340
<v 1>Why does this keep working? Oh, well that's a difficult question.</v>

721
00:44:55.341 --> 00:44:58.160
I came across a psychology professor. I'm Richard Gehrig.

722
00:44:58.161 --> 00:45:03.161
I am a professor of psychology in the cognitive experimental program at Stony

723
00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:03.620
Brook University.

724
00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:08.090
He has this notion Richard Gehrig does and it rude people are suckers for

725
00:45:08.091 --> 00:45:11.780
stories. We just cannot help ourselves. When a story starts,

726
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:13.450
you just kind of go, whoa.

727
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:17.360
I think the norm is to fall into the story and that it's unusual to sort of keep

728
00:45:17.361 --> 00:45:19.800
yourself from falling it by. Favorite example is a,

729
00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.690
there's a scene in gold finger.

730
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:29.590
Yeah. For the all time best James Bond movie. I think we're bond is tied down,

731
00:45:29.591 --> 00:45:32.950
spread eagle on a piece of metal and there's this laser coming toward him,

732
00:45:32.951 --> 00:45:34.660
which really looks like he's gonna cut them into.

733
00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.270
And even as I'm saying that right now,

734
00:45:37.271 --> 00:45:40.240
I'm starting to feel a little bit of anxiety cause as a picture get in my head

735
00:45:40.241 --> 00:45:43.720
and pitch me that laser coming toward him. And you know, spoiler alert,

736
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:48.310
he doesn't actually get split by the laser. Yeah. Sorry.

737
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:49.210
But here's the thing.

738
00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:51.790
Go and watch the movie now and see if you can get through that scene without

739
00:45:51.791 --> 00:45:52.630
experience. Suspense.

740
00:45:52.631 --> 00:45:57.631
And it really seems to say something very powerful and strong about how immerse

741
00:45:58.301 --> 00:46:00.400
we can become in a narrative world.

<v 1>the thing is we do go in, Lee all fall into these stories. He says,</v>

745
00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:22.010
it's just the way we are built for hundreds of thousands of years. Our memories,

746
00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.340
our friendships, our sense of family, our kinship.

747
00:46:25.341 --> 00:46:28.400
We build our identities from stories,

748
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:31.520
stories that we tell and stories that we hear.

749

<v 17>Um,</v>

766
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.760
<v 4>is the sound of 700 people who have come to bear witness to that</v>

767
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:52.330
<v 1>during our show today. We are in the Fitzgerald Theater at Saint Paul,</v>

768
00:48:52.331 --> 00:48:55.900
Minnesota talking about these strange phenomenon that is the war of the worlds.

769
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:59.040
You know, I, it's very great that everybody's here of course. But this,

770
00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:03.340
there is one guy I really wish had been here. Who's that? The Ecuadorian guy.

771
00:49:03.341 --> 00:49:07.420
Leonardo. Well, let's just, yeah, yeah, because he's the guy I want to ask.

772
00:49:07.421 --> 00:49:12.400
Like what were you thinking? That's what I want. When he's dead,

773
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:15.540
he's dead. Yeah. Well, but how Orson Wells, I would say to him, what,

774
00:49:15.541 --> 00:49:18.220
what were you thinking? I would say dead. They had, yeah.

775
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:23.170
How about the guy in Buffalo, buffalo? A missing retired?

776
00:49:23.171 --> 00:49:25.810
I don't know. That's ask somebody.

777
00:49:25.811 --> 00:49:30.160
So I found the guy who I think is definitely alive. I am Daniel Myrick,

778
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:31.150
Cole writer,

779
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:36.150
Co Director of the Blair witch project before making the Blair witch project and

780
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:38.800
my record a recording of the war of the worlds,

781
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:41.170
which he was pretty young at the time. He was a teenager.

782
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:44.350
I just thought it was brilliant. I absolutely,

783
00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.390
the coolest thing and more than anything else,

784
00:49:46.391 --> 00:49:48.640
he was impressed by the technique of the thing.

785
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:52.240
There's a couple of moments in particular where they cut to the kind of onsite

786
00:49:52.241 --> 00:49:54.990
reporter, I'll return you to call fill upset drivers,

787
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:58.530
but it's almost like cut in a second or two early and you hear the reporters

788
00:49:58.531 --> 00:50:02.020
saying, so are we on? Are we on it, ladies and gentlemen?

789
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:03.910
And then he goes into his indie character.

790
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.510
Here I am back with stonewall and it says little beats,

791
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.470
those little moments that really make it convincing.

792
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:13.780
I get this kind of guilty excitement when I, when I know how it affected people.

793
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:17.710
Myrick never forgot that sense of guilty excitement.

794
00:50:17.711 --> 00:50:22.600
He was fascinated by the idea that scary stories get even scarier if you think

795
00:50:22.601 --> 00:50:25.750
they're true. So years later, fresh out of film school,

796
00:50:25.751 --> 00:50:28.010
he and his friend Eduardo Sanchez decided

797
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.610
<v 5>to develop their own a well's like product. It's your basic scary which story?</v>

798
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:35.240
Three a kids go into the woods. Okay, okay, okay, we're leaving right now.

799
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.871
They get lost.

800
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:39.110
They bumped into the witch and then they die or they think they die.

801
00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.280
You never see them again.

802
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:44.870
But when you entered the theater to see the Blair witch project,

803
00:50:44.871 --> 00:50:47.990
the first thing that you'd see on the screen are these two sentences.

804
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:53.230
It would read in October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the

805
00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:59.660
woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary. A year later,

806
00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:01.820
their footage was found.

807
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:06.880
So the suggestion here is that what we see is not a movie with ag mind that you

808
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:09.350
were in a movie theater, right?

809
00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:15.200
And you're paid $10 and have some popcorn. Yeah, yeah. But when you went,

810
00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:16.100
when you went sat down,

811
00:51:16.101 --> 00:51:20.360
what you saw was something called the found footage shot by three kids who have

812
00:51:20.361 --> 00:51:23.540
gone missing. And so these kids, you're not sure,

813
00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:27.290
but they might be real. Well,

814
00:51:27.291 --> 00:51:32.291
we picked a subject matter that was difficult to disprove to the casual

815
00:51:32.421 --> 00:51:36.920
observer. Martians invading from outer space is you turn the channel to the next

816
00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:40.040
networking. If no one's reporting about it, it's pretty well assured.

817
00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:43.910
It's probably fiction, but three missing students in the woods, you know,

818
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:47.570
that's something that is a little harder to disprove without a fair amount of

819
00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:50.000
scrutiny. And it worked.

820
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:54.230
We were getting calls from police wondering where these three kids were and how

821
00:51:54.231 --> 00:51:56.900
come they never heard of this case? You're kidding. Oh yeah.

822
00:51:56.901 --> 00:51:58.180
I mean it was constant. Oh,

823
00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:01.160
so people saw the whole thing and thought they saw something real still do.

824
00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.730
I still get emails occasionally on what part of the story is real. You know,

825
00:52:04.731 --> 00:52:08.380
is there still any phenomena out in Burkittsville and Dah, Dah, Dah,

826
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:10.310
all fiction and is all made up.

827
00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:14.870
And I think it reinforces what I think Ed and I suspected that so much of us

828
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:19.040
wants to believe. Some people told Dan Myrick that after watching the suite,

829
00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:22.880
campers go into the woods, they themselves would never go camping again.

830
00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:27.430
And he thought that was fabulous. You love to go, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,

831
00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:31.070
whoa, Whoa, whoa. Why would you not want people to go camping?

832
00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:36.530
I mean, well, no, honestly, why would you do that to people? I asked him. Well,

833
00:52:36.531 --> 00:52:38.210
I think that's the goal of any filmmaker.

834
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:42.830
When you make a move and whether you want people to laugh or cry or be scared,

835
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:47.720
you're trying to affect people so viscerally and so emotionally that it has a

836
00:52:47.721 --> 00:52:51.170
resonating effect on them long after they've seen your moving.

837
00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.980
I mean that's why you're doing it. You know,

838
00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.580
we're not making this movie to kind of scare people.

839
00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:58.010
We were making the film to really scare people.

840
00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.550
No regrets on people not wanting to go camping afterwards.

841
00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.180
So the question is,

842
00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:14.230
is that what Orson Welles was up to back in 1938 was he just trying to give

843
00:53:14.231 --> 00:53:16.930
people a good old fashion show business scare,

844
00:53:16.931 --> 00:53:19.000
make them scream way up in the balcony.

845
00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:21.430
Cause remember at the time that is what he claimed,

846
00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:26.130
that this was simply an entertainment. This is Austin, ladies and gentlemen

847
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:30.930
<v 11>out of character to assure you that the war of the worlds has no further</v>

848
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:33.630
significance. And as the holiday offering,

849
00:53:33.631 --> 00:53:38.400
it was intended to be the mercury theater's own radio version of dressing up in

850
00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:40.650
a sheet and jumping out of a Bush and saying boom.

851
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:45.950
<v 5>16 years later, Orson wells changed the story.</v>

852
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:50.090
Here he is on the BBC. The year is 1955

853
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.550
<v 11>in fact, we weren't as innocent as we meant to be.</v>

854
00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:55.770
When we did the Martian broadcast,

855
00:53:55.771 --> 00:54:00.771
we were fed up with the way in which everything that came over,

856
00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:04.050
this new magic box, the radio was being swallowed.

857
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:10.190
So in a way our broadcast was an assault on the credibility of that machine.

858
00:54:11.221 --> 00:54:16.221
We wanted people to understand that they shouldn't swallow everything that came

859
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:17.610
through the tap.

860
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:21.510
<v 5>So here are two ways to think about the war of the worlds. One,</v>

861
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:25.410
it was a smashing entertainment using every trick they could think of including

862
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:27.690
inventing some new ones to scare you.

863
00:54:27.691 --> 00:54:31.140
Silly master storytelling or or,

864
00:54:31.141 --> 00:54:34.770
and it was, we're trying to send you a warning,

865
00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:36.750
don't trust everything you hear on the radio.

866
00:54:36.751 --> 00:54:40.650
It's not always true to which one was it. You think?

867
00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:45.210
Well, I asked the Professor Jason Lavilla me. Yeah,

868
00:54:45.211 --> 00:54:49.650
you Jason Him. He's a radio historian at the University of Maryland.

869
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:54.770
He says that what wells understood was that a newscast is often two things at

870
00:54:55.651 --> 00:55:00.450
once in a newscast. You hear something scary or disturbing sometimes,

871
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.960
but it's going to be told to you in a way that sues you,

872
00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:06.360
meaning the authority of the voice, the newscasters,

873
00:55:06.361 --> 00:55:08.040
steady voice coming through the radio.

874
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:12.270
It will calm you like President Roosevelt's famous fireside chat.

875
00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:13.553
<v 11>Hi Friend.</v>

876
00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:18.280
I want to prop for a few minutes with the people of the United States about

877
00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:19.930
banking. He's so calm.

878
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.370
<v 10>The charge as professor [inaudible],</v>

879
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.460
when you study the rhetoric that Roosevelt used,

880
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.610
he really did convey two messages. One,

881
00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:32.330
we're in terrible danger and two, I've got it covered.

882
00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:37.070
And that is the sort of the, the authoritative voice coming out of the darkness.

883
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:42.020
This sort of invisible disembodied voice of the powerful man. Um,

884
00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:44.240
the news anchor timber 22nd,

885
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:47.750
1940 and we'll see this with Moreau on the rooftops.

886
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:52.110
<v 13>Britain standing on the roof during the blitz looking out over London,</v>

887
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:56.280
straight in front of the, now you'll hear two sounds in just a moment

888
00:55:57.970 --> 00:55:58.803
where they are.

889
00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.990
<v 10>He's giving us a story of an unfolding emergency,</v>

890
00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:05.920
<v 13>I should think in a few minutes. There may be a bit of shrapnel around here,</v>

891
00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.860
<v 10>but his mastery of the information,</v>

892
00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:13.420
his mastery of his own voice is bravery on the scene.

893
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:16.640
<v 13>You may be able to hear the sound of guns off in the distance. Very thankfully,</v>

894
00:56:16.641 --> 00:56:17.900
like someone kicking a tub.

895
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:22.280
<v 10>This was the beginning of the formatting of fear,</v>

896
00:56:22.281 --> 00:56:24.190
the formatting of crisis.

897
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:28.780
<v 2>It's sort of a ritual where we're sort of evoking a terrible danger and then</v>

898
00:56:28.781 --> 00:56:33.580
somehow assuaging those fears through the performance of the news.

899
00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:38.850
And so people go to the news not to be afraid but to be afraid.

900
00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:43.870
And then to be reassured. Robert [inaudible] you file things for the news.

901
00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:44.560
Yeah.

902
00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:49.120
Do you buy this that a news reporter does these two things simultaneously,

903
00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.200
<v 5>gears and then reassures and then Scott, you never go, you know,</v>

904
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:53.760
go cover the governor and say,

905
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:56.460
first I'm going to scare them and then I'm going to assuage them, you know,

906
00:56:56.461 --> 00:56:59.510
when would do that? Why else would you talk that way? I mean not you. Oh,

907
00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.520
<v 2>but I mean the, the, the, the anchors will sometimes. Yeah.</v>

908
00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:06.590
<v 5>Well, the the form him of the news is a,</v>

909
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:09.650
because the guy is always there because he's an anchor.

910
00:57:09.651 --> 00:57:10.970
That's what the word means.

911
00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:15.200
It is a reassuring thing to see them night after night telling and telling,

912
00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:19.190
but [inaudible] says that the real genius of the war of the worlds was that

913
00:57:19.191 --> 00:57:24.080
wells put you into a newscast where you expect anchors to anchor and you expect

914
00:57:24.081 --> 00:57:29.081
reporters to report and then he kills the reporter and the anchor and suddenly

915
00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:33.130
you're left all by yourself in your own living room all alone.

916
00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:35.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

917
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:39.800
<v 2>That is exactly right. The moment of the war of the worlds broadcast,</v>

918
00:57:39.801 --> 00:57:42.920
which still frankly terrifies me. It's this moment, right? Yeah.

919
00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:44.703
<v 0>Slice them head on.</v>

920
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:52.690
[inaudible] the words that running every way,

921
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:55.180
cutting this boy dog by 20 yards by, right.

922
00:57:56.620 --> 00:58:00.940
<v 2>It's like that silence is terrifying. No anchor. No reporter,</v>

923
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:04.690
no one too. We assure you. Okay,

924
00:58:04.691 --> 00:58:06.490
but forgetting that for a moment.

925
00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:08.830
What about his second lesson that he had to teach us the thing about don't

926
00:58:08.831 --> 00:58:11.350
believe the radio. What about that? Did it work?

927
00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:15.520
<v 5>Well, professor at Lavilla says, if that is really what wells was trying to do,</v>

928
00:58:15.521 --> 00:58:17.650
if you believe that, well then he failed. Actually,

929
00:58:17.651 --> 00:58:22.120
he worse than failed the war of the worlds. Not once, not twice.

930
00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:24.010
We've shown you three broadcast tonight.

931
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:28.240
It was so good at grabbing an audience and sucking them in that the will's

932
00:58:28.241 --> 00:58:28.721
formula,

933
00:58:28.721 --> 00:58:32.080
you might call it the newscast that scares you enough to keep you listening,

934
00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.260
has been adopted by of all folks. News

935
00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:39.110
<v 1>right now at 11 at night at shopping during the two at night of fear,</v>

936
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:44.360
swarming over boardrooms, flooding, cities and towns, Muslim immigrants, jeans,

937
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:45.440
texting and driving.

938
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:50.470
It's a deadly mint terror in the toilet and sink holes and landslides.

939
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:52.160
Python in the cod,

940
00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:55.760
a rabid baby go terrorists working at one of our airports.

941
00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.130
<v 5>So many newscast tease you with things that aren't quite true.</v>

942
00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:03.150
Terror in the toilet. Pythons in the potty. It may be,

943
00:59:03.151 --> 00:59:07.680
there will be true snakes somewhere near a toilet tree facility of some kind,

944
00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:11.970
but it probably wasn't the python and it probably wasn't your toilet,

945
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.430
but you don't know that. You want to hear that.

946
00:59:14.431 --> 00:59:18.960
It belongs to Mrs. James C McGillicuddy of 2114 boday boulevard and not you.

947
00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.640
So you,

948
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:24.650
you want to be reassured and so you listen and so you fall in.

949
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:29.900
And if Orson Welles retelling a Martian invasion story by HD wells that most

950
00:59:29.901 --> 00:59:30.800
people already knew,

951
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:36.250
if he could grab us and then if they could do it again in Ecuador and then if

952
00:59:37.461 --> 00:59:40.790
they can do it again in Buffalo, what does that tell you?

953
00:59:40.791 --> 00:59:45.770
It tells you that we can't help ourselves even if the headline is slightly

954
00:59:45.771 --> 00:59:50.480
preposterous, even if it's slightly scary, even if it's slightly

955
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.200
<v 10>false, we will listen</v>

956
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:55.980
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

957
00:59:55.980 --> 01:00:00.980
<v 10>the fear of that these broadcasts generate now suck us in.</v>

958
01:00:01.201 --> 01:00:05.430
And you'd think that 70 years later we'd be more sophisticated and critical when

959
01:00:05.431 --> 01:00:08.610
the local news cast or tells us that there's something we're feeding our

960
01:00:08.611 --> 01:00:12.960
children that could kill them and they'll tell us after the news the way I still

961
01:00:12.961 --> 01:00:13.500
listen.

962
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:17.400
I'm a media critic and I still wait through the commercials to see what is it

963
01:00:17.401 --> 01:00:20.040
that I'm doing to kill my child. Even if it's really implausible,

964
01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:22.660
your shoelaces will kill you after this beat method.

965
01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.780
I somehow it gets me every time.

966
01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.380
Yeah, and wells knew.

967
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.453
