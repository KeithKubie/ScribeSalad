TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.431
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:04.431 --> 00:00:07.550
about the coolest developer
news from Google in the last two

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.110
weeks.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.770
Android 7.0 Nougat has
begun rolling out to users.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.320
For more on what's included,
how we're rolling it out,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.480
and what's next, check out the
post linked in the description

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.810
below.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.350
There's a new Street View
renderer in the Google Maps

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.990
JavaScript API that brings
rendering improvements

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.700
and better mobile support.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.467
Street View helps make apps
more unique and exciting

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.550
by giving users a sense
of what it's like to visit

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.680
a place in real life.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.610
Check out the post for
all the improvements,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.760
including before and
after screen caps.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.850
The open source version
of Google Santa Tracker

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.620
has been updated with the
Android and web experiences

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.250
that ran last December.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.119
We extended, enhanced,
and upgraded our code,

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:51.660
and you can see how we used our
developer products, including

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.450
Firebase and Polymer, by
following the link below.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.650
Check out this post for
highlights from the latest

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.400
release of TF-Slim.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.530
The TF-Slim library
provides common abstractions

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.900
which enable you to define
models quickly and concisely

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.150
while keeping the model
architecture transparent

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.700
and its hyper
parameters explicit.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.710
And it keeps getting better.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.870
Also from TensorFlow, we're open
sourcing TensorFlow model code

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.190
for generating news headlines
on Annotated English

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.290
Gigaword, which is a
data set often used

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.430
in summarization research.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.050
Check out the post for
details and the GitHub link.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.580
Stackdriver is great for
troubleshooting issues

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.500
in production
cloud applications,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.090
and now it has logs
panel integration.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.810
Not only can you gather
production application state

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.030
and link to its
source, you can also

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.900
view the raw logs associated
with your Google App Engine

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.140
projects, all on one page.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.940
More details and a
screenshot are on the post.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.000
I've got two Google
Cloud Platform updates

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.030
for Java developers.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.280
First, the beta
release of two new

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.800
build tool plugins,
one for Apache Maven,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.560
and another for Gradle.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.170
These plugins allow you to
test your applications locally

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.850
and then deploy them to the
cloud from the command line

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.750
interface or through
integration with an IDE,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.020
such as Eclipse and IntelliJ.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.480
And on that note, you can
now use the new Google Cloud

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.180
Tools for IntelliJ plugin to
deploy your application in App

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.230
Engine standard and
App Engine flexible,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.210
and use Google Stackdriver
Debugger and Google Cloud

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.979
Source Repositories
without leaving that IDE.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.520
Here's another bundle of posts
for the Google Cloud platform.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.510
These are about working with
Windows Workloads, everything

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.880
from setting up a
Windows server and SQL

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.100
server on Google Compute Engine
to cloud tools for Visual

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.810
Studio and PowerShell.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.880
Check out all three
posts linked below.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.920
Don't forget to
subscribe and share.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.420
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next week.
