00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:01.700
- [Instructor] In the United States today,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.083
we know our system of government so well

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:07.175
that it hardly bears thinking about.

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:09.482
We know that there's a president

00:00:09.482 --> 00:00:12.274
who's the head of the Executive Branch,

00:00:12.274 --> 00:00:14.050
there's Congress, which is made up

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.424
of the House of
Representatives and the Senate,

00:00:16.424 --> 00:00:20.092
and there's the judicial branch,
which has the Supreme Court

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:23.016
as its head of a whole court system

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:25.242
that stretches throughout
the United States.

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:29.299
But how did the United States
end up with this system?

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:33.483
We frequently forget that
the Constitutional Convention

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:37.650
which created this system we
know today happened in 1787.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.022
That was more than a decade

00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:44.930
after the Declaration of Independence.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.524
So there was this 11-year plus period

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:52.233
before the United States had
its modern day constitution

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:56.957
and during that time, fought
the Revolutionary War,

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:57.957
won in 1783,

00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:02.725
and tried out a completely
different system of government

00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:04.875
called the Articles of Confederation,

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:08.557
which we talked a little bit
more about in another video.

00:01:08.557 --> 00:01:10.041
Now the Articles of Confederation

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:13.874
had a very strong sense
of limited government.

00:01:16.657 --> 00:01:19.307
In fact, you could think of
the Articles of Confederation

00:01:19.307 --> 00:01:20.953
as being a little bit more

00:01:20.953 --> 00:01:24.036
like a loose confederation of states,

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:31.209
where each state had one vote
in the legislative branch,

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.417
the branch that makes laws,

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:38.084
and they had to really
agree on most things,

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:42.565
nine out of 13 for most legislation

00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:44.613
and unanimous agreement

00:01:44.613 --> 00:01:47.083
for any kind of amendments to this system.

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:49.616
And I think it's clear why the founders

00:01:49.616 --> 00:01:52.592
first went with this system
of limited government

00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:56.908
because they had just
revolted against a monarchy.

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.017
They thought of the states as being

00:01:59.017 --> 00:02:02.508
in what they call just kind
of a league of friendship,

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:04.025
can almost see it as being similar

00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:06.359
to the European Union today,

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.276
independent nations who
do some things together

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.517
for foreign policy reasons
and economic reasons.

00:02:14.517 --> 00:02:17.691
Now by the late 1780s,
it was becoming clear

00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:21.200
that the Articles of
Confederation were not working.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.323
With such a weak central government,

00:02:23.323 --> 00:02:25.113
it was really hard to get things done.

00:02:25.113 --> 00:02:26.492
They couldn't raise taxes.

00:02:26.492 --> 00:02:28.975
They couldn't raise a military.

00:02:28.975 --> 00:02:30.966
Some states were even putting taxes

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:33.137
on the goods of other states.

00:02:33.137 --> 00:02:37.054
So in 1787, delegates
from 12 of the 13 states,

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.831
Rhode Island did not
participate because Rhode Island

00:02:40.831 --> 00:02:43.051
was not a big fan of central government,

00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:44.799
came together in Philadelphia,

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.516
in the same place where they had signed

00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:48.425
the Declaration of Independence,

00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:52.383
to think about how to revise
the Articles of Confederation.

00:02:52.383 --> 00:02:54.724
And some very notable figures were there.

00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:57.141
George Washington is one of them.

00:02:57.141 --> 00:02:59.733
See Ben Franklin over here,

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:01.233
and James Madison.

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:05.384
Although some people that
you might have expected

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:08.982
to be at the Constitutional
Convention were not,

00:03:08.982 --> 00:03:10.982
namely, Thomas Jefferson

00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:13.974
and John Adams

00:03:15.417 --> 00:03:19.584
who were out of the country
being diplomats at the time.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.775
So the delegates at the
Constitutional Convention

00:03:22.775 --> 00:03:26.041
have a pretty difficult problem to solve.

00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:30.433
They want to have a
stronger central government,

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:32.316
one that can get things done,

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:35.177
make sure the states play well together,

00:03:35.177 --> 00:03:37.600
raise armies, raise taxes,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.249
but they don't want a central
government that is too strong

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:44.350
because they just escaped from monarchy.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.392
They don't wanna recreate
monarchy in the United States.

00:03:48.392 --> 00:03:51.878
So they're looking for
a very delicate balance

00:03:51.878 --> 00:03:54.932
of a government strong
enough to get things done

00:03:54.932 --> 00:03:58.265
but not so strong as to promote tyranny.

00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:03.075
Now even though the delegates
were supposed to be revising

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:04.932
the Articles of Confederation,

00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:06.825
some people had, in secret,

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:10.774
been considering completely throwing out

00:04:10.774 --> 00:04:13.492
the Articles of Confederation
and starting anew.

00:04:13.492 --> 00:04:15.817
But one of the biggest
hurdles they had to solve

00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:19.926
was what would a new sort
of legislature look like.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.002
So the Virginia delegates

00:04:22.002 --> 00:04:25.675
suggested a plan for the legislature,

00:04:25.675 --> 00:04:27.758
it's the law-making body,

00:04:29.816 --> 00:04:31.816
that would be bicameral,

00:04:33.192 --> 00:04:35.442
means two room or two house

00:04:36.425 --> 00:04:38.792
from bi, meaning two,

00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:41.042
and camera, Latin for room.

00:04:43.224 --> 00:04:47.064
And their idea was that
there would be a lower house,

00:04:47.064 --> 00:04:51.231
similar to the House of
Commons in English Parliament,

00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:56.567
that would be directly elected

00:04:56.567 --> 00:05:00.300
as individuals would vote
for the representatives

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.396
but the number of representatives
that each state would get

00:05:04.396 --> 00:05:07.479
would be decided by their population.

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:12.933
Now Virginia was the largest
state by population by far

00:05:14.325 --> 00:05:15.924
and so, this plan would have worked out

00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:18.115
pretty well for them because
they would have gotten

00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:21.269
the largest proportion of representatives.

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:25.542
Small states like Delaware,
and Georgia, Rhode Island,

00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:29.658
would have very few representatives
indeed, comparatively.

00:05:29.658 --> 00:05:32.991
They also wanted to have an upper house,

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.866
similar to the House of Lords
in the British Parliament,

00:05:37.866 --> 00:05:39.866
which would be appointed

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:44.599
by state legislatures.

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:46.342
But just like the lower house,

00:05:46.342 --> 00:05:48.192
the number representatives

00:05:48.192 --> 00:05:51.777
would also be determined by population.

00:05:51.777 --> 00:05:53.625
Now as you can imagine, the small sates

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:57.758
were not big fans of having representation

00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:00.082
based just on population,

00:06:00.082 --> 00:06:02.616
so they came back with a different plan.

00:06:02.616 --> 00:06:04.850
This was called the New Jersey Plan.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.624
So the little states said,
"All right, the Virginia Plan

00:06:08.624 --> 00:06:11.777
"gives way too much
power to the big states.

00:06:11.777 --> 00:06:15.583
"We want an equal voice in legislation."

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:16.850
So the New Jersey Plan,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.000
much like the Articles of Confederation,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.083
gave one vote

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.580
to each of the states

00:06:27.043 --> 00:06:29.043
so that the small states

00:06:30.574 --> 00:06:34.925
would have the same
representation in Congress

00:06:34.925 --> 00:06:36.490
as the large states

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.090
and their plan was for a single chamber

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.257
or unicameral legislature.

00:06:43.892 --> 00:06:45.400
So this really wasn't much different

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.208
from the Articles of Confederation at all.

00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:50.132
So how did the delegates
resolve this issue

00:06:50.132 --> 00:06:54.082
of how to balance the
voices of large states

00:06:54.082 --> 00:06:56.091
with large populations

00:06:56.091 --> 00:06:59.363
with small states that
had small populations?

00:06:59.363 --> 00:07:03.407
Because in a situation where all states

00:07:03.407 --> 00:07:05.432
have an equal number of votes,

00:07:05.432 --> 00:07:07.300
like in the New Jersey Plan,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.349
the 60,000 residents of Delaware

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:11.924
could have as much say

00:07:11.924 --> 00:07:16.245
as the almost 700,000
residents of Virginia.

00:07:16.245 --> 00:07:18.288
Meaning that the people
who live in Delaware

00:07:18.288 --> 00:07:20.649
were in fact more powerful.

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:23.682
But at the same time, you wouldn't want it

00:07:23.682 --> 00:07:26.336
so that people living in the larger states

00:07:26.336 --> 00:07:28.832
could get their way all the time.

00:07:28.832 --> 00:07:30.408
What if the people in Delaware

00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:32.666
had a very legitimate concern

00:07:32.666 --> 00:07:34.657
that those in Virginia didn't share?

00:07:34.657 --> 00:07:36.100
It would be impossible

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.400
to get all of these
states to agree, to amend,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.100
or replace the Articles of Confederation

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.897
if some of them felt like their interests

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:47.075
aren't being taken into account at all.

00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:50.325
So to solve this issue of how to weight

00:07:51.558 --> 00:07:53.683
the representation of the states,

00:07:53.683 --> 00:07:54.715
the delegates came up

00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:56.833
with what's called the Great Compromise

00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:00.166
or sometimes the Connecticut Compromise.

00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:04.933
And in a way, what they did
was combine these two plans.

00:08:04.933 --> 00:08:08.021
They made a legislative branch

00:08:08.021 --> 00:08:10.521
that was bicameral, two house,

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:15.475
with a lower and an upper house

00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:21.766
and this lower house become
the House of Representatives,

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:28.375
where each state would
have representatives

00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:32.558
in proportion to their population.

00:08:33.616 --> 00:08:36.916
So states that have large populations

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.582
have more representatives.

00:08:38.582 --> 00:08:42.749
States with small populations
have fewer representatives.

00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:46.184
And those representatives

00:08:46.184 --> 00:08:49.908
would be directly elected by the people.

00:08:49.908 --> 00:08:51.233
Now, and this time,

00:08:51.233 --> 00:08:54.566
the people was a fairly small proportion

00:08:55.724 --> 00:08:57.141
to vote in 1790s.

00:08:58.816 --> 00:09:00.899
You had to be a white man

00:09:02.007 --> 00:09:04.491
with fairly significant property,

00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:07.183
so it wasn't full suffrage.

00:09:07.183 --> 00:09:10.408
It wasn't event full
suffrage for white men,

00:09:10.408 --> 00:09:13.491
but these folks were elected by vote.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.183
And then this upper house
would be the Senate.

00:09:20.084 --> 00:09:24.251
And in the Senate, each state
would have two senators,

00:09:26.524 --> 00:09:28.607
regardless of their size,

00:09:30.007 --> 00:09:33.840
so that as legislation
moved through Congress,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.124
first from the lower house,
where it would be approved

00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:42.599
and if approved, sent to the upper house,

00:09:42.599 --> 00:09:45.700
there, all states would
have an equal voice

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.232
in whether legislation was passed.

00:09:48.232 --> 00:09:49.682
And in this upper house,

00:09:49.682 --> 00:09:52.467
the senators would not be directly elected

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.134
but rather appointed

00:09:56.708 --> 00:09:58.450
by state legislatures.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.425
And in fact, senators were
appointed into the 20th century.

00:10:02.425 --> 00:10:05.507
Now the Great Compromise
wasn't the only compromise made

00:10:05.507 --> 00:10:07.532
at the Constitutional Convention.

00:10:07.532 --> 00:10:09.092
They made a number more

00:10:09.092 --> 00:10:10.915
and we'll talk more about those

00:10:10.915 --> 00:10:14.249
and about the other two
branches of the government

00:10:14.249 --> 00:10:15.324
in the next video.
