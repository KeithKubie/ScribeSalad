00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
 while we were talking about the adaptive immune system, we already 

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.250
 we saw there are several actors. 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.070
 First we have the humorous reaction. 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.370
 This is a reaction to things that fly 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.590
 around body fluids, but not only 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.820
 things that have penetrated the body. Then we have 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.245
 cellular immune response. 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.200
 And then the humorous answer - and we are talking 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.680
 for a specific immune response - that is, where the B cells, 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.220
 B-lymphocytes are the most active. 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.540
 And basically what they do is, we have a cell here 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.900
 It has a specific antibody specific for only 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.640
 this B cell, not all B cells. 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.010
 This is one of the billions of B cells, 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.550
 which incidentally has the right key - or 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.920
 perhaps the proper lock for the key it represents 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.270
 the attacking pathogen - the pathogen which, 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.560
 will connect to this B cell. 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.420
 It may be a virus, it may be a bacterium. 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.890
 And then the cell will activate and we'll talk 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.450
 in this video that activation 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.630
 does not always happen. 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.730
 In fact, it's usually not only the result, 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.860
 but so far we have said that it is activated, this is remembered 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.320
 of B cells that are actually multiple versions of 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.450
 this original cage - say, let's have a lot 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.640
 versions of this - because it usually recognizes this virus. 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.160
 So if we meet this virus again in the future, these multitudes 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.450
 versions, these multiple memory cells will be available, 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.240
 to participate in this interaction. 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.530
 This interaction is more likely to happen in 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.210
 future because we will have more than that 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.640
 type B cell. 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.980
 And then we have effector cells. 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.730
 And these are actually ... Both are B cells. 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.230
 This cell, once activated, propagates, 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.430
 continues to divide and clone itself. 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.910
 Memory cells just sit around waiting to be activated 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.890
 in the future. 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.570
 I only paint one of these membrane-associated antibodies, 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.530
 but we actually have about 10,000 of them. 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.000
 I mean, I could draw many of them. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.300
 I do not have to paint only one. 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.120
 Memory cells just walk around in the future, 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.850
 but now we have more of them. 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.610
 So in the future, if we come across this virus again, 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.350
 this interaction will happen faster and so 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.800
 they will be activated faster. 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.300
 And then effector B cells 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.990
 are turned into antibody factories. 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.100
 This antibody goes in and says, let me just produce ... 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.870
 I'm activated. 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.200
 Let me produce many, many more versions 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.460
 from exactly that antibody. 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.710
 So she ejects them. 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.670
 I drew it a little wrong. 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.040
 This antibody, this can then be sent 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.170
 exclude or mark antigens - and not any antigens - 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.290
 exactly that antigen here. 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.550
 We also saw that the other thing that the cage is doing is, 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.190
 that it becomes an antigen displaying a cell.
