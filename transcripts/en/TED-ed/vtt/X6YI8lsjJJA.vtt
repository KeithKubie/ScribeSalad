00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:10.361
Following a devastating nuclear war,

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:14.661
Lilith Iyapo awakens
after 250 years of stasis

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:18.857
to find herself surrounded by a group 
of aliens called the Oankali.

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:21.737
These highly evolved beings
want to trade DNA

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:23.157
by breeding with humans

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:27.517
so that each species’ genes 
can diversify and fortify the other.

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:32.257
The only alternative they offer is 
sterilization of the entire human race.

00:00:32.257 --> 00:00:35.477
Should humanity take the leap into 
the biological unknown,

00:00:35.477 --> 00:00:38.327
or hold on to its identity and perish?

00:00:38.327 --> 00:00:41.317
Questions like this haunt 
Octavia Butler’s "Dawn,"

00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:44.217
the first in her trilogy "Lilith’s Brood."

00:00:44.217 --> 00:00:47.237
A visionary storyteller who 
upended science fiction,

00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:50.097
Butler built stunning worlds 
throughout her work–

00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:53.187
and explored dilemmas that keep 
us awake at night.

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:54.996
Born in 1947,

00:00:54.996 --> 00:00:59.046
Butler grew up shy and introverted in 
Pasadena, California.

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:01.386
She dreamt up stories from an early age,

00:01:01.386 --> 00:01:04.306
and was soon scribbling these 
scenarios on paper.

00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:07.236
At twelve, she begged her mother 
for a typewriter

00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:12.256
after enduring a campy science fiction
film called "Devil Girl From Mars."

00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:14.097
Unimpressed with what she saw,

00:01:14.097 --> 00:01:16.707
Butler knew she could tell a better story.

00:01:16.707 --> 00:01:19.437
Much science fiction features 
white male heroes

00:01:19.437 --> 00:01:22.897
who blast aliens or become 
saviors of brown people.

00:01:22.897 --> 00:01:26.607
Butler wanted to write diverse characters
for diverse audiences.

00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:31.187
She brought nuance and depth to the 
representation of their experiences.

00:01:31.187 --> 00:01:32.244
For Butler,

00:01:32.244 --> 00:01:35.924
imagination was not only for planting 
the seeds of science fiction–

00:01:35.924 --> 00:01:40.794
but also a strategy for surviving an 
unjust world on one’s own terms.

00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:43.372
Her work often takes troubling 
features of the world

00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:48.182
such as discrimination on the basis of 
race, gender, class, or ability,

00:01:48.182 --> 00:01:52.125
and invites the reader to contemplate 
them in new contexts.

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:53.775
One of her most beloved novels,

00:01:53.775 --> 00:01:55.265
the "Parable of the Sower,"

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:56.805
follows this pattern.

00:01:56.805 --> 00:01:59.565
It tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina

00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:03.775
as she makes her way through a near-future
California, ruined by corporate greed,

00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:06.865
inequality, and environmental destruction.

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:08.795
As she struggles with hyperempathy,

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.945
or a condition in the novel that 
causes her to feel others’ pain,

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:13.855
and less often, their pleasure.

00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:18.325
Lauren embarks on a quest with a group 
of refugees to find a place to thrive.

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:23.250
There, they seek to live in accordance 
with Lauren’s found religion, Earthseed,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.830
which is based on the principle

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.240
that humans must adapt to an 
ever-changing world.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.710
Lauren’s quest had roots 
in a real life event–

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.950
California Prop 187,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.950
which attempted to deny undocumented
immigrants fundamental human rights,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.380
before it was deemed unconstitutional.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.990
Butler frequently incorporated 
contemporary news into her writing.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.360
In her 1998 sequel to "The Parable of the 
Sower," "Parable of the Talents,"

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.281
she wrote of a presidential candidate

00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:53.591
who controls Americans with virtual 
reality and “shock collars.”

00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:56.481
His slogan? “Make America great again.”

00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:58.341
While people have noted her prescience,

00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:01.661
Butler was also interested in 
re-examining history.

00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:03.771
For instance,
"Kindred" tells the story of

00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:06.171
a woman who is repeatedly
pulled back in time

00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:09.241
to the Maryland plantation 
of her ancestors.

00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:13.771
Early on, she learns that her mission 
is to save the life of the white man

00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:15.532
who will rape her great grandmother.

00:03:15.532 --> 00:03:19.662
If she doesn’t save him, 
she herself will cease to exist.

00:03:19.664 --> 00:03:23.074
This grim dilemma forces Dana to 
confront the ongoing trauma

00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:26.684
of slavery and sexual violence 
against Black women.

00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:29.334
With her stories of women 
founding new societies,

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.864
time travelers overcoming 
historical strife,

00:03:31.864 --> 00:03:33.774
and interspecies bonding,

00:03:33.774 --> 00:03:38.694
Butler had a profound influence on 
the growing popularity of Afrofuturism.

00:03:38.694 --> 00:03:40.000
That’s a cultural movement

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.820
where Black writers and artists who are 
inspired by the past, present and future,

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.200
produce works that incorporate magic, 
history, technology and much more.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.100
As Lauren comes to learn in 
"Parable of the Sower,"

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.360
"All that you touch you Change.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.729
All that you Change Changes you.

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:01.169
The only lasting truth is Change.”
