00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.192
Sarah Chen:
Hi, I'm Sarah.

00:00:01.192 --> 00:00:02.000
Chenyu Zheng:
I'm Chenyu.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Kelly Rouser:
I'm Kelly.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.620 position:95%
Chenyu Zheng:
And we are the organizers of the sustainable fashion contest.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.904 position:69%
Sarah Chen:
We gave very loose guidelines to any student

00:00:11.904 --> 00:00:13.400
Sarah Chen:
designers who wanted to enter.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.746 position:91%
Sarah Chen:
Really we just asked them to create pieces out of anything

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:20.290 position:88%
Sarah Chen:
that could be re-used, that could be deemed sustainable.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.920 position:91%
Chenyu Zheng:
We were also fortunate to collaborate with the Art Museum,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.530 position:70%
Chenyu Zheng:
which provided a special venue for the event.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.010 position:80%
Chenyu Zheng:
The format of the contest was each contestant would

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.750 position:78%
Chenyu Zheng:
come up to the stage and present his or her piece,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.400 position:69%
Chenyu Zheng:
and then all four judges will ask questions.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.100 position:80%
Kelly Rouser:
So, one of the judges was Professor Patricia Brown.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.180 position:78%
Kelly Rouser:
Another judge was senior James Mister, and he's in

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.880
Kelly Rouser:
the Politics department.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.490 position:88%
Kelly Rouser:
And then a third judge was Nina. All I know was that she

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.930 position:95%
Kelly Rouser:
was a fashion designer, so we just happened to meet her while

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.730
Kelly Rouser:
preparing for the competition.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.190 position:83%
Kelly Rouser:
And the fourth judge was Starre Varten, and she's the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.650 position:92%
Kelly Rouser:
eco-blogger that we invited earlier to speak during dinner.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.030
Student:
So, the biggest problem with type 6

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.560 position:80%
Student:
plastic is it has a very narrow window of when it's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.530 position:88%
Student:
melting and then when it goes past the point that it can

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.140 position:67%
Student:
be heated and becomes brittle and unusable.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.470 position:94%
Student:
So, what I was interested in, because I do a lot of material

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.175 position:95%
Student:
science, would be... was trying to find the point at which it

00:01:33.175 --> 00:01:36.710 position:69%
Student:
would slump and soften while still retaining

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.150
Student:
its malleability.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.030 position:67%
Student:
So, I wanted things that were beautiful and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.560 position:86%
Student:
thought-provoking but were also, at a very basic level,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.570
Student:
practical and functional.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.190 position:72%
Chenyu Zheng:
And one art major, she used the used, leftover

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.990
Chenyu Zheng:
canvas from her art studio.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.730 position:69%
Chenyu Zheng:
So, it's all leftover material that happened

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.480
Chenyu Zheng:
to be thrown away into the trash.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.310 position:64%
Chenyu Zheng:
And one student, she used her own thesis.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.420 position:78%
Laura Bai:
I like to think of this as like a quintessentially

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.390 position:95%
Laura Bai:
Princeton piece, because, well first you have the thesis, but

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.160 position:86%
Laura Bai:
also a lot of people tend to drink a lot of caffeinated

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.270
Laura Bai:
beverages at Princeton.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.460
(music)

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.082 position:81%
Student:
So it was very much we were constantly bantering and

00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:26.050 position:77%
Student:
checking things out with each other, trying shoes

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.100
Student:
on for each other.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.950 position:86%
Student:
Very collaborative, the whole process, but tons of fun.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.140 position:97%
Student:
That's really the key. It was a project that we saw going into

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.020 position:98%
Student:
it, going, "Wow, this could be a lot of fun for us to do, a way

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.810 position:97%
Student:
to spend time and hang out, and that's what it should be about."

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.830 position:81%
Student:
I think it's going to be kind of a major catalyst in

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.530 position:98%
Student:
my life, both as a designer and as a chemist, because it really

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.330 position:84%
Student:
reinforced what I've always suspected, which is that I

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.790 position:91%
Student:
fundamentally love the design and materials, especially as

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.170 position:92%
Student:
tied to their functionality, and I've always thought that I

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.300 position:94%
Student:
was really most interested in architectural materials, and I

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.740 position:98%
Student:
could -- after this experience -- I could really see myself going

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.180 position:78%
Student:
into the design of fashion materials and maybe the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.250
Student:
design of the fashion itself.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:22.338
