00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.100
I've got a transformation, m
that's a mapping from Rn to

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.420
Rn, and it can be represented
by the matrix A.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.310
So the transformation of x
is equal to A times x.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.500
We saw in the last video it's
interesting to find the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.480
vectors that only get scaled
up or down by the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.300
transformation.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.910
So we're interested in the
vectors where I take the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.220
transformation of some
special vector v.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.580
It equals of course,
A times v.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.250
And we say it only gets scaled
up by some factor,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.160
lambda times v.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.940
And these are interesting
because they make for

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.180
interesting basis vectors.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.580
You know, the transformation
matrix in the alternate

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.680
basis-- this is one of
the basis vectors.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.220
It might be easier to compute.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.340
Might make for good coordinate
systems. But they're in

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.700
general, interesting.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.660
And we call vectors v that
satisfy this, we call them

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.910
eigenvectors.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.560
And we call their scaling
factors the eigenvalues

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.610
associated with this
transformation and that

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.350
eigenvector.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.230
You know, hopefully from that
last video, we have a little

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.890
bit of appreciation of
why they're useful.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.460
But now in this video let's at
least try to determine what

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.200
some of them are.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.260
You know, based on what we know
so far, if you show me an

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.930
eigenvector I can verify that it
definitely is the case, or

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.620
an eigenvalue.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.970
I could verify the case.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.620
But I don't know a systematic
way of solving

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.400
for either of them.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.750
So let's see if we can come
up with something.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.840
So in general, we're looking for
solutions to the equation

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.350
A times v is equal
to lambda v.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.750
It's equal to lambda
times the vector.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.750
Now one solution might
immediately pop out at you,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.800
and that's just v is equal
to the 0 vector.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.210
And that definitely is a
solution, although it's not

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.100
normally considered to be an
eigenvector just because one,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.610
it's not a useful
basis vector.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.230
It doesn't add anything
to a basis.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.800
It doesn't add really the amount
of vectors that you can

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.140
span when you throw the
basis vector in there.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.420
And also, it's not clear what
is your eigenvalue that's

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.120
associated with it.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.710
Because if v is equal
to 0, any eigenvalue

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.500
will work for that.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.320
So normally when we're looking
for eigenvectors, we start

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.955
with the assumption that we're
looking for non-zero vectors.

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:17.880
So we're looking for vectors
that are not

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.545
equal to the 0 vector.

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:21.840
So given that, let's see if we
can play around with this

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.660
equation a little bit and see
if we can at least come up

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.260
with eigenvalues maybe
in this video.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.730
So we subtract Av from both
sides, we get the 0 vector is

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.480
equal to lambda v
minus A times v.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.460
Now, we can rewrite v as-- v is
just the same thing as the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.690
identity matrix times v, right?
v is a member of Rn.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.200
The identity matrix n by n.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.580
You just multiply and we're
just going to get v again.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.640
So if I rewrite v this way, at
least on this part of the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.230
expression-- and let me swap
sides-- so then I'll get

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.390
lambda times-- instead of v
I'll write the identity

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.890
matrix, the n by n identity
matrix times v minus A times v

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.390
is equal to the 0 vector.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.020
Now I have one matrix times v
minus another matrix times v.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.140
Matrix vector products,
they have the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.840
distributive property.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.300
So this is equivalent to the
matrix lambda times the

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.630
identity matrix minus A
times the vector v.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.810
And that's going to be
equal to 0, right?

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.930
This is just some matrix
right here.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.180
And the whole reason why I made
this substitution is so I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.770
can write this as a matrix
vector product instead of just

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.000
a scalar vector product.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.340
And that way I was able to
essentially factor out the v

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.700
and just write this whole
equation as essentially, some

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.350
matrix vector product
is equal to 0.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.760
Now, in order-- if we assume
that this is the case, and

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.030
we're assuming-- remember,
we're assuming that v

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.920
does not equal 0.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.890
So what does this mean?

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.980
So we know that v is a member
of the null space of this

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.990
matrix right here.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.339
Let me write this down. v is a
member of the null space of

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.380
lambda I sub n minus A.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.040
I know that might look a little
convoluted to you right

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.890
now, but just imagine this
is just some matrix B.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.840
It might make it simpler.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.580
This is just some matrix
here, right?

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.470
That's B.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.750
Let's make that substitution.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.460
Then this equation just becomes
Bv is equal to 0.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.190
Now, if we want to look at the
null space of this, the null

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.940
space of B is all of the vectors
x that are a member of

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.450
Rn such that B times
x is equal to 0.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.090
Well, v is clearly one
of those guys, right?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.560
Because B times v
is equal to 0.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.560
We're assuming B solves this
equation and that gets all the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.940
way to the assumption that B
must solve this equation.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.060
And v is not equal to 0.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.320
So v is a member of the null
space and this is a nontrivial

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.180
member of the null space.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.030
We already said the 0 vector is
always going to be a member

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.200
of the null space, and it
would make this true.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.630
But we're assuming
v is non-zero.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.170
We're only interested in
non-zero eigenvectors.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.000
And that means that this guy's
null space has to be

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.070
nontrivial.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:36.100
So this means that the null
space of lambda In minus A is

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.350
nontrivial.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.360
The 0 vector is not
the only member.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.650
And you might remember before,
that the only time-- let me

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.650
write this in general.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.170
If I have some matrix--
I don't know.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.270
I've used A and B.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.235
Let's say I have
some matrix D.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:08.310
D's columns are linearly
independent if and only if the

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:18.390
null space of D only contains
the 0 vector.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.030
Right?

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.350
So if we have some matrix here
whose null space does not only

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.130
contain the 0 vector,
then it has

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.670
linearly dependent columns.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.830
And I just wrote that there to
kind of show you what we do

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.110
know and the fact that this
one doesn't have a trivial

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.220
null space tells us that we're
dealing with linearly

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.670
dependent columns.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.750
So lambda In minus A-- it looks
all fancy, but this is

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:52.590
just a matrix-- must have
linearly dependent columns.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.120
Or another way to say that is,
if you have linearly dependent

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.220
columns, you're not invertible,
which also means

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.990
that your determinate
must be equal to 0.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.740
All of these are true.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.000
If your determinate is equal to
0, you're not going to be

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.230
invertible.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.770
You're going to have linearly
dependent columns.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.000
If your determinate is equal
to 0, then that also means

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.850
that you have nontrivial members
in your null space.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.460
And so, if your determinate is
equal to 0 that means there's

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:27.030
some lambdas for which this is
true, for non-zero vectors v.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:32.530
So, if there are some solutions,
if there are some

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:39.160
non-zero vector v's that satisfy
this equation, then

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:46.220
this matrix right here must
have a determinate of 0.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.990
And it goes the other way.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.830
If this guy has a determinate of
0, then there must be-- or

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.890
if there's some the lambdas
that make this guy have a

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.320
determinate of 0, then those
lambdas are going to satisfy

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.072
this equation.

00:07:57.072 --> 00:07:57.970
And you could go
the other way.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.640
If there's some lambdas that
satisfy this, then those

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.060
lambdas are going to make this
matrix have a 0 determinate.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.280
Let me write this.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:29.620
Av is equal to lambda v for
non-zero v's if and only if

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:37.409
the determinate of lambda
In minus A is

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:41.080
equal to the 0 vector.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.860
No, not the 0 vector.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.159
Sorry, it's just equal to 0.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.280
The determinate is just
a scalar factor.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.590
And so that's our
big takeaway.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.830
And I know what you're saying
now, how is that

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.270
useful for me, Sal?

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.040
You know, we did all of
this manipulation.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.100
I talked a little bit about
the null spaces.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.000
And my big takeaway is, is that
in order for this to be

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.690
true for some non-zero vectors
v, then lambda

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.085
has to be some value.

00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:05.090
So if I take the determinate of
lambda times the identity

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.050
matrix minus A, it has
got to be equal to 0.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.670
And the reason why this is
useful is that you can

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.820
actually set this equation up
for your matrices, and then

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.650
solve for your lambdas.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.460
And we're going to do that
in the next video.
