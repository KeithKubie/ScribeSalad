00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now, with this play pig, with the dependancy injection,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
with the goal being 50, here's a test that I can actually run.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So "A" and "B" are going to be my two contestants.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
"A" is hold at 50, which is equivalent to saying never hold until you win.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
"B" is the clueless function, the one that acts at random,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and rolls is going to be an iterator of some list of numbers,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
maybe 1, 2, 3 or whatever you want, but I want you to write in there

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the list which is the shortest possible list, or one of the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
shortest possible lists that allows "A" to win and then you can

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
check Play a Game of Pig between "A" and "B"

00:00:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
with these rolls and make sure that "A" wins.
