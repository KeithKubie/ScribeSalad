00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.360
Truly good people are
always ready and even,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.960
at times, highly enthusiastic
about telling lies.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.296
This sounds odd only because
we are in the grip of a heroic

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.080
but indiscriminate and delusional
addiction to truth-telling.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.440
A lot of it can be blamed
on George Washington,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.320
first president of
the United States.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.479
Legend recounts how, at the age of six,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.280
he was given a little axe as a present.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.416
He was so excited with the gift

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.720
that he went straight into the garden and
hacked down a beautiful cherry tree.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.096
His father was furious when
he discovered the chopped tree,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.720
and asked George if he was responsible.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.160
The boy was said to have replied:
‘Father, I cannot tell a lie. It was I.’

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.096
The story is probably apocryphal,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.816
but it has stuck because
it encapsulates an ideal

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.896
to which we are intensely
collectively committed:

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.600
a devotion to the truth in spite of
the cost it exacts on oneself.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.856
In this scenario, the liar is odious

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.496
because they seek to evade
a necessary and important truth

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.800
for the sake of low personal gain.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.040
But good people do not lie
for their own benefit.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.416
They aren’t protecting themselves,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.736
and they aren’t disloyal
to the facts out of mendacity:

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.856
they tell lies because
(paradoxical as it sounds at first)

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.936
they love the truth intensely

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.520
and out of good-will for
the person they are deceiving.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.480
We’re ready enough to admit to
a role for lies in certain situations.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.736
You might be visiting an elderly aunt
who prides herself on her talent for

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.440
carrot cakes with vanilla icing.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.560
But her heyday is long gone.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.656
Now she muddles up the recipe

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.496
and sometimes forgets how long
the butter has been in the fridge.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.000
The result is pretty off-putting.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.496
But it’s deeply important for her to feel

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.400
that she’s still able to please others.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.080
That’s why you lie.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.960
The lie isn’t produced to protect oneself.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.216
It is told out of loyalty
to a bigger truth,

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.016
that one loves the aunt,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.920
that would be threatened
by full disclosure.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.896
As is so often the case,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.800
a great truth has to pass into the mind
of another person via a smaller falsehood.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.776
What makes falsehoods so necessary

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.760
is our proclivity for
making unfortunate associations.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.279
It is, in theory,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.016
of course entirely possible
to love someone deeply

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.360
and at the same time believe
they are terrible at baking.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.336
But in our own minds,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.456
the rejection of our cakes
tends to feel synonymous

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.240
with the rejection of our being.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.256
We’re forcing any half decent person
to lie to us

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.600
by the obtuseness of our thought-processes.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.856
It is because the aunt
is in the grip of a falsehood

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.496
(‘if you don’t like my cake,
you can’t like me’)

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.296
that we will have to offer her
a dose of untruth

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.616
(‘I like your cake’)

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.720
by which we can make sure that
a big truth (‘I like you’) remains safe.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.656
The same principle applies
in more tricky situations.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.976
Suppose a woman goes away
to a conference.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.176
One night, after a lovely conversation
in the bar,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.856
she gets carried away and slips into bed
with an international colleague.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.936
They don’t make love but have a sweet time.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.160
They rub their lips together
and entwine their legs.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.256
They will almost certainly
never see one another again,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.880
it wasn’t an attempt to start a long-term
relationship and it meant very little.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.296
When the woman gets home,
her partner asks how her evening was.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.920
She says she watched CNN and ordered
a club sandwich in her room on her own.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.456
She lies because she knows her partner well

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.256
and can predict how
he would respond to the truth.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.816
He would be wounded to the core,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.936
would be convinced that
his wife didn’t love him

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.400
and would probably conclude
that divorce was the only option.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.120
But this assessment of the truth
would not be true.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.616
In reality, it is of course eminently
possible to love someone deeply

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.760
and every so often go to bed
with another person.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.296
And yet, kind people
understand the entrenched

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.280
and socially-endorsed associations
between infidelity and callousness.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.016
For almost all of us,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.496
the news ‘I spent a night with
a colleague from the Singapore office’

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.536
(which is true)

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.320
has to end up meaning ‘I don’t love
you anymore’ (which is not true at all).

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.616
And so we have to say
‘I didn’t sleep with anyone’

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.816
(which is untrue)

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.079
in the name of securing the greater idea:

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.480
‘I still love you’
(which is overwhelmingly true).

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.256
However much they love the truth,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.696
good people have an even greater
commitment to something else:

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.616
being kind towards others.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.896
They grasp (and make allowances for)

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.896
the ease with which a truth can produce

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.096
desperately unhelpful convictions
in the minds of others

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.160
and they are therefore not proudly
over-committed to accuracy at every turn.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.016
Their loyalty is reserved
for something they take to be

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.120
far more important than literal narration:

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.320
the sanity and well-being
of their audiences.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.736
Telling the truth, they understand,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.080
isn’t a matter of the sentence by
sentence veracity of one’s words,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.967
t’s a matter of ensuring that,

00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:46.711
after one has spoken,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.720
the other person will be left
with a true picture of reality.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.376
This concern for the well-being of others

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.096
explains why kind people only ever lie

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.920
when there is little chance of
their untruths being detected.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.816
They know that a lie which gets unearthed

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.400
will cause proper and
unjustifiable trouble,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.696
leading the other person to a second
and even more radically false conclusion:

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.456
not only that
‘you don’t love me’ (first untruth)

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.656
but also that ‘you lied to me
because you don’t love me’

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.960
(a second, even greater untruth).

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.680
It can feel condescending to hear
the logic of the good liar spelled out.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.720
But that’s only because we don’t like to
acknowledge the fragility of our own minds.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.400
We may believe we’re heroically ready
to embrace the truth, however painful.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.440
We may insist that others should
tell us everything, whatever they do.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.200
But we thereby discount our own powerful
tendencies to emotional indigestion.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.920
It’s why we should not only
occasionally tell untruths,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.600
but actively hope that, from time to time,
others will lie to us

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.760
and quietly hope that we will
never find out that they have.
