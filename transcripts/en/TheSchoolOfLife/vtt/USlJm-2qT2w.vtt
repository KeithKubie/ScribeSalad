00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
Evolution is one of the biggest ideas in the modern world.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.900
It was most memorably formulated by Charles Darwin in the 19th centruty.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.420
Part of the theory focuses on the tendency on genes to mutate.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.860
When a frog, or a microbe, or a giraffe has a gene mutation,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.780
it usually means that they'll be unsuited to their environment and will simply die.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.540
But very occasionally, just by chance, the mutation gives them an advantage and makes them more successful.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.340
The mutation is passed on to their descendants, who will have the same advantage as their parents,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.920
and their result in success will spread it ever further down the generations.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.840
But the key thing about gene mutation is that it takes time-- a lot of it.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.860
It took us around 3,900 million years to go from the first cells to homo sapiens.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.040
So the one thing we can be pretty sure about is that genetic mutation will not be a significant feature

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.320
of the human world now.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.260
However, there's a second, equally interesting bit to Darwin's theory of evolution,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.560
which focuses on what gets called "adaptation to the environment."

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.100
Darwin pointed out that when an environment changes,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.280
a characteristic can suddenly shift from being an advantage to a disadvantage, and vice versa.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.620
In 1811, a famous survey of moths around the bordering town of Manchester

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.020
recorded no melanic or black-winged moths.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.140
37 years later, in 1848, another survey discovered huge numbers of these creatures,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.620
and far fewer white-winged moths.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.540
Darwin's explanation was simple: Manchester's rise as a major industrial city

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.060
meant that huge quantities of soot had entered the atmosphere and darkened tree trunks.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.340
Thereafter, light-winged moths became highly conspicuous to their main predators, birds,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.280
while the dark-winged ones were effectively camouflaged.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.040
Darwin concluded that changes to the environment

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.420
can dramatically alter which members of a species will thrive within it.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.720
This happens in the human world, where it doesn't affect reproductive potential,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.500
but does change the social hierarchy.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.000
Consider, for instance, the classic example of our age.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.940
The rise of the nerd: being short sighted, timid, having poor muscular development,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.540
being obsessed with complex, abstract processes, and being short on charisma and social skills

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.500
used to be a recipe for an unsuccessful life.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.320
That's because, for most of history, making your way in the world was hugely dependent on physical strength,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.060
and strong practical links to a family group.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.100
The weakling, the loner, and the introvert were in very disadvantageous positions.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.040
Then, in the last quarter of the 20th century, the tech industry created an environment

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.620
in which nerd-characteristics turned out to be highly advantageous.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.400
Human beings are not themselves now, evolving or too slowly to matter.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.800
But our environment is changing very fast,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.040
and this has hugely privileged certain traits while penalizing others.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.340
A key dynamic of evolution, adaptation to the environment, is still very much around,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.740
even though gene mutation may not be a notable factor.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.140
Some of us are like the black moths of industrial Manchester,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.120
ideally suited to the new world,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.500
which rewards massive intellect, self-discipline, and rationality.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.780
Others, many, many of us, are like white moths in a newly sooty world.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.640
We find it hard not to eat too much, to distinguish real threats from baseless anxieties,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.600
to spend all day in an office in front of a computer, to look at porn in moderation, to be monogamous,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.760
and to defer gratification for years

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.240
while we collaborate on large projects inside the glass towers of corporations.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.460
We should feel compassion for ourselves when we don't quite fit our times.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.160
Our biology has saddled us with a range of cognitive habits which were sensible when they evolved--

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.000
habits around sugar, sex, power, anxiety,  and excitement--

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.180
with which really hamper our effectiveness in the modern world.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.220
An understanding of the theory of evolution should move us to sympathy

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.800
for why we do some of the deeply counterproductive things we do.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.240
When he first wrote about evolution, Charles Darwin was accused of demeaning human nature;

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.800
cartoonists loved to draw him as an ape.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.480
But Darwin was being deeply kind and helpful to us humans.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.460
He was reminding us that we carry with us a lot of baggage, which we don't now need,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.800
but which we can't get rid of very fast.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.220
Modern life has required things of us which are really very hard for us pull off.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.500
We're saddled with so many inconvenient but maddeningly deep-rooted tendencies,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.220
which is yet another reason why we constantly need to be a little more forgiving of other people

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.980
and of ourselves.
