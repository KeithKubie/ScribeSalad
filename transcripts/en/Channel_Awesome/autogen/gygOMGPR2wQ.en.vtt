00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.840
that a lot of thing I that I know a lot
of people with depression and I would

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:06.850
of people with depression and I would
 

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.460
of people with depression and I would
always just go why don't you just be

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:08.470
always just go why don't you just be
 

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.400

like it your life's fine you know what's

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:13.720
like it your life's fine you know what's
 

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.100
like it your life's fine you know what's
wrong and I realized more that it's very

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:17.110
wrong and I realized more that it's very
 

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:19.319
wrong and I realized more that it's very
much because depression is you know

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:19.329
much because depression is you know
 

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:21.480
much because depression is you know
clinical and is an imbalance that I

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:21.490
clinical and is an imbalance that I
 

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.100
clinical and is an imbalance that I
think it's something where you can know

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:23.110
think it's something where you can know
 

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.540
think it's something where you can know
what everything is fine but you don't

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:24.550
what everything is fine but you don't
 

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.490
what everything is fine but you don't
feel it yeah and that can be a really

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:26.500
feel it yeah and that can be a really
 

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.559
feel it yeah and that can be a really
really big difference and in a way that

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:28.569
really big difference and in a way that
 

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.390
really big difference and in a way that
makes it even worse because at least if

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400
makes it even worse because at least if
 

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.820
makes it even worse because at least if
something goes wrong you can point to

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:33.830
something goes wrong you can point to
 

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.590
something goes wrong you can point to
certainty this is what's wrong I know I

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600
certainty this is what's wrong I know I
 

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.730
certainty this is what's wrong I know I
had to go through the mourning process

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:36.740
had to go through the mourning process
 

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.519
had to go through the mourning process
or whatever but when you don't have

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:39.529
or whatever but when you don't have
 

00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:41.409
or whatever but when you don't have
something solid that actually has

00:17:41.409 --> 00:17:41.419
something solid that actually has
 

00:17:41.419 --> 00:17:42.970
something solid that actually has
happened it's just an imbalance which

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:42.980
happened it's just an imbalance which
 

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.279
happened it's just an imbalance which
ins they just but it's an imbalance it's

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:45.289
ins they just but it's an imbalance it's
 

00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:47.049
ins they just but it's an imbalance it's
harder to get a grasp on it it's harder

00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:47.059
harder to get a grasp on it it's harder
 

00:17:47.059 --> 00:17:48.460
harder to get a grasp on it it's harder
to understand therefore harder to

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:48.470
to understand therefore harder to
 

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.289
to understand therefore harder to
conquer well it's like a catch-22

00:17:50.289 --> 00:17:50.299
conquer well it's like a catch-22
 

00:17:50.299 --> 00:17:52.360
conquer well it's like a catch-22
because you're you're already feeling

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:52.370
because you're you're already feeling
 

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.149
because you're you're already feeling
this horrible feeling inside and then

00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159
this horrible feeling inside and then
 

00:17:55.159 --> 00:17:57.490
this horrible feeling inside and then
logically you understand there's nothing

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:57.500
logically you understand there's nothing
 

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.250

00:18:05.139 --> 00:18:05.149
and what's wrong with me and then you
 

00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:07.450
and what's wrong with me and then you
get on yourself because to say what's

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:07.460
get on yourself because to say what's

wrong with me that I can't feel happy
 

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.860
wrong with me that I can't feel happy
when I know I should and then you get

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:11.870
when I know I should and then you get
 

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:14.289
when I know I should and then you get
even more depressed because you know I

00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:14.299
even more depressed because you know I
 

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:16.090
even more depressed because you know I
mean it's like you can't get out of it

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:16.100

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:18.380
it's a loop that is very very difficult
 

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.620
it's a loop that is very very difficult
to kind of punch out of yeah no it's um

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:22.630
to kind of punch out of yeah no it's um
 

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.909
to kind of punch out of yeah no it's um
there was definitely but there's a weird

00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919
there was definitely but there's a weird
 

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:26.889
there was definitely but there's a weird
point when I realized I think it's

00:18:26.889 --> 00:18:26.899
point when I realized I think it's
 

00:18:26.899 --> 00:18:28.149
point when I realized I think it's
changed now but there was a point where

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159
changed now but there was a point where
 

00:18:28.159 --> 00:18:30.460
changed now but there was a point where
I realized I actually knew I had more

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:30.470

friends with depression than people who
 

00:18:32.299 --> 00:18:33.820
friends with depression than people who
did not have depression it was very

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:33.830
did not have depression it was very
 

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:38.440
did not have depression it was very
surreal what I thought about it and yeah

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:38.450
