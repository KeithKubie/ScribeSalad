00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
They're all true.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Similar triangles have exactly identical angles.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In fact, we could have rotated this triangle.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We could have moved it around.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We could make it bigger or smaller.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
As long as these three angles

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
are identical to these three angles, it doesn't matter.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
These triangles are still similar.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's do a quick little quiz.
