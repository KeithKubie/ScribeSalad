I mean gravity of course is something

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029
I mean gravity of course is something
 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.540
I mean gravity of course is something
that has well many people have already

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550
that has well many people have already
 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.220
that has well many people have already
thought about it it's something that we

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230
thought about it it's something that we
 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.800
thought about it it's something that we
see every day and it's not like it's not

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:11.810
see every day and it's not like it's not
 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.870
see every day and it's not like it's not
existent in our every life but what I

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880
existent in our every life but what I
 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.730
existent in our every life but what I
mean by that it's an illusion is that

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740
mean by that it's an illusion is that
 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.099
mean by that it's an illusion is that
one would eventually like to know where

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109
one would eventually like to know where
 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.100
one would eventually like to know where
it comes from an explanation up to now

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110
it comes from an explanation up to now
 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.430
it comes from an explanation up to now
we have well descriptions I mean Newton

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440
we have well descriptions I mean Newton
 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.680
we have well descriptions I mean Newton
of course is the one famous for first

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.690
of course is the one famous for first
 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.700
of course is the one famous for first
writing down a theory of gravity and he

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710
writing down a theory of gravity and he
 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.040
writing down a theory of gravity and he
could describe why apples fall and and

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050
could describe why apples fall and and
 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.889
could describe why apples fall and and
why the moon goes around the earth using

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899
why the moon goes around the earth using
 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.809
why the moon goes around the earth using
the same basic equation for gravity but

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:39.819
the same basic equation for gravity but
 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:43.329
the same basic equation for gravity but
he described it he had to assume that

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339
he described it he had to assume that
 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.680
he described it he had to assume that
gravity was there and then then had to

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690
gravity was there and then then had to
 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.020
gravity was there and then then had to
write down a law that described it when

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030
write down a law that described it when
 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.000
write down a law that described it when
two masses are at a certain distance how

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010
two masses are at a certain distance how
 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.219
two masses are at a certain distance how
they attract each other but he was also

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:54.229
they attract each other but he was also
 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:56.500
they attract each other but he was also
not very happy with the fact that he

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510
not very happy with the fact that he
 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.869
not very happy with the fact that he
should just assume that these things

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879
should just assume that these things
 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.139
should just assume that these things
these objects attract each other and

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149
these objects attract each other and
 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.899
these objects attract each other and
without even anything in between so if

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909
without even anything in between so if
 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:06.720
without even anything in between so if
there are two masses in empty space

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730
there are two masses in empty space
 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.150
there are two masses in empty space
there's no nothing that that really

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160
there's no nothing that that really
 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.370
there's no nothing that that really
happens between them but Silda they're

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380
happens between them but Silda they're
 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.930
happens between them but Silda they're
attracting each other and he thought

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940
attracting each other and he thought
 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.960
attracting each other and he thought
that was kind of mysterious and that it

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970
that was kind of mysterious and that it
 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.820
that was kind of mysterious and that it
was something he would have had like to

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830
was something he would have had like to
 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.530
was something he would have had like to
explain in a better way

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540
explain in a better way
 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.400
explain in a better way
so later came in Stein and Einstein with

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410
so later came in Stein and Einstein with
 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.690
so later came in Stein and Einstein with
his theory of relativity eventually

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700
his theory of relativity eventually
 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.920
his theory of relativity eventually
realized that also gravity has to be

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930
realized that also gravity has to be
 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.470
realized that also gravity has to be
described in a different way and it took

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480
described in a different way and it took
 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.090
described in a different way and it took
him quite some years but then eventually

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100
him quite some years but then eventually
 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.660
him quite some years but then eventually
he wrote down a theory where he thought

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670
he wrote down a theory where he thought
 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.630
he wrote down a theory where he thought
about a space and time together and then

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640
about a space and time together and then
 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.520
about a space and time together and then
his explanation of what gravity would be

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530
his explanation of what gravity would be
 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.190
his explanation of what gravity would be
is that there's masses which curved

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200
is that there's masses which curved
 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.380
is that there's masses which curved
space and time and then the motion of

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390
space and time and then the motion of
 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.600
space and time and then the motion of
planets and of the earth around the moon

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610
planets and of the earth around the moon
 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.540
planets and of the earth around the moon
or the moon around the earth is then

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550
or the moon around the earth is then
 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.649
or the moon around the earth is then
described by thinking about moving in

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659
described by thinking about moving in
 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.840
described by thinking about moving in
this curved space-time and how then

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850
this curved space-time and how then
 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.830
this curved space-time and how then
objects are are well making their orbits

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840
objects are are well making their orbits
 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.589
objects are are well making their orbits
and the reason they go around then in

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599
and the reason they go around then in
 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.410
and the reason they go around then in
circles is that that space and time

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420
circles is that that space and time
 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.819
circles is that that space and time
itself is curved in the sense that

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829
itself is curved in the sense that
 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.229
itself is curved in the sense that
things don't move in straight lines

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239
things don't move in straight lines
 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.120
things don't move in straight lines
anymore they they they go around

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130
anymore they they they go around
 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.710
anymore they they they go around
so that was his explanation but he had

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720
so that was his explanation but he had
 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.040
so that was his explanation but he had
to write down equation for it which

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050
to write down equation for it which
 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.540
to write down equation for it which
again assumed that gravity is there

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550
again assumed that gravity is there
 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.670
again assumed that gravity is there
because he basically wrote down that

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680
because he basically wrote down that
 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.280
because he basically wrote down that
that the matter occurs the space-time so

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290
that the matter occurs the space-time so
 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.990
that the matter occurs the space-time so
in a certain way that's still in the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000
in a certain way that's still in the
 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.380
in a certain way that's still in the
script

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.580
description or what I should say is well
one would like to understand again why

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590
one would like to understand again why
 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.720
one would like to understand again why
this description sort of how you can can

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730
this description sort of how you can can
 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.790
this description sort of how you can can
understand it from a more basic point of

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800
understand it from a more basic point of
 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.980
understand it from a more basic point of
view so what I've done in my paper is

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990
view so what I've done in my paper is
 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.310
view so what I've done in my paper is
try to start from a formal point of view

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320
try to start from a formal point of view
 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.370
try to start from a formal point of view
where you don't assume gravity to be

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380
where you don't assume gravity to be
 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.820
where you don't assume gravity to be
there you would like to explain it by

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830
there you would like to explain it by
 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.980
there you would like to explain it by
seeing how you can derive it from a more

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990
seeing how you can derive it from a more
 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.500
seeing how you can derive it from a more
microscopic set of equations where

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510
microscopic set of equations where
 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.200
microscopic set of equations where
gravity itself is not assumed but then

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210
gravity itself is not assumed but then
 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.810
gravity itself is not assumed but then
just follows from a certain logical

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820
just follows from a certain logical
 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.470
just follows from a certain logical
reasoning

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480
 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.589
if you think about particles very tiny

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599
if you think about particles very tiny
 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.350
if you think about particles very tiny
particles and it turns out that things

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360
particles and it turns out that things
 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.050
particles and it turns out that things
like positions and velocities are not

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060
like positions and velocities are not
 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.140
like positions and velocities are not
very precisely defined you have to take

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150
very precisely defined you have to take
 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.430
very precisely defined you have to take
into account effect that there's an

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440
into account effect that there's an
 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.160
into account effect that there's an
uncertainty in when we look at something

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170
uncertainty in when we look at something
 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.190
uncertainty in when we look at something
we may influence the measurement but we

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200
we may influence the measurement but we
 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.020
we may influence the measurement but we
may also just doesn't a fundamental

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030
may also just doesn't a fundamental
 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.040
may also just doesn't a fundamental
limit on how precise you can understand

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050
limit on how precise you can understand
 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.630
limit on how precise you can understand
the position or the velocity of a

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640
the position or the velocity of a
 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.840
the position or the velocity of a
particle they cannot be of all not both

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850
particle they cannot be of all not both
 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.240
particle they cannot be of all not both
describes infinitely precise so taking

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250
describes infinitely precise so taking
 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.910
describes infinitely precise so taking
gravity into account then gives us a bit

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920
gravity into account then gives us a bit
 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.289
gravity into account then gives us a bit
of a problem because then we have to

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299
of a problem because then we have to
 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.809
of a problem because then we have to
talk about space-time and and then these

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819
talk about space-time and and then these
 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.340
talk about space-time and and then these
quantum uncertainties gives us

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350
quantum uncertainties gives us
 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.380
quantum uncertainties gives us
another way of looking at space-time at

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390
another way of looking at space-time at
 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.490
another way of looking at space-time at
the short distances so this led to

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500
the short distances so this led to
 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.300
the short distances so this led to
problems and string theory is another

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310
problems and string theory is another
 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.800
problems and string theory is another
way of also looking at gravity and

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810
way of also looking at gravity and
 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.150
way of also looking at gravity and
quantum mechanics which have been

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160
quantum mechanics which have been
 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.750
quantum mechanics which have been
working on quite a bit so people have

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760
working on quite a bit so people have
 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.910
working on quite a bit so people have
studied the problem of quantum gravity

studied the problem of quantum gravity
quantum mechanics and gravity from

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720
quantum mechanics and gravity from
 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.240
quantum mechanics and gravity from
various perspective from string theory

various perspective from string theory
but also by thinking for instance about

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140
but also by thinking for instance about
 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.140
but also by thinking for instance about
black holes what happens with black

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150
black holes what happens with black
 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.680
black holes what happens with black
holes and I've taken some of the things

we've learned about it and seen that

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900
we've learned about it and seen that
 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.020
we've learned about it and seen that
there is some explanation of maybe where

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030
there is some explanation of maybe where
 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.650
there is some explanation of maybe where
gravity then comes from from those are

mechanics and gravity together so if you

mechanics and gravity together so if you
 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.360
mechanics and gravity together so if you
then start trying to explain where it

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370
then start trying to explain where it
 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.300
then start trying to explain where it
comes from it has to do with the fact

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310
comes from it has to do with the fact
 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.760
comes from it has to do with the fact
that is at the microscopic scale a

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770
that is at the microscopic scale a
 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.980

certain information about how you

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990
certain information about how you
 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.990
certain information about how you
describe this which we don't see

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000

ourselves we forget about that and it
 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.110
ourselves we forget about that and it
turns out that if you take that into

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120
turns out that if you take that into
 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.420
turns out that if you take that into
account in some appropriate way that you

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430
account in some appropriate way that you
 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.940
account in some appropriate way that you
can understand where where gravity comes

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950
can understand where where gravity comes
 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.270
can understand where where gravity comes

resembling things that we call
 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.940
resembling things that we call
thermodynamics that's a theory that

thermodynamics that's a theory that
 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.110
thermodynamics that's a theory that
describes how gases move when they give

describes how gases move when they give
 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.390
describes how gases move when they give
them a temperature or when when there is

pressure and you well you can apply it

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360
pressure and you well you can apply it
 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.840
pressure and you well you can apply it
in very many situations but it's some

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850
in very many situations but it's some
 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.910
in very many situations but it's some
way in which we describe how things

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920
way in which we describe how things
 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.210
way in which we describe how things
happen at very large fairly large scales

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220
happen at very large fairly large scales
 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.300
happen at very large fairly large scales
in terms of not looking at the

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310
in terms of not looking at the
 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.940
in terms of not looking at the
individual motion of the atoms and

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950
individual motion of the atoms and
 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.250
individual motion of the atoms and
molecules but by just thinking about

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260
molecules but by just thinking about
 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.230
molecules but by just thinking about
these objects like temperature pressure

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240
these objects like temperature pressure
 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.170
these objects like temperature pressure
and so on which are what I call

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180
and so on which are what I call
 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.900
and so on which are what I call
macroscopic quantities mean the

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910
macroscopic quantities mean the
 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.400
macroscopic quantities mean the
temperature is something that is just an

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410
temperature is something that is just an
 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.910
temperature is something that is just an
average of all of the motions or the

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920
average of all of the motions or the
 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.430
average of all of the motions or the
collision little collisions of atoms

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440
collision little collisions of atoms
 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.930
collision little collisions of atoms
today for instance on my skin if I think

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940
today for instance on my skin if I think
 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.240
today for instance on my skin if I think
about what temperature I feel that says

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250
about what temperature I feel that says
 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.790
about what temperature I feel that says
something about the average energy that

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800
something about the average energy that
 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.710
something about the average energy that
each of the molecules in the air is

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720
each of the molecules in the air is
 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.140
each of the molecules in the air is
carrying so temperature is not really a

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150
carrying so temperature is not really a
 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.130
carrying so temperature is not really a
microscopic thing I can define and so

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140
microscopic thing I can define and so
 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.440
microscopic thing I can define and so
gravity is somewhat like that in the

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450
gravity is somewhat like that in the
 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.690
gravity is somewhat like that in the
sense that the thing the equations that

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700
sense that the thing the equations that
 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.010
sense that the thing the equations that
we currently use to describe gravity are

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020
we currently use to describe gravity are
 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.040
we currently use to describe gravity are
basically obtained from averaging or at

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050
basically obtained from averaging or at
 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.409
basically obtained from averaging or at
least describing things as a much tinier

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419
least describing things as a much tinier
 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:30.760
least describing things as a much tinier
scale and then forgetting about a

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.770
scale and then forgetting about a
 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.430
scale and then forgetting about a
certain details so temperature for

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440
certain details so temperature for
 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.310
certain details so temperature for
instance also forgets about how all of

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320
instance also forgets about how all of
 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.320
instance also forgets about how all of
the individual molecules are moving we

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330
the individual molecules are moving we
 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.600
the individual molecules are moving we
don't have to keep track of that but

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610
don't have to keep track of that but
 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.280
don't have to keep track of that but
still we can describe quite well how

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290
still we can describe quite well how
 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.560
still we can describe quite well how
gases move when we just talk about

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570
gases move when we just talk about
 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.310
gases move when we just talk about
pressure and temperature and even

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320
pressure and temperature and even
 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.210
pressure and temperature and even
differences in pressure for instance

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.220
differences in pressure for instance
 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.150
differences in pressure for instance
then if you have one room with one

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160
then if you have one room with one
 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.040
then if you have one room with one
pressure and other room with lower

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050
pressure and other room with lower
 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.590
pressure and other room with lower
pressure you simply know that the gas

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600
pressure you simply know that the gas
 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.190
pressure you simply know that the gas
will flow from one to the other and this

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200
will flow from one to the other and this
 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.280
will flow from one to the other and this
kind of differences is then necessary to

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290
kind of differences is then necessary to
 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.640
kind of differences is then necessary to
get things moving

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:06.650
 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.159
it's fun too

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169
it's fun too
 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:12.420
it's fun too
about things like gravity and even while

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430
about things like gravity and even while
 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.399
about things like gravity and even while
what I had in my paper things like even

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:14.409
what I had in my paper things like even
 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:16.409
what I had in my paper things like even
the laws of Newton because they do play

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419
the laws of Newton because they do play
 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:19.350
the laws of Newton because they do play
a role in one's everyday life but it's

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360
a role in one's everyday life but it's
 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.749
a role in one's everyday life but it's
surprising that when I go and walk out

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759
surprising that when I go and walk out
 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:22.920
surprising that when I go and walk out
the door and something like that it's

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930
the door and something like that it's
 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.480
the door and something like that it's
not like I immediately sort of think

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490
not like I immediately sort of think
 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.820
not like I immediately sort of think
about these things in a different way

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:26.830
about these things in a different way
 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.379
about these things in a different way
but for me I think it's more important

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:31.389
but for me I think it's more important
 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:33.300
but for me I think it's more important
eventually what will be the implications

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.310
eventually what will be the implications
 

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.909
eventually what will be the implications
for understanding not just gravity but

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919
for understanding not just gravity but
 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:38.399
for understanding not just gravity but
also what's happening in the universe I

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:38.409
also what's happening in the universe I
 

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:41.760
also what's happening in the universe I
mean the gravity equations of Einstein

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:41.770
mean the gravity equations of Einstein
 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.959
mean the gravity equations of Einstein
are also used in in describing the

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:44.969
are also used in in describing the
 

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:47.070
are also used in in describing the
expansion of the universe the Big Bang

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080
expansion of the universe the Big Bang
 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.320
expansion of the universe the Big Bang
Theory are all based on these same

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:49.330
Theory are all based on these same
 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.459
Theory are all based on these same
equations what I hope is that that idea

00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:53.469
equations what I hope is that that idea
 

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:55.079
equations what I hope is that that idea
is that that we are now starting to

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:55.089
is that that we are now starting to
 

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:56.999
is that that we are now starting to
develop for for gravity can eventually

00:07:56.999 --> 00:07:57.009
develop for for gravity can eventually
 

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:00.029
develop for for gravity can eventually
sort of lead to possibly some somewhat

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039
sort of lead to possibly some somewhat
 

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:02.730
sort of lead to possibly some somewhat
better or even more refined way of

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:02.740
better or even more refined way of
 

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.679
better or even more refined way of
thinking about the early universe and I

00:08:04.679 --> 00:08:04.689
thinking about the early universe and I
 

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:07.499
thinking about the early universe and I
think that will influence a little bit

00:08:07.499 --> 00:08:07.509
think that will influence a little bit
 

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:12.209
think that will influence a little bit
more by thinking then yeah I think as

00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:12.219
more by thinking then yeah I think as
 

00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:14.399
more by thinking then yeah I think as
human beings we like to know where we

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:14.409
human beings we like to know where we
 

00:08:14.409 --> 00:08:16.800
human beings we like to know where we
come from and how the universal of sort

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:16.810
come from and how the universal of sort
 

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.159
