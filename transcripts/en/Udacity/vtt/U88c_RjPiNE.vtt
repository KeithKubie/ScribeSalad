00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
And the answer here is that--yes, this algorithm is actually correct.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.470
It might not be very practical in terms of running time but the arguments are perfectly fine.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.490
If you have finite memory and a program is in an infinite loop, then at a certain point in time

00:00:13.490 --> 99:59:59.000
snapshots are states of the machine must repeat themselves--there's no other way.
