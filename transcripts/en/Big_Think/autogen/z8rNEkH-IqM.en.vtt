my cousin who lives in Hong Kong is a
 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.660
my cousin who lives in Hong Kong is a
game programmer and he loves what I'm

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670
game programmer and he loves what I'm
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.259
game programmer and he loves what I'm
doing but he just tells me when we

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
doing but he just tells me when we

gratification like he codes something

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
gratification like he codes something
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.650

something cool right and if you need

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
something cool right and if you need
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.750
something cool right and if you need
that if you really need to see something

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
that if you really need to see something
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.099
that if you really need to see something
cool happen every day AGI is not for you

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109
cool happen every day AGI is not for you
 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.900
cool happen every day AGI is not for you
and in AGI you may work six months and

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910
and in AGI you may work six months and
 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.010
and in AGI you may work six months and
nothing interesting happens and then

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020
nothing interesting happens and then
 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.119
nothing interesting happens and then
something really really interesting

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
something really really interesting
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.369
something really really interesting
happens so I think if someone doesn't

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
happens so I think if someone doesn't
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.479
happens so I think if someone doesn't
have that kind of stubborn pigheaded

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489
have that kind of stubborn pigheaded
 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.889
have that kind of stubborn pigheaded
persistence I will tend to employ them

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
persistence I will tend to employ them
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.799

doing for example data analysis because

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809
doing for example data analysis because
 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.689
doing for example data analysis because
that gives immediate gratification you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
that gives immediate gratification you
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.180
that gives immediate gratification you
get a data set from a customer you run a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
get a data set from a customer you run a
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.450
get a data set from a customer you run a
machine learning algorithm on it and you

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
machine learning algorithm on it and you
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340
machine learning algorithm on it and you
get a result which is interesting the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
get a result which is interesting the
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.080
get a result which is interesting the
customer is happy then you go on to the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
customer is happy then you go on to the
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.070
customer is happy then you go on to the
to the next data set and if you explain

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
to the next data set and if you explain
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.530
to the next data set and if you explain
the different types of work available

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540
the different types of work available
 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.490
the different types of work available
actually most people are pretty good at

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500
actually most people are pretty good at
 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.249
actually most people are pretty good at
choosing what won't drive them crazy so

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
choosing what won't drive them crazy so
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.469
choosing what won't drive them crazy so
some people are like yeah what I want to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
some people are like yeah what I want to
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.649
some people are like yeah what I want to
do stuff that seems cool every day and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659
do stuff that seems cool every day and
 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.700
do stuff that seems cool every day and
other people are like well I I really

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
other people are like well I I really
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.760
other people are like well I I really
want to understand you know how thinking

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
want to understand you know how thinking
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.960
want to understand you know how thinking
works I want to understand how cognition

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
works I want to understand how cognition
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.870
works I want to understand how cognition
and vision work together and that's much

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
and vision work together and that's much
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.990
and vision work together and that's much
more interesting to me than applying an

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
more interesting to me than applying an
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.420
more interesting to me than applying an
existing vision algorithm to solve solve

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
existing vision algorithm to solve solve
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.840
existing vision algorithm to solve solve
someone's problem so I I tend to I tend

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
someone's problem so I I tend to I tend
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.100
someone's problem so I I tend to I tend
to throw the issue at the potential

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110
to throw the issue at the potential
 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.660
to throw the issue at the potential
employee or volunteer themselves and

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670
employee or volunteer themselves and
 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.740
employee or volunteer themselves and
sometimes that works sometimes it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
sometimes that works sometimes it
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.510
sometimes that works sometimes it
doesn't but I trust them to know

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
doesn't but I trust them to know
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.920
doesn't but I trust them to know
themselves better than I know them

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
themselves better than I know them
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.540
themselves better than I know them
anyway there are many different types

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
anyway there are many different types
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.340
anyway there are many different types
and levels of problem

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350
and levels of problem
 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.020
and levels of problem
the one encounters in in doing AI work

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030
the one encounters in in doing AI work
 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.090
the one encounters in in doing AI work
and there are sort of low-level

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100
and there are sort of low-level
 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.980
and there are sort of low-level
algorithmic problems or software design

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990

problems what you solved via clever

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440
problems what you solved via clever
 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.940
problems what you solved via clever
tricks and then there are deeper

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950
tricks and then there are deeper
 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.960
tricks and then there are deeper
problems like how do you architect a

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970
problems like how do you architect a
 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.120

and cognition work together in an AI

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700
and cognition work together in an AI

how do you leverage that knowledge ah

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310
how do you leverage that knowledge ah
 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.330
how do you leverage that knowledge ah
but learn another language I find

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340
but learn another language I find
 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.780
