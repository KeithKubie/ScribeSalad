1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,390
I find meetings of greater
than or equal to eight people,

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,220
far less productive than smaller groups.
Even with stroke,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,790
with a structured action oriented agenda.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,310
Is there a maximum amount of people
you'd involve in a strategic or tactical

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,630
planning group?

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,470
I don't think,
I don't think there is a massive amount.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,000
I think it just has to be
controlled and you've got to have,

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,270
you've got to have some decentralized
command or people understand if there's

9
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:37,200
just a bunch of people in a meeting and
everyone's kind of speaking in, in turn,

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,350
um, and talking over each other,
you're not gonna get anything done.

11
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:42,600
So you got to have, there's got
to be one leader who's run that.

12
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:46,590
There's gotta be some, some,
you know, some other, uh,
uh, subordinate leaders that,

13
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:47,200
uh,
and,

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,180
and one person's got to drive that
meeting and make sure that when someone

15
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,370
starts going down a rabbit hole,
okay,

16
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:56,100
you guys have a sidebar
conversation afterwards.

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,260
Let's keep this meeting focused and less.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,340
And ultimately the decision maker who
can focus the team on a single course of

19
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:05,010
action, get her by behind them. I agree.

20
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,800
And there's certainly times where you
can bring too many people in to try and

21
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,100
figure something out. I mean,
that can certainly happen. And we,

22
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:13,470
we have the good idea fairies that keep
coming around with their good ideas and,

23
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,150
and well, what if we did
this? I wonder if we did that.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,630
There's also an interesting dynamic that
you just pointed out that ties into a

25
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:22,260
question that we had earlier or something
that we were talking about earlier,

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,180
which is,
okay,

27
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:27,000
so let's say we have a meeting and
there's 15 people in that meeting.

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,850
If the leader of that meeting,

29
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,940
then we'll say steps down into
the position of being the,

30
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,930
the director of the meeting itself.

31
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,980
Guess what he's doing the whole time
he's talking, he's pulling things,

32
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,660
he's good and what he's
doing while he's doing that,

33
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:48,090
as he's getting in the
weeds of what's going on.

34
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,310
So as he's getting in the
weeds of what's going on,

35
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,470
he's losing the strategic vision.

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,820
And so if there's 20 people in a meeting
and you as the leader are going, okay,

37
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:58,980
what do you think? What do you think?
What are you thinking? Hey, no,

38
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:02,490
let's get it refocused. When you're
doing all that traffic copping,

39
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,700
you're actually losing
your strategic altitude.

40
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,250
You're not going to be able to see
and make a good clear decision.

41
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,180
So if there's 30 40 50
people in a meeting,

42
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,550
and you as the leader get down in the
weeds and get down in the trenches and you

43
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:21,360
start throwing down with everyone, well
it's not gonna take very long. We'll,

44
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:24,210
you're just, you're just one of the
troops and you don't see anything.

45
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,130
Whereas if you let,

46
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,670
let one of the other leaders let one of
the subordinate leaders let them step up

47
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:32,550
and let them start to do their thing,
let them do the direction of the meeting.

48
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:36,060
And you might even tell him, hey, run this
meeting. I would do that. I'd be like,

49
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,320
Hey,
you run this meeting.

50
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,430
And then you let them get in there in the
trenches and let them try and sort out

51
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,000
ideas.
And they,

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,240
their mind gets filled with a bunch of
crap and meanwhile you're in the meeting,

53
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,110
you're just not running it.

54
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,790
So there's a big difference between
running the meeting and overseeing the

55
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,940
meeting or being in the meeting or
being the leading leader of a meeting.

56
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,720
So if we're going through a
kill house or if we're going,

57
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,490
if we're going through a kill
house, that's a good example,
which is, you know, the,

58
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,450
with the building with a bunch
of rooms in it, if as the leader,

59
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,920
you don't say, Hey, I'm gonna run this
kill house. I'm not gonna, I'm not,

60
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,010
I'm not going to direct the movement
through the kill house because then guess

61
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,530
what you're doing, you're directing
the movement through the kill house.

62
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,370
What you want to do is take
a step back and say, Hey,

63
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,240
you third, fourth, fifth,
and the chain of command.

64
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,770
You run this kill house, you run the
train, and now that guy goes, okay, cool,

65
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:29,530
I got it. And now while he's
running the train, doing the work,

66
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,500
you're stepped back at altitude,
you can see what's going on,

67
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,650
you can hear the frustration,
you can hear shots fired,

68
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:39,130
you know where people are moving, then
you become, you are the real leader.

69
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,320
So same thing at a meeting.

70
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,740
If the dynamics of the meeting or you
get more than 10 people, 15 people,

71
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,110
and what you're doing is you're
down there directing traffic,

72
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,940
it's going to be really
problematic for you.

73
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,450
If you have a meeting with 15 or 20
people and you tell someone else to direct

74
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:59,230
the meeting and run the meeting and you
take a step up and you simply observe,

75
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,180
you're going to have a better time

76
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,030
feeling like the meeting is effective
and you will get the benefit of hearing

77
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:08,950
all these different voices,
which is good,

78
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,980
which is good to hear all these different
opinions and voices and be able to

79
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:15,560
pick through and sort through and that's
going to give you more benefit than a,

80
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,460
you know what I get,
there's too much going on in this meeting.

81
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:21,730
Only give me two people and we'll make
the decisions. Well, there's some people,

82
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,570
number of number, the six person,
that person had a good input, right?

83
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,190
The 12th person might've had some good
input. So again, is there balance? Yes.

84
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,760
Are there certain decisions that you
kind of need to take and really dive down

85
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:35,830
and with a small group?
Absolutely,

86
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,870
but is it good sometimes to let things
air out and let someone run a meeting and

87
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:44,470
you listen and you learn kind of what
the overall atmosphere because of the

88
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:48,160
situation are? Absolutely.
That's my answer.

89
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,970
I think it's a great one. It helps people.
It helps people listen to you as well.

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,200
Right?
I mean if,

91
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,660
if you're the boss and you're just sitting
back and you're not saying anything

92
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,990
and then all of a sudden you're like, hey
guys, we're getting way off topic here.

93
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,720
This is what we need to do. Here's
the address we need to go. Got It.

94
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,470
Everyone's back on track. Whereas if
you're in the middle of it, then yeah,

95
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,110
people are just automatically
kind of doing. There is,

96
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,150
I'm sure you've said this before and
I know we talked about earlier too,

97
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:13,750
but like when I would say something on
the radio and task unit bruiser when I

98
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:15,880
would say like a legitimate thing,

99
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,060
Manny would happen if I got on and said
everyone get to building 34 now people

100
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:24,130
would go and I,
one of my favorite things to do,

101
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,520
one of my favorite conversations to have
on the radio with with either you or

102
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:32,140
stoner was like I remember you'd
be like, you'd say, Hey Jocko,

103
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:35,530
we've got another mover or where I want
to take down building 34 and I'd come up

104
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:36,364
and go do it.

105
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,050
But that was all I'd ever set to be
like do it just like go because I'm not

106
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:45,310
trying to talk. Right. I got these
guys, got their situations handled.

107
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,280
Hey he's going outside of it.
Something that we planned. Hey Jack,

108
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:53,230
I want to build a move to building 34
and take that thing down. Do it. Nah.

109
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,570
Well why do you want to do that?
You know why he wants to do it?

110
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,560
Cause he's got a good reason.

111
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,960
He's not me that because it's a fantasy
that he thinks it's going to be cool. No,

112
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:02,210
there's a reason.
And he'll explain that to me later.

113
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,430
And if it was something where
he's like, I want to, you know,

114
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,700
start doing jumping jacks out here,
then I might ask why,

115
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,220
because that doesn't make much sense
to me. But to say, hey, we're gonna,

116
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,410
we're gonna hit building 34 as well.
What if we were doing burpees with Dell?

117
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:17,690
Would that make more sense?
That makes a little more sense,

118
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,520
a little more sense than jumping jacks.
Look that that absolutely worked.

119
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,700
It worked for us. When you, when you said
something over the radio, like got it.

120
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,620
We're good. Like it is the decision made
everyone's on board. And uh, I think it's,

121
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,240
it's something that, um, you've got
to, you've got to focus on what,

122
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:38,210
like when a leader talks, it should
matter. And I think you can be,

123
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,590
you gotta be really careful about that.

124
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,150
And I've certainly been achieved violator
that of like going off to dip too many

125
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:45,860
different directions, but, um, that,

126
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,430
that you did extremely well tasking at
bruiser and it works on every leader

127
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:52,820
should be very conscious of them. Yeah.
The less you talk, the more people listen.
