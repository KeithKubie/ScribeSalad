00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:03.439
- A lot of students come to
school and they don't eat,

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.339
they don't have breakfast, they're hungry.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.888
And so then we have to talk
about, well, what does that mean

00:00:07.888 --> 00:00:09.462
for outside resources?

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:12.060
What does that even mean
for you going to class

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.961
and staying alert?

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.887
- And are you able to get them?

00:00:14.887 --> 00:00:17.390
To satisfy those needs,
like just something to eat?

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.326
Something as simple as that?

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:21.511
- Yeah, so a little bit of two things.

00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:23.722
So the first thing is, we
definitely want to direct

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:26.591
them to longterm resources
and then the second thing,

00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:28.672
if they have immediate
resources, organizations

00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:30.651
like the West End House
Boys and Girls Club,

00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:33.615
other organizations that work
on the Success Boss Intiative,

00:00:33.615 --> 00:00:37.078
these nonprofits, we
have different resources

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:39.467
for those students to meet
their immediate needs,

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:41.606
but we also want to
make sure that we handle

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:42.883
those longterm needs as well.
