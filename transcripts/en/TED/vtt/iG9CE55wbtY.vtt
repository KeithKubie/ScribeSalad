00:00:27.103 --> 00:00:29.678
Good morning. How are you?

00:00:29.702 --> 00:00:31.105
(Audience) Good.

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:32.797
It's been great, hasn't it?

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.729
I've been blown away by the whole thing.

00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:37.245
In fact, I'm leaving.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.175
(Laughter)

00:00:43.096 --> 00:00:46.663
There have been three themes
running through the conference,

00:00:46.687 --> 00:00:48.973
which are relevant
to what I want to talk about.

00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:53.467
One is the extraordinary
evidence of human creativity

00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:55.904
in all of the presentations that we've had

00:00:55.928 --> 00:00:57.880
and in all of the people here;

00:00:57.904 --> 00:01:00.555
just the variety of it
and the range of it.

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:03.301
The second is that it's put us in a place

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:05.822
where we have no idea
what's going to happen

00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:07.237
in terms of the future.

00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:10.246
No idea how this may play out.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.892
I have an interest in education.

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:16.328
Actually, what I find is,
everybody has an interest in education.

00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:17.669
Don't you?

00:01:17.693 --> 00:01:19.095
I find this very interesting.

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.077
If you're at a dinner party,
and you say you work in education --

00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.846
actually, you're not often
at dinner parties, frankly.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.666
(Laughter)

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.118
If you work in education,
you're not asked.

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:35.321
(Laughter)

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:39.304
And you're never asked back, curiously.
That's strange to me.

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:41.544
But if you are, and you say to somebody,

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:43.346
you know, they say, "What do you do?"

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.058
and you say you work in education,

00:01:45.082 --> 00:01:47.131
you can see the blood run from their face.

00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:48.840
They're like, "Oh my God. Why me?"

00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:51.140
(Laughter)

00:01:51.164 --> 00:01:52.688
"My one night out all week."

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:55.322
(Laughter)

00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:58.587
But if you ask about their education,
they pin you to the wall,

00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:02.018
because it's one of those things
that goes deep with people, am I right?

00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:05.535
Like religion and money and other things.

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:10.001
So I have a big interest in education,
and I think we all do.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:11.827
We have a huge vested interest in it,

00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:15.171
partly because it's education
that's meant to take us into this future

00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:16.849
that we can't grasp.

00:02:16.873 --> 00:02:18.039
If you think of it,

00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:24.185
children starting school this year
will be retiring in 2065.

00:02:25.272 --> 00:02:26.843
Nobody has a clue,

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:30.426
despite all the expertise that's been
on parade for the past four days,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.976
what the world will look like
in five years' time.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.294
And yet, we're meant
to be educating them for it.

00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:37.868
So the unpredictability,
I think, is extraordinary.

00:02:37.892 --> 00:02:41.320
And the third part of this
is that we've all agreed, nonetheless,

00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:46.649
on the really extraordinary
capacities that children have --

00:02:46.673 --> 00:02:49.008
their capacities for innovation.

00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:51.821
I mean, Sirena last night
was a marvel, wasn't she?

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:53.515
Just seeing what she could do.

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:59.088
And she's exceptional, but I think
she's not, so to speak,

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.017
exceptional in the whole of childhood.

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:04.872
What you have there is a person
of extraordinary dedication

00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:06.067
who found a talent.

00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:08.677
And my contention is,
all kids have tremendous talents,

00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:11.095
and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.976
So I want to talk about education,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.872
and I want to talk about creativity.

00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:20.992
My contention is that creativity now
is as important in education as literacy,

00:03:21.016 --> 00:03:23.803
and we should treat it
with the same status.

00:03:23.827 --> 00:03:24.939
(Applause)

00:03:24.963 --> 00:03:26.152
Thank you.

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:30.461
(Applause)

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:32.771
That was it, by the way.
Thank you very much.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:34.910
(Laughter)

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:36.611
So, 15 minutes left.

00:03:36.635 --> 00:03:39.792
(Laughter)

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:41.487
"Well, I was born ... "

00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:44.982
(Laughter)

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:47.656
I heard a great story recently --
I love telling it --

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.051
of a little girl
who was in a drawing lesson.

00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:52.250
She was six, and she was
at the back, drawing,

00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:55.034
and the teacher said this girl
hardly ever paid attention,

00:03:55.058 --> 00:03:56.844
and in this drawing lesson, she did.

00:03:56.868 --> 00:03:58.208
The teacher was fascinated.

00:03:58.232 --> 00:04:01.021
She went over to her,
and she said, "What are you drawing?"

00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:03.536
And the girl said,
"I'm drawing a picture of God."

00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:07.960
And the teacher said, "But nobody
knows what God looks like."

00:04:07.984 --> 00:04:10.072
And the girl said,
"They will in a minute."

00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:16.878
(Laughter)

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:24.389
When my son was four in England --

00:04:24.413 --> 00:04:26.604
actually, he was four
everywhere, to be honest.

00:04:26.628 --> 00:04:28.380
(Laughter)

00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:31.791
If we're being strict about it,
wherever he went, he was four that year.

00:04:31.815 --> 00:04:34.453
He was in the Nativity play.
Do you remember the story?

00:04:34.477 --> 00:04:35.696
(Laughter)

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.547
No, it was big, it was a big story.

00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:39.876
Mel Gibson did the sequel,
you may have seen it.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.161
(Laughter)

00:04:41.185 --> 00:04:42.746
"Nativity II."

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.654
But James got the part of Joseph,
which we were thrilled about.

00:04:46.678 --> 00:04:49.584
We considered this to be
one of the lead parts.

00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:52.095
We had the place crammed
full of agents in T-shirts:

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:53.533
"James Robinson IS Joseph!"

00:04:53.557 --> 00:04:54.590
(Laughter)

00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:58.242
He didn't have to speak, but you know
the bit where the three kings come in?

00:04:58.266 --> 00:05:00.951
They come in bearing gifts,
gold, frankincense and myrrh.

00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:02.133
This really happened.

00:05:02.157 --> 00:05:05.273
We were sitting there, and I think
they just went out of sequence,

00:05:05.297 --> 00:05:07.876
because we talked to the little boy
afterward and said,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.696
"You OK with that?" They said,
"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.876
They just switched.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.210
The three boys came in, four-year-olds
with tea towels on their heads.

00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:18.556
They put these boxes down, and the first
boy said, "I bring you gold."

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.854
And the second boy said,
"I bring you myrrh."

00:05:20.878 --> 00:05:22.960
And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."

00:05:22.984 --> 00:05:28.461
(Laughter)

00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:38.801
What these things have in common
is that kids will take a chance.

00:05:38.825 --> 00:05:42.307
If they don't know, they'll have a go.

00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:45.360
Am I right? They're not
frightened of being wrong.

00:05:45.924 --> 00:05:49.431
I don't mean to say that being wrong
is the same thing as being creative.

00:05:49.886 --> 00:05:52.976
What we do know is,
if you're not prepared to be wrong,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.367
you'll never come up
with anything original --

00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:57.971
if you're not prepared to be wrong.

00:05:57.995 --> 00:06:02.438
And by the time they get to be adults,
most kids have lost that capacity.

00:06:02.462 --> 00:06:04.926
They have become
frightened of being wrong.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.640
And we run our companies like this.

00:06:06.664 --> 00:06:08.316
We stigmatize mistakes.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.642
And we're now running
national education systems

00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:13.205
where mistakes are the worst
thing you can make.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.908
And the result is that
we are educating people

00:06:16.932 --> 00:06:19.274
out of their creative capacities.

00:06:19.298 --> 00:06:23.725
Picasso once said this, he said
that all children are born artists.

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:26.971
The problem is to remain
an artist as we grow up.

00:06:26.995 --> 00:06:30.227
I believe this passionately,
that we don't grow into creativity,

00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:31.956
we grow out of it.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.863
Or rather, we get educated out of it.

00:06:34.607 --> 00:06:36.510
So why is this?

00:06:37.124 --> 00:06:39.907
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon
until about five years ago.

00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:42.184
In fact, we moved from Stratford
to Los Angeles.

00:06:42.912 --> 00:06:45.536
So you can imagine
what a seamless transition this was.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.976
(Laughter)

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.376
Actually, we lived in a place
called Snitterfield,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.651
just outside Stratford,

00:06:50.675 --> 00:06:53.310
which is where
Shakespeare's father was born.

00:06:53.334 --> 00:06:55.457
Are you struck by a new thought? I was.

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:58.076
You don't think of Shakespeare
having a father, do you?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.473
Do you?

00:06:59.497 --> 00:07:02.388
Because you don't think
of Shakespeare being a child, do you?

00:07:02.412 --> 00:07:03.676
Shakespeare being seven?

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.876
I never thought of it.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.592
I mean, he was seven at some point.

00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:08.882
He was in somebody's
English class, wasn't he?

00:07:08.906 --> 00:07:15.693
(Laughter)

00:07:15.717 --> 00:07:17.046
How annoying would that be?

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.070
(Laughter)

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:26.279
"Must try harder."

00:07:26.303 --> 00:07:29.703
(Laughter)

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:33.540
Being sent to bed by his dad,
to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!"

00:07:33.564 --> 00:07:34.722
To William Shakespeare.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.017
"And put the pencil down!"

00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:37.116
(Laughter)

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.617
"And stop speaking like that."

00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:42.220
(Laughter)

00:07:42.244 --> 00:07:43.568
"It's confusing everybody."

00:07:43.592 --> 00:07:48.862
(Laughter)

00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:54.072
Anyway, we moved
from Stratford to Los Angeles,

00:07:54.096 --> 00:07:56.572
and I just want to say a word
about the transition.

00:07:56.596 --> 00:07:58.398
Actually, my son didn't want to come.

00:07:58.422 --> 00:08:00.817
I've got two kids;
he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.

00:08:00.841 --> 00:08:03.044
He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.

00:08:03.068 --> 00:08:06.856
He loved it, but he had
a girlfriend in England.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.737
This was the love of his life, Sarah.

00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:11.136
He'd known her for a month.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.510
(Laughter)

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:15.813
Mind you, they'd had
their fourth anniversary,

00:08:15.837 --> 00:08:17.773
because it's a long time when you're 16.

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:19.438
He was really upset on the plane.

00:08:19.462 --> 00:08:21.869
He said, "I'll never find
another girl like Sarah."

00:08:21.893 --> 00:08:24.207
And we were rather pleased
about that, frankly --

00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:28.464
(Laughter)

00:08:32.434 --> 00:08:35.380
because she was the main reason
we were leaving the country.

00:08:35.404 --> 00:08:38.404
(Laughter)

00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:43.503
But something strikes you
when you move to America

00:08:43.527 --> 00:08:44.894
and travel around the world:

00:08:44.918 --> 00:08:48.565
every education system on earth
has the same hierarchy of subjects.

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:50.492
Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.

00:08:50.516 --> 00:08:52.786
You'd think it would be
otherwise, but it isn't.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.791
At the top are mathematics and languages,
then the humanities.

00:08:55.815 --> 00:08:58.106
At the bottom are the arts.
Everywhere on earth.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.495
And in pretty much every system, too,
there's a hierarchy within the arts.

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:05.376
Art and music are normally given
a higher status in schools

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.828
than drama and dance.

00:09:06.852 --> 00:09:08.959
There isn't an education
system on the planet

00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:10.902
that teaches dance every day to children

00:09:10.926 --> 00:09:12.576
the way we teach them mathematics.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.758
Why?

00:09:13.782 --> 00:09:14.949
Why not?

00:09:14.973 --> 00:09:16.567
I think this is rather important.

00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:18.855
I think math is very important,
but so is dance.

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:21.759
Children dance all the time
if they're allowed to, we all do.

00:09:21.783 --> 00:09:24.233
We all have bodies, don't we?
Did I miss a meeting?

00:09:24.257 --> 00:09:27.621
(Laughter)

00:09:27.645 --> 00:09:29.966
Truthfully, what happens is,
as children grow up,

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.704
we start to educate them progressively
from the waist up.

00:09:32.728 --> 00:09:34.354
And then we focus on their heads.

00:09:34.378 --> 00:09:35.868
And slightly to one side.

00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:39.115
If you were to visit education as an alien

00:09:39.139 --> 00:09:42.120
and say "What's it for, public education?"

00:09:42.144 --> 00:09:44.871
I think you'd have to conclude,
if you look at the output,

00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:46.252
who really succeeds by this,

00:09:46.276 --> 00:09:47.976
who does everything they should,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.731
who gets all the brownie points,
who are the winners --

00:09:50.755 --> 00:09:53.993
I think you'd have to conclude
the whole purpose of public education

00:09:54.017 --> 00:09:55.215
throughout the world

00:09:55.239 --> 00:09:57.218
is to produce university professors.

00:09:57.718 --> 00:09:58.886
Isn't it?

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.894
They're the people who come out the top.

00:10:00.918 --> 00:10:02.737
And I used to be one, so there.

00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:06.458
(Laughter)

00:10:06.482 --> 00:10:08.082
And I like university professors,

00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:10.021
but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up

00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:12.976
as the high-water mark
of all human achievement.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.113
They're just a form of life.

00:10:15.137 --> 00:10:16.560
Another form of life.

00:10:16.584 --> 00:10:17.981
But they're rather curious.

00:10:18.005 --> 00:10:19.969
And I say this out of affection for them:

00:10:19.993 --> 00:10:22.068
there's something curious
about professors.

00:10:22.092 --> 00:10:25.838
In my experience -- not all of them,
but typically -- they live in their heads.

00:10:25.862 --> 00:10:28.005
They live up there
and slightly to one side.

00:10:28.495 --> 00:10:31.931
They're disembodied, you know,
in a kind of literal way.

00:10:31.955 --> 00:10:35.105
They look upon their body as a form
of transport for their heads.

00:10:35.129 --> 00:10:41.176
(Laughter)

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.577
Don't they?

00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:44.746
It's a way of getting
their head to meetings.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:49.998
(Laughter)

00:10:50.022 --> 00:10:53.944
If you want real evidence
of out-of-body experiences, by the way,

00:10:53.968 --> 00:10:57.443
get yourself along to a residential
conference of senior academics

00:10:57.467 --> 00:10:59.818
and pop into the discotheque
on the final night.

00:10:59.842 --> 00:11:02.454
(Laughter)

00:11:02.478 --> 00:11:03.834
And there, you will see it.

00:11:03.858 --> 00:11:08.351
Grown men and women
writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.

00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:10.867
(Laughter)

00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:14.216
Waiting until it ends, so they can
go home and write a paper about it.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.221
(Laughter)

00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:20.106
Our education system is predicated
on the idea of academic ability.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.301
And there's a reason.

00:11:21.325 --> 00:11:24.954
Around the world, there were
no public systems of education,

00:11:24.978 --> 00:11:27.085
really, before the 19th century.

00:11:27.109 --> 00:11:30.356
They all came into being
to meet the needs of industrialism.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.432
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.

00:11:32.456 --> 00:11:37.018
Number one, that the most useful
subjects for work are at the top.

00:11:37.042 --> 00:11:40.075
So you were probably steered benignly away
from things at school

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.251
when you were a kid,

00:11:41.275 --> 00:11:42.428
things you liked,

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:44.894
on the grounds you would never
get a job doing that.

00:11:44.918 --> 00:11:46.069
Is that right?

00:11:46.093 --> 00:11:48.505
"Don't do music, you're not
going to be a musician;

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:50.380
don't do art, you won't be an artist."

00:11:50.404 --> 00:11:53.150
Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.

00:11:53.174 --> 00:11:55.319
The whole world
is engulfed in a revolution.

00:11:55.343 --> 00:11:57.440
And the second is academic ability,

00:11:57.464 --> 00:12:00.283
which has really come to dominate
our view of intelligence,

00:12:00.307 --> 00:12:03.046
because the universities design
the system in their image.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.221
If you think of it,

00:12:04.245 --> 00:12:07.909
the whole system of public education
around the world is a protracted process

00:12:07.933 --> 00:12:09.084
of university entrance.

00:12:09.108 --> 00:12:11.401
And the consequence is
that many highly talented,

00:12:11.425 --> 00:12:13.943
brilliant, creative people
think they're not,

00:12:13.967 --> 00:12:16.100
because the thing
they were good at at school

00:12:16.124 --> 00:12:18.426
wasn't valued,
or was actually stigmatized.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.679
And I think we can't afford
to go on that way.

00:12:20.703 --> 00:12:22.990
In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,

00:12:23.014 --> 00:12:26.420
more people worldwide will be
graduating through education

00:12:26.444 --> 00:12:28.639
than since the beginning of history.

00:12:28.663 --> 00:12:29.820
More people.

00:12:29.844 --> 00:12:32.765
And it's the combination
of all the things we've talked about:

00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:35.182
technology and its
transformational effect on work,

00:12:35.206 --> 00:12:37.684
and demography and the huge
explosion in population.

00:12:37.708 --> 00:12:40.145
Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.

00:12:40.169 --> 00:12:41.846
Isn't that true?

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.851
When I was a student,
if you had a degree, you had a job.

00:12:44.875 --> 00:12:47.673
If you didn't have a job,
it's because you didn't want one.

00:12:47.697 --> 00:12:50.031
And I didn't want one, frankly.

00:12:50.055 --> 00:12:51.646
(Laughter)

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.475
But now kids with degrees
are often heading home

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:57.293
to carry on playing video games,

00:12:57.317 --> 00:13:00.365
because you need an MA
where the previous job required a BA,

00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:02.176
and now you need a PhD for the other.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.976
It's a process of academic inflation.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.756
And it indicates the whole structure
of education is shifting beneath our feet.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.322
We need to radically rethink
our view of intelligence.

00:13:10.346 --> 00:13:12.270
We know three things about intelligence.

00:13:12.294 --> 00:13:13.445
One, it's diverse.

00:13:13.469 --> 00:13:16.450
We think about the world in all the ways
that we experience it.

00:13:16.474 --> 00:13:19.451
We think visually, we think in sound,
we think kinesthetically.

00:13:19.475 --> 00:13:21.796
We think in abstract terms,
we think in movement.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.816
Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.

00:13:24.673 --> 00:13:26.976
If you look at the interactions
of a human brain,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.023
as we heard yesterday
from a number of presentations,

00:13:30.047 --> 00:13:32.205
intelligence is wonderfully interactive.

00:13:32.229 --> 00:13:34.467
The brain isn't divided into compartments.

00:13:34.872 --> 00:13:36.446
In fact, creativity --

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.490
which I define as the process of having
original ideas that have value --

00:13:40.514 --> 00:13:42.444
more often than not comes about

00:13:42.468 --> 00:13:46.025
through the interaction of different
disciplinary ways of seeing things.

00:13:47.472 --> 00:13:51.103
By the way, there's a shaft of nerves
that joins the two halves of the brain,

00:13:51.127 --> 00:13:52.425
called the corpus callosum.

00:13:52.449 --> 00:13:53.670
It's thicker in women.

00:13:54.471 --> 00:13:56.194
Following off from Helen yesterday,

00:13:56.218 --> 00:13:59.229
this is probably why women
are better at multitasking.

00:13:59.253 --> 00:14:01.078
Because you are, aren't you?

00:14:01.102 --> 00:14:04.436
There's a raft of research,
but I know it from my personal life.

00:14:04.865 --> 00:14:07.800
If my wife is cooking a meal
at home, which is not often ...

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:10.390
thankfully.

00:14:10.414 --> 00:14:13.104
(Laughter)

00:14:13.128 --> 00:14:14.580
No, she's good at some things.

00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:17.499
But if she's cooking,
she's dealing with people on the phone,

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:20.170
she's talking to the kids,
she's painting the ceiling --

00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:21.209
(Laughter)

00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:23.258
she's doing open-heart surgery over here.

00:14:23.282 --> 00:14:26.280
If I'm cooking, the door
is shut, the kids are out,

00:14:26.304 --> 00:14:27.543
the phone's on the hook,

00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:29.257
if she comes in, I get annoyed.

00:14:29.281 --> 00:14:32.071
I say, "Terry, please,
I'm trying to fry an egg in here."

00:14:32.095 --> 00:14:38.825
(Laughter)

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:40.454
"Give me a break."

00:14:40.478 --> 00:14:42.198
(Laughter)

00:14:42.222 --> 00:14:44.721
Actually, do you know
that old philosophical thing,

00:14:44.745 --> 00:14:48.228
"If a tree falls in a forest,
and nobody hears it, did it happen?"

00:14:48.252 --> 00:14:49.581
Remember that old chestnut?

00:14:49.605 --> 00:14:52.515
I saw a great T-shirt
recently, which said,

00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:55.976
"If a man speaks his mind in a forest,
and no woman hears him,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.396
is he still wrong?"

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:03.026
(Laughter)

00:15:05.089 --> 00:15:07.128
And the third thing about intelligence is,

00:15:07.152 --> 00:15:08.521
it's distinct.

00:15:09.114 --> 00:15:11.618
I'm doing a new book at the moment
called "Epiphany,"

00:15:11.642 --> 00:15:14.083
which is based on a series
of interviews with people

00:15:14.107 --> 00:15:15.971
about how they discovered their talent.

00:15:15.995 --> 00:15:18.116
I'm fascinated by
how people got to be there.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.331
It's really prompted by a conversation
I had with a wonderful woman

00:15:21.355 --> 00:15:24.032
who maybe most people
have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.652
Have you heard of her? Some have.

00:15:25.676 --> 00:15:28.128
She's a choreographer,
and everybody knows her work.

00:15:28.152 --> 00:15:30.168
She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."

00:15:30.192 --> 00:15:31.343
She's wonderful.

00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:34.314
I used to be on the board
of The Royal Ballet, as you can see.

00:15:34.338 --> 00:15:36.267
(Laughter)

00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:39.816
Gillian and I had lunch one day.
I said, "How did you get to be a dancer?"

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.991
It was interesting.

00:15:41.015 --> 00:15:43.262
When she was at school,
she was really hopeless.

00:15:43.286 --> 00:15:46.075
And the school, in the '30s,
wrote to her parents and said,

00:15:46.099 --> 00:15:48.134
"We think Gillian
has a learning disorder."

00:15:48.158 --> 00:15:50.256
She couldn't concentrate;
she was fidgeting.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.157
I think now they'd say she had ADHD.

00:15:52.181 --> 00:15:53.480
Wouldn't you?

00:15:53.504 --> 00:15:57.681
But this was the 1930s, and ADHD
hadn't been invented at this point.

00:15:57.705 --> 00:15:59.745
It wasn't an available condition.

00:15:59.769 --> 00:16:02.984
(Laughter)

00:16:03.008 --> 00:16:05.050
People weren't aware they could have that.

00:16:05.074 --> 00:16:07.499
(Laughter)

00:16:07.523 --> 00:16:11.699
Anyway, she went to see this specialist.

00:16:11.723 --> 00:16:15.430
So, this oak-paneled room,
and she was there with her mother,

00:16:15.454 --> 00:16:17.781
and she was led and sat
on this chair at the end,

00:16:17.805 --> 00:16:19.750
and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes,

00:16:19.774 --> 00:16:21.455
while this man talked to her mother

00:16:21.479 --> 00:16:23.943
about all the problems
Gillian was having at school,

00:16:23.967 --> 00:16:27.516
because she was disturbing people,
her homework was always late, and so on.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.691
Little kid of eight.

00:16:28.715 --> 00:16:31.626
In the end, the doctor went
and sat next to Gillian and said,

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.363
"I've listened to all these
things your mother's told me.

00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:35.981
I need to speak to her privately.

00:16:36.005 --> 00:16:38.321
Wait here. We'll be back.
We won't be very long,"

00:16:38.345 --> 00:16:40.995
and they went and left her.

00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:42.659
But as they went out of the room,

00:16:42.683 --> 00:16:45.539
he turned on the radio
that was sitting on his desk.

00:16:45.563 --> 00:16:47.201
And when they got out of the room,

00:16:47.225 --> 00:16:49.603
he said to her mother,
"Just stand and watch her."

00:16:49.627 --> 00:16:52.139
And the minute they left the room,

00:16:52.163 --> 00:16:54.758
she was on her feet, moving to the music.

00:16:54.782 --> 00:16:58.285
And they watched for a few minutes,
and he turned to her mother and said,

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:00.288
"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick.

00:17:00.312 --> 00:17:01.976
She's a dancer.

00:17:03.338 --> 00:17:04.724
Take her to a dance school."

00:17:04.748 --> 00:17:05.976
I said, "What happened?"

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.976
She said, "She did. I can't tell you
how wonderful it was.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.829
We walked in this room,
and it was full of people like me --

00:17:11.853 --> 00:17:14.075
people who couldn't sit still,

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.006
people who had to move to think."

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.862
Who had to move to think.

00:17:18.886 --> 00:17:22.496
They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;
they did modern; they did contemporary.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.266
She was eventually auditioned
for the Royal Ballet School.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.543
She became a soloist; she had
a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.

00:17:28.567 --> 00:17:31.122
She eventually graduated
from the Royal Ballet School,

00:17:31.146 --> 00:17:33.074
founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,

00:17:33.098 --> 00:17:34.335
met Andrew Lloyd Webber.

00:17:34.359 --> 00:17:35.655
She's been responsible for

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:38.827
some of the most successful
musical theater productions in history,

00:17:38.851 --> 00:17:40.447
she's given pleasure to millions,

00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:41.878
and she's a multimillionaire.

00:17:41.902 --> 00:17:45.612
Somebody else might have put her
on medication and told her to calm down.

00:17:45.636 --> 00:17:52.418
(Applause)

00:17:53.603 --> 00:17:55.176
What I think it comes to is this:

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.976
Al Gore spoke the other night

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.519
about ecology and the revolution
that was triggered by Rachel Carson.

00:18:02.257 --> 00:18:04.369
I believe our only hope for the future

00:18:04.393 --> 00:18:08.268
is to adopt a new conception
of human ecology,

00:18:08.292 --> 00:18:10.819
one in which we start
to reconstitute our conception

00:18:10.843 --> 00:18:13.104
of the richness of human capacity.

00:18:13.128 --> 00:18:16.499
Our education system has mined our minds

00:18:16.523 --> 00:18:19.964
in the way that we strip-mine the earth
for a particular commodity.

00:18:20.377 --> 00:18:22.799
And for the future, it won't serve us.

00:18:22.823 --> 00:18:24.976
We have to rethink
the fundamental principles

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.063
on which we're educating our children.

00:18:27.087 --> 00:18:29.761
There was a wonderful quote
by Jonas Salk, who said,

00:18:29.785 --> 00:18:34.882
"If all the insects
were to disappear from the Earth,

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.689
within 50 years,
all life on Earth would end.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.807
If all human beings
disappeared from the Earth,

00:18:41.831 --> 00:18:44.465
within 50 years,
all forms of life would flourish."

00:18:45.378 --> 00:18:46.663
And he's right.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:51.121
What TED celebrates is the gift
of the human imagination.

00:18:51.533 --> 00:18:55.767
We have to be careful now
that we use this gift wisely,

00:18:55.791 --> 00:18:59.020
and that we avert some of the scenarios
that we've talked about.

00:18:59.044 --> 00:19:02.799
And the only way we'll do it
is by seeing our creative capacities

00:19:02.823 --> 00:19:04.610
for the richness they are

00:19:04.634 --> 00:19:07.816
and seeing our children
for the hope that they are.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.238
And our task is to educate
their whole being,

00:19:10.262 --> 00:19:11.675
so they can face this future.

00:19:11.699 --> 00:19:14.204
By the way -- we may not see this future,

00:19:14.228 --> 00:19:15.791
but they will.

00:19:15.815 --> 00:19:18.533
And our job is to help them
make something of it.

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:19.742
Thank you very much.

00:19:19.766 --> 00:19:25.213
(Applause)
