00:00:01.996 --> 00:00:04.491
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.060
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU:
Thank you so much.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.960
Hello, Google.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.330
Afternoon.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.330
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.230
It is my fourth visit,
I think, as you said,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.300
first time in New
York City for Google.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.670
And just trying to
figure out how many

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.215
Google locations there are.

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:20.090
You helped me before.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.729
I think you said there's 70
locations in 40 countries.

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:24.270
AUDIENCE: That's
according to Google.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.853
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU:
According to Google.

00:00:25.853 --> 00:00:29.740
I mean, it's a
verifiable good source.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.100
So after I finished going to
every country in the world,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.641
I was like, maybe
I need a new quest,

00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:35.970
and maybe now I'll try to
go to every Google office.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.170
Did San Francisco, Mountain
View, Dublin, now here.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.500
Super excited to be here.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.330
I would love to share
a few stories with you.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
I'll give you four tips, four
actionable things that you

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.380
can do right away,
tonight, tomorrow

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.780
to make real improvements
in your life and work.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.190
And then we'll have
a conversation.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.560
Love to have some questions
and attempted answers,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.690
and we will hang out.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.040
So everything I do is focused
more or less around this topic

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.290
of how to find the
work you were born

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.447
to do, how to find that thing
that makes you come alive,

00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:10.280
that thing you can kind
of lose yourself in,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.825
but it's also sustainable,
something you enjoy,

00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:14.742
something that is
financially viable,

00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:16.450
and something that
you're really good at.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.620
And I'll talk about
that as we go along.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.560
But first I have a
question for some of you.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.910
Do you remember when
you were six years old

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.230
and some adult, maybe a
friend of your parents,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.190
random stranger,
teacher, asked you

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.730
this question, what do you
want to be when you grow up?

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.604
How many of you remember
your answer to that?

00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:38.730
Raise your hand.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.270
Andrew, what was your answer?

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.562
ANDREW: I wanted to be a pilot.

00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:43.186
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU:
Wanted to be a pilot.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:44.733
Did you grow up
to become a pilot?

00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:45.420
AUDIENCE: No.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.480
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: No.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.440
What was your answer?

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.890
AUDIENCE: Same.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.220
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Same.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.860
Also a pilot.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.935
Two pilots in the front row.

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:51.560
That's awesome.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.442
What was your answer?

00:01:52.442 --> 00:01:53.620
AUDIENCE: I wanted to be rich.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.300
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: You
wanted to be rich.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.380
OK.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.324
That's great.

00:01:57.324 --> 00:01:58.240
AUDIENCE: Firefighter.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.060
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Firefighter.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.936
OK.

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:00.830
AUDIENCE: I fight
different kinds of fires.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.038
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: You fight
different kinds of fires.

00:02:03.038 --> 00:02:03.570
OK.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.130
Anybody else?

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.630
Yeah.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.372
Over there?

00:02:06.372 --> 00:02:07.330
AUDIENCE: Psychologist.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.860
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Psychologist.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.711
Why did you want to be a
psychologist when you were six?

00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:13.710
AUDIENCE: Because I like
to read people's minds.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.585
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: OK.

00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:16.260
You like to read people's minds.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.364
Couple of other people.

00:02:17.364 --> 00:02:18.030
Raise your hand.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.130
Yeah, all the way in the back.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.720
A pilot.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.840
OK.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.510
This is a high pilot
audience here at Google,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.290
which I suppose makes sense.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.440
And maybe one more person.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.590
Is there anyone who
wanted to do something

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.732
totally wild and crazy?

00:02:32.732 --> 00:02:34.440
You had your hand up
and you put it down.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.790
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
be a fashion designer.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.300
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: That's cool.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.260
AUDIENCE: A wild and
crazy fashion designer.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.690
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU:
Did you grow up

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.980
to become a wild and
crazy fashion designer?

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.453
And then lastly you had your
hand raised as well, I think?

00:02:43.453 --> 00:02:44.300
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to be the president.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.750
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: You
wanted to be the president.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.930
All right.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.060
Well, there's still time.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.060
OK.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.370
So last question.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.512
Who here is doing exactly
what they imagined

00:02:53.512 --> 00:02:54.720
when they were six years old?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.386
Is there anyone?

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.130
You kind of have your
hand, like, halfway up.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.774
Did you become a psychologist?

00:03:02.774 --> 00:03:04.690
AUDIENCE: No, but I still
read people's minds.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.689
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: You
still read people's minds.

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:07.350
OK.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.660
And are you rich yet?

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.060
Still working on it?

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.940
OK.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.330
Awesome.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.250
So the interesting
thing, the curious thing,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.150
is that most of
us actually do not

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.850
know when we're six years
old, like, what we're

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.240
going to be when we grow up.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.410
Hello, everyone.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.520
Good to see you guys.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.422
This is my team from
Crown Random House.

00:03:25.422 --> 00:03:26.880
Big part of making
the book happen.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.810
So thank you guys for coming.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.020
and just a little bit
briefly about my journey.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.410
When I was six, I
had twin aspirations.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.170
There were two things
that I wanted to do.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.628
Did anyone want to
be an astronaut?

00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:43.220
People usually say that.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.721
Everybody here
wanted to be a pilot.

00:03:44.721 --> 00:03:46.095
We had three people
here who said

00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:48.470
they wanted to be a pilot
when they were six years old.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.210
So my dad worked for NASA.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.550
And when I was six years old
he took me to his office.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.895
And there was a special
lunch happening.

00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:00.800
And he gave me a task.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.532
He gave me an assignment.

00:04:02.532 --> 00:04:03.990
And now kind of
looking back, I can

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.610
see it was a fake assignment,
like a manufactured

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.960
kind of thing.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.040
But at the age of six, I
thought I was singlehandedly

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.890
responsible for the safety and
success of the space shuttle

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.610
launch.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.519
And so I completed my
task with diligence.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.579
Everything was good
for the launch.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.000
And then we went to my
favorite restaurant,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.194
which was Burger King.

00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:24.860
So when I was six
years old, Burger King

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.690
was like the greatest
place in the world.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.190
And if it was my
birthday or if I had just

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.480
saved the world, sent
the shuttle into space

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.960
successfully, or if it was
Monday or Tuesday or pretty

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.400
much any other
day, I would always

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.010
want to go to Burger King.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.690
And so when people
ask me, what do

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.260
you want to be when you grow
up, Chris, I would either say,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.584
I want to be an astronaut or
I want to work at Burger King.

00:04:47.584 --> 00:04:49.750
And the thing is I didn't
really know the difference

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:50.692
at the age of six.

00:04:50.692 --> 00:04:52.150
At the age of six
it was just like,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.665
these are too cool places.

00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:55.040
These are two
really cool things.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.581
And I didn't understand there's
actually a lot of differences

00:04:57.581 --> 00:05:01.180
here in terms of what
that career track is like,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.680
and advancement potential,
and compensation, and lots

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.860
of other things.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.740
I just knew it was these two
interesting things, right?

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.050
And so I grew up, and
I wasn't smart enough

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.970
to work for NASA--
or Google, I should

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.040
say-- but at a certain
point, I realized

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.020
that a career in fast
food probably wasn't

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.520
the best choice for me either.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.730
And so I did a lot
different things.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.860
I started a series
of small businesses.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.540
I always worked
for myself, mostly

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.890
because I wasn't that good
at working for other people.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.360
I was very motivated in doing
something that I believed in,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.100
but it was kind of hard
for me to do something that

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.220
wasn't my vision or my idea.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.440
And started traveling
at a certain point.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.300
I lived in Sierra
Leone and Liberia

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.520
for about four years as an aid
worker after a civil war there.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.580
And started going to
lots of other countries.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.670
And then, as you
heard, eventually

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.354
started this travel
quest of going

00:05:57.354 --> 00:05:59.020
to every country in
the world, which was

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.010
about a 10- or 11-year journey.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.840
At a certain point, I started
writing about it on the blog

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.230
The Art Of Nonconformity,
and eventually the books.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.920
And as part of this
whole process--

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.480
wasn't really
strategic, it was just

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.360
much more of an
organic thing-- but as

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.130
part of this process, everything
I do now, one way or another,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.670
is kind of focused on this
aspect of community building.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.220
And when I say
community building,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.330
it's not so much a top
down kind of thing.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.150
It's not so much about me giving
people tools and resources

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.116
as it is about bringing
like-minded people together,

00:06:32.116 --> 00:06:33.740
forging connections,
and kind of seeing

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.637
how we can support one another.

00:06:35.637 --> 00:06:37.470
So I'm really interested
in this convergence

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.390
between a big dream,
like following

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.320
a big dream or a
passion of your own,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.170
like mine was to go to
every country in the world,

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.740
and also contributing
something, some act of service.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.990
So I like to kind of bring
people together and support

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.270
them in their quest as well.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.480
So this was kind of a
long and winding road.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.410
It wasn't a strategy.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.130
And your journey was
probably different from mine.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.330
But you, too, had
to make choices,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.830
and you, too, had
to make decisions.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.700
And many of you are
probably still making

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.660
decisions at different times.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.140
And we kind of go through life
and we navigate this process

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.617
with limited information.

00:07:15.617 --> 00:07:18.200
So we don't actually know what
everything is going to be like.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.360
We have to make
these decisions that

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.970
are going to set
things in motion

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.910
for several years
or even longer.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.490
And we often make these
decisions under what

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.150
I call a haze of uncertainty.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.286
So it's like, well, I think I
know what it's like to do this,

00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:33.410
and maybe I'm good at this.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.310
Maybe I took a skills test,
or maybe my guidance counselor

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.020
suggested this to me.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.370
Or maybe I had a
friend who did this.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.470
But I don't really know
until I start doing it.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.970
I don't really know
until I actually

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.010
start going down that road.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.620
And so what a lot
of us end up doing,

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.910
or at least what a lot
of people end up doing,

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.720
is settling, or making
some kind of compromise.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.595
And we all have to make
compromises in life.

00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:00.970
But this is kind of a central
compromise of saying, like,

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.410
OK, I'm going to either choose
between work that I really

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.330
love, or a life that
I love, and the job

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.310
is going to be kind
of a means to an end,

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.670
but I'm not going to be
able to do both things.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.215
I'm either going to have the
job as a means to an end,

00:08:14.215 --> 00:08:16.173
or I'm going to pursue
something I love but I'm

00:08:16.173 --> 00:08:17.570
going to be poor, et cetera.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.360
And that's not really the goal.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.520
I mean, obviously, Googlers
interested in self-improvement,

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.340
interested in
continuous improvement.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.116
The goal is essentially to have
both, your money and your life,

00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:30.490
and also one more
thing that I'll

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.590
tell you about in a moment.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.620
But first, I talked about
this non-linear journey

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.309
that I went on.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.559
And over the past
three years I've

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.320
been looking at people from
all different walks of life

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.780
who have found or created what
they call their dream job.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.144
And I kind of wanted to extract,
what are the commonalities

00:08:52.144 --> 00:08:52.810
of these people?

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.643
Because they're very
different in some ways.

00:08:54.643 --> 00:08:56.890
We did this comprehensive
research study.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.420
We looked at men and women,
different backgrounds,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.250
different ages, different
kinds of careers.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.980
What do they have in common?

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.210
And one thing I saw
almost immediately

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.260
is that almost none of
them follow a linear path.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.330
Almost all of them have this
kind of long and winding road.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.724
Almost all of them go
down different paths.

00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:18.140
And then they
aren't afraid-- this

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.390
is a key point-- they aren't
afraid to kind of go down

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.024
a path for awhile and
take a step back and say,

00:09:23.024 --> 00:09:24.440
actually, I thought
this was good,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.000
but I'm actually do
something different.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.370
So there's this old poem
about the road not taken

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.950
by Robert Frost, how
two roads diverge

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.290
in a woods and the traveler
has to make a choice.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.620
Do I go down this road,
do I go down that one?

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.862
In that poem, he
says, you know, I

00:09:40.862 --> 00:09:42.570
chose the road less
traveled by, and that

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.550
has made all the difference.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.780
So one way to think
of that is, OK, he

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.240
chose the right road, right?

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.450
That road made all the
difference, that choice.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:56.031
But what we don't know is
what was down the other road.

00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:57.030
What was the other path?

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.270
What was that story?

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.170
And maybe that path was
just as good, right?

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.610
Maybe that path was even better.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.276
We just don't know
because we don't know

00:10:04.276 --> 00:10:05.630
the other part of the story.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:10.490
So I saw that these people who
identified with his dream job

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.770
concept, they
talked about things

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.217
like, I would go to work even
if I didn't get paid for it.

00:10:15.217 --> 00:10:16.550
That's how much I believe in it.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.160
But thankfully I
do get paid for it.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.440
Hopefully maybe some of you
could say that same thing.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.930
But what I saw is that
not only do they go down

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.090
a lot of different
paths, they also

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.430
weren't afraid to make mistakes.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.680
And when they made
mistakes, it wasn't

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.730
just that the mistakes were OK.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.600
It wasn't that it just
turned out all right.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.974
It was actually
that the mistakes

00:10:35.974 --> 00:10:39.710
could be beneficial
for them, because they

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.980
made decisions, like all of us
do, with limited information.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.750
And as they went
down different paths

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.470
and sometimes made mistakes,
sometimes had success,

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.990
all of these things gave
them more information

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.150
to make better decisions
as they went along.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.630
So I thought that
was interesting.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.790
One of the people I
looked at it in the book

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.190
was a successful working actor.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.950
She had done a lot of regional
theater across the country.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.620
She had been on
several TV shows.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.140
And then she kind of
went down a winding road

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.750
to make a career change.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.630
She said acting was good, but
she wanted something different.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.391
And I really like this quote.

00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:16.640
She said she was kind of
going in search of something.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.080
She didn't really
even know what it was.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.830
But she didn't find it
through a eureka moment.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.730
It was a process
of discovery that

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.870
led her to something that
provided the autonomy that she

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.750
craved.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.740
So it was a very
values-based journey.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.180
It wasn't like, here's my goal.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.170
What do I need to do
to make that happen?

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.474
It was, here's my value,
autonomy, freedom,

00:11:37.474 --> 00:11:38.015
independence.

00:11:38.015 --> 00:11:40.360
I want the ability to choose.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.224
And that kind of led
her along the way.

00:11:42.224 --> 00:11:43.640
Lots of different
twists and turns

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.670
before she found something
that she liked even better.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.580
So even though people want to
do a lot of different things,

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.360
different professions and
vocations, most of us,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.600
if we're on this kind of
course for a dream job,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.520
there are three qualities
that every dream job has.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.270
This is true in
entrepreneurship.

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.880
This is true if you're
working for a company, people

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.770
working in non-profits.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.440
Everybody who's
really successful--

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.730
and when I say successful,
I mean your own definition

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.300
of success, whatever
success means to you.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.400
It can mean different
things to different people.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.140
But let's say purposeful,
let's say fulfilled.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.390
They all have this
quality of joy.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.520
They're doing something
that they love to do.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.980
It's not quite like
following your passion.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.490
It's doing something
that you love,

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.730
and it also integrates
with other qualities.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.340
Second quality is what I
mentioned before, money.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.310
Something that is
financially viable,

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.420
something that is sustainable.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:42.940
And the third quality is
flow, or essentially something

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.400
that you do really
well, something

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.150
that uses your skills in a
unique way, the kind of work

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.084
that you can really
get lost in, the kind

00:12:50.084 --> 00:12:52.250
of work that makes you come
alive, the kind of thing

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.649
you do where you're like,
the hours kind of go by

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:56.940
and I don't really see where
they went because I was so

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.370
immersed in this thing.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.184
So I like what I do,
it's sustainable,

00:13:00.184 --> 00:13:02.350
and I'm actually doing
something I'm really good at.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.280
And people who are
successful-- again,

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.970
by your own
definition, people who

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.220
are purposeful-- they work
toward the intersection

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.180
of all three of these qualities.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.450
They work to find not just
one of them, not just two,

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.420
but actually all three.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.820
And if we think about people
who are really successful--

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.150
maybe even some famous people.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.649
We can kind of look
from the outside

00:13:23.649 --> 00:13:25.160
and say, OK, they're
clearly doing

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.380
what they were born to do.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.450
Maybe there's more
than one path.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.680
Maybe they could have done
something different themselves.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.470
But they didn't.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.280
Beyonce could have
been a dentist,

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.460
could've been an accountant.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.360
Roger Federer could have been
a Swiss watchmaker or something

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.500
else.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.584
And that might have been
fine, but not necessarily

00:13:46.584 --> 00:13:48.500
the work they were born
to do, not necessarily

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.270
the pinnacle of a career or a
whole industry, where all of us

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.220
can look at them
and say, clearly

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:55.830
doing something that's
amazing and fantastic and very

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:56.670
fulfilling.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.550
And it's not just
about celebrities.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.080
You can probably think
of someone that you know.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.700
My editor Talia Krohn is
here from Random House.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.630
She gave me this great example
that we use in the book.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.100
She said, you know,
it's almost like

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.130
when you run into somebody that
you knew back in high school

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.550
and you haven't
kept up with them.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.220
So five years go by, 10
years, 20 years whatever.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.120
And you run into them and you
hear what they're doing now.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.900
And you're like, that
makes perfect sense.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.900
I can look back to them
when they were teenagers

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.630
or young, whatever, and
I can see these traits

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.630
that were in their life.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.870
And now I can see, of
course she became a doctor.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.370
Of course he became an engineer.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.290
Makes perfect sense.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.700
That's totally the work
that they were born to do.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.860
They've work closely to get
close to the intersection

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.050
of joy, money, and flow.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.450
And the second big
lesson, second thing

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.640
that kind of emerged
through all the research,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.930
is it's not just about
the kind of profession

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.400
we hold, the kind of
vocation, what we actually do,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.610
that leads to success
and happiness.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:01.124
It's the working environment
or the working conditions.

00:15:01.124 --> 00:15:02.665
It's actually how
we do our work that

00:15:02.665 --> 00:15:05.889
is just as important as the
content or the type of work.

00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:07.680
And this is really
critical, because almost

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.990
all career-based education,
almost all skill training,

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.860
focuses on vocation
or on profession,

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.697
like here's the ideal
profession for you.

00:15:16.697 --> 00:15:18.280
When you're six years
old, what do you

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.446
want to be when you grow up?

00:15:19.446 --> 00:15:21.170
And we identify professions.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.150
When you're going
to go and study,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.550
I'm going to choose
the field of study that

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.450
leads to a certain profession.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.680
If you're a bit
older, then you're

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.620
going to take on a second
act or a third act,

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:32.640
do something different.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.600
You're always thinking
in terms of professions.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.110
But what's just as important
is to understand, OK,

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.770
how do I do my ideal work?

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.630
And how can I create
the conditions

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.142
that work best for me?

00:15:42.142 --> 00:15:43.850
So working conditions
are things like how

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.940
you like to spend your time,
your ideal schedule, where you

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.180
like to do your work, how you
like to be rewarded, motivated,

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.920
compensated-- it's different
for different people--

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.490
how collaborative you
are, how much you like

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.370
to work with other people
versus how much you

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.770
like to work on your own.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.280
Pretty much all of us like to
do some of both of those things.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.707
But the range is tremendous.

00:16:07.707 --> 00:16:10.040
Some people really want much
more of a social structure.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.123
Some people really want
much more independent time

00:16:12.123 --> 00:16:13.949
to carve out and
create something.

00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:16.365
So all these different factors
that are working conditions

00:16:16.365 --> 00:16:19.780
that lead to the environment in
which we do our best work or we

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.340
don't, in which we feel
supported or we don't.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.594
And the goal is to find
the right kind of work

00:16:27.594 --> 00:16:29.510
in the right kind of
working conditions, which

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.000
is very individual.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.060
What we're looking for,
right kind of work,

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.960
right kind of
working conditions.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.730
If you have a job that
you believe in-- good job,

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.180
you like what you do--
but the conditions are not

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.100
good for you, you have a
boss that's overly negative,

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.810
you have a conflict with
one of your colleagues,

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.695
the schedule doesn't
work for your needs--

00:16:47.695 --> 00:16:48.820
it's going to be stressful.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:50.444
It doesn't matter
that it's a good job.

00:16:50.444 --> 00:16:52.420
You're going to be
stressed in that situation.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:54.628
On the other hand, you could
have really good working

00:16:54.628 --> 00:16:57.750
conditions, you could have
the best possible environment,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.516
but if you're not actually doing
something that you believe in,

00:17:00.516 --> 00:17:02.606
then you're going
to be unfulfilled.

00:17:02.606 --> 00:17:03.980
You're going to
look and say, OK,

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.730
I have this good environment,
but I'm not actually

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.660
part of something that's
bigger than myself.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.089
I don't believe in this mission.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.778
It's fine for a while, but
it's not actually really making

00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:12.569
me feel purposeful.

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:16.066
So the goal is,
right kind of work,

00:17:16.066 --> 00:17:17.440
right kind of
working conditions,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.019
engaging content,
good conditions.

00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:21.560
If you're try to
figure out, OK, what

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.500
are my ideal working
conditions, then you

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.270
can go to the website
bornforthisbook.com.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.156
You can take a free quiz.

00:17:27.156 --> 00:17:28.780
You don't have to
register or anything.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.900
You're going to
answer 14 questions

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.150
and it's going to give you
a very specific personality

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.060
type along with some clear
recommendations and strategies

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:36.820
for you.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.950
This isn't going to tell
you to change your job.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.690
It's going to tell you
how to adapt your working

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.023
conditions and the kind of
work, the kind of environment

00:17:43.023 --> 00:17:45.750
under which you'll thrive.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.640
So I said I'll give you four
actions, four specific things

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.930
you can do today,
tomorrow, going forward.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.170
First thing is, we talked
about this model of joy, money,

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.630
and flow, the three qualities
of any successful dream

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.400
job, anyone who feels like
they've won the career lottery.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.970
And as much as possible,
wherever you can make decisions

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.480
based on this
model, big decision,

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.560
small decisions, the
happier you will be.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.190
I understand that not
everybody-- almost no one-- has

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.516
100% autonomy over their time.

00:18:16.516 --> 00:18:18.140
Even if you're
completely self-employed

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.900
you don't have 100% autonomy.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.870
But wherever you
do have autonomy,

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.230
wherever you can make
choice, you think about this.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.620
You think about what I
love to do, what is viable,

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.250
and what I'm really good at.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.972
Here's a very simple thing.

00:18:29.972 --> 00:18:30.930
All of you can do this.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.800
I try to answer this
question every day.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.400
At the end of the day,
I take out my journal,

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.950
or if you're not a
journaling person,

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.540
you can use a Post-It note.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.330
You probably do it digitally.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:45.250
And you answer this
question, did today matter?

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.760
And I believe when all
of us do that, we're

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.640
going to know the
answer to that question.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.126
You answer it in your own way
based on your own evaluation,

00:18:52.126 --> 00:18:54.500
based on your own standard,
what you think success to be.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.960
And I think if you look
back, you'll be able to say,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:01.970
OK, today I actually made
progress on my goals.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.840
I got a little bit closer to
that thing I'm working toward.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.350
I also was in good
harmony with people.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.320
I invested in the relationships
that are important to me.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.820
Good day.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.860
Today mattered.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:18.080
Or you might look back and say,
actually, it wasn't that great.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.480
It started kind of poorly.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.910
There was some problem
or some conflict.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.050
Then I just behind, I was just
responding to things all day.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.531
I didn't really create anything.

00:19:26.531 --> 00:19:28.030
Like I was at work
for all this time

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.500
but I don't actually
know what I did.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.640
All of us have bad
days, like that happens.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.737
But the goal, the goal is a
streak of days that matter.

00:19:37.737 --> 00:19:39.570
The goal is being able
to say over and over,

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.880
yes, you know, today mattered.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.890
Maybe it had some challenge.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.060
Maybe it had some problem.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.180
There was some obstacle.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.840
It wasn't perfect,
but today mattered.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.780
And when we answer
that question,

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.640
we're going to begin to
identify over and over,

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.950
what are the qualities
that lead us to say,

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.367
OK, today was a
day that mattered?

00:19:54.367 --> 00:19:56.533
And we're going to do more
and more of those things.

00:19:56.533 --> 00:19:58.730
What are the activities
that gave me energy today?

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.760
What are the activities
that drained my energy?

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.135
How can I do more
of those things

00:20:02.135 --> 00:20:05.410
wherever I do have a choice?

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.340
Second recommendation that
I've been talking with people

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.170
about all over the
country-- and I'll

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:14.010
be very careful in talking
about it here-- is I

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:18.630
have seen over and over that
wherever people are employed,

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.860
even when they
love their job, it

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.180
can be tremendously empowering
for them to have something

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.750
on the side that they do,
some kind of side business,

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.930
some kind of additional project.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.390
Even if it's not
something that is bringing

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.070
in a tremendous
amount of money, it

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.080
can be disproportionately
satisfying

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.064
and disproportionately
rewarding.

00:20:37.064 --> 00:20:38.980
I get emails all the
time from people who say,

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.320
I was never an entrepreneur.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.410
I don't even want to
be an entrepreneur.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.970
I'm not sure that's my thing.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.002
So I started this little
project, or I made some arts

00:20:46.002 --> 00:20:47.460
and crafts and I
sold them on Etsy.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.860
Or I started this
consulting thing that

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.196
has nothing to do with my job.

00:20:50.196 --> 00:20:51.070
There's no conflicts.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.778
I just do it on the
weekend or something.

00:20:52.778 --> 00:20:55.000
But I signed my first client.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.530
It was fantastic.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.920
So in the book I have a
number of stories about this.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.370
Some of them are like
this guy, Benny Shu,

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.521
from Jacksonville,
Florida, who had started

00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:04.770
a bunch of different projects.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.853
And some of them kind of
took off and some of them

00:21:06.853 --> 00:21:08.650
didn't, which is totally normal.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:11.450
But eventually he got a
project designing t-shirts

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.550
and selling them through online
ads on Google and Facebook.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.951
And within a year he
was earning more money

00:21:16.951 --> 00:21:19.450
from that side business than
he was in his day job as an app

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.540
developer.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.740
So in his case, he did quit
his job and go kind of full

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.420
into that project.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.640
I also hear from people
who have a side hustle

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.780
and kind of build that out,
and it becomes successful.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.280
And then they have
to make a choice.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.529
OK, I do I do that or do I
kind of remain with my job?

00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:37.940
And sometimes people choose
to stay with their job.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.170
And they say, actually,
I like the side project,

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.812
but the kind of work
that I'm doing in my job

00:21:43.812 --> 00:21:46.020
is very different, and I
have a different environment

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.478
and I'm working
with people I like,

00:21:47.478 --> 00:21:48.990
and I'm going to
keep doing that.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.850
And I think that's a great place
to be as well, because when

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.090
you have the other thing
and it's going well,

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.600
you don't have to go to work.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.210
You're going to work every day
because you want to go to work,

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.250
not because you have to.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.880
And I think that's
an ideal situation

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.572
not just for an employee,
but also for an employer,

00:22:04.572 --> 00:22:06.780
to have their people coming
to work because they want

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.155
to be there,
because they believe

00:22:08.155 --> 00:22:10.350
in the value of the mission.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.180
People often talk about, how
do I find the time to do this?

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.080
And what I always
say to people when

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.000
I'm speaking to other audiences
is, well, we're all busy.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.180
Everybody has lots
of commitments.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.940
But when you're
busy, in some cases

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.340
that can be a benefit,
because you have limited time.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.030
You have to make
that time count.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.640
You don't have 40,
50 hours open to you.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.557
You can't be on 12
different social networks.

00:22:32.557 --> 00:22:34.640
You can't start a whole
bunch of different things.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.710
You've got to focus on
the things that matter.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.418
And there's some more
information on that

00:22:38.418 --> 00:22:42.660
if you go to the website
and register the book.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.190
Third recommendation.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:50.390
If you already know, I am
expert in this one thing,

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:53.999
and I'm a specialized
expert, I know more

00:22:53.999 --> 00:22:55.790
about this than anybody
else, that's great.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.470
That's wonderful.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.220
But a lot of people,
even in companies,

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.020
even in technical careers,
feel this pressure

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.170
to know what that thing is.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.260
And they don't always know
because they haven't gone down

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:07.810
enough roads.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:08.950
They don't have
enough experience.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.220
And maybe even if
they've gone down roads,

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.240
maybe there's something
else out there.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.930
So you don't have
to choose a niche.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.917
And I've seen lots
of successful people

00:23:15.917 --> 00:23:18.000
who've been able to kind
of craft a career in more

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.390
than one interest.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.640
And sometimes they're
focused, and sometimes they've

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.306
actually been able
to choose a direction

00:23:23.306 --> 00:23:25.170
and combine two or
three different things.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.980
We can look at some celebrities
again, just briefly.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.470
Richard Branson started more
than 80 different companies

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.740
across a range of industries.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.240
Record label, airline, soda
company, cosmetics, fashion,

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.127
newspapers, magazines.

00:23:41.127 --> 00:23:43.460
His first business was actually
selling Christmas trees.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.085
I don't know how many
people knew that.

00:23:45.085 --> 00:23:48.010
Probably no one, because
it wasn't successful.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:51.330
It's kind of a
seasonal business.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.100
But all these
different businesses

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.750
weren't really linked,
by industry, at least.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.450
It was a very
values-guided business,

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:00.600
just like Laura's approach
to finding her ideal career

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.370
was a values-based journey.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:07.410
Oprah has influenced millions
of people all over the world

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:12.810
and has been a leader in
media, entertainment, but also

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:16.891
business, spirituality,
wellness, self-care,

00:24:16.891 --> 00:24:18.140
all kinds of different things.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.710
She's very good
at what she does,

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:21.400
but it wasn't just one thing.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.800
She kind of honed a career
around multiple interests

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.100
and multiple focuses.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.522
And so you, too-- just
as we said earlier--

00:24:28.522 --> 00:24:30.730
you can probably think of
someone else that you know.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.820
It's not just about
celebrities or famous people.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.194
You can probably
think of someone

00:24:34.194 --> 00:24:36.180
that you know who
has been able to be

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.970
successful without focusing on
one hyper-specialized, focused

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:41.540
thing.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.410
You don't have to
choose a niche.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.670
And here's my last
recommendation.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.900
If something isn't working
in your life or your work,

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.360
I think you should
stop doing it.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:00.090
And we are told over and over
in this entrepreneurial age

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:03.920
we live in, which has lots
of good qualities in it--

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.620
but in particular the western
mindset of manifest destiny

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:14.310
and pioneering-- has this
belief that winners never quit.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.380
And what I saw through
all my research

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.330
and talking with lots
of different people

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.590
is that winners
quit all the time.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.110
Winners aren't afraid to
walk away from something.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.900
Winners aren't afraid to say,
I actually went down this path

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.750
and it wasn't the right path.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.590
Or maybe it was the
right path for a time,

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.530
but now I want
something different.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.700
I'm going to change it up.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.730
So part of the
conventional wisdom,

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.529
especially in terms of careers
and business education--

00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:41.570
conventional wisdom, you've
probably heard this--

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:46.000
is that persistence is the most
important predictor of success.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.250
And I don't think that's true.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:50.580
I think that flexibility
and adaptation

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.567
are the most important
predictors of success,

00:25:52.567 --> 00:25:54.150
being willing to
kind of change it up.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:58.580
So here's one story
to illustrate this.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.190
This is a story called
"Three Feet from Gold."

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:06.810
In 1851, California
Gold Rush, a prospector

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:10.610
moves across the country and
buys a small plot of land.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.990
And every day for
weeks, months, years,

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:17.440
some long period of time,
he's panning for gold.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.370
And he's unsuccessful.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:23.180
Every day no gold, kind of
running out his life savings.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.510
So finally one day, he
sells the plot of land

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.010
to somebody else for a
small amount of money.

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:32.790
And the very next day after
that the new guy strikes gold

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:36.590
just three feet from where
the first guy gave up.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.530
So the way this
story is always told,

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:44.340
the lesson is, first
guy gave up too soon.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.990
If only he had kept going.

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.321
And this story,
or even this myth,

00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:51.570
is kind of perpetrated in
all kinds of success stories

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.330
that we hear about someone who
fails 10 times, 25 times, et

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.490
cetera, only to succeed
on the 26th time.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:01.910
So the lesson is, first guy
shouldn't have given up.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.090
Even back in 1851 this was
a popular meme on Snapchat

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.750
getting lots of views.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.850
Everybody was like, first guy
shouldn't have abandoned ship.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.580
But just like we don't know
what would have happened

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.210
on that other path we started
with in the beginning,

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.660
we don't know what happened
with the first prospector.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.160
First of all, there
was no guarantee

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.771
he was going to strike it rich.

00:27:23.771 --> 00:27:26.020
It's actually quite likely
that he wouldn't because he

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:27.190
had done it over and over.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:28.780
He was doing the same thing.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.010
He wasn't getting
different results.

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:35.010
And secondly, we don't know
what he did after that,

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.470
after he sold the plot of land.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.167
Maybe he went on
to a better life.

00:27:38.167 --> 00:27:39.500
Maybe he found a different path.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.520
Maybe started a
shovel-selling business

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.640
for all the other prospectors
who were heading west.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.480
And so I don't think you should
give up on your life dream.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.350
I don't think you should give
up on your ultimate vision.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.790
But I think the best lesson is,
you should always keep trying,

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.660
but you should try again
in a different way,

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.960
and you shouldn't
try the same thing.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.360
And if something
isn't working, then

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.485
don't be afraid to give up.

00:28:03.619 --> 00:28:05.160
How many of you have
bought a lottery

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.780
ticket in the past few months,
let's say, past three months?

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.875
Andrew, why'd you buy
the lottery ticket?

00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:14.250
ANDREW: Because the jackpot
was, like, a billion dollars.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:14.450
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU:
Because the jackpot was,

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:15.679
like, a billion dollars.

00:28:15.679 --> 00:28:16.220
That's right.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.560
Why'd you buy-- because
you wanted to be rich.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.900
You said that earlier.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.570
Did it work out?

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:21.000
AUDIENCE: Nope.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.874
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: OK.

00:28:21.874 --> 00:28:23.650
Anybody else?

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.675
Any other reason for
buying a lottery ticket

00:28:25.675 --> 00:28:26.797
that I haven't covered?

00:28:26.797 --> 00:28:28.880
Is there anyone here who
bought the lottery ticket

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.135
expecting to win, like, you
were putting all your hopes

00:28:32.135 --> 00:28:32.940
and dreams on that?

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.510
Probably not.

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:37.920
So there's this belief--
another conventional belief

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:42.010
is that playing the
lottery is not rational.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:45.410
And I think investing
your life savings

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:48.270
in playing the lottery
is not rational for sure.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.670
But most of us, when we
buy the Powerball ticket

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.870
for a small amount of money,
we don't really expect to win.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.350
We're not crushed when
it doesn't happen.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:58.750
We're investing in a dream.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.230
We're spending a few dollars
to have this little fantasy

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.120
of what would life be like
if I won the billion dollars

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.750
or whatever it was?

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:06.630
And then it's OK.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.440
We kind of go on.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.890
So the thing about
the lottery is,

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.210
the lottery is not hackable.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:13.400
There's nothing we can do.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.730
There's no tips.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.775
There's no tricks, nothing we
can do to increase our odds.

00:29:17.775 --> 00:29:20.140
It's a completely
randomized game.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.640
But the career
lottery is hackable.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.340
There are things we can do.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.970
There are strategies
we can learn.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.720
There are things
that we can adopt.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.620
There's actions that we can
take that will improve our odds,

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.060
that will kind of increase
our chances of success

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.340
as we choose it, that
will help us find better

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.660
working conditions, that
will help us have more joy,

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:42.530
more money, and more
flow in our life.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.110
So there's this Steve Jobs
quote that some of you

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:51.750
probably have heard in
thinking about life purpose

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.700
and thinking about the work
that you were born to do.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.460
He said, "You can't connect
the dots looking forward.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.460
You can only connect
them looking backward.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.170
And you have to trust
that the dots will somehow

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.820
connect in your future."

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:06.320
I

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.540
And I like that
quote, but I think

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.620
it's not just about trusting.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.340
It's not just about
being a passive observer

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.060
in this process.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.660
It's about taking
strategic action.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.600
It's about
understanding, OK, how

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.460
can I find joy, money,
and flow in my life?

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.130
How can I have more
days that matter?

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.420
How can I build out
that streak in my life?

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.940
What are the ideal
working conditions for me?

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.760
How can I do my best work?

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.390
How can I create more
security for myself

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:36.330
so that I can be
a better employee,

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.905
but also continue to invest
in myself for the future,

00:30:38.905 --> 00:30:40.780
because no one will ever
care about my career

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.960
more than I will.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.502
How can I truly understand, OK,
what is this thing out there?

00:30:45.502 --> 00:30:47.376
And there's more than
one path, but how can I

00:30:47.376 --> 00:30:48.390
go down different paths?

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:49.730
How can I do that?

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.260
And so it's not just
about passively observing.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.760
It's about making
active decisions

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.560
and building a bridge
from one dot to another.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:02.910
So we talked about
joy, money, flow.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.030
We talked about how I
think everyone should learn

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.300
to think entrepreneurially
even if you don't

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.760
want to be an entrepreneur.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.990
That's the whole concept
of the side hustle,

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:14.960
creating more
confidence and security.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.060
If you are a specialized
expert in something,

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.995
which probably some of
you are, that's wonderful.

00:31:19.995 --> 00:31:21.870
But if you're good at
a few different things,

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.390
that's also OK,
and people can be

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.020
successful in more than one way.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.199
And if something
isn't working, then I

00:31:29.199 --> 00:31:30.490
think you should stop doing it.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.810
So I am super happy and honored
and excited to come back

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:37.580
to Google for my fourth visit.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:42.800
I'll look forward to going
to the other 64, 66 locations

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.500
that you mentioned.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.880
And if you remember only
one thing from this time

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.460
that we've shared,
you might remember

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.830
that there's a very high
percentage of pilots here

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.180
in this audience, or at
least aspirational pilots.

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.340
You might remember that the
lottery is not hackable,

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.940
the career lottery is.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.140
But I would say if you
only remember one thing,

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:08.400
remember that it's
OK to make mistakes.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.010
And not just is it
OK to make mistakes,

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.210
but the mistakes can
actually inform our thinking.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:15.430
The mistakes can be beneficial.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.490
They can help us to
make better decisions

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.070
as we go down different paths.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:22.010
So making active choices is
almost always a good decision

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.470
even if we make
the wrong choice.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.980
So if there is one thing
that you are meant to do

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.350
or born to do, I hope
that you do everything

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:34.890
you can to find that or discover
it or create it and bring it

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.440
into light, make it
happen for yourself.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.880
And I hope you win the lottery.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.862
Thank you, Google.

00:32:40.862 --> 00:32:43.811
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:43.811 --> 00:32:45.602
MALE SPEAKER: If anybody
has any questions,

00:32:45.602 --> 00:32:48.227
I'll bring around
the microphone.

00:32:48.227 --> 00:32:49.060
AUDIENCE: Hi, Chris.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.320
Thanks for being here.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.370
My name's [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.840
You mentioned the
word success and you

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.240
said it means different
things to different people.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.060
I'm curious, you've
obviously described

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.600
what success kind of is to
you, the three parts to that.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.550
But if you're thinking of
the word success, who are

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.220
some people that you think of?

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:10.730
And why do you think
they're successful?

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.816
And what makes them successful
outside of just those three

00:33:13.816 --> 00:33:15.440
things, or it could
those three things?

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.648
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Sure, sure.

00:33:16.648 --> 00:33:20.575
I mean, I think those are
descriptors of success.

00:33:20.575 --> 00:33:21.950
Those are qualities.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:25.060
Those aren't necessarily,
this is what success is.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.910
So I guess I think
for myself, and what

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:29.542
I see in a lot of other
people-- and perhaps some people

00:33:29.542 --> 00:33:31.250
will relate to this,
maybe not everyone--

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:34.750
but I think of success
as continuously

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.020
improving your circumstances.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.290
We're all on a journey.

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.250
We've all had circumstance and
luck and fortune in some ways

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.740
that have led us to we are.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:44.960
We've all had privilege
that's affected our lives

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.650
and given us opportunities
that others don't have.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.540
But yet we've also kind
of made choices as well.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.020
And so when I look at people
that have influenced me,

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.780
or people in my
community, I guess

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.150
what I see is they're
striving, essentially.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:02.890
And the previous book
that you mentioned,

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.316
"The Happiness of Pursuit," it
was very much about striving.

00:34:06.316 --> 00:34:08.690
It was about looking at this
concept of going on a quest,

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.190
whether a physical
quest like I did,

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.002
with going to every
country, or lots

00:34:12.002 --> 00:34:13.710
of people that did
other kinds of quests,

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.429
academic quests, different
kinds of things, explorations.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.655
And there was this
quality of striving in it.

00:34:19.655 --> 00:34:21.030
There was this
quality of, here's

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.409
the thing I'm reaching toward.

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:23.386
It's bigger than me.

00:34:23.386 --> 00:34:24.969
It's going to require
something of me.

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:26.659
I'm going to be
changed through it.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:29.398
So I think that is
an important factor.

00:34:29.398 --> 00:34:30.772
AUDIENCE: And is
there any person

00:34:30.772 --> 00:34:34.000
that you can think of that
you think embodies that?

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.250
I know you've mentioned a few.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:36.210
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Sure.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:38.719
You know, I don't think of a
lot of-- I mentioned a couple

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.070
celebrities.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.320
But I try to be really
careful in the books and all

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:42.850
of my work.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.600
For the most part, I actually
don't look at celebrities.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.469
I don't look at famous people.

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:46.600
I can't say, here
are give people

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.308
that I think are
successful, because what

00:34:48.308 --> 00:34:51.600
I'm trying to do is look at
a lot of different people

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.580
representative of
the population,

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.449
and so that if
you read the book,

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:57.624
you're able to say,
OK, maybe I don't

00:34:57.624 --> 00:34:59.040
identify with this
person's story,

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:00.374
but I identify with this one.

00:35:00.374 --> 00:35:02.040
I'm not just reading
the author's story.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.850
I'm not just reading
some famous person.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:04.810
I'm reading all these
different people.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.393
So I don't really
think of one person.

00:35:06.393 --> 00:35:07.671
I think of a lot of people.

00:35:07.671 --> 00:35:08.170
Thank you.

00:35:18.547 --> 00:35:19.380
AUDIENCE: Hi, Chris.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:21.490
My name's Michele.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.570
So amongst all the
people that you've

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:27.950
spoken to throughout your career
and researching this book, lots

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:31.420
of creative people, they've
gone down different paths

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.110
and then pivoted.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:37.620
I'm interested to know
about the value of intuition

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:41.760
in people's decision making
or your own, any insights

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.850
you can offer.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:43.808
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Yeah.

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:44.940
That's a great question.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.740
I feel like maybe you have some
insider opinion of your own

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.000
to share as well.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.661
So I do very much believe in
the value of intuition or gut

00:35:53.661 --> 00:35:54.160
thinking.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:58.500
And I think it comes in
in particular use when

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.310
we come to these choices of,
OK, I could go left or right,

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:03.980
and maybe I've already
done this analysis.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.380
I've done as much fact-based,
objective-based analysis

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.440
that I could and I
still can't decide.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.140
That's why I think it's
helpful to ask things like,

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.730
what gives you energy?

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:15.935
What drains your energy?

00:36:15.935 --> 00:36:17.560
It sounds kind of
woo-woo but it's not.

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.689
A very practical question.

00:36:18.689 --> 00:36:20.730
You can really look and
identify, OK, I did this.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:21.230
I did this.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.800
This is how it makes me feel.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.915
If you come to that choice,
that question itself,

00:36:24.915 --> 00:36:26.040
how does this make me feel?

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.540
If I think about this,
if I think about this.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.467
And you have to kind of separate
the positive and negative

00:36:32.467 --> 00:36:34.050
qualities of those
things, because you

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.750
might say, this choice, I'm
actually kind of afraid of it.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.630
But that could be a good thing.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.910
It can be, I'm afraid of it
because it sounds so big,

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:43.600
it sounds so challenging.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.680
When I thought about
the travel quest,

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:48.819
I didn't begin that travel
quest at country number two.

00:36:48.819 --> 00:36:50.360
I had been traveling
for a long time.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.220
I loved traveling.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.350
I lived in Africa.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:54.220
And after I'd been to,
like, 70 countries,

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.845
it was like, what if I try to go
to every country in the world?

00:36:56.845 --> 00:36:59.860
Wow, that really scares me, but
I'm also kind of drawn to it.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.660
And so I feel like that's
where intuition comes in.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.450
It may not give you
all the answers,

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.670
but as you kind of
come close to things,

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.730
then it can guide
you a little bit.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.313
And I think I saw
that from the people

00:37:10.313 --> 00:37:12.830
that I looked at in
the book as well.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:16.150
There was a woman in
Mississauga, Ontario

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:19.410
who became the first female
firefighter in Ontario

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.980
23 years ago.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.690
And obviously at
the time, that felt

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.180
like of an exclusionary field.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.989
She was also very
short, short in stature,

00:37:26.989 --> 00:37:29.280
so she was kind of the opposite
of what you would think

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.526
is a stereotypical firefighter.

00:37:31.526 --> 00:37:32.900
But she had this
vision and she's

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.108
like, I really want to do it.

00:37:34.108 --> 00:37:35.720
And so she decoded the process.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.510
And so then she went into
this logical pursuit of it,

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.074
like what do I need to achieve?

00:37:40.074 --> 00:37:40.990
What are the licenses?

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:41.580
What are the training?

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.680
What are the skills?

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.180
But before she did
that, it was kind

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.059
of an intuition-based
decision like,

00:37:46.059 --> 00:37:47.350
I like that, that sounds crazy.

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:48.370
I want to do it.

00:38:00.549 --> 00:38:01.340
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.214
I'm sort of curious
about your country quest.

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:05.940
Did you literally go to every
country, including North Korea?

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.106
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: I literally
went to every country.

00:38:08.106 --> 00:38:10.540
It was an 11-year journey.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.650
I wasn't traveling
continuously for 11 years,

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.690
but was this 11-year pursuit.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.970
It was a process of decoding
and figuring out, OK,

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:22.110
what are the challenges?

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.734
North Korea is actually not one
of the most difficult countries

00:38:24.734 --> 00:38:25.350
to go to.

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.154
People think of
North Korea and Cuba

00:38:27.154 --> 00:38:29.070
and places like that--
well, Cuba is easy now,

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:32.150
but it wasn't until a few
years ago for Americans.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.320
The countries that had
the more challenges with

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.230
were more Visa issues,
countries like Sudan,

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.930
like Yemen, couple of
other African countries.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.160
I got deported when
I went to Eritrea.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:46.050
So I don't have a
desire to go back there.

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:48.760
But most places I went
it was totally fine.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.160
I had a wonderful experience.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.160
It was a transformative act.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.410
And people sometimes
ask how much time

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.710
do I spend in each country.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.270
I lived in Liberia for a year.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:01.580
I lived in the
Philippines for two years.

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.140
Some places I would
be for a month,

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.450
some places a couple of weeks.

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:07.460
And there were some countries
that were relatively brief,

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.750
one or two days or something.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.489
And I don't pretend to be an
expert on the entire world

00:39:11.489 --> 00:39:12.030
or something.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:13.613
For me, I was
interested in the quest.

00:39:13.613 --> 00:39:15.260
I was interested
in the act of, what

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:19.325
is it like to pursue this
dream and follow it logically?

00:39:19.325 --> 00:39:19.824
Thanks.

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:25.202
AUDIENCE: Chris,
I have a question.

00:39:25.202 --> 00:39:26.660
Some of us have
people in our lives

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.389
that we could see could benefit
from something like this, kind

00:39:29.389 --> 00:39:30.680
of going through this exercise.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.550
But they may not have
the self-awareness

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.280
to know that they
necessarily need it.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.130
I'm just curious
where and how you--

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.660
you've probably
come across people

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:39.660
like that that you
might want to nudge.

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.100
How would you go
about doing that?

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.324
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: I think
it's very hard to do that.

00:39:44.324 --> 00:39:46.240
I think it's very hard
to say to someone, hey,

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.360
you need this thing.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.590
Maybe there's a way to do it.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.270
I would just say,
me personally, I'm

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.780
not in the business of
being an evangelist.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.360
I'm not like a
door-to-door salesman.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.380
You can be a door-to-door vacuum
cleaner salesman or saleswoman

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.420
and eventually succeed.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.690
If you knock on enough
doors, someone's

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.080
going to buy that
vacuum cleaner,

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.580
but how much rejection
are you going

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.080
to go through along the way?

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.519
So personally, I'm much
more of a recruiter.

00:40:09.519 --> 00:40:10.810
I'm like, here are these ideas.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:13.580
People kind of come to
them when they're ready.

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:17.370
So sometimes I do these book
signings, and parents often

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.145
come to me and say,
my son or my daughter

00:40:19.145 --> 00:40:21.770
really needs to read this book,
so I'm going to give it to them

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:22.760
so they read it.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.980
And I'm like, I'm not sure
how that's going to work.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.010
I'm not sure how
that's going to go.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.960
Maybe one helpful thing is,
you used the word nudge,

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:33.640
so that's good.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.060
Maybe it's like, how
can you be a role model

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.530
without being a role model?

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.950
How can you be a mentor
without being a mentor?

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:42.937
How can you help people
see what's possible?

00:40:42.937 --> 00:40:43.770
That's a good thing.

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:44.990
Help people see
there's an opportunity,

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:46.865
there's a possibility,
there is more to life.

00:40:46.865 --> 00:40:49.220
There is this available to
you, but it's here for you

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.750
when you're ready.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.510
There are tools and
resources when you're ready.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:56.188
And then they come to
it when they want to.

00:40:56.188 --> 00:40:58.646
MALE SPEAKER: I think we've
got time for one more question.

00:41:04.102 --> 00:41:07.090
Anybody?

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:11.110
AUDIENCE: You mentioned briefly
a 14-question questionnaire

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.750
which you fill it
out, and that gives

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:16.510
you-- what's the basis for it?

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.570
What did you base it on?

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.150
Is it Myers-Brigg?

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.640
Is it any kind of
personality test?

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.260
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: No, it's
not based on Myers-Brigg.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.740
It's based on all the work
that we did for the book.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.270
I did it here with
Talia, my editor.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.140
So we had spent a
long period of time

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.600
with all of the interviews.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.170
And then I start from
a very large pool

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:39.470
of people with some introductory
interviews and surveys.

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.090
Then I choose a smaller circle
and do more detailed interviews

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:43.591
and surveys.

00:41:43.591 --> 00:41:45.256
And then for the
people who are actually

00:41:45.256 --> 00:41:47.150
in the book, at
that point I'm kind

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.000
of choosing representative
stories to ensure it's

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.100
diverse, to ensure that it's
hitting different points.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.410
So as for the quiz itself,
as we learned things

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:00.440
about working conditions, as
we developed this model of joy,

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.306
money, flow, as we developed
other exercises in the book--

00:42:03.306 --> 00:42:04.680
there's a number
of them-- that's

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.330
kind of how the quiz came to be.

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:10.080
And we then designed
personality types based

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.450
on all the research we had
done that said, OK, if you like

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:17.950
to work in this
manner, then here's

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.810
the ideal working
environment for you.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:21.612
And again, you may not
have 100% autonomy--

00:42:21.612 --> 00:42:23.820
you can't choose everything--
but you should be aware

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:25.190
that this is who you are.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:26.920
You should be aware
of that whenever

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.290
you can create this
kind of environment,

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:30.959
then they'll thrive in that.

00:42:30.959 --> 00:42:33.500
So if you take the quiz, let me
know if you like it or if you

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.217
don't.

00:42:34.217 --> 00:42:35.710
AUDIENCE: Original research?

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.720
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU:
Original research, yes.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.220
Thank you.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:38.860
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.550
Let's give another round
of applause to Chris.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:41.716
CHRIS GUILLEBEAU: Thank you.

00:42:41.716 --> 00:42:42.530
[APPLAUSE]
