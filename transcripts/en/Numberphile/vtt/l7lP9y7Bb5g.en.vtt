00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
MATT: OK, so I'm going to
do a card trick based

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.430
on the number 27.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.180
And this is my all-time favorite
maths card trick.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.750
And I'm going to show it for
you today, and I'm going to

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.460
explain it.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.040
I found this trick in an old
1950's math book written by

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.170
Martin Gardner.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.530
And for me it is the maths
card trick with the most

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.590
beautiful maths behind it
out of all of them.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.946
And because it is a math card
trick, it does involve a lot

00:00:24.946 --> 00:00:26.570
of long tedious counting.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.510
But bear with us here.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.500
So this involves 27 cards, so
I'm going to take 27 off.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.880
And this is a genuine count.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.550
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.530
27 is actually one of my
favorite numbers--

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.720
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10--

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.670
because it's a cubed number.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.110
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.730
OK, that's 27 cards.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.530
And this works with any 27
cards, and none of this trick

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.850
is slight-of-hand.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.900
None of it is YouTube magic
where I'm using something

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.890
sneaky, or a sneaky edit.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.770
And I'll explain the trick
afterwards, so it's OK.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:00.520
But this is how works--

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.160
You get 27 cards, you
shuffle them up.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.569
I'm actually going to
get Brady to both

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.980
film and be the volunteer.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.580
So I'll flick through, do you
want to tap which one you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.940
want, which one of these?

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.390
OK that one there.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.960
Do you want to show you
the camera that card?

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.225
Don't let me see
it, obviously.

00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:16.290
And do you want to put it back
in wherever you want?

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.322
Thank you.

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:18.870
Now all he needs to do is just
remember what that card was,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.450
and believe me, people in the
comments will mention

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.460
afterwards if you don't.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.950
Brady what's your favorite
number from 1 to 27, if you

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.800
had to pick a number?

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.710
BRADY: 10.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.110
MATT: 10, any particular
reason why 10?

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.556
BRADY: I just like
how it looks.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:30.106
MATT: You like it?

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:30.130
OK.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.340
Are you looking for your
card by the way?

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.100
What I want you to do is have
a look, and see if you can

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.780
spot which pile your
card goes into.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.640
And people may have seen
this trick done before.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.135
It's a variation, in fact, it's
a generalization on a 21

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:45.210
card trick.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.365
Which pile is it in?

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:47.880
BRADY: It's in that pile.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.530
MATT: In the middle
pile there?

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.490
OK, I'm going to pick
them up from the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.750
viewer's right to left.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.120
And what people tend to do is
they do this tedious counting

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.690
out each time.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.000
And what I'm actually
doing is last time I

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.750
memorized all the cards.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.490
And so I when you told me which
pile, I had narrowed it

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.110
down to nine possible
cards it could be.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.650
If I do it again, because of the
way I'm dealing it out, if

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.600
you tell me which pile it's in
this time, I will narrow it

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.610
down to one of three
possible cards.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.030
Which pile is it in this time?

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.210
BRADY: This time it is
in the middle pile.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.920
MATT: The middle one again,
there we are.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.650
OK purely coincidence, I'll
pick them up again.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.760
And then we'll do it one last
time again dividing by 3, and

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.690
this is why 27 is 3 cubed.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.440
If you say which one it's in I
will know, having memorized

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.070
all the cards, exactly one in
one, or I will know precisely

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.090
which card it is.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.060
And that's just the pure
information of this trick.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.000
Which one's it in?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.720
BRADY: That one.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.990
MATT: That one over there.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.790
Cool, OK.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.840
So now to be fair all
of that wasn't true.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.610
Well the numbers were true,
and the number of cards it

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.340
could've been going from 27 to
nine, to three, to one, that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.430
is completely accurate.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.120
I wasn't bothering to memorize
them though, I was doing

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.040
something else slightly
different.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.600
What was your card?

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.350
You can tell me now.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.390
BRADY: It was the
king of hearts.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.025
MATT: King of hearts, and what
was your favorite number?

00:03:03.025 --> 00:03:03.750
BRADY: 10.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.130
MATT: OK.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.530
Watch this.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.880
Here we go.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.460
Ready?

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.350
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.160
King of hearts.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.790
So this trick, you can put the
card-- even though you don't

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.120
know what it is-- as long as
they tell you which pile it's

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.440
in, you can put it anywhere
in that deck.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.980
So if you say any number, after
three lots of dealing it

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.920
out, I can put the card
into that position.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.700
And that is my all-time
favorite

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.340
maths based card trick.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.180
Do you want to know
how it works?

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.740
BRADY: Yes please.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.630
MATT: This is brilliant.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.360
OK, so can I have some of
your famous brown paper?

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.180
OK, excellent.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.320
Now let's look at why
this trick works.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.600
Now you're going to have
to bear with me here.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.240
I'm going to set up a
slightly unusual way

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.450
to look at the cards.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.950
Because when you get the 27
cards, the very last step-- if

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.020
we go from the end
of the trick--

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.430
I pick them up into three
piles of nine cards.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.940
From now on I'm going to call
the top one the 0th pile, and

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.480
then the first pile, and
the second pile.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.000
And there's a reason for that
in a moment, but just bear

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.160
with me while I set
up some notation.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.980
So when the cards go back
together there are nine cards

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.894
in the top pile one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:04:12.894 --> 00:04:13.590
eight, nine.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.050
So that was why I called
the 0th pile on top.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.770
Then there was one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.010
eight, nine in the first pile.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.725
And the bottom one-- one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:25.510
eight, nine, that was
the second pile.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.700
And as it turns out your one
was the king of hearts.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.770
That ended up being the
10th card down.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.280
Because you said at the very
beginning your favorite number

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.740
is 10, and your king of
hearts ended up there.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.290
And so now when you think about
it these top three from

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.020
the final pile-- because this is
the very last top, middle,

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.130
and bottom pile--

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.800
that top one came from the
previous top pile.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.870
That was the previous 0th pile,
that was the previous

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.050
middle pile, that was the
previous bottom pile.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.105
That was the previous
top, middle, bottom.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.340
Top, middle, bottom.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.420
And so actually if you
watch it you can

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.190
see how that happens.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.440
Because I've picked them up
from the second time.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.430
I've got the top, the middle,
and the bottom packets.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.400
Each are nine cards, I've
put them together.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.970
I deal out the next three piles,
and the first three

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.100
come from that top
pack of nine.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.760
And then the next three come
from that top pack of nine,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.850
and then the next three from
the same top pack of nine.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.690
So that's why over here the
top three come from the

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.260
previous top 0th pile.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.660
The next three of each one come
from the middle pile.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.630
So that's the first three off
the middle, next three off the

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.270
middle, next three
off the middle.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.680
And I've got nine left, that was
the previous bottom pile.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.860
That's why now I get three from
the bottom, three from

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.020
the bottom, three
from the bottom.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.180
So they end up going
down like that.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.480
And if you get some cards and
you start playing around with

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.080
this, within the final ordering
it turns out from the

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.000
very, very first time you put
them together this is the top,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.460
the middle, the bottom.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.760
The top, the middle,
the bottom.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.875
The top, the middle,
the bottom.

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:07.380
And don't lose too much sleep
over exactly why this happens.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.100
If you get a pack of cards
and deal it, you'll

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.090
start to see why.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.330
And what you end up here is this
is the ordering from the

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.480
first time we dealt
the cards out.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.700
That's the ordering from the
second time we dealt the cards

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.460
out, and that's the ordering
from the third time we dealt

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.170
the cards out.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.220
And to get it here at 10th,
I can see that to get this

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.590
position here it's
the 0th 0 first.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.330
Or top, top, middle.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.910
And so each time Brady pointed
to where his card was the

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.950
first time I put that pile back
on top, the second time I

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.050
put that pile back on top, The
third time I put that pile in

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.960
the middle.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.460
The first time I put that
pile back on top.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.667
The second time I put that
pile back on top.

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:06.010
The third time I put that
pile in the middle.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.475
In fact, Brady, do you want to
pick a different number?

00:07:08.475 --> 00:07:12.150
BRADY: So say I told you my
favorite number was 13, what

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.730
would you have done?

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.830
MATT: OK so 13, I need to put
12 cards on top of that, and

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.550
12 is one 9, one 3,
and no units.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.900
So I'm going to put
that on the top,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.680
the middle, the middle.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.540
13 is, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.050
Yeah see?

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.030
0, top, middle, middle.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.550
But the way I work it
out is I'm actually

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.580
working it out in base-3.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.930
Because this whole trick uses
base-3 ternary numbers, which

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.580
I think are absolutely
amazing.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.340
And the first time you put the
piles back together you're

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.790
doing the units column of
your base-3 number.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.080
The next time you put them back
together you doing 3's

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.390
column, and then the last time
you're doing the 9's column.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.850
And so when you give me your
number I work out that number

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.333
in base-3, and then that
tells me how to put

00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:54.790
the piles back together.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.300
OK so now we're going to redo
the very first trick I did in

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.210
almost slow motion, in annotated
mode if you will.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.540
And so you had a look at one
card, and then I started

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.170
dealing these.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.870
And then I talked to you about
your favorite number,

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.150
and you said 10.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.880
You're looking for the king of
hearts, and I'm thinking how

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.270
am I going to get that
king of hearts?

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.350
Well I don't know
what card it is.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.520
How'm I going to get
whatever the card

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.010
is to the 10th position?

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.830
And 10, nine goes
into that once.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.070
And so I want to get
nine cards on top.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.480
So I actually have to put it in
the top, the top, and then

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.780
the middle.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.110
So has the king of
hearts gone past?

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.965
Where was it?

00:08:29.965 --> 00:08:30.500
BRADY: It was there.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.789
MATT: OK so I now know it has
to go top, top, middle.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.160
So when I pick them up from left
to right-- these two I

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.320
don't care about-- that can be
bottom, that can be middle.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.490
The king of hearts is in this
one, so it has to go on top.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.450
Which means it's going to
be one of the first nine

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.390
to get dealt out.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.130
And so it's going to be either
the top card of the next

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.660
piles, or the second card of
the next piles, which it

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.880
happens to be, or
the third card.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.510
And then the rest we actually
don't care about.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.700
Because those other two piles
I know it wasn't in those.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.990
These are just padding to get it
into the correct position.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.180
So now which one was it in?

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:05.990
The middle one?

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.100
OK so again it's top,
top, middle.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.190
So it has to go top again.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.610
And if you watch, when I pick
them up I still pick them up

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.790
in the same order.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.700
But I put them together
in a different order.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.270
So that goes on top, and then
I'll get this last one, and

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.000
I'll just shove it underneath.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.720
So now I know it's on top.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.670
In fact I know it's in the top
three of the top pile.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.160
So when I go down this time
it has to be the top

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.930
card, there it is.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.080
And then the rest go on top, and
then the last time it has

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:32.930
to go in the middle.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.500
And so you can see what's
going to happen now.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.880
Because if it goes in the middle
it's going to get nine

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.380
cards put on top of it.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.780
It's going to be the top card in
the middle pile, it's going

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.920
to be the 10th card.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.265
So it was in this one?

00:09:42.265 --> 00:09:43.330
Well how about that?

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.890
Pick that one up first, pick
that one up and put it

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:45.960
underneath.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.640
So it was the middle one, put
that one underneath like that,

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.740
and so now it has to
be the 10th card.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:57.520
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, boom.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.510
So in fact one way you can
think about it is I like

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:06.290
drawing a time versus
card height diagram.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.920
So the first time you do
it-- this is the first

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.260
time you deal out--

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.990
you've got the bottom pack,
you've got the middle pack,

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.300
and you've got the
top pack when you

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.380
put them back together.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.360
And the reason I use 0, one, and
two is actual units column

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.450
in ternary.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.220
The second time you've got the
bottom pack, you've got the

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.050
middle pack, you've got the top
pack, and again that's 0,

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.920
one, and two.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.480
And that's the second
time you deal.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.990
And then the third time you
deal, again you've got the

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.885
bottom, the middle pack,
and the top, and

00:10:34.885 --> 00:10:35.810
that's 0, one, and two.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.120
So there are the three
packs when you

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.230
put them back together.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.470
And in fact this is your
units column, or

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.440
that your 1's column.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.830
That there's your 3's
column, and that

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.530
there's your 9's column.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:52.760
So if you want to put 15 on top,
to get 15 you're going to

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.860
need two 3's, one
9, and no units.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.230
So it's going to go top,
bottom, middle.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.040
To put 15 cards on top.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.730
And it'll end up being
the 16th card.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.777
BRADY: If someone at home wants
to do this trick do they

00:11:06.777 --> 00:11:09.400
have to be pretty
good at maths?

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.780
MATT: You have two options.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.650
You can either be pretty good
at maths, or you can spend a

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.700
lot of your free time practicing
until your brain

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.870
gets used to doing this.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.850
Which to be fair, are both
exactly the same thing.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.670
Maths is all about practicing
something, and developing a

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.630
new way of thinking for your
brain to get used to it.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.630
So either option, learn maths,
of learn card tricks.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.350
You're ending up with the same
skill set to be honest.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.350
BRADY: You said at the start
this was your favorite trick

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.120
to some extent.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.600
MATT: It is.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.980
BRADY: There are
lots of tricks.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.200
What is it about that one
that resonates with you?

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.340
MATT: People know the 21 card
trick, where you put it back

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.060
in the middle each time, and
then it ends up being the

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.740
middle card.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.120
And so people kind of
know that, but they

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.280
don't know why it works.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.020
Whereas this one you know why it
works, and then you can do

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:52.950
so much more with it.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.080
And there's a huge difference in
math-- indeed in anything--

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.280
between just memorizing the
steps so you know how to do

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.980
it, versus knowing why
those steps get you

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:02.840
where you want to be.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.200
And so this utilizes the
advantage of knowing why the

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.680
steps are doing something,
and then you can

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.660
tweak it as you go.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.500
So instead of always putting it
in the middle you can put

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.200
it anywhere you want, because
you understand how it works.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.410
Because you're putting three
piles back together three

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.340
times there are 27 possible
arrangements of putting it

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.160
back across the trick,
which correspond to

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.080
all 27 possible positions.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.020
In fact you can do this trick
with a lot more cards if you

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.980
really want to.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.790
It's the number of piles to the
power of how many times

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.360
you deal the cards out.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.810
If you get 10 billion cards,
which is a lot of cards, and

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.500
you deal them out into 10 piles
10 times, you can put

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.900
any of those 10 billion cards
into any position

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.350
just through 10 deals.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.580
Although admittedly you are
dealing a million cards into

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.580
each pile, so it does take
a very long time.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:58.720
In fact in Martin Gardner's book
Magic, Maths, and Mystery

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.982
he describes that if you want
to do the 10 billion card

00:13:04.982 --> 00:13:07.720
version his recommendation is
to be very, very careful as

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.880
you're doing the 10 piles
of 10 each time.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.320
Because if you make a mistake
very few audiences will sit

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.740
through that trick for
a second time.
