00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.869
Let's start off by looking at some exponent patterns. Here are some expressions.

00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:09.353
And here are those same expressions expanded based on the exponents. I have

00:00:09.353 --> 00:00:13.917
three 3s multiplied together and three 2s multiplied together. Because the

00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:18.607
exponents were 3 and 2. The same is true down here. I have two 2s and three 5s.

00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:23.057
If I wanted to simplify these expressions, I would write the final answer with

00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:27.611
one base and the exponent. For example, for this case I would have three 5s. So,

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:31.633
I could write this answer as 3 to the 5th. This second one's a little bit

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:35.964
tricky. I have a base of 2 and a base of 5. The bases are different, so I can't

00:00:35.964 --> 00:00:40.199
combine these two bases and write them with an exponent. I have to keep them

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.968
separate. I still have 2 twos and 3 fives. When we simplify expressions with

00:00:44.968 --> 00:00:48.921
exponents, we want to try and combine the exponents that have the same base. So

00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:52.813
think about what I did here. What did I really do with these exponents to get

00:00:52.813 --> 00:00:56.771
this answer? And what did we have to do in this case? And I know it seems weird

00:00:56.771 --> 00:01:01.059
that we have an answer, that's the original question but sometimes that happens.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.254
Sometimes we can't combine the powers. We could, of course, multiply each of

00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:09.244
these out to get a number, but I wasn't focused on the number. I wanted to look

00:01:09.244 --> 00:01:11.744
at the exponents and what we're doing with them.
