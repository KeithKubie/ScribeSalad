00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We've seen a little bit of testing, but let's look at testing from another angle.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's say this is the program or the thing that we're considering testing.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We want to test our JavaScript interpreter,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we're going to feed it this factorial definition and this call to document write.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And by thinking hard about the problem, we know the answer we should get is 120.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1--5 factorial.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Here's the quiz.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's say this is our test case and that's the input we're comparing against.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I want to know which parts of the program we gain confidence about.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So here I've written 6 important parts of our JavaScript interpreter:

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
handling function calls; handling environment lookups for variable values;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
handling string constants like hello; local variable declarations like var temp = 3;

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
assignment statements like z = 2; and binary operations like addition.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And what I want to know is, if this is our test input

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we're comparing the answer to 120,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which of these features in our interpreter will be tested?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If something isn't tested, we can't hope to find a bug in it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
As a hint, another way of looking at this problem is to imagine,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
let's say, that our code for function calls totally didn't work.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Would we get 120?

00:01:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
If the answer is no, then we're testing function calls.
