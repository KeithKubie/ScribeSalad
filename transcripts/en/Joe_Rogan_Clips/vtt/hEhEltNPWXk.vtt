1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.950
The Joe Rogan experience.
You know,
I heard a really great,

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.840
I,
this is just the beginning of a thought,
right?
Um,
but,
um,
it came up,

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.880
so just somewhere I was talking to,
um,
uh,
uh,
uh,

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.380
some people about this,
uh,
and in sports,

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.730
one of the things,
our assumption that men have an advantage over women,
right?

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.570
In sports,
in sports.
Yeah.
Our assumption.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,
let me,

7
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:30.330
let me expand on our assumption that men have an advantage over women in sports,

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.530
um,

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.330
is partially based on the fact that so many of the sports were designed for male

10
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:41.130
bodies,
right?
They're optimized for male bodies,
right?
Basketball for example.

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.990
Right.
Um,
uh,
you know,
there's an optimized for mail bombs.
It's like the,

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.850
uh,
the,
uh,
the height of the basket,
you know,
the,

13
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.440
um,
uh,
the way that the ball moves around,
you know,
like,

14
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:57.410
like even when the ball moves around,
if we're going to say that,
if,

15
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.100
if we're going to say that men and women have physiological differences,
right.

16
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.690
Um,

17
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.670
and then we're creating sports and the s and the sports are sort of tuned to the

18
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:07.100
physiological differences.
Okay.

19
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.240
<v 1>[inaudible] we're talking about power,
speed,
athleticism,
all those,</v>

20
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.870
there's an advantage when you look awesome

21
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.140
<v 0>when you look at say gymnastics,
right?
Yeah.
Um,</v>

22
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.060
I would say that like women for the events that are in a women's gymnastic

23
00:01:22.061 --> 00:01:25.860
competition,
right.
Have an advantage over men,
right?
Um,
women,
uh,

24
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.700
women don't compete on the ring hold thing.
You know what I mean?
Right.
Uh,

25
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.140
men don't compete at,
at some of that crazy,
uh,
you know,
bar shit.

26
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.030
You know what I mean?
Like larger there its height,
its flexibility.

27
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:41.440
It's like there's a lot going on,
right?

28
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800
So that's a rare case where women's gymnastics,

29
00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:48.700
we've actually created events in that and like competitions that like only women

30
00:01:48.701 --> 00:01:50.590
can do.
Right?
Um,

31
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.160
and so we sort of optimized that sport more for a female body.
Right?

32
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.000
What if we did that with a lot more sports?
Right?
Um,
and how about this?

33
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:02.320
What if we were able to do,
because again,
the rules of the game,
right?

34
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.320
Are not absolute.
The rules of the game are things that humans create,
right?

35
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.180
And so why do we s like maybe part of our assumption that men are better at

36
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.480
sports than women or men have an advantage on sports and women are that we have

37
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:14.021
constructed,

38
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:17.830
most of the Games that we've constructed are actually sort of biased towards a

39
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:20.830
male type of body.
Right.
That sounds ridiculous.
First of all,

40
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.650
<v 1>he's and why gymnastics is like why women are good at gymnastics.</v>

41
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:30.380
First of all,
their,
their flexibility,
their lightness,
all those things.
Also,

42
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.490
they're not competing against men in a one on one type of situation.

43
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:37.280
Like one's trying to defend the other one's trying to tack like a game of

44
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:42.281
basketball or a game of football or any other sort of team sport with any male

45
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:45.350
gymnast and try to have them compete against the female.

46
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.420
That's not going to be a little,
those things.

47
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.280
It's a physical event as opposed to a sport.

48
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.760
So a physical event is you have to do this thing.
It's very athletic.

49
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:55.370
It's an athletic endeavor.
Should do as your balance.
You land.

50
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.390
No one's trying to stop you from doing it again.

51
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.760
When you're shooting basketballs,
you're not just shooting basketballs.

52
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.990
You're trying to shoot a basketball,
what people are trying to defend.

53
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.670
You're trying to Juke left and then go right.
You're trying to be sneaky.

54
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.510
You're trying to shoot from the outside.
There's all this shit going on in.

55
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:17.530
A lot of,
it involves your ability to move fast,
to close distance,

56
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.550
to have the physical strength of leap up in the air and there's a huge physical

57
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.630
advantage that men enjoy.
This is not because the sports designed this way,

58
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.240
it's because the sport is very simple.

59
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.180
There's a basket on one side of basket on the other side.

60
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
You got to get it in here.
They got to get it in there ready,
go.

61
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.170
If you're faster and your stronger,
you'll be able to accomplish that better.

62
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.060
Males are faster and stronger.

63
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.610
There's a reason why there's a male and a female division.

64
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:47.470
It's not that these sports were designed for males is that men are physically

65
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:51.610
bigger and stronger and faster than this.
These are physiological advantages.

66
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.940
Yeah.

67
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.140
You can have a thing like a gymnastics balance beam event where women are going

68
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:59.410
to shine because they're lighter and more flexible and they could do things with

69
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:02.530
their body that men can't because of the shape of their,
all the mass,

70
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:06.730
all the different things.
But that's rare.
That's the outlier.
I,
yeah,
I don't,

71
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:08.440
I don't think we actually disagree that much.
Um,

72
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.850
the reason it's rare is because historically we've created most of our sports

73
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.570
around things that men have the advantage,
and you're,
you're not wrong,

74
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.310
but sports are,

75
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.620
most sports involves speed and power.
Most sports.

76
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.920
But why men have an advantage in speed and power.
I know,

77
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:28.480
but we created those sports,
right?

78
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.570
Like what would we possibly be able to create where women would have an

79
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:36.571
advantage that is an athletic event where a man speed and power does not give

80
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:38.110
him an advantage.
I mean,

81
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.240
<v 0>look,
man,
I this,
this is not,
uh,
again,
like I said,</v>

82
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:43.980
this is the beginning of a thought,
right?
I'm trying to,

83
00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:46.200
I'm trying to use this as a thought experiment is sort of like a,

84
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.790
a possibility opening device.
Right?
Right.
But so you,
you postulate,
hey,

85
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.630
now you make a fair point that there's a difference between individual athletic

86
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:58.260
events like gymnastics and competitive one on one or events like,
you know,

87
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.970
grappling or,
or basketball or something like that.
Right.
And so,
um,
and again,

88
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:06.450
I'm thinking this through myself as I'm talking about it,
right?
But,
um,

89
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.580
like I don't think it's impossible that you could come up with a one on one

90
00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:14.550
competition that,
uh,
privileges that that is,

91
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.410
that is designed around the same athletic qualities that make a women make a

92
00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:22.950
woman,
uh,
give her an advantage in a certain gymnastics event.

93
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.800
I don't think there's any reason you couldn't do the same thing for a find a one

94
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:30.480
on one competition that did the same thing.
Right.
Um,
there's also,
uh,

95
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.740
what could it be?
Uh,
I mean,
well,
here's an example.
Uh,
for instance,
uh,

96
00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:39.660
I believe,
I'm not sure,
I'm not 100% sure,
but I believe in like shooting events,

97
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.400
right?
Uh,
for example,
that women and men are on a level playing field.
Correct.
Or,

98
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.360
or that,
uh,
like,
you know,
sort of air rifle sorta thing.
Um,

99
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.390
that like there are events,
right?
Uh,
there,

100
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.710
there do exist athletic events where you can have men and women in direct

101
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:57.800
competition with each other.
Right?
Where that,

102
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.920
where that event is not designed around a particular facet of a,

103
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.250
you know,
male or female body.
Right.
Um,
so,
uh,

104
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.490
my point is look,
men,
have you,

105
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.360
do you agree that men have run the country in the world for like most of

106
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.510
civilization?
Like,
and most every country.
Okay,
great.

107
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.550
So [inaudible] had been the one setting up the sports.

108
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.950
So the fact that as you say,

109
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:25.940
it's rare that we have sports that are sort of more designed around a female,

110
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.360
you know,
the differences between between women as opposed to men.
Right.

111
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.570
I think that might be because men had been setting up all the sports.
Right.

112
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.830
And so my,
so my point is sports that women gravitate towards.

113
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.850
How do you mean there's sports that women gravitate towards that you really

114
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:44.140
enjoy?
This mean like women's volleyball.
She ain't right.
Oh No,
this is,

115
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.920
there's many successful women have traditionally gravitated towards gymnastics

116
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:50.570
as you said earlier,
is puffy example.

117
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.410
But those are but way more women involved in gymnastics and men.
Oh,
absolutely.

118
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.590
Um,
but there,
those are the sports that get the less attention.

119
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.990
Right now we have less huge amounts.
It sure does.

120
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:02.780
It's one of the rare examples of like ones where,
you know,

121
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:05.680
that is a real female forward,
you know,
female first support.
Right.

122
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.850
No one bothers me the most is to volleyball.

123
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.890
Was that because the girls have to dress like hoes,

124
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.680
like even in the Olympics they wear thongs.

125
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.580
Jeanette fucking basketball players in the dress like that.
Yeah,

126
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.240
that's fucked up man.
They can choose what they're wearing.
I think that,

127
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.440
what's her name,
the Muslim Egyptian team,
they dress in national guards.

128
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.270
The name of the volleyball player who has,
has the black tape on,
um,
very famous.

129
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:30.680
You know,
the,
the two,
the two women,

130
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.230
the two women from the u s they're very famous volleyball players.

131
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:34.100
Whose names I can't remember.

132
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.930
They probably aren't complaining about what they're wearing.

133
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:38.890
They're probably choosing what they're wearing.
I don't know.
Um,
I don't think it,

134
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.030
let's forced them to wear that stuff.
But I mean,

135
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.880
when I tune into a Olympic volleyball,
my Tim Lee,

136
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.740
these girls in their underwear pretending they're at the beach,

137
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.880
they're not even at the beach.

138
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.110
It's a choice apparently towards they want to where they want to wear it.
I see.

139
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.900
I mean,
good move,
but is that a choice for the men?
Basketball players?

140
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.950
Can they wear thongs?

141
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.520
They can wear short shorts if they imagined where they could wear it,

142
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:03.020
like a cutoff with a midriff showing and a and little booty shorts,

143
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.150
they might be allowed to,
if they wanted to come back to see me,

144
00:08:06.151 --> 00:08:08.530
I been narrow masculinity.
They might get shit in the locker room,
you know?

145
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.690
Maybe not.
Maybe they just make a point.

146
00:08:10.691 --> 00:08:14.000
I like the short shorts that they used to wear a couple of decades ago,
so,
okay,

147
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:15.720
look,
yeah,
Larry Bird style.
You know,

148
00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:19.850
one of the things I love about baseball and I started watching baseball is a,

149
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.340
you get to choose your own baseball pants.
He ever noticed that,

150
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:24.140
like they get to choose when you look at them.

151
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:27.680
Some of them were really tight baseball pants and then someone wear really baggy

152
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:30.080
baseball pants.
And I just love the managing.
I like clothes.

153
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.260
I imagine them going to like the baseball Taylor and being like,
dude,

154
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:37.730
I want to like sag my pants.
I want to,
you know,
show a little swag.

155
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.440
But you don't want to impede your performance.

156
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.010
So I think the tight would be better as you're running like good swimmer shaped

157
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.800
their bodies to be more aerodynamic.

158
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:48.710
I mean how much really if you're just running to first base,

159
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.540
how much does like baggy pants,

160
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:53.240
the wind catching the baggy pants cause that for real,

161
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.130
we look at like Manny Ramirez had like the baggy pants.
I remember.

162
00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:59.520
And like you had to imagine that guy was like a little bit suboptimal with his

163
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:03.000
baseball pants.
You know,
maybe just call them up and stuff.
Yeah.

164
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.290
<v 1>Maybe a big ass thighs and the only feel good with the baggy pants.</v>

165
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.870
<v 0>Let me just put a bow on,
on what I was trying to get earlier.
Right.</v>

166
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.060
Cause I know I was,
I was sort of like getting to a pretty spacey place.
Um,

167
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.860
my point is just what our show is about so much is about showing how the things

168
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:19.470
that we take for granted in our world,
like the way the world is.

169
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:22.180
So much of the time is just something that we built.
Right?

170
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.460
And we can question it.

171
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.840
And so when we say men are men have advantages in women over sports,
I'm like,

172
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:28.531
well,
hold on a second.

173
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:32.340
Let's look at how we set the sports up and is it possible that we could set up,

174
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.970
set it up in a different way,
right?

175
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.630
That would allow more people to compete in sports.
Right?

176
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.800
It might not be the same sports.

177
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.730
I'm not going to say that women should play in the NFL against men.
Right?

178
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:43.560
I don't think that'd be safe.
I don't think anyone should play in the NFL.

179
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:48.180
Frankly.
I think it's way too dangerous.
Uh,
it's very bad for people.
But um,
uh,

180
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.120
is it like,
is our assumption just based on,
Hey,

181
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:52.620
these are the sports that we invented.

182
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:54.990
We happened to invent sports that were men have the advantage.

183
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.160
Can we imagine a world where 90% of sports are ones where women have an

184
00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:02.400
advantage of would we be having a different conversation?
And if that's the case,

185
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.430
could we come up with some sports that,
like everybody could,

186
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.440
you know that where there's no,
uh,
this is,
it would have to say

187
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.530
<v 1>physical sports I think.
Um,
but I think,
yeah,</v>

188
00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:15.670
you could come out with competitions were women and female.

189
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.150
Traditional female characteristics would have an advantage for sure.
You could,

190
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.520
I mean,
it could definitely be done,
you know,

191
00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:25.510
it's just the ones that exist now when that involve running and lifting things

192
00:10:25.511 --> 00:10:30.430
and moving fast,
physically,
physiologically males have an advantage.
Yeah.

193
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.220
That's why we have these distinctions and what's,
while we have men's divisions,

194
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.120
women's divisions over hundreds and hundreds of years ago,
you know what,

195
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.210
this just not fair.
It's not fair,
you know?
But you know,
I mean,

196
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.900
is it the like that's the,

197
00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:45.550
that's the notion of fairness we have now.

198
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.130
<v 0>I think the interesting thing about the question trans athletes is it's going to</v>

199
00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:51.170
challenge that notion.
It's going to lead to conversations like this one.

200
00:10:51.171 --> 00:10:53.600
You know,
I think that's really cool.
And that's what I think we're sort of,

201
00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:56.300
we should be down to have as a society.
Right.
Oh,
okay.
