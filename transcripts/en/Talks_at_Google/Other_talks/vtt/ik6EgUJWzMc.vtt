00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:19.070
The process of making is the point of it.
This needs to be a kind of ballet.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:30.890
&gt;&gt; If anybody can copy [indistinct], it's
not art.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.369
[violin]

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:44.370
&gt;&gt; There's no carving in wood or in stone
or knots on a rug that are going to look anything

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.120
near like what pleats do when they express
a line.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.850
&gt;&gt; Lots of people talk about the reality of
a [indistinct] elephant in origami.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.900
Does it look real?
Does it look like an elephant?

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.679
But, it's a piece of paper, and, of course,
it can't look like an elephant.

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:09.110
&gt;&gt; I think, at heart, one of the things that
makes us human -- that's both our strength

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.070
and our weakness -- is a need to change things.
It's also the heart of the appeal of origami,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.580
exploring the surprising magic of just how
far you can change that square only by folding

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.580
it.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.120
&gt;&gt; What are the limits -- the physical limits
 -- of this art form?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.400
&gt;&gt; When you put a crease in the paper, you're
essentially changing the memory of that piece.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.390
&gt;&gt; Origami is just a way to get your hands
dirty with math.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.090
It becomes your laboratory for doing mathematics.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.740
&gt;&gt; Whenever there's a need in the industry
to take a flat sheet and somehow make it smaller,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.460
there is potential for origami to have an
application.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.930
&gt;&gt; In science, this is the most creative you
can be.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.390
We are artists whether we do science or whether
we build sculpture.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:13.349
&gt;&gt; Well, first, thanks to everybody here and
Paul and Brian, it's a real pleasure and we're

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.630
flattered that you were able to make this
happen today.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.709
I don't want to take up too much time myself,
because, really, the people who you want to

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.329
ask questions to are the artists who are in
the back.

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:27.329
First, actually, I'll call up Sally Rosenthal.
She's the executive producer, and she's an

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.480
amazing person.
And then, Bernie Peyton.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.920
Please, you guys should just get up.
This is informal.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.890
Yes.
Chris, Jeremy, Robert, Michael, Richard.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.620
Did I miss anybody?
We've had a couple.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.829
You guys actually are -- yeah.
This is quite special to have all these people

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.819
here.
We have a bunch of local people and that have

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.790
helped.
There's an enormous amount of brain talent

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.819
right here.
So, and many of them have actually brought

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.950
some of their work.
I know Chris Palmer has some new things to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.840
show you.
And Michael has Wilbur.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.450
And I think, Chris also has a flower tower
here.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:22.840
Jeremy might have a flasher.
This is the papermaker; is that you?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.579
&gt;&gt; Can you describe what's involved in making
paper, and what's special about the paper

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:27.579
that's used for this?

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.640
&gt;&gt; Sure.
When I first became inspired to become an

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.639
origami artist, it was because of the work
of Akira Yoshizawa, who we saw in the film,

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:50.529
and his work just had that artist touch.
So I tried to do this as a young boy with

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:51.529
ordinary paper.
First, I thought it was me, and then I thought,

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:53.610
"It's the paper."
I luckily lived in a papermaking town, and

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.790
I began to study it, and realized there was
chemistry involved and material selection

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.400
and paper-forming techniques.
So, over the years, my three goals in the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.430
papermaking, starting from age 16, were: the
foldability.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.459
I wanted it to respond to my touch, so it
worked like playing a fine instrument.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.470
I could put the expression I wanted.
I wanted the works to last a long time.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.630
You know, you put a lot of work into these
things, and maybe people buy them, and they

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.720
should not crumble and fade.
And then the third thing was, of course, I

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.819
wanted to be able to do this whenever I really
needed it.

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:36.949
I had to set myself up to make paper on demand.
So, I did a lot of research.

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:43.720
Essentially, we use plant fibers, abaca, which
is from a banana plant, or hemp -- really

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.360
good, long, strong stuff, like they use in
paper money.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.030
You grind that up in water.
And then you can color it, use permanent pigments.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.590
You float the stuff in water and use various
size screens to screen out layers of pulp

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.771
 -- thinner or thicker -- press it and dry
it, and you've got paper.

00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:08.009
So, our paper can be as thin as tissue and
as strong as paper money at the same time.

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:14.460
Wilbur is folded from thicker paper, and when
we fold the paper, we moisten it slightly

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.949
sometimes.
That's called "wet folding."

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.000
You can see the stylistic difference.
But that's in a nutshell what paper making

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.789
is all about.
Richard is our other papermaking master.

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.669
&gt;&gt; Most people associate origami with origami
paper which was developed in the 1800s to

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.180
support the Froebel Kindergarten Program,
where they did a lot of paper folding in Europe,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:40.560
and then it spread through the U.S. and Japan.
And sure, you can make origami from anything

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.620
you can fold, but to make origami art, you
need to use artist materials that are going

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.550
to last.
That's the difference.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.150
&gt;&gt; I've seen some images floating around the
Internet by artists who, instead of fold paper,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.430
they just make creases.
And they use these creases in such a way to

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.960
make -- usually a representational scene.
Have you seen this type of art that, again,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.340
instead of actual folds, they're just like
minor creases in what remains a flat piece

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.000
of paper, and do you consider that origami?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.130
&gt;&gt; Have you guys seen that?

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.490
&gt;&gt; So, just the crease pattern, and then,
it's folding up to make a geometic pattern?

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.509
Or what is it making?

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.139
&gt;&gt; No folding.
Usually it looks like a room or maybe like

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:30.539
an outdoor scene.
I mean, lots of, it kind of tries to use -- painterly

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:35.050
three dimensionality but again they're not
really folds.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.509
It's just a series of creases on an otherwise
flat pieces of paper, that create a picture,

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:41.509
or something like that, but it doesn't actually
fold up into anything.

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:52.990
&gt;&gt; Like a relief kind of?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.060
&gt;&gt; Robert.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.530
&gt;&gt; So, I've seen this.
Oh, sorry, I'm Robert Lang.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:05.669
So, I'm one of the artists in the film.
I've seen this, and for those who haven't,

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:10.640
it is low relief.
Effectively, they're scoring the paper, the

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.610
artist is scoring, making shallow creases
in the paper.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.550
And so, the image that you get comes from
both the fold lines itself, and the slight

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:29.280
changes in angle of the paper, when lit appropriately,
give height and contrast, so you can see representation

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.789
images.
And, to me, everyone has a different definition

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:38.159
of origami.
My definition of origami is, It's an art form

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:44.689
where folds are the primary means of creating
the structure.

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:49.830
So it doesn't have any rules about whether
it's one or two sheets, or whether you can

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:56.800
or can't cut, but folding has to be primary.
And so, in my view that type of folding, as

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:04.490
well as the nondeterministic folding, otherwise
known as crumpling [indistinct] is, in fact,

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.209
another branch of origami.

00:08:07.209 --> 00:08:11.700
&gt;&gt; I think this doesn't really answer the
question.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:19.689
I think the root of the question is, How are
they made? Right?

00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:21.550
&gt;&gt; Well, that's another interesting question.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:26.469
&gt;&gt; And I have my own -- I mean, who knows
for sure, but I've looked at them really carefully.

00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:33.909
And I would suggest there's some sort of laser
work, you know, scoring -- that's just my

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:38.409
own personal thing.
I have no proof, so anybody -- that's everybody's

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.270
to their own personal interpretation.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:48.770
&gt;&gt; Well, the word "origami" is gradually,
in my opinion, becoming equal to the word

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.030
music.
By the way, I'm Michael LaFosse, the papermaker,

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.840
designer too.
And today, we realize that whatever anyone

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:04.500
wishes to call music, or even the word art
for that reason, might really be up to their

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.701
own decision.
So, when Robert mentioned that, the thing

00:09:07.701 --> 00:09:14.190
that occurred to me is, I wonder what the
folks who actually make that work of art wish

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.750
to -- or decided to -- call it.
That might be a bit more interesting to hear,

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.080
you know, their answer of what they're calling
it.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.430
Maybe they don't want to call it "origami."
I don't know.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.870
I think of it as origami, because as Robert
said, if its primary expression is folds in

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.950
paper, no matter the method of getting them
into the paper, that can categorically be

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:28.950
origami, like the word "music".

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:29.950
&gt;&gt; Hi my name is Natalie Su.
My question for all the artists is, "Once

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.260
you have the final product, is there anything
that you either spray on the product to make

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.420
it last for a long time?
For example, lacquer or, is it more like determinant

00:09:32.420 --> 00:10:01.890
on the paper that you use final pieces it's?"

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Well I'd say that's -- there is some people

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:12.410
in the wide world of the craft of origami
that have been known to paint their final

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:17.610
thing with lacquer.
It's a small set of people.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:23.160
And it makes it much different object.
It kind of freezes it in place, and takes

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:32.220
it away from that idea that that process brought
it there, in my opinion.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.310
&gt;&gt; And, well, yeah.
Sometimes, in order to make it more durable,

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:40.630
it is necessary.
And, Jeremy has some examples of that sort

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.690
of thing for performing.
If it needs to actually open and close many

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:51.760
times, then some treatment is necessary.
That's kind of an interesting subject that

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.760
has movement.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.760
&gt;&gt; Hi.
Richard Alexander.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.620
We do some commercial installations, some
which are permanent.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:02.900
We have to spray the tops of the origami mobiles
with maybe an acrylic spray that will allow

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.290
the workers to clean them and keep them dusted
so they look fresh.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:10.700
Window displays are often up for a short period
of time, and there's a coating.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.680
When people make origami jewelry, depending
on the age of people that are going to be

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:20.740
wearing it, jewelry sold to younger children,
they will dip in two-part epoxy to make it.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:26.620
&gt;&gt; That's what I was referring to that some
people do that.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:33.120
&gt;&gt; Here's some examples of paper that's been
treated for utility with tape.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:49.830
&gt;&gt; And so this is -- okay.
So, this one is first folded out of a large

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.690
sheet of paper.
I couldn't find that big one, so I pieced

00:11:54.690 --> 00:12:00.980
several together to get this big of a square.
And then after I folded it, I did paint it,

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.950
and I reinforced it on the back laminating.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.980
&gt;&gt; So, there's some plastic in there.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.670
&gt;&gt; Yes.
And this one has lasted me a few years, actually,

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:22.970
opening it during all my performances.
And these are some other ones that I laminated.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:32.220
And, with acrylic paint, which is also -- acrylic
paint is also very flexible, so that's what

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.860
I use.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.860
[laughter]

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.750
&gt;&gt; It was hinted towards earlier, but I didn't
get the chance to follow up.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:43.830
You mention, or said with some disdain, that
they might have been using lasers in that

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:50.921
paper-creasing process.
I didn't see any tools or maybe I missed it.

00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:54.480
I didn't see many tools in this video.
Is it kind of looked down upon in the origami

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.480
community to use like the small hooking tools
to make these teeny creases?

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.199
Or did I just not see that part of the process?

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:05.640
&gt;&gt; I think you just didn't see that part of
the process, and also different people do

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.360
 -- some people use bone [indistinct], and
some people like to laser cut or etch a little,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:16.810
very lightly, with very little power, to make
creases.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:23.820
So, it's there and around.
And people use small tools for fine work as

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.820
well.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:30.580
&gt;&gt; I just want to clarify, since I made that
disdaining comment.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:36.430
I just think that origami, it's okay to use
tools, but if it's.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:42.320
It's sort of important to present like -- if
you use cuts, for instance, then you would

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:49.750
put a work on display.
And maybe, people in this day and age might

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:56.690
consider that that model doesn't have cuts.
And then, when -- I mean, that happened to

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.330
me the first time I made a crab.
I wanted to make a crab.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:05.300
I saw it in the book, and I was really excited
to make it, and then it sort of turned out

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.490
it had cuts and I was like.
[disappointed sound]

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:12.730
And so yeah, it's just presenting things,
I think, it's important to have some sort

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.900
of description of the medium, the method in
order to really present an artwork.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.480
And that's just my own personal opinion.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:29.840
&gt;&gt; I was just going to mention: A lot of people,
including myself, do use tools.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:36.300
I use anything, ranging from tweezers, glasses,
reading glasses sometimes, [laughter] and

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.190
on some pieces, I've also used laser-scriber
to scribe creases.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:48.760
My view is, if tools help you create a better
artwork -- and what Jeremy alluded to, you're

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.550
not claiming that you are doing something
different than what you are doing -- then

00:14:53.550 --> 00:15:02.440
I think any tool is a good thing, just as
if you are a painter, using a brush to apply

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.500
the paint, rather than spitting it out of
your mouth like the old people did, is a good

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.390
thing as well.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:11.990
&gt;&gt; I've seen images floating around of someone
who used toilet paper rolls to create faces.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.540
Have you seen this?
Is that artist up here?

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.370
Or do have you an opinion of using found objects
to?

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:28.710
&gt;&gt; That artist is Junior in France.
He's a member of LECRIM, and he lives in Paris.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:38.650
And I personally met with him and saw his
paper rolls and tried it myself as well, I

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.380
must confess.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:48.230
&gt;&gt; We have somebody, who's name is Linda Miyahara,
and she delights in having contests at conventions,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:54.380
and she will give us things like a tortilla,
a piece of plastic wrap, a toilet seat cover,

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.390
a towel, a paper pack, anything that she can
come up with to fold.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:04.390
And you'd have to sit there in front of judges;
you have one minute to make a creation.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.540
It's rather exciting.
So, yes, anything can be folded.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.530
&gt;&gt; Sounds like an Iron Chef of paper, kind
of?

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in fact, you know, the origami community
worldwide is very well-connected.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.870
It's a small group, but it's a huge group.
And we all know each other, and many of us

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:30.050
here for years, Vanessa was able to learn
about each of us by the recommendation from

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.990
one of us to another.
So, it just went around the world.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:37.820
That also happens when it comes to commercial
jobs.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.440
Maybe somebody contacts somebody and says,
"Oh, you know who you have to contact to get

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.400
this done?"
And if that person is too busy or contractually-obligated

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.480
to something else, you say, "Oh, I know just
who you should go see."

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:55.740
That kind of thing is actually very common.
And speaking of the toilet paper tube thing,

00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:04.350
Richard and I have had to engineer parts folded
from crafton plastic, that are collapsible,

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.180
and ended up in satellites in orbit now right
now.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.520
So our fingerprints, if they didn't clean
them up very well, they're in orbit right

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:19.339
now -- similar kind of shape, about the size
of toilet paper tube, and geometrically-designed

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:23.770
to collapse a certain way.
Hand-folded, sent off for gold coating.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.220
And, there you go.
So from toilet paper tubes to orbit.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.090
&gt;&gt; Hi.
This is Sally Rosenthal.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:39.160
I have a question and a comment.
Vanessa, I don't think people saw you when

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.560
you first went up there.
And since you're the director.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.410
Would you get in the camera frame please so
people know what you look like who are on

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.020
the other side of the world.
Just be in the frame so they can see you.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.100
And then, the other thing I have an unfair
advantage because I know what's going on,

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.801
but Chris has some hats that I know people
want to see.

00:17:50.801 --> 00:17:57.170
And I have one on.
Would you show that?

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:03.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I do have a collection of silly hats.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.600
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.961
&gt;&gt; I'll get that.

00:18:05.961 --> 00:18:06.961
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:12.070
&gt;&gt; And can you repeat the question please?

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.870
&gt;&gt; So, yeah.
There are other things that get folded besides

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:21.170
paper.
Jeff was indicating that I could talk a little

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:28.010
bit about folding in other mediums, specifically
textile, and a little bit of the history and

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:33.970
relationship of how paper folding and textile
folding have crossed in my work.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:44.310
So, well, here's okay. Small side thing on
silly hats just for a moment here.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.320
They make people look silly, but they do have
some fun math behind them.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:52.633
And they also have a technique for expressing
 -- now, this is called "paper engineering."

00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:57.600
This is cutting and folding.
Cutting and folding.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:04.790
Paper engineering.
And this is a way that meshes and computer

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:10.540
3D models can get out of the computer in a
way that wouldn't happen if it was happening

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:16.210
with glue, which is a way that people do paper
engineering and cutting and putting things

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:20.060
together.
These are, instead of accumulated air that

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.950
happens when you glue tabs together to make
3D models.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:27.290
Like, we're wearing these 3D models on our
head.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:32.380
This is self-correcting.
So, it's accumulated perfection.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.440
Just kind of a nice thing.
People aren't used to that.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440
They're used to little errors getting worse,
most of the time.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.920
So, these adjust, because they move a little
bit, because there's no glue on them.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:45.950
It's a little far away, but you can see the
connection in here.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:57.380
It's a little bit like a zipper, and it allows
for, as you put each little piece together,

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:02.240
they can still move a little bit.
And they want to move towards the perfect

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.290
place of the two edges of the face of the
mesh.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:09.670
So, I'd encourage that, when we do a little
mingling here, that everyone come and try

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.321
to put these hats on, please.
I like to collect silly portraits with the

00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:22.799
hats on, so I'd encourage a bit of that later.

00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:30.710
&gt;&gt; Yes.
So, here's a little bit of -- kind of, how

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:37.690
do things get folded in other mediums, textiles,
and some cross-relationship?

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:42.710
And also, a little bit of backwards process,
because this is a special demonstration piece

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.510
that we can see.
It looks -- I could have pasted these things

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.210
on here.
After watching this movie, you're probably

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.840
guessing that it's one piece of cloth, but
I could have pasted them on.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.990
If you'd never seen the movie, you might have
thought I pieced them on, lots of little pieces

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:05.960
to get this pattern on, but we get to see
the reverse process of this ordered thing

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.169
go to chaos and flat.

00:21:10.169 --> 00:21:14.610
&gt;&gt; And here's the -- we can see in low relief
the crease pattern.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.890
Yes?
And then it goes back, and this going back

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:24.310
part is not exactly like what I see when I'm
doing this cross, when I'm folding this.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:33.030
And this is a, kind of, classic folding of
where the lines of a tiling are expressed

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:40.900
as pleats.
And this style of folding is from a Japanese

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:47.860
teacher, [indistinct]__ Fujimoto, and I figured
out after sometime of doing the paper folding

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:54.380
style of these kinds of patterns where every
line becomes a pleat, there's some interesting

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:59.280
things about pleats expressing tilings and
lines because funny things happen at the vertices

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:09.850
that are unique to this expression of a folded
plane whenever the plane is paper or silk.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:14.930
One of the most remarkable and interesting
things about folding a piece of paper to do

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:20.240
this, and folding this silk is that, a piece
of paper is highly technical to do this because

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.590
we saw, as it came apart, there was all this
distortion.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:28.720
And if you try to fold this in paper and you
make all the creases and then push it together

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:34.000
there's a lot of distortion and the paper
needs to go through a very complex kind of

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.141
state before it gets to this final state.
And paper doesn't really want to do that and

00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:44.030
so only 30, 40 people in the world are really
good at doing that in paper.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:48.150
It's a highly technical, special niche in
origami.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:59.559
This is another, kind of, pleasant contradiction
or -- in that, this technique in cloth, if

00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:04.220
you do it a different way and take advantage
of the fact that cloth can be distorted, it

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:09.860
becomes a counter-example to, when we see
something complex, we always think it needed

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.310
something complex to do it.
And this is the counterexample.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.660
This is not a complex method.
It doesn't take skill.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:25.330
I can take a roomful of eleven-year-olds,
and they could walk away with a piece of folded

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.330
silk in a very complex thing.
You won't exactly believe me, because a lot

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:30.150
of crafts people will say, "Oh, my thing is
easy" and 30, 40 steps later it's not exactly

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.860
easy.
I could very well be one of those.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:41.460
But, this is a beautiful counterexample that's
a kind of an amazing thing that pulls down

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.630
a highly technical thing so that many, many
people can do it.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:49.000
It's a little bit like the right technique
like -- many people can do knitting.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.370
It's a simple little thing.
It produces complex things, and it has levels

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:58.610
of complexity within the activity, but the
right medium in the right kinds of expression

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:04.059
for that medium are coming together in a way
where, in cloth, that is true.

00:24:04.059 --> 00:24:08.090
And part of the interesting -- to tie back
to the origami story -- is that in order to

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:13.960
get to this cloth and this work and have it
be able to have its technique to be shared,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:19.820
it needed to come first from paper.
And that's an interesting story that's a little

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.540
more detailed.
But I'm glad to let you know a little bit

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:28.540
about that and share more than what's in the
movie and what's in the wider world out there.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:35.409
&gt;&gt; How did you plan to make this movie?

00:24:35.409 --> 00:24:39.780
&gt;&gt; Well, perhaps this would be relevant to
some people out there, who have a fascination

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:44.120
about something.
I first learned about mathematicians doing

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:50.240
origami about five years ago, and I was in
no shape, way, or form a filmmaker at that

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.820
time.
But I'd always had a kind of amateur interest

00:24:53.820 --> 00:25:01.809
in math, and generally more of a mathematical
person, but was looking for a way to explore

00:25:01.809 --> 00:25:08.790
the connections between math and art, and
how general creativity could be applied in

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:14.240
both ways, you know -- together or separately.
And so, when I heard about the mathematician

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:21.950
in the film, Tom Hall, who was making, as
you saw, some modular pieces that were so

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:26.260
mathematically-based, but also so beautiful
to look at, I thought that that would be a

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:30.950
nice, short film.
So, I decided to visit him, and I had hoped

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:36.320
to make a 7- or 8-minute movie about the mathematics
of origami.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.660
At that time, not knowing anything about what
I was about to get into.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:44.260
But as time went by, Tom Hall introduced me
to Michael LeFosse.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:50.340
And I slowly began to understand that what
fascinated me most about the art form was

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:57.270
not that, in fact, either mathematicians were
doing it, or heavy scientists or sculptors

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:02.820
or artists, but the fact that it was a medium
that drew all those people together or, at

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:08.160
least, attracted them because of its qualities.
And therein, I decided to explore the kind

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:13.390
of creativity that the scientists and the
mathematicians and the artists applied to

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.740
the medium itself.
And I felt that the metaphors about a square

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:24.140
of paper and the idea of this uniform accessibility
and democracy of the medium itself had a lot

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.110
to explore.
So that's how it happened, and then, five

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:34.260
years later, here we are.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.559
&gt;&gt; [clapping]
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:42.370
Richard Alexander here.
We just -- as artists and people involved

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.250
with origami -- we just want to thank Vanessa
for the wonderful story that she's told about

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:53.100
this group of people.
Going back several years, a lot of these people

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:59.040
were folding in relative isolation.
There were small conventions and a few publications.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.800
And when Michael and I opened the Origamido
Studio in 1996, I searched the word "origami"

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:09.559
on Al Gore's Internet, and I got about a million
hits.

00:27:09.559 --> 00:27:16.180
And, when we opened our show in Waikiki last
year, I did a Google search and found 32 million

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.210
hits -- something like that -- on the word
"origami."

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:21.210
Congratulations.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:31.010
&gt;&gt; Well -- not to sound too self-congratulatory
up here -- but, it's obviously an honor for

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:34.290
me to be able to work with the artists and
their artwork.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:38.330
We did put information about all of these
artists on the film's website, which is BetweenTheFolds.com.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:44.210
So if you go there, there's links to pretty
much everybody up here.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:50.559
So, oh, that's right.
They're in the area -- in the Bay Area.

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:54.700
In fact, Robert, maybe you want to talk about
 -- I don't know much about PCOC.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.350
&gt;&gt; So, there are origami conventions around
the world.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:01.809
And there is one called the Pacific Coast
Origami Convention.

00:28:01.809 --> 00:28:07.670
It's in San Francisco.
It's November 5th through 8th.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:14.220
About two hundred people, origami classes
at all levels, from beginner to extremely

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:19.480
advanced.
And, if you want to learn more about it, go

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:28.320
to the Origami USA website, origami-USA.org
or Google for "PCOC," "peacock," and you'll

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:35.410
find out what it's about and how.
Oh, yes.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.490
There is an exhibition, and that is open to
the public.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:51.410
So, you can just come to the exhibition if
you want.

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:58.950
&gt;&gt; We get asked a lot if the DVD is available.
And, as of about four days ago, we are thrilled

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:00.990
to say, "Yes, at our website, BetweenTheFolds.com."

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:05.460
&gt;&gt; The very first question -- I think it was
Jessie -- asked about papermaking, and the

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.690
DVD has a lot of extra footage that you didn't
see here.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:14.350
So if you are interested in the details, Vanessa
has provided information such as drill down

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.650
into the DVD.
Thank you.
