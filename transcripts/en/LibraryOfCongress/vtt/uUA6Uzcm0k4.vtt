&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.490
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Good morning.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.790
&gt;&gt; Class: Good morning.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.730
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: If you go

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.060
to Whittier Education
Campus, raise your hand.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.230
All right.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.490
Welcome first graders to
the Young Reader's Center.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.390
My name is Karen Jaffe.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.780
I'm head of the Young
Reader's Center,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.730
and you are in the
Library of Congress.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.800
Has anyone been to the
Library of Congress before?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.910
Terrific. Thank you.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.410
Well, that means that we hope
many more of you will come back,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.330
and come back to visit us in
the Young Reader's Center.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.630
Today, we have a special program

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.260
with our friends, "Everyone
Wins D.C."

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.390
who is bringing you together,
with us, for a special story time.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.900
And, today the story time is with
two Capitol Hill police officers.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.670
They are Renee White and Tech
Tiffany White, and guess what?

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.090
Hunter, the K-9.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.320
Okay? And, he's part
of this program.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.220
So, I'm going to ask
Officer White to read a story

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.970
about police officers,
and then Tech White

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.340 position:56%
and Officer White will be talking to
you a little bit about what they do,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.800
what their job is at
the Capitol Hill Police,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.360
and then you can ask
them some questions.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.030
Okay? So, we are going to ask
that you not ask any questions

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.830
until they finish with the program,
and then you can ask the questions,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.090
and then you'll have a chance
to meet Hunter yourself.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.500
Okay? So, here we go.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.800
&gt;&gt; Renee White: Good morning.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.100
&gt;&gt; Class: Good morning.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.000
&gt;&gt; Renee White: I will be reading
"Let's Meet a Police Officer."

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.660
&gt;&gt; Renee White: Officer White,
I kind of changed the name,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.080
because this officer's name
in here is Officer Gabby,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.870
but I'm going to say Officer
White which is myself.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.280
Today, our class is
having a visitor.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.930
We're going to find out
what a police officer does.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.210
We invited Officer White.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.590
She works at our school.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.720
"I keep our neighborhood safe"
says Officer White, "And,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.650
our school" says Madeline.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.570
Officer White is a
school resource officer.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.470
That's her assignment,
making students safe.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.180
It's her job.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.790
She stopped cars at the cross walk.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.090
She warns us about strangers.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.190
"Did you get your assignment
from police school?"

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.780
says Phoebe, the little
girl asked her.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.440
"From my police department"
says Officer White.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.790
"First, I was a patrol officer.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.780
It was part of my training.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.110
I worked hard.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.780
Then, I got a new assignment.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.080
We're happy."

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.880
See, she's very happy.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.150
[ Silence ]

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.860
Officer Tech White and
K-9 Officer, Hunter.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.160
Most officers wear police
uniforms, special clothes

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.810
and tools are part of this uniform.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.910
"1051 at 1422 Pine Street."

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.260
Officer White uniform is talking.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.560
"What's that noise?"

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.860
says Beckie.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.880
"My police radio" she says.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.440
Officer Tech White is on patrol.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.750
The radio is how she
shares information.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.640
Tech White works in
the neighborhood.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.660
She drives a police car.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.170
Some patrol officers use
helicopters, or boats,

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.860
others ride bicycles
and motorcycles.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.090
Still, others work on horseback.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.070
Patrol officers get
information on the go.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.000
They use technology to
help them do their jobs.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.100
Tech White has a K-9 partner.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.830
K-9 partners are also
called "police dogs."

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.630
Tech White K-9 partner
name is, "Officer Hunter."

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.410
Sniffing out things is
a K-9 partner's job.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.190
Officer Hunter finds
people in hidden objects,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.000
and he wears a uniform too.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.570
"Do officers have people partners?"

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.660
says Ben. "Many do"
says Officer White.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.600
"We also work with other officers
in different towns and cities,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.680
and states, and countries.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.340
By teaming up, we can
keep people safe."

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.000
"Go team safety" says Ben.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.770
Not all police officers
work in a neighborhood.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.310
State police patrol highways, they
keep roads safe across the state.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.270
FBI agents protect the country.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.100
They gather information
to fight crime,

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.000
and they help catch
people who break the law.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.330
Even we help Team Safety.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.770
We buckle up our seatbelts.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.210
We stand up against bullying.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.930
Even when there's trouble, we, in
the case of emergency, we dial 911.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.080
Officer White makes
our neighborhood safe,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.000
so we give our neighborhood
helper a hand too.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.800
So, you going to give me a hand?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.600
The end.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.500
[ Applause ]

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.530
Renee White: Hi.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.830
Good morning.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.130
My names is Officer Renee White.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.450
I've been a United States Capitol
police officer for 16 years.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.860
I started in 1999.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.880
What drew me to police
officers is because I

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.610
like talking and helping people.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.980
I like seeking resources,
as far as helping

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.840
and making sure everybody's
safe and sound.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.340
This work is kind of
diverse, and so you get

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.340
to meet a lot of nice people.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.530
See, I get to meet you, and I
get to meet members of Congress.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.660
I get to meet celebrities,
and everything like that,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.090
so it's kind of working
here on the Hill.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.810
And, you get to travel, I
don't get to travel much,

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.760
but I can travel if I like.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.680
But, it's been a good job so far.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.570
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Tell them where
you started as a police officer.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.940
&gt;&gt; Renee White: Well I started as a
police officer was, I used to work

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.090
in jail [chuckle] 1901 District,
and where you kind of lock them up.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.510
I started at the end, so this is
the beginning, and I was there

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.500
for like eight years
prior to me coming here.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.940
And, that was a little different
on the other side of the law.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.240
But, it was still fun
helping people.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.790
Yes.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.360
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Tech Tiffany, do
you want to talk about the dog?

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.780
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Yes.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.530
My name is Technician White,
and I'm considered a technician,

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:48.330
because I have a K-9, so that's
why this is Officer White

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.100
and this is why they
consider me Technician White.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.420 position:56%
But, I started here eight years ago.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:58.410
I had a job working in a
lab prior to working here.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.460
And, I started here
straight out of college.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.330
So, I came here because when I was
in school I had some professor's

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.960
and teachers who were
talking about law enforcement,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.170
and that was very interesting,
and so I decided to as oppose

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.150
to working in the laboratory.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.930
I applied, and that's
how I got here.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.070
So, I've been here for eight years.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.320
I started on the Senate Division
with a lot of our Senators

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:34.600
and congressmen first, and three
years ago I put in to join K-9.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.960
And, from there I joined
the K-9 unit and me

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.940
and Hunter started together.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.610
So, we started three years ago.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:46.770
Hunter actually came here from
Russia, so he's not from America.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.760
He was shipped here from Russia,

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.460
and purchased by our department
and we trained together.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.620
So, Hunter and I -- I
didn't know what I was doing

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.270
and he didn't know what he
was doing either [laughter].

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.370 position:56%
So, we learned together, and we went
through training for about 17 weeks

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.850
which is about three
and a half months.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.590
We trained day in and day out.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:16.300
And, then he graduated [up,
up, up] and got a badge,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.940
as you can see he got a badge so he
became an official police officer,

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.310
and then he came to live with me.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.470
So, Hunter lives at
home with me and he's

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.610
with me every day,
all day, every day.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.420
We rarely get time apart.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:39.490
And, his training is
specific to explosives.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.150
So, explosives would be anything
that could blow up, or explode

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:49.650
and a lot of what we're trained
to do on Capitol Hill is to go

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.610
in building, just like
this, we go on busses

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.160
that you see driving around here.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.480
We check cars.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.070
We check the grass.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:58.370
We check trees.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.400
We check every area around the
Capitol to make sure that it's free

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.800 position:56%
from anything that can
potentially explode and harm you all

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.040
or anybody else who would be
coming to the Capitol to visit.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.030
So, when you see the dogs out
there, generally they're working

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.500
to make sure that you're safe

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.630
and everybody else
remains safe on the Hill.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.500
So, it's very intense.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.910
It's a lot of hard training,
but it's very rewarding,

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.490
and it's good so that we're
safe and you all are safe too.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.570
Okay.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.970
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Okay, would
you guys like to ask questions?

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:39.810
If you raise your hand, and we
will try to get you a microphone

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.400
if we can, but they
will call on you.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.000
Okay, so one at a time
if you raise your hand.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.850
&gt;&gt; Student: Is it hard
to be a police officer?

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.700
&gt;&gt; Renee White: No, it's not
hard to be a police officer.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.930
There's just a lot of
training, that's all.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:06.040
Concentrating, training, a lot
of running when you first start.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.620 position:56%
But, you can tell I don't run no
more, s [giggle], 16 years not a lot

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.940
of running, but it's not
that much [inaudible].

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.240
Just enough.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.790
&gt;&gt; Student: Is it hard to be
a police officer with a dog?

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.090
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: With a dog?

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.390
Wow, that's a good question.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.890
It is not hard.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:32.420
Anyone can do it, you just have
to go through the training,

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.680
and you have to always [inaudible].

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.250
You know, you see me right
now with the dog and it looks

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.880
like he's playing,
he's always working.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.890
So, you got to keep that in mind.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.410
So, that's the only difference.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.970
He's always working.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.560
When he's here he's always working.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:55.150
Even if it looks like he's
playing, he's working.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.450
So, you have to pay
attention to that.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.750
So, it's not hard.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.050
With the right training and the
practice, you could do it too.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.190
&gt;&gt; Student: Why do
you have to catch --

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.410
why do you need cars
to catch bad people?

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:17.530
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Sometimes,
depends on where they're located

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.010
and you might not be able to get
there on foot, it's quicker to get

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.590
to them if you're in a car.

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.940
But, we don't just use cars.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.240
We have bikes.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.710
We have motorcycles.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.450
We have some agencies that
have helicopters, planes.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.330
So, cars are just one thing
that we use to catch bad people.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.000
There are other ways that
we can catch them as well.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.250
&gt;&gt; Student: Why do
you all use horses?

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.590
&gt;&gt; Renee White: Why do
we -- don't use horses?

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:49.700
&gt;&gt; Student: Why do you have horses?

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.960
&gt;&gt; Renee White: Well, we used
to have horses on Capitol Hill,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.930
but park police still have horses.

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:56.230
Yeah, they use them --

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.740
I mean because sometimes you can
get there just as quick, you know

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.510
and the park is the park,
so it's not a lot of cars

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.210
in the park, and it's easy.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:10.000
There's a lot of grassy areas to
use a horse as opposed to a car.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.810
&gt;&gt; Student: Is it hard
to train dogs?

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.990
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: That's
a good question.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.210
Actually, it's not hard,
but you have to have a dog

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.290
who is very willing to listen,

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.500
because if the dog doesn't
listen then it's not going

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.370
to be easy to train him.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.740
So, a lot of times when you go
through training you may have more

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:39.050
than one dog in the beginning
and you might just end

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:44.080
with the one dog that
listens to you.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.140
So, that's what's important.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.950
You have to have a dog that
listens, but more importantly

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.250
that dog has to listen to you.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.550
So, he's very trained to listen
to everything I tell him to,

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.850
so that's why he works well.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.970
&gt;&gt; Student: Why do you
work with the Army?

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.270
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: With the Army?

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.570
Why do we work with the Army?

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.090
It depends on specific
missions that we have,

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.340
or different assignments sometimes,
that may require extra help

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:14.130
and we can't do it all on our
own, so we'll work with the Army

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.430
to do things here on Capitol Hill.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.710
&gt;&gt; Student: My brother's
in the Army.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:24.970
So, you -- he uh -- so you --
so you -- you work for the Army?

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:30.000
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: No, we work
for the U.S. Capitol Police.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.180

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.630
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Do
we work with the Navy?

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.190
Sometimes, but very rarely.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.000
Very rarely do we work
with the Navy.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.530

you all have guns?

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:11.830

&gt;&gt; Renee White: That's
a very good question.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.620
As a police officer that's
part of the description.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:23.120
Carrying a handgun, and being able
to be equipped and trained to.

or the bad girl tries to shoot you?

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.580
Or, try to do something to
you, yeah [inaudible comment].

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.890

because we like to be liked.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.470
It helps our job [giggle].

Yes ma'am?

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.030
&gt;&gt; Student: So, you said the dog
came from Russia, so was it easy

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.900
for him to translate
to English [inaudible]?

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.310
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: No, and --
it was for me to learn Russian

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.810
&gt;&gt; Student: Or, for
you to learn Russian.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.110
Right.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:57.410
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Yes.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.410
Because, I had to learn
certain commands in Russian

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:05.660
when I first got him because that
was all he understood and so --

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:09.620
we would, eventually
keep using Russian,

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:15.510
and then repeat it in English.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.870
&gt;&gt; Student: How's his English?

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.910
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Oh,
it's good [laughter].

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:26.460
I don't even remember Russian, but
all he understands now is English,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.760
because that's all he's been using.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.060

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.120

about two weeks.

weeks [background comments].

&gt;&gt; Student: I don't have a
question, but I was going

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.320
to say something about the dog.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.620
We have a Rottweiler.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.920
My husband is a [inaudible]
police officer, and our dog came

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.220
from Germany, and so we had
to go through the same thing.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.520
I understand.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.820
&gt;&gt; Renee White: Yeah.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.120
&gt;&gt; Student: You know, we had to
learn a couple words in German.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.920
But, his training is.

[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.340
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: And
he was, when I got him,

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.070
he was two years old,
so he was still a puppy.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:59.080
He's six now so, it's easy
for him to understand.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.510
I didn't say that.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.000
He's a flat coated retriever.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.070
That's his breed.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:07.740
I don't know if you have
ever seen a golden retriever

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.170

coat is black as opposed to golden.

&gt;&gt; Student: Do you find that there's
any breed that trains better,

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.520
or it depends on the
dog [inaudible]?

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.590
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Honestly,
it depends on the dog.

have a lot of dogs.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.590
We have a springer spaniel.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.250

We have [inaudible].

We have German Shepherds,
and we have Retrievers.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.720
A lot of it depends on the
dog and the drive of the dog,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.260
their willingness to want to work.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.560
&gt;&gt; Student: Okay.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Yes, because it
could be another dog that looks just

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.650 position:56%
like him, but if they're not willing
to work, or do what's required

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.000
of them, then they wouldn't
be a good service animal, so.

&gt;&gt; Where do we put the
dogs and the bad people?

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.840
Well, they go to two
different places.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:35.670
The dog, he actually stays in the
car, and he also stays in a kennel.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.270
But, the bad people go in a place

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.630
like a kennel, it's
a cage in the jail.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.000

people who break the law.

&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Why
do we have dogs?

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.830
We use the dogs for their noses.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.930
Okay, their nose is
what keeps us safe.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:19:00.630
Their nose can detect a whole lot
of things that we can't detect.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:06.960
You know, have you ever been
to Burger King or McDonalds

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:12.150

you smell french fries?

&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Alright.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.150 position:56%
Okay, well the dogs, when they
drive up, or when they smell things,

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.800
they could smell the
grease in the french fries,

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.130
and they can smell the potatoes.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.060
They can smell the salt.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.690
They can break it down in that way.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:31.600
We smell one thing, but they're
able to break things down in

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.270
to multiple components,
or smaller things.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.920
So, that's why we use the dogs,
so they can detect certain smells

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.750
and scents in the air and builds in
to animal people, so that they know

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.050
if there's any danger
that has the consistency,

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.350

dog a boy or a girl.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.700
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: It's a boy.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.280
That's a good question actually.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.000
It's a boy, it's a boy.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.510
&gt;&gt; Student: What do
you use the dogs for?

[ Background Comments ]

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.340
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Okay,
I'll repeat it.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.600
We use the dogs to help smell
things to make sure that you

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.580
and everyone else stays safe.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.000
We use their nose to
help keep us safe.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.260
&gt;&gt; Student: So, you
said Hunter, right?

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.560
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Yes.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.450
&gt;&gt; Student: You said Hunter
is specialized in explosives,

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:51.280
and you also said that you
use the dogs for noses.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.810
How do they train Hunter to
identify certain explosives?

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.180
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Okay,
that's a great question.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:02.990
During our 17 weeks of training,
we will get various components

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:08.650
of explosive materials, and we will
train them based on those scents

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:13.250
to recognize the odors that
the explosives give off.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:19.240
And from that, they're able to
detect what it is that they need

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.110
to find to keep us safe, so.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.740
That's what we do in the training.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:28.000 position:56%
They specialize in particular odors.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.700
&gt;&gt; Student: Why do police
officers have badges?

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.740
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: That's
a great one.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.410
&gt;&gt; Renee White: That's
for identification.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.310
Identification purposes, because
her badge is -- it looks the same,

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.610
like hers is different than mine.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.310
Can you see them?

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.450
But, she has one that
looks just like this too.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.040
But, I don't have one that
looks like that [laughter].

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.750
Just to identify.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.040
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: So, that you
know when you see us we stand out.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.340
&gt;&gt; Renee White: We stand out, yeah.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.000
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: So,
we're easily identified.

two more questions [inaudible].

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.320
&gt;&gt; Student: How do you
capture the criminals?

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.850
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: How do
we capture the criminals?

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:15.660
There are a lot of
different methods that we use.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:21.550
It all depends on who the
criminal is, and where they are,

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.690
and how do we need to get them.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:31.430
Do we need a car, bus, train, feet?

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:38.920
We could use one person, we
could use multiple people.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:44.900
It just really depends
on the situation.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.390
&gt;&gt; Man: Alright, anyone who
hasn't asked a question?

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.690
Yeah?

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.990
&gt;&gt; Student: How do you
want to be a police?

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.290
&gt;&gt; Renee White: Huh?

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:52.590

you want to a police?

what we're going to do.
