00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.471
 Xenia wants to participate in a broccoli and carrot cutting competition. 

00:00:03.471 --> 00:00:11.216
 It takes the same number of seconds to cut a carrot or a head of broccoli. 

00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:19.800
 Its purpose is to cut at least 20 vegetables for 540 seconds. 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.814
 The graph below shows the set of all combinations of carrots and broccoli. 

00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:33.094
 Inequality A presents the set of all the combinations that Xenia wants to cut. 

00:00:33.094 --> 00:00:36.363
 Because she wants to cut at least 20 vegetables. 

00:00:36.363 --> 00:00:40.718
 So, inequality A suggests that she wants to cut at least 20 vegetables. 

00:00:40.718 --> 00:00:43.140
 All this blue colored area, 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.926
 which is dense, i. the right points are also included. 

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:49.830
 These are all variations in which she cuts at least 20 vegetables, 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.697
 all this blue area, including blue rights. 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.660
 Inequality C presents the set of all combinations, 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.478
 which she can cut within the specified time. 

00:00:59.478 --> 00:01:05.968
 So, inequality B is all the combinations in which it fits in the set time 

00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:11.360
 and does not use more than 540 seconds. 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.202
 What is the smallest number of carrots that Ksenia can cut and reach its goal? 

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:20.255
 She remembered she wanted to cut at least 20 vegetables. 

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:22.241
 You want to be in the blue zone. 

00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:25.500
 You want to be in the multitude of decisions about inequality A, 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.836
 which is in the blue area or on the blue straight. 

00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:32.364
 She wants to achieve her goal and meet the time constraint. 

00:01:32.364 --> 00:01:35.521
 But it must also be within the framework of the many decisions 

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.580
 for inequality C, so it also needs to be in 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.651
 the green area or the green line. 

00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:41.030
 So overlapping both, 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.886
 when it meets both conditions, 

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:48.380
 this is the whole area. 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.900
 This is the overlap 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.200
 of the two sets of solutions. 

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:02.307
 In this area of ​​overlap where is the smallest number of carrots? 

00:02:02.307 --> 00:02:03.940
 What is the smallest number of carrots, 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.016
 which Xenia can cut to achieve its goal? 

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:07.873
 If we look at here, the smallest number of carrots ... 

00:02:07.873 --> 00:02:10.253
 you may be tempted to say: "20 carrot, 

00:02:10.253 --> 00:02:12.425
 it is in the multitude of decisions. " 

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:16.629
 It's 20 carrots and zero broccoli heads. 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.310
 But you can also find a combination, 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.133
 in which there are even fewer carrots. 

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:22.596
 You can go right to this point, 

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:25.230
 because do not forget the points you make 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.390
 are also included in the plurality of the solution, 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.991
 because they are dense lines, not interrupted. 

00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:31.708
 So this point here, 

00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:34.843
 10 carrots and 10 broccoli heads, 

00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.491
 actually meet its purpose. 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.440
 So let me write it down. 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.320
 10 carrot and 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:50.340
 10 broccoli heads. 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.560
 Let me just write it. 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.760
 10 broccoli heads. 

00:02:56.765 --> 00:02:58.123
 So, this is the smallest quantity. 

00:02:58.123 --> 00:03:00.120
 If you want to find less than 10 carrots, 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.322
 in each of these variations there will be no overlapping. 

00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:06.649
 If you are looking for a way to cut 9 carrots 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.960
 and look here - at C equal to 9 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.286
 there is no overlap between the two sets of solutions. 

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:14.760
 So the minimum quantity here is 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.067
 the point of intersection of these two straight lines. 

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:18.774
 10 carrots and 10 broccoli heads 

00:03:18.774 --> 00:03:21.490
 is the combination at which she cuts 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.615
 the minimum number of carrots, 

00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:28.580
 to achieve both goals: 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.277
 to be within the time and cut at least 20 vegetables.
