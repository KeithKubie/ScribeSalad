Speaker 1:          00:00          And now to keep us in our oopsie mood. Here's another Cupertino oops. From language expert Ben Zimmer. So back in October, oh six Reuters, the news wire had an article about honeybees. And uh, there was some very interesting sentences in this article about honey bees, for instance. Did you know quote Queen Elizabeth has 10 times the lifespan of workers and lays up to 2000 eggs a day. That's why she's a very nice girl, but doesn't have a lot to say because there's all these eggs dropping on the floor with its highly evolved social structure of tens of thousands of worker bees commanded by Queen Elizabeth. The honeybee genome could also improve the search for genes linked to social behavior. So every time a clean reference came in, they were commanded to that particular queen. Whenever the words, the Queen appeared in this article, it had to be the queen. So the queen was being replaced with Queen Elizabeth, unfortunately in an article about honeybees. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:06          this next oop singular oop, wouldn't it be, I mean, if you have one, oop. Wouldn't be never heard that man sister a new clinic. Oop. This next one. It raises the question of, I guess you'd say, of moral balance. The question that I don't think any of us would want to have to answer comes to us from our producer, Lulu Miller. Okay, so set up this story a, this story happens where it's in a little town in northern Michigan called Myo 7:00 AM just drove through the Delaware water gap. That's me on my way out there from New York. The Sun is rising and it's about an 800 mile drive and it's just gorgeous out here. Listen to you. Lush and nausea. I know, but I'm just one of those people. When I get out into nature, I feel my in the world anyways. Crossed into Myo. What was the reason you were going again to see a bird?

Speaker 3:          02:07          A very, not just rare, not just the kind of bird birders get obsessed about this is a bird. This is what they call a life bird life. Birders wait their life to see it. Really? Yeah. Only found right here. What's the bird called? The Kirtland warbler. And have you, have you seen apparently before? No, I've never seen one. This is my first trip up here and this right here. Where are you? We're just outside of town on the edge of the forest about to go in and I'm standing with about 15 people who come from everywhere. Are you folks coming from to see this? Bert, Toledo. I'm from South Carolina. We're from Oregon, Wyoming. We'll walk out to a spot, try to stay single file park ranger leads us down a path into a little clearing and pretty immediately back ground there. Way Back there. The guy from Ohio, spots of Kirtland there. See good turn around the tiny yellow bird back there, right there. Up High in the Jack Pine Tree. Oh Great. It's singing like crazy. The lady from Dayton starts clapping.

Speaker 4:          03:11          Grab what you're saying. I see a lovely bird with a gray bag. This is a guy from Oregon, Jim Coleman, blue gray bag and his wife Frieda smaller than a rob and brilliant yellow in the sunlight is just an absolutely radiant bird. Yeah. Is this worth the trip tomorrow again? Oh, you bet. I don't know. It just makes me thankful that I'm here. So, and it makes me grateful that my wife is here. I know this is something she's willing to see a lot for a long time. I know Jim actually starts to tear up. It's a very special bird. Oh my hand. Yeah, that guy.

Speaker 3:          03:50          And that's what this story is really about. How special is this bird? Meaning well, how much is a species? Right,

Speaker 4:          03:58          right.

Speaker 3:          04:02          Um, well, here's the backstory. Okay. In the early seventies the warbler almost went extinct. The reason why it was thought was because of a little creature called the Calbert. I want to go in. Okay. That's just the sound of them. It's a parasite, you know, on someone who is this guy? This is Chris Mensing fish and wildlife biologist with the US fish and wildlife service. And we're standing in this cage full of cowbirds or looks like we've got six males and one female. Let me grab a couple. You just reached out and grabbed two of them. You can put it that and the males. Yeah, go ahead. Imagine a tiny little gnarly crow got really sharp little beaks, but with this blunt dagger like beats, very drab body. I'm very doll to, here's what the Calbert does to the warbler while the warbler is out of its nest, like getting a worm or something.

Speaker 3:          04:54          Yeah. The Calbert lay is one of its own eggs in the nest to make room for it. So the warbler doesn't know anything is up. It pushes out one of the warblers eggs. Oh yeah. To the nest. And the timing is such that the cupboard egg will hatch first and will double its size in 24 hours. Wow. So by the time that the host birds hatch, that Coburg may be up to four times the size and when they start begging for food, but parents, the loudest, most aggressive chick is going to get fed the cupboard chick. So the warbler mom ends up shoveling food into this Calbert chip. Yep. Oftentimes it gets so much food that another warbird chick will die. So when the cowbirds first showed up in this area in late 18 hundreds early 19 hundreds the warbler population just started plummeting. This huge drop by 1971 are only 200 males on earth.

Speaker 3:          05:40          Well, so what do you do? Are you asking me [inaudible] um, I guess you get to kill the cat. Exactly. Um, this is one of 54 traps and new one that we just built this year, which is why we're out in this cage. It's actually a cowbird trap. Oh, she did? Yeah, she, yeah, she bite me. They just like anyone else, get someone larger, grabbing you. They don't appreciate it too much. And so anyone know how to kill him? I kind of do. Yeah. Thoracic compression is the term we use. We basically squeeze the bird, suffocating and preventing it from breathing in your hands. There's no, Yup. Yup. Yeah. You have to do that. Yeah. Like all the time. Yeah. Did you see this? No, but 1972 fish and wildlife service sets up a bunch of traps a few years, and about 12,000 dead cow birds later

Speaker 5:          06:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          06:35          kind of the population stopped dying off, but then it didn't start bouncing back. What's going on? Why aren't we seeing bigger numbers now that we're catching the copperheads, that's Rita Harbison. She worked with the forest service back in the 80s and we thought well if we finally concluded it must be just, there is not enough habitat. Like they don't have enough trees. Well No, there are plenty of trees. But the thing about warblers is they like a specific kind of tree. They like them very young. They're like I'm young, but they like young trees is what you're saying. Yup. And there aren't young trees in this place? No. It's really weird. When when they started looking around this forest they noticed, well the trees were really, really old. Why wouldn't there be young trees? Well [inaudible] hey smokey bear seat. When humans began to settle in this area of Michigan in about the 1880s they brought with them that certain human disdain for fire.

Speaker 3:          07:48          The fire is exactly what's needed up there to make new trees. This ecosystem is a fire ecosystem says Chris, it burns. Cause when these trees burn, they release their seeds and make room for new trees to grow. It is a fire ecosystem. It is made to burn. So I ask you again, what do you do? Do you start fires? Would that be the solution? That would be the solution. While, so the forestry started doing, when we call a prescribed burn, basically it says Rita, they burned down a little patch of forest, a few acres to regenerate it and one windy spring day in 1980 at a place called Mac Lake. The forestry service started a fire that they probably shouldn't have. Okay. My name is Dick Lord. At the time of the Mac lake fire, I was part of the ignition crew for the prescribed burn. What does an ignition crew, uh, they liked the farm.

Speaker 3:          08:40          So at 10 in the morning, Dick and his crew go out into the woods when the plants start setting up perimeters and they begin lighting a few stands of shrubs. I was driving home, that's Bob Burner. Best name ever for firefighter. I could see for service starting to do a burn. And I thought this is not a good time. It was windy. They didn't have the man power. And I says, well, it probably would be getting called out here shortly. Basically we did not realize that whether it was going to change as rapidly as it did, the wind came up suddenly, something nobody could predict and it took the fire across the road into a standard mature Jack Pine.

Speaker 6:          09:25          [inaudible] flames, probably a hundred 150 feet in here. The sound is like a roaring train before his guys jumped into their bulldozers, trying to plow trenches alongside the pinch at all and I mean you can feel the heat. It was way out of our control hitting the tops of the trees rolling. I knew at the rate it was traveling that no one was going to be a major catastrophe

Speaker 3:          09:53          within six hours. It had burned over 20,000 acres. It's one of the fastest moving fires ever documented. Yeah. Well through here, far as you can see, it was all black. These are two guys I, Bob owned houses in the area that got burnt. I remember the guy down there in a corner. Yeah, grabbed it off during the drop. The Black Charlie, their houses were okay, but 41 houses were destroyed all the way up to the lake, so just completely, yeah, nothing green. No like something out of a moonscape fire. As you could see, everything gone and the worst part about it for all of us that's read a hell of a sin. Again, one set, it killed. One of the forest service employees, a very young wildlife technician who was very well loved by his coworkers. A guy named Jim Swiderski and old Jim was a good friend.

Speaker 6:          10:42          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          10:42          As well as an employee declared again, Jim's boss. He told me that Jim had been a postman for a few years, but just loved birds so much that he took a huge pay cut to come and help protect the warbler. Basically what happened was, oh, the fire overran him. Oh, the press was having a heyday just tearing into the forest service for what had happened. The towns, people were very angry at the forest service. How can you do this? Rita says, they were told not to wear their forest service uniforms in town. Gosh, it was so terrible in the forest itself. You know, there was nothing there. It was completely silent. But a year later, a little bit of green started to poke up in the next year a little bit more and eight to 10 years after that Mac like Bern just seemed like everywhere you turned around you'd stop for, listen, there were five or six birds, the tremendous number of person. That was the, the answer to the mystery, the fire. You know, if you look at a population graph, that's Christmas sing again. After that medical lake population

Speaker 4:          11:54          went like that, he points his hands straight up. And so it's pretty dramatic. Today the numbers are up to almost 4,000 birds and growing, seeing it like crazy now that the birds are back, but a man has gone. When you walk around this town, a question lingers in the air. Weiss was a fireman worth the life of a bird? Pick a woman.

Speaker 3:          12:30          No. My opinion it isn't. This is Ed Faucet. I wouldn't trade your life for a bird and sitting with him and his wife, Mary Jane and then in a diner. And no matter where you go in this town, government doing, people don't tend to be huge fans of the warbler. It's just a small bird. And I've been up here since 68 I'd never seen one. Did you ever see one? No, never have I seen it. And back to Ed, I just got to say to you, what would you think about it? If your father or brother were killed for a bird, be pretty hard to accept, wouldn't it? But if you zoom out one human life versus the end of a species, you know how many workers there are in the United States? Cause something like 37 species of warblers and the real number is actually closer to 60 that's kind of ridiculous.

Speaker 3:          13:26          And that's not all the asco. When are you done? And we really say never. Chris explained to me that they have to keep killing the cowbirds and they have to keep doing burns, smeller burns. But every single year if we let things be, the bird would be extinct. Wow. That's the hard thing about this job is knowing that we're never done. How many people are working, how much you're probably looking at hundreds of people. Well, over $1 million a year spent. All of this began to really sink in. I'm one of my last mornings out there. All right. It is five in the morning. It was the annual Kirtland warbler. Census were birders from all over the world show up to help count how many warblers there are out there. Is it like there is a warbler step that steps up? There's a warbler. Yeah. Yeah. That's actually exactly how it works.

Speaker 3:          14:17          I was paired up with this guy, Dave Mendez. We're going to kind of walk through the middle of these transects. We're going to come up. He's kind of a dude, dude. He's an older guy, got a beard and work for an electrical contractor. Told me he's got a man room and man room. You know, most guys got sports, but I've got Kirtland's warbler pictures up on the wall, so I went into it thinking like, this'll be really cool. We'll march along. We'll count it. I looked at the map. It was a mile maybe of a walk. We'll be done in 20 minutes. Well, okay, maybe not. We're rocking through the forest on our top and we set off dense brambly forest. Still Dark, so that was a hermit. Thrush. Okay. Let me just play you a quick little time lapse. 20 to seven right now the sun's just coming up and it's get a little muggy out here.

Speaker 4:          15:07          Yeah, it was a curtain. Oh yeah. Yeah. We can't count them though. He's not in our section seven oh seven I heard one way back that way. Yeah. Yeah. There it is again, but I'm not going to mark them then because I don't know exactly where he's at. Seven 33 there he go. Yeah. Nope. Right there. No, no, no,

Speaker 3:          15:31          no, nope. We want to be a lot more accurate. We want to triangulate them. Nine 56 in all's well in the warbler woods. A couple of anther biting me. Yeah, they hurt down there. They do a little bit. Yeah. Get Out of there 10:45 AM I know that there's a bird out

Speaker 4:          15:49          [inaudible] I can still hear that burden lay back there.

Speaker 3:          15:53          So we ended up staying out there for seven and a half hours. Just marked one, right? Yup. Only mark one. And I don't mean to sound like I'm making fun of Dave. I mean he's doing his job well, but at some point in between the fire ants and taking four hours to confirm this one bird, he's going to be right off. I just started thinking about all the effort. It takes Rosa trees over from us and I can't see them. I just suddenly thought it's this Fussy, fragile little bird and it hasn't evolved. Who Cares? Yeah. I mean this is not worth it. And so I started asking people who protect the bird, why do that with so much money? And it's all for a bird. And I could see it maybe if it was for some, but it's just one warbler of 18 million different kinds of warblers.

Speaker 3:          16:44          Like, why do it? Well, we do it cause we should, you know, we're stewards of the land. That's Chris Mensing again. Cowbird killer. It's for future generations and well, here's the firestarter Dick Lord. You know the Kirtland's warbler was listed under the endangered species act and we had a charge under the law to do what we could to recover its existence. And that's the only thing that I can say that all we had to do, what the law required us to do. So we should do it and the law tells us we have to do it. Unconvincing and that question is a little wife of a farm on worth the life of a bird and that guy at at the diner, it just stuck in my mind and I realized I couldn't leave this town until I talked to the people who lost the most. I just skated and introduced yourselves. Yeah, sure. Robert Sweaters, ski age 54 Kathleen Sweater Ski, Florence [inaudible] Ski, the mother, mother and the mother. The guy died. Yeah, I that's it.

Speaker 1:          17:50          What? Iced tea or water even. We're all sitting around the kitchen table, dogs and beer over there. Jim's brother-in-law's there. Twos off. Kevin, Kevin Debris and I asked them to tell me about Jim. Quite a guy. Soft spoken. Smart. Quite a character. Yeah. They told me at first they were furious. They should have never ever sent him in there. Angry at the forest service. Angry about this bird. No. Very angry. Now, three decades later, I say you keep that a little bird calling. Exactly. Really? Jim's younger brother Robert said that the thing he wanted the most is for the Kirtland's warbler to become the state bird by that. That would be the ultimate, Huh? That would be the biggest accomplishment ever would be that be in a state bird.

Speaker 3:          18:39          Wow. I guess I'm, I'm, I guess in some ways I'm surprised like I didn't mean to come here with expectations, but in some ways I thought if it was my family that I would hate that bird. I would just hate that bird. No, it's not the bird. I mean that bird didn't do anything to any of us. Right. You know, if we can keep it going, I mean that's what he set out to do. Let's keep it going. They think about Jim's death.

Speaker 1:          19:04          Any of the military guys like the death of a soldier, where would you be setting right now? We would have lost all those soldiers in world war a war, World War II. He died protecting, you know, it's only one species. Well then this could be another species and another species in another species. Next thing you know, you walk out in the morning and it'll be quiet. Thank God for the Teddy Roosevelt and the boys that made our national parks. Imagine what if we didn't have those? It costs money. It's painful, blah, blah, blah. You gotta have the guts to do that. And Jim was really that kind of guy. Now that is convincing. Yeah, but I mean, do you agree for us? And I asked the mom, what can I say? The bird could come in back, but the life was gone.

Speaker 3:          19:59          So why bring it up again? It's done. It's, you can't bring it back. So you have to live by that. But there's always a hole in your heart, something that none of us will ever forget forever. Don't ask me any more questions, please.

Speaker 1:          20:20          Okay. And then, Oh, good. Oh, the power went out. Give me a break. Oh. Oh, cool. We go home and get the generator.

Speaker 7:          20:45          Where do you go Lulu? Miller.
