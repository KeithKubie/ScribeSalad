00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.030
As an app developer, the
biggest problem you have

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.920
is how can I show my
wonderful creation

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.890
to every user possible.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.950
And this isn't as
straightforward

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.890
as tell your friends.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.790
Users today are informed
and use different channels

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.490
to find, understand,
and get apps.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.460
Did you know that
three out of four users

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.830
do some kind of research
before installing an app?

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.060
Among all of those
informed users,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.050
how do you attract new,
interested users that

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.920
will generate revenue for you?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.580
You don't just want
a ton of users.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.410
You want a ton of users
who love your app.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.090
So how do you wade
through the herds

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.460
of less-than-interesting
users for the ones

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.290
that truly matter for you?

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.490
Here are three
recommended methods.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.720
To attract new users, you could
run an app install campaign

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.000
on Google search.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.330
These ads will be shown just to
users who don't have your app.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.300
To find the users
that are potentially

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.239
most interested in your app,
use installed app category.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.380
It can find new customers who
have already installed apps

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.850
from related categories in
Google Play Store or the App

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.500
Store.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.930
And to find high-value users,
use paid users targeting.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.990
It enables you to show ads to
app users who have previously

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.420
made purchases.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.030
For Android, you
could also show ads

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.000
to only those users who
have made an in-app purchase

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.780
within a certain category.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.670
In order to use this
tool effectively,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.250
you need to understand these
terms, average revenue per user

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.690
and lifetime value.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.530
Why?

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.980
Because you can't manage
what you can't measure.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.930
Average revenue per
user-- ARPU, if you

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.480
wish to sound like a
pro-- is a simple ratio

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.430
that divides the revenue by
the number of users in a time

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.650
period.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.510
It gives you additional
insight into how your campaign

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.230
is really performing.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.170
It's not rocket science.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.680
If revenue goes up
and ARPU goes down,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.760
you're not attracting
users that spend.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.270
Not so good.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.850
If revenue goes up
and ARPU goes up,

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.600
you are making more
money out of your users.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.820
Good.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.480
Besides average
revenue per users,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.750
there's another handy metric
called lifetime value, or LTV,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.950
which is a new report in
Google Analytics for apps.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.430
It allows you to understand
the value of your users

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.920
to your business.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.700
Rather than looking at
an isolated session data,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.100
you can instead look
at the ongoing impact

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.710
users have from the
date of acquisition

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.060
and through the rest
of their activity.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.360
Lifetime value is
especially important

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.620
if you're running a user
acquisition campaign.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.830
Your acquisition cost
per user is should not

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.060
exceed the user lifetime value.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.230
So what happens when you combine
average revenue per users,

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.770
lifetime value, and our new API?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.750
Well, a developer
GREE tried just that,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.670
and ended up seeing
five times improvement

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.138
to their monetization.

00:03:01.138 --> 00:03:01.638
Excellent.

00:03:01.638 --> 00:03:03.100
[CHEERING]

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.800
On the next episode, we will
see how to make money in games.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.270
Cool?

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.450
Until next time,
eat your vegetables,

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.565
increase your users
lifetime value,

00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:13.690
and listen to your partner.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.040
