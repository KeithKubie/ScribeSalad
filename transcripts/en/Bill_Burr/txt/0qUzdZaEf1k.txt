Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on is bill burn? It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and Ah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       ah,

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       yes. Checking in on you. Uh, March 29th. Oh my God. This month is almost, oh,

Speaker 1:          00:00:22       did you have a good month? Well, that's good. Um, I just have so much stuff to talk about. I don't even know where to begin. First of all, last night I watched the first hour and a half of that, the zen of Garry Shandling, the Judd Apatow documentary on the great genius Gary Shandling. And I'm, I got to tell you, judge, did that Guy Proud? It's unbelievable. You have to see it. A comedian buddy of mine told me, he goes, dude, have you seen this thing yet? You got to see it. Thank God he told me about it and I went and I recorded this goddamn thing, you know, and I'm telling you right now, you got to see him. All right? I told you last week you have to watch Barry. If you sat down and you watched Barry Storing Bill Hader, uh, Henry Winkler and all those guys, uh, you know, I was right.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       Okay. When are you gonna learn to trust when I tell you something on HBO is going to be good. Um, anyways, I was watching that documentary and I guess Gary Shandling just kept diaries. His whole life was basically his entire life and he was writing all this stuff and overcoming fear and trying to get better as a comedian and a, it was like Erie watching, like how much I related to it because I never kept a diary. I tried one time, I was just too walled off emotionally. I remember I wrote like one line, my name's bill, I'm 28. I'm a stand up comedian and that's as far as I got.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       And then I think I threw that book out so it's biodegrading somewhere cause it's made out of paper. Um, but anyways, I used to always, I would write down on cocktail Napkins, dad, right. Commit to everything, be positive. I actually used that thing, you know, in the Catholic Church, I can't remember the part of the mass where you do the sign of the cross on your forehead, your mouth and then over your heart, which means you know, God in your mind, you and your mouth and in your heart or something stuff. Like I used it as like a positive side rather than, you know, God's only son died on this thing that I'm now fucking drawing on my face. I actually, I use it as like a positive side, like no negative thoughts. Um, I don't know why I thought I'd put a positive sign of, of my mouth so much to the Shit I say is fucking curmudgeony at best.

Speaker 1:          00:02:48       But it was just more just committing to everything. And um, cause when we first moved down to New York, it was intimidating thing. And uh, I get on my heels and then I wouldn't have a, and then I'd have to wait like another five, six days before get stage time again, just fucking hating myself for going up there and acted like a little guy. Um, although you're not supposed to say that now, right? That's not progressive. You know why you saying that? You're acting like a little girl. Okay. Okay. I was acting like a, somebody who's gender neutral. Why can't you just say that she was scared without insulting the opposite sex? Well, I don't know, I guess, you know, I guess I guess said something. I need to work on there. I happy. Yeah. Okay. Kay, can you shave your legs?

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       Um, AH, fuck. I have fun. Last night on stage, man, I went up and I was just, I'm sick of a bunch of shit in my act and I was just like, I'm not talking about any of that shit. And I just meandered, meandered is the key word there. But I had a good time. I apologize to the crowd, but I, you know what units? It was a fucking Wednesday. All right. Wednesday's a work day. Um, but anyways, it's a wonderful week. It's a wonderful week in Los Angeles. Nothing's on fire. No one got me to evidentaly. They got all the crepes. Um, all right. Oh, I got to promote here. Bar still rough and rowdy. If you've missed the last few podcasts, first of all, it's one of the great paper views you're ever going to watch. It's just regular people that enjoy fighting. They want to get on TV and they are willing to fight each other.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       Okay. It's like, I don't know, I don't even know how to describe it. It's a, it's a juggernaut and it's like 15, 16 bucks and a, I'm going to be at the next one and I will be ringside announcing even though I, I bet, I know the jab is, I know what a hook is. Overhand, right. I know what a straight writers too, cause I watched the documentary, uh, leap boom by, yeah, I watched that a long time ago. But other than than that, I'm just going to be making fun of Shit. Like I always do. And hopefully one of those regular people won't try to beat the crap out of me afterwards. Um, I dunno. I'm so fucking excited for it. And uh, that's going to be on April 13th. Okay. You guys, I'm telling you, I, I'm, I'm, I'm telling you, you got to fucking see. You got to see the shit.

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       You know, you don't have to, you know, if you want to miss out and then not know what anybody's talking about. Come Monday when you standing around the fucking water cooler. Um, and, uh, this is the last promo thing I have to do. Um, we've added some shows. If you want an updated list of the shows to see possibly come and see my ignorance live, uh, go to bill bird.com. Dot Events for an updated list of shows. I hate doing promos in the beginning of the podcast because it just kills my fucking flow, you know, now I just feel like I don't, you know, like I'm sitting in a fucking waiting room. I don't feel funny anymore. I don't know who I am. Um, oh, here's one for you. The theme of this podcast, this half hour is, is, is late to the party. All right? And, um, which is really a theme to my life. Okay. I was late for everything. You know, I stayed back in first grade. Boom, right there. I was just a year behind my whole fucking life. All right. I wasn't late getting my driver's license. I got that thing immediately. The day I was eligible. I did the old right there. Fred took it on a stick shift too. It's one of the main, that's probably the only manly thing I've ever done in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       I had no choice. That's all we had in our, in our family. We always had sticks shifts. Um, cause they were fucking cheap. Um, also it's more fun. You fell you'd drive in the fucking car instead of just getting in some go cart down there. I hate automatic transmission. You know, there's only a few left out there. I think the, uh, the Volkswagen Gti, there's one or two BMWs is probably a Porsche. That's something interesting. There is something that I could look up. How many standards? Standard treads mission cars left in pro duction. All right. The disappearing stick shift. Less than 3% of cars sold in the u s still have a stick shift. All right. 2017 cars that still offer a manual transmission. Let's see what we got here. Well, we have is slow Internet by the way. My buddy called me up and you know I have a deli, missed this amazing Celtics road trip where they went for no coming in there.

Speaker 1:          00:08:03       The walking wounded, everybody's out and all the young kids is stepping up. And last night they played the Utah Jazz and I guess, uh, was a Jaylen brown almost said Jalen rose hit a three point and a winning. I heard Jason Tatum stepped up. Uh, I'm sure I'm missing it. I'm missing by, I have to miss it. I got the kid, I got the kids. So I, uh, if you guys want to know what's going on with the new episodes of muppet babies, I'm on. I'm on that. All right. Gonzo Baby Gonzo had some little chicks and in the beginning of the episode, Foz a little Fozzie bear is doing is bad jokes. And he went to open his mouth and it sounded like a fart noise. And somebody goes, hey, you should say, excuse me. And I was like, Holy Shit. Is this going to be about passing gas and how you handle that in a public forum like this really progress compared to the shit that I saw as a kid.

Speaker 1:          00:08:58       You know, it was just the alphabet. They didn't deal with bodily functions, but that wasn't the point far as he goes. I didn't make that noise and they looked up and they saw that there was all these geese were flying south for the fucking winner. So then God so got all fucking afraid that chickens, we're going to fly south in. Selfishly, even though chickens don't fly south south for the winter, they're doing it for survival. But selfishly Gonzo is so fucking needy. He tries to, you know, keep hiding the chicken so that the mother, it's weird. It's like they're all little fucking puppet animals and then there's like a real person that kind of takes care of them and bring some lunch and shit. There's like this sort of like, I don't know what's going on there. Some sort of muppet beastiality that this woman had all of these kids, I have no idea.

Speaker 1:          00:09:46       You know, and evidently fucked a frog and a bear and all kinds of ship or it, I don't know. One of them is hers a pig. So anyways, I'll fucking episode this. Goddamn, I don't know what he is. He's like a a vulture. Maybe I'm a two can, I don't know what he is. He's trying to hide these fucking chickens. And in the end, uh, the mom, you know, the, uh, the puppet groupie there, she comes out and she says like, listen, you're dumb little fuck chickens do not fly south for the winter. They're going to be in the coop. They're going to be fine. And then Gonzo is all happy in. What upset me was that the chickens didn't get mad at him. In the end, they should have been like, wait a minute, she'll like for your own selfish needs, we would have fucking starved to death just because you're, you're, you're so fucking codependent.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       And then of course he would try to talk his way out of it being like, well, I mean it doesn't really make a difference cause you don't fly south anyways. He says, yeah, yeah, but you didn't know that digit guides up. You didn't know that and you will fucking contend. What the fuck are we going to stay outside the fucking snow. You can't. You're crooked. Bigged cunt. And then God's, I'll be like, I always knew that you thought I was less than other people fight and then he would make it about his fucking nose. See, that's why you can't, you got to stay on topic because I just fucked up the argument for the chickens. Don't make fun of his beak. You keep it on, on, on topic. I should say. He keep it on fucking topic about the fact that you're a codependent cycle and you had information that you knew that as far as you knew was pertinent to my own fucking survival.

Speaker 1:          00:11:32       And you kept that to yourself, didn't you? You little cunt. So that's the shit that I've been watching. Um, I know the Bruins it there, they were doing well and what are the, see, what have I done? What have they been doing? They lost in a shootout to Columbus five, four. They lost in overtime to one to St Louis. So there's two points. We go, we beat Dallas. There's four points for that week. Four of a possible six. I'd say that's a good week. And then this week we beat Minnesota. And over time that's two points. Then we lost in a shootout to win a pig. Uh, so we've got three out of four points cruising along.

Speaker 3:          00:12:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       Now we've got a couple of home games against the Florida teams, the Tampa Bay lightning and the new fucking a broad street, the Southbridge speech bullies and the Florida panthers with the most fighting fucking mansion in the league. I mean, I think they, uh, I think they're almost going to have 30 fights this year. I mean, those people are out of control. Oh, it's fucking assholes. They all wrote, they all ruined the Goddamn game. That was fucking constant watch Olympic hockey. Not even them. I can't even blame them. It's just people that aren't content with being millionaires. They want to be billionaires and now they have to fucking, let's just level it out. Let's mainstream it up. Let's alienate our core fucking fed base.

Speaker 3:          00:12:58       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       And try to get all these fucking douchebags that watch the Kardashians to fucking watch rivalry, rivalry Wednesdays, which they're not going to do. All right. And the theme, this is good. Everyone. Did you guys write in and tell me how, you know, let me hear your late to the party stories. I got married late. I had a kid late. I started stand up leg. I stayed back in school. I got laid lake. Yeah. I fucking had go to summer school. I was just always, everybody, every, everybody was always like turning the corner. I was always like,

Speaker 4:          00:13:29       why not? Weird for me.

Speaker 3:          00:13:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:34       I become progressive. Like

Speaker 3:          00:13:37       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       My ideas of, of, of, of of everything else is like from fucking 20 years ago. So here's another thing that I am, I am 30 fucking years late. I am so late to the party on this band that they're actually doing their farewell tour and half the people aren't even in the band anymore to what are the first two original members? So,

Speaker 3:          00:14:03       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       Doing the goddamn comedy jam and all of that and like trying to do, you know, pat terror and learn these, these double bass drum songs. Uh, now I, and then, uh, my Trump teacher, Dave took me to go see miss sugar. All of a sudden that whole world opened up to me. So now I'm backtracking to all of this shit that I vaguely remember. My younger brothers, they were into it go going, you got to hear this shit. And I was listening to a ribose has it. So

Speaker 4:          00:14:36       it's like a that edits.

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       No,

Speaker 4:          00:14:43       just that a cow. Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       you know, you're singing along. Six is say, say that's a good fucking song. I listening to that shit. And uh, when Metallica and all these other bands came out, it was so fucking fast. I, I just, my ear couldn't catch up with it. And now I'm going back 30 years fucking late. I, so guess what album I fight downloaded yesterday? Slayer, south of heaven. I was watching, I don't know how I, I just was watching, like trying to learn, you know, all this double Bass Shit. I was just on this youtube thing. And then eventually if you're going to do that shit, eventually you're gonna run into Dave Lombardo and slayer. So it was like, I got to fucking see that. I go why? I watched this mini documentary I guess is a new documentary coming out on him. So I watched this older one from like 2004 and um, I've always tried to get into the band and it was just always, it was just was beyond what my ears understood.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       So I heard that song south to heaven and that's it. I'm done. So I love that album. And I guess that was an album they play, made a conscious effort to play a little slower than they did on the previous album. That's the one that has like angel of death. And I listened to that one a little bit now is like the south they have and I'm going to fucking, I got to, I can't go from like, you know, listening to poison and Bon Jovi and all this shit that I listened to to immediately going into that level of speed. You know, that's like, that's like when he's sober person after 20 years decides to start partying again and they pick up where they left off, you're going to have a fucking heart attack. So I have to kind of ease my way into it and this fucking album, which I guess, you know, Moron fans of musical fresh, it's not fast enough, like saying like, that doesn't even make sense. It's like, is it a good fucking song? So I have just been listening to south of Heaven and whatever the song is after it, because they do that thing where it just sort of blends into it and it's fucking hilarious. I'm going to be 50 in June and I'm finally listening to slayer and up driving down the street, pulling up to red lights.

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       I got it. I fucking love it. So, uh, late to the party on that one 30 years late. And I know I'm going to listen to this fucking album a million times and then I'm going to get a angel of death. And I remember a long time ago I had that, uh, I had the, uh, the, the Iowa album. Oh, what's the name of the band there? Jesus Christ with Jody Jordan said, and all those guys, eight, seven check debt. Thec five bore. The fuck is in now. Jesus Christ. Don't say that. I almost said no, they were, they were the mass. They were the eyes watch. Ah, fucking what am asshole. You know what I mean? Listen, I know who the big four hours anthrax, anthrax, slayer. Megadeath Metallica. I at least know that. Okay. I'm an I'm new to this. Please. Please be gentle when you trash me on social media for not knowing, uh, shit. Thrash Iowa masks. Let's see what this comes up with. Why can't I know the name of the drummer but not the name of the band, but the fuck does that say about me? Huh? Oh, speaking of which I did the, I did the goddamn comedy jam. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:16       okay, so now they're showing me slip. Not Fuck. That's right. That's right. Okay. It's funny, the first thing that came up, why these 11 bands wear masks? I Dunno, cause they're smart. They want to have a life after this show's over.

Speaker 3:          00:18:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       Oh, that's the best thing ever. Like that bucket head. It's fucking genius. He gets to fucking go around the world and guns and roses and all these awesome beds. And then the second he doesn't feel like being that guy anymore. He just takes the bucket off his head and the mass goes away. You know, probably puts it up in a man bun or something. Looks is non rock. God is possible. It just fucking walks away like what's his face at the end of the usual suspects, you know, straightens out his foot and just walks right through the crowd. No one has any fucking idea. Um, anyway, so I did the goddamn comedy jam. Uh, thanks everybody. You know, I played the, uh, I played, uh, was it Panthera cowboys from hell and uh, I thought I had it down. I thought I knew what I was doing.

Speaker 1:          00:19:32       I got out there, my Vinnie Paul Costume, I, I actually, I almost said postmate it, I fucking, uh, instagrammed it. I grabbed it. Yolo, my young again. Um, the costume that I wore and uh, that was probably the best part of the performance was the costumes looking asshole. You know, Vinny, he's, you know, he's a Husky fellow, right? So I had like a pillow or a throw pillow underneath is this fucking shirt and like a fucking asshole. When I sat down behind the drums, like I, I didn't take it off. I sat there, so it was like I had a kid or something sitting on my lap and the snare was a little lower than I was used to. So I fucking got through the song. I think I fucked up every single Phil and I got that. Am I already suck at drums? Why would you add to difficulty with a pillow and your fucking chest and this thing up?

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       You know why? Because it's the comedy jam. There has to be some sort of comedy. So I just look, my double bass playing still whole fucking thing sucks. So then the closer was, um, was a def Leppard pour some sugar on me, which was a song that I absolutely fucking, and not necessarily because it was a bad, it's a pop song for what it is. It's a great fucking song. But here's the reason why I hated it was because in 1988 my buddy got that fucking tape. Okay. And all he did was listened to that fucking song. Like why don't, can we listen to animal? Can listen to hysteria? No, no. He just kept fucking, I remember the time, he didn't really know the lyrics, but anytime I would get to pour some sugar on me, he'd be like pumping his fist pause.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       So was doing the song right and thank Christ we got out of the middle part where there's all that busy bass drum shit that, ah Ha, well that old shit, right? We got through all of that, that whole breakdown thing. And then we're right in the end and I go to hit the bass drum and no sound comes out of the bass drum. And I'm like, what the fuck? And I looked down and my bass drum Beta had fallen off right in the middle of the fucking saw. So fortunately I had the double pedal, so I just, I just played the, the left one for the rest of the song. Nobody really noticed, um, until they got to the end of the song. And I had to do all my, my songs, fillers and I had nothing. Oh, it's Paul [inaudible]. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast. Mr. Paul Versey.

Speaker 3:          00:22:07       Paul, can you hear me?

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       Hey Dude, I'm doing, I'm doing my podcast. Somebody call you back. I'll be done in about 15.

Speaker 3:          00:22:14       All right, let's see. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       you know, so that, that all of that shit happened. So I had such fucking, I hope so. I'm like, I'm going to fucking murder this song. And I did in a, in a bad way. I butchered it. Um, but my standup set, the thing that actually do for a living was actually really fun and it was fun to go out there. I wasn't really being Vinnie Paul, I was just acting. I was just speaking in a southern accent and I was talking positively about Ar 15, which is such a fun thing to do,

Speaker 3:          00:22:51       um, in Hollywood

Speaker 1:          00:22:54       is to dress like a cowboy and then say why you love Ar 15. So I mean, why, why wouldn't, why wouldn't you do that? All right. So anyways, late to the party, got into parent, Tara could have seen them live. My younger brothers were going to go see them. I was like, Eh. [inaudible] I think I'm okay. I think Mr Right. And I didn't go see them.

Speaker 3:          00:23:18       Uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       just, I don't know when the, when the fuck did the 1990, they came out, we're talking, I am literally 30. I'm 30 years behind the fucking 30 years late. Wherever the party was. Like the fucking building doesn't even exist anymore. How fucking late I am. All right. Continuing, continuing with the late to the party fucking theme here. All right. I finally watched the first moto GP race and Qatar's that say it and I gotta tell you something. Okay. For those of you not into it. That is a professional, uh, motorcycle racing at its highest level. It's the formula one of motorcycle racing. And I have to tell you something right now. I don't know why I have to tell you that. I'm going to tell you something. I should just fucking, you know, cause I watched friends, Mcdermott Dermot, right? I'm going to say something, right. I'm going to say something that fucking sport.

Speaker 3:          00:24:12       I'm

Speaker 1:          00:24:13       completely fucking sold on it. I am a big fan of Andre de Vizios. So who drives the Ducati and Italian? Right? I just fucking, I like love the way rides. I know Mark Marquez is like the fucking Derek Jeter or this sport. So whenever I get into a new sport, you know, it's like Lewis Hamilton. I'm not going to come into, you know, oh, this is my first year of watching Formula One, my favorite drivers, Lewis Hamilton, the guy who, fuck it always wins. Um, so I can't be a markable Aila. I like Mark Marcus. I'm not saying I'm not a fan, but it's just, I can't be like some bandwagon guy. So the CEO. So it was a guy watched last year and I was just like, I like this guy. He's always, you know, he's always up there, you know, on the podium or whatever. He's calming. I liked him and I liked a Johan Zarko. I just liked his bike and he was always up there and he seemed like he didn't have as good a bike is other people that he was somehow fucking with those guys. So I watched the first.

Speaker 3:          00:25:10       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       I watched the first race and uh, I had missed all the qualifying nic. Johan Zarko has pulpit position. I was like, Holy Shit. Last year his whole story was like, this guy is like right there, but shit just kept happening. Um, and he didn't quite get over the Hump and areas. The first race of the year, the guys got the pole position. So I watched the race. And by the way, if you think this is a big time commitment, it's like 22, 23 fucking lap. She can watch the whole race in 40 minutes. There's no pit stops. And by the way, it's people racing on motorcycles going over 200 miles an hour. Now they're going to say kilometers. So it's simple math. Every 80 kilometers is 50 miles an hour. Okay? So a lot of times they go in like you know, 240 kilometers. That means they're going to buy 150 miles an hour. And then on the straightaways, when they go by, all the fans to start finish line, they will get up over 300 320 when they get to 320 they go, they're going 200 fucking miles an hour

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       on a motorcycle and there's someone right on their ass and they have a big fucking turn that they have to slow down for. And the big fucking move, who has the balls to break last usually comes out of the turn the fastest. However, if you go with, if you brake too fucking late, you might go to widen the guy who will cut into neath IA or you could go flying off your bike and die. All right. Now, if that's not enough excitement for you that I, I don't know. I don't want to tell you. So anyway, so I'm watching this race and hand Zarko in the lead for the whole fucking race and they keep talking about his front tire cause he's averaging like, I don't, I don't know what they're, his average was like one 50, 150 kilometers. Uh, which would be what, oh, Jesus built.

Speaker 1:          00:26:58       That's like a little over a hundred miles an hour is what he was average. And that's, you know, with all the turns slowing down and all that shit, right? Um, I'm sitting there watching this fucking guy and I'm like, Holy Shit. Is this guy going to go wire to wire and winning and they keep talking. This was something, I need people into this, this, uh, into racing to explain to me. They just kept talking about yo hands Arccos front tire and saying it's eventually it's going to wear down and he's going to have a fucking problem. And before it happened to him and happened to Valentino Rossi and all of a sudden, like he was in second place and all of a sudden on one lap he got, um, he got passed by like two people. But then it's like he made this adjustment, which is why he's evidently the one of the greats of all time.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       And he was able to come back and still make the podium and come in third place. But when it happened to Zarko, he just, he got passed by two people at the same fucking time. You went from first place the whole race down to not even be in on the fucking podium. And then he ended up finishing eighth. And why doesn't he have the same fucking tires as the other guys? How come, how come his tires are wearing down faster than other people? What the fuck does this Zarko guy have to do to get the best shit? I know, I'm probably fucking this up. So anyways, uh, to vizios so right. He was like in ninth place starting the race. So I was kind of keeping an eye on him, you know, like what's his face when I was watching the Formula One when uh, Valtteri Botox started way in the back because of the gear shift penalty, uh, changing out the gearbox fucking a penalty gear shift penalty, the gearbox penalty and um, I just watched him slowly move his way up through the field and then the last two laps of the race.

Speaker 1:          00:28:44       Okay. He's in first place. Mark Mark has is in second place and last year. This is like the Brady fucking Peyton manning. This is Starbuck for stabler Elway verse Montana. This is just like, okay, this is Jordan verse Dominic Week Wilkins. Doug can contact one of the great chaebol a first Russell, whatever the fuck you want to call it. And these guys were fucking writing like maniacs for the last two laps. Marquez is right on divisio sows ass and he just knew it wasn't easy going gonna pass them. It's when is he going to pass him because he did this all fucking last year. It drove me nuts, which is why I became a Davinci also fan. You got to gotta to root for the underdog, right. So there's like fucking two or three corners left and they're like, I don't think Marquez is close enough. And all of a sudden he braked later than Divisio so name was right on his ass and the next fucking corner he fucking goes underneath divisio so and passed them.

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       And I didn't even realize I was that into it. I was in the living room and I would just went like, Nah, my wife comes running into, what's the matter? She thought there was something wrong with that kid. So he does, he goes dives underneath the visio. So at this point, you know that go in like 90 fucking miles an hour in a turn with their knee, like a like an eighth of an inch off the fucking ground. And he ducks underneath them. But he was going so fast, he went a little wide and then divisio so went underneath him and then it was just a fucking flat out race on a straightaway, just pinning it all the way to the fucking finish line. Individ CEO so wins it. It was just an, it's everything that's missing in Formula One as far as like, I love Formula One, I'm going to continue to watch it, but I just fucking hate lawyers.

Speaker 1:          00:30:39       It's just a race to the first corner and whoever's in the first corner is going to be driving and clean air and everything. Everybody is so equally matched. No one's going to be able to pass them and then you just have to wait for someone to fuck up in the pits. Like that's the exciting passing. It's just like, can this guy get out of the pits before that second place guy comes around again? Um, I dunno just, but if you're, if you're missing passing and Formula One, uh, I would suggest jumping sports. You can watch them both. I mean, it's, they, it's not that much that you're committing to 40 races a year on a 365 days. I mean, he can tape them, you can watch them whenever you want to. So, uh, I am 100% sold on this fucking sport and I'm actually going to be taking a vacation coming up when I'm celebrating my 50th birthday and I just realized I'm going to be in the vicinity of a that race in Spain and I'm trying to talk my wife into going with me.

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       That's my, uh, and I'll just be like, come on honey. It's my 50th birthday and she's such a sweetheart. I think she's going to do it by the way, a honorary mentioned to a cow crutch low coming in fourth place and run a writing a great race and having one of the great fucking names of all time, cal crutch Lowe is such a fucking cool name. It doesn't even sound like, it sounds like an alias. Like if I was a cop, I wouldn't believe him if cuts him under age drinking. All right, give me your names. What's your name? Uh, cal crutch low. Alright, get up against the wall. He going downtown. I just got it. God, it's my real name. Um, anyways, all I gotta do a little read here. I got to do a little re, I get a little read here. Uh, and then get on with my fucking day, cause I got another show.

Speaker 1:          00:32:29       I'm coming up where I'm going to be playing drums. I've got to make sure I tightened down the fucking bass drum beater before I play. I'm doing a Dean del Rey's is, is uh, what was it, 52nd birthday. And uh, I played drums on his 50th birthday. It's great. He has a whole standup show. And then after that he came out for his 50th birthday with a live band. He sang the entire AC DC highway to hell album. So for his 52nd, he's going to be singing the, uh, the entire, uh, power age album. So I'm playing a couple of songs off of that, so I gotta make sure I have that shit down. And I'm also gonna make sure that the bass drum beater is fucking tightened down. Um, but whatever. And once again, trying to learn those songs that I've been learning I, and really be able to play him a whole new, I already had a love, uh, Phil Rudd, but Jesus Christ, I mean, he's just, he just, it's perfect what that guy's plays is perfect. Uh, but there's gonna be a bunch of, you know, big musicians there, cause dean came up in the, in that world, the music world, so he knows all of these guys. Um, I think there's a flyer somewhere out there, I believe. I think I, but actually I believe it's already fucking sold out. But, um, that's my day. I'm going to go fucking play drums. Huh? I don't know why all you guys don't become comedians. You get to be a fucking kid for the rest of your life. Um, actually it's not that easy.

Speaker 1:          00:34:05       After 20 years of sitting there going like, did I make the biggest mistake of my life?

I'm going to be at the Brady that Todd radioed. He said best the Brady Theater in Tulsa, Oklahoma with let there be talks. Dean del Rey and then we're going down to San Antonio for two shows and I for the life of me, couldn't figure out why it was like 500 fucking bucks a night for a hotel in San Antonio. I'm like, what do they have some new hipster area or something and they may can cupcakes and riding bicycles. Why is everything so expensive? Well, it turns out that the night I'm there, so it's the final four weekend, so I bet a lot of you are thinking like, oh, bill came in town to go to those games and I had no idea that games were there and I'm just paying five times what I normally would have paid for 'em for a hotel room. You know, I just realized whatever happened to five, four club Faffel Club, motherfucker

Speaker 3:          00:40:46       did. They dumped me in a what?

Speaker 1:          00:40:50       I am so sick of being, I feel like I'm that podcast that like advertisers go to right before they meet their soulmate podcast. You know what I mean? You know that chick who's always the fucking bridesmaid, never a bride. That's what I'm starting to feel. I just don't feel that people understand what the fuck it is. It just cause I joked doesn't mean people take it seriously in the Goddamn copy and make some listen to it rather than fast forward to it. It's so fucking simple. Why can't you Madison Avenue Kuntz figured that out

Speaker 7:          00:41:19       or maybe they're going to be advertising my podcast next week. Don't, and I probably should have checked with my, my producer before I sit there. But you know what he did all right. That's okay. Here's a little bit of music and then uh, I don't know. I guess we'll fucking, we'll play in some half hour. Greatest Sense. You know what?

So this guy fills in and if you look at him, he's literally having an outer body experience. So it's so funny to me because I can relate to this person because at first time I did stand up, I felt like I was watching myself. I've fucked everything up and this guy, just the way he says his name, it's almost the just, he says like, my name is John Dacre.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       It's like, it's like he was outside. I think that might be my favorite part of the video is the when this fucking guy, just the way he says his own name, he didn't say, my name is John Dacre. He goes, my name's John Decker. I did it right the first time and I just fucked it up. And you got to hear this. Yeah, this fucking guy. He says he's singing all these Jesus songs. Hang on, hang on.

Think if they could eat, you could make a show about his fucking thoughts in all these fucking movies out. It's, yeah.

Um, I have not watched one 2nd of March madness and is always, it's the best fucking sporting event of the year. And I don't know what happened. I was over in April and, uh, I was over in Europe, so, uh, you know, I wasn't there in the beginning, so I missed the whole thing. I watched Kentucky lose yesterday and I got to Mit. I can't really look at John Calipari the way I used to have to, what's his face?

Speaker 11:         00:48:17       Verbally, bitch slapped him. Um, that angry white haired guy from Indiana who then went to Texas and now he just talks about games. The fuck's his name. Actually went to a game when I was out there when it was still out. Damn. What the fuck is his name? I keep thinking white to his hair. Jesus Christ. He's one of the great coaches of all time. Come on bill. You've been gone to lumosity.com focus. Let it go. Just don't care about it. I don't give a fuck. No, I care. My brain can tell. I care. So it's just hiding it. Just mocking me. Come on work.

Speaker 11:         00:48:52       Bobby Knight. There we go. Add to think of him throwing the chair. Uh, yeah, he called GTV key actually called John Calipari out on some kind of decent, he said, you know, every fucking program that this guy has been a part of has had some sort of problem with the NCAA and then he jets out of town, you know, continuing to build his resume and he really trashed him. Now, I'm not saying what he said was right, but Calipari Ali came back with, was a, a a respect globby night. I think he's a great coach. And he didn't that you didn't address anything. You know, somebody told me I killed a hooker and they were a friend of mine and I respected them. I would address the killing of the hooker at some point. Uh, in my innocence of it.

Speaker 12:         00:49:36       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:49:37       Before I, you know, after, you know, after I said how much I respected the guy. Right. You know, I went to a game one time out there in Indiana with Bobby Knight was still there and he was, you know, Indiana started to lose. It was a year. Michigan State won the championship. I think it was the year 2000. I already 10 years ago. And I went to this fucking game and I remember about a student ticket and, uh, you know, showed up. At that point I was well into my thirties. And the guy's looking at me like, really? You know, what do you want the fucking 12 year plan? That's when he got to come with the fucking Luther vibe from a 48 hour. I've been busy number. That's shit. When he pulls up to the toll booth of the parking garage thing and the guy's like this tickets like four years old.

Speaker 11:         00:50:22       Yeah, I been busy. That was a vibe. Me, I just gave the guy that's like, come on man, come on. Really it's me. So he let me in and I went in there and I remember watching Bobby Knight and it was a fucking great arena and there he was, the legend, right? I was up in the nosebleeds, but uh, Indiana started losing and he started, he walked out on the court and was yelling at the point guard bringing it up. The court like his, his whole fucking head was just, you know, with, just with every, you fucking mother fucking like is like a, like a rooster with Tourette's. Right. Just, just fucking unbelievable. And I remember I got so Goddamn mad watching him do that. I was just like, I was, I wanted that kid just to take the ball and just fire it right into his fucking screaming face. I have a son and he allows himself to get fucking yelled at like that. You know what I mean? You fucking retard control your goddamn emotions. All right? You want to fucking blow up a little bit, Blah. But this guy had completely lost his shit.

Speaker 9:          00:51:33       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:51:34       Yeah. Do you ever see Marvin Hagler when he fought Tommy Hearns, remember when he was punching him in the head and Tommy's fucking head would go back in his Jerry curl, all the shit from it would fly out. Instead, he was doing that with his head to himself, except instead of going back, he was going forward every time he was making a point to this kid. He's like, Ben Kingsley and sexy beast make me look like a right cunt hair dark. You're fucking learn to fucking, ah, he's leading with this head. Fucking right. Cross white to is fuck, I fucking hate people like that. Remind me of one of my relatives. Um, well, I just really revisited that anger, didn't I? Um, so anyways, I was actually going to do this podcast last night at, uh, at, at 12 midnight now that I've been over to Europe and I found out how many people listen to my podcast over there.

Speaker 11:         00:52:25       You know, I'm starting to have a little, uh, you know, responsibility for those people. Like, you know, I now know that England and Ireland are seven hours ahead of me. So if I did it at midnight Monday nights, if I posted it then, I mean, Sunday nights, you know, they're rolling into work couple hours later, you know, and I know what you thinking down there in Australia. Ooh, what about us? We're fucking 14 hours ahead. Go fuck yourselves. All right, the fuck do you want me to do it on Thursdays every week? You know, why don't you be happy? Why don't you guys just focus on the fact that you guys don't get respect for living on the largest island in the fucking world. You know, Disney should've made a cartoon about you guys, not Madagascar. Huh? What was that about? So sick of those fucking cartoons about animals that know about global warming.

Speaker 11:         00:53:17       And then they teach human beings a lesson. You know, do you realize that like 98%, and I just grabbed that stat right out of ass, reach right in and pulled it out. 98% of fucking animals, including the goddamn insects. There's an insect, an animal. I know what a human, um, 98% of those motherfuckers are murderers every day, every fucking day. When they want to go out and get something to eat, they have to commit a murder. You know, they got to set a trap. They got an ambush. Should ever do it. Fucking face to face. You ever seen a fucking animal, you know, be a gentlemen, come up and slap another fucking beast with his glove and say, I challenge you. I challenge you to a meal off. I want to eat, you know, all pieces of shit. Fucking animals. What about me? I don't kill anybody.

Speaker 11:         00:54:13       I go and eat an animal that's already been murdered. I am accomplice to murder. That's what the fuck I am. Um, I did I get on that subject? What was I talking about? It's talking about Bobby Knight. Oh, some of those stupid fucking animal movies at Disney's always make and try to make me cry, you know, and say, have some polar bears slide on his belly into a coke can. The same fucking thing that would just be eating me alive. Um, if you only get mauled by an animal, if you had to get eaten by an animal, which one would you pick? I picked the biggest fucker ever. I want that shit to be over. Cause I remember when that gay dude with the evil Knievel, a Onesy, the Joan Jett fucking Leotard. Remember those two guys out there sick, free and roid. Roid sick free and Roy, Siegfried and Roy, remember those two twinkle toes out there, dance around with all those fucking, you know, whatever they had.

Speaker 11:         00:55:13       They, they're cats. They were doing cats. The musical for real. Whenever you thrill cats, I think that'd be spectacular. We just skip around and I'll bleach my hair. And then you put shoe fallish in yours. Yeah. Well, Robert's bowls. I'm actually, that's bullshit because the musical cats came out after fucking, uh, the, the, the fucking, those two guys, gay evil Knievel. And uh, and gay. Uh, who's the other one? What did he look like? A, who's the other guy at night at the Roxbury, not will Pharrel. Ah, Jesus. My is just shot Catan. That's what it looks like. If they ever, if they ever make the movie that I would cast a Catan. Chris Catan is the one who gets his neck chopped and then I would have to go with the guy who played Bo Duke and the rob and I. He's too fucking old at this point. Who's got hair like that? God knows I don't, even if you fucking bleached it, I got enough left. Hang on a second. Who the

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       fuck would I pick?

Speaker 9:          00:56:26       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:56:27       whatever. There's your project for the week. But anyways, my point is that when he grabbed the, the, the gay Chris Catan, dude, it was just over. It wasn't like, Oh God, I'm getting eaten by an island. An island, a fucking lie. Jesus. It wasn't that. It was just scrapped his fucking throat and that was it. He went chomp and that was it. That was it. Just fucking off. I know, Bill, we saw it. We saw it on fucking Hollywood. Aina aided a bitch or whatever the fuck that, that's stupid. He Hollywood bowl shows he Hollywood fucking stories about celebrities and addition all this dirt about them. Did you ever notice that none of their close friends are on it? It's because it's all bullshit. You know they do like the willy aim story and they have like his fucking made talk and all sorts of shit about them. There's grant. Good Eve say anything? No. Does the kid who played Nicholas Bradford, does he say some shit now with none of them say anything? It's always like, you know some fucking PA.

Speaker 1:          00:57:34       I don't know what the fuck I'm talking. I was talking about animals. Let's rewind this for a second. Yeah, those stupid fucking call. If you've got to get killed by an animal. That's what I'm saying. I want, I want to get fucking killed by something like that. A big cat or a bear. You know there's something about an alligator though. I just, I don't like it. I don't like that they have fucking them. They're mean about it. You know, they just did. They grab your leg and then they do that fucking barrel roll. You know, it's like, can't you just fucking shot my leg off? Can you just, just nice clean Ginsu it and you know it a major writer there. I'll fucking bleed out in like five seconds. Do you really got to Joe Theismann me to the 10th power. You guys ever seen that clip?

Speaker 1:          00:58:16       Non Sports fans. If you want to see something that'll just make you lose your lunch for all you broads out there trying to lose some weight. If you just had a piece of cake right now, go on youtube and look up Joe Theismann breaks leg or Joe Theismann uh, who landed on him. Lawrence Taylor. Remember that shit? It's, it's a, it's a two foot one break compound fracture I believe is what, what is what is called the Tabula and the fibula. Uh, yeah, I think that's what it is. Look at me. Follow fucking pulling another thing out of my age. Um, alright, so this is the deal. It's Monday morning out here in Los Angeles. She probably wondering, hey bill, you know what? What does that, what does a struggling actor, moderately successful comedian do on a Monday morning? Well, I'll tell you right now. I had a fucking audition and I prepared my little actor hard out for it. And uh, it was one of the roles I've always wanted to play. All right. Um, there's a few scenes that I want that I want to do as an actor. A lot of actors want to win an Oscar. Of course I

Speaker 11:         00:59:22       do. But who's kidding, Hill. You know one of my jeans, Staple Horn said somebody's name. I don't know. Fuck, that is a triple horn. I don't know what the fuck I'm trying to say here. Look who's getting to it will be 42 years old in June. Okay. If I can just stand near somebody who won a fucking Oscar, I'm going to be happy. All right. So anyways, um, and you know what I'm doing? I'm adjusting my dream. Okay. Rather than going on Oprah now and having her ask me how I became so fucking brilliant. Now all I want to do, I want to have that scene. I want to play a snitch. That's what I want to do and I want to have somebody chased me down a fucking alley. I don't give a fuck if it's the cops are the guys I snitched on and I want to come to the end of the alley.

Speaker 11:         01:00:07       I want that chain link fence. You know where you grab it and you're trying to climb up it and you think you're going to make it and then they grab you by your cheap leather coat. They pull you off it and kick the shit out of you. I want that. I want to do the interrogation scene. You know when I'm sitting there, then they're doing the good cop, bad cop. I've already been the cop. I did that on Chappelle show. I want to be the guy getting interrogated. And then the last thing is I want to get my fucking head blown off in a movie. So today and I have the perfect head, my big fucking kitchen TV set head, my Sean Penn forehead. I mean this, it's just begging to be fucking blown off in a movie. I'm dying for that scene. Right? And I had an audition today to, uh, to play.

Speaker 11:         01:00:53       A Gal gets fucking shot in the head. In the end, I was site, I was feeling good. I worked the whole fucking thing out, right? So I go down to the audition and I show up on me at the address and I'm looking at somebody's house like, what the fuck? This is somebody goddamn house. This doesn't seem right. So recheck the address. And then I saw a couple of people walking in holding this sides. Um, so I was like, all right, fuck it. Not Sides for those unit in the business, they didn't walk in with like mashed potatoes and stuffing. It's fucking sides are basically the part of the script, the couple of scenes that they give you. Um, so I go walking in there and I walk in and all I see is two Asian guys in suits. And I'm like, all right, this is weird. Because basically what happens when you, when you audition for a role, they kind of know what they want. Every once in awhile they do that, all ethnicities. But basically I walk in there and there's a bunch of howdy duty looking guys. You know, Donnie most is in there fucking resent and me, you know, cause my red hair hasn't turned yellow yet.

Speaker 11:         01:01:59       No, it's not all red heads, but you know, it's a bunch of fucking white dudes about my age, you know. And um, this time I walk in, it's two Asian dudes, one with the shaved head and one with fucking Chow, young fat hair, and they're both sitting there. And I'm like, what the fuck? I must be coming in at the tail end of, we're trying to find the Asian dude. And uh, I walk in and I sign in and it was right as I sign in to say I'm there, the casting person came and I was like, oh my God. I tried to call and I was like, oh fuck. I tried to call, try to email you. Basically they, they, I dunno. I Dunno if they cast it, they gave it to somebody famous or what, but they basically tried to call me to say that, uh, they were rewriting the role.

Speaker 11:         01:02:45       I love when somebody says that I tried to call really what happened. I, I dunno, I, I dialed it, but I couldn't pick up the, I tried, I couldn't just be honest. It was a late night fucking decision, you know, and I had the one, I was one of the first guys coming out of the chute. It's no big deal. Whatever. I'm already showered, looking good today. It was still would've been sleeping like a bump. So, uh, yeah, my day started a little fucked up. What are you going to do? Whatever, whatever, whatever. I'm 16, 17 minutes into this podcast, they got a little bowl of grapes here. Um, and people let me tell you something. I am severely, severely off the wagon. All right. I stumbled in last night and, uh, all I had was two beers. I don't know what the fuck happened. I was like stumbling and I, you know, got out of my car, which I probably shouldn't have been driving.

Speaker 11:         01:03:40       I two beers in an hour and a half. So, I mean, I think I'm not drunk, right? Your body gets rid of a one drink an hour. Isn't that what it is? All I know is I have this fucking little zip up, right? My little fucking, uh, you know, I don't know what it is. It's like a fun, I think it has the English flag on it. It's white. It's weird. It looks like really American because it's red, white and blue. It's a fucking cool look and zip up. It makes me look maybe two and a half years younger than I am and I'm vain, so I wear it. So I stumble out of my car and I brush up against the hinge of the garage and I was like, fuck. And I look down and I have this Greece, at least it was brand new, so it was kind of green looking and I ruined it.

Speaker 11:         01:04:21       And I just sat there and I remembered what this recovered alcoholic told me when I wasn't drinking. I was like, Yeah Dude, I'm done with drinking. And he looked at me and he said, yeah man. He goes, nothing good comes from it. And I was like, once again, this guy is right when you're younger, good stuff comes from it. You get laid, you get charged with date rape later, but you know, in the moment it's good. Um, no, you know what I mean? Loosens people up. You don't know how to talk to a luck. Be a lady two night. Let me get you drunk and less uptight. Gonna stick my finger in your fucking who has sweetie, whether you want it or not. Now doing it. I don't, I'm not advocating rape here. I just felt like singing. So let me have a grape. Maybe that'll take me down here. Oh. Oh God. Isn't that delicious? It was the last time you bought some grapes and actually finished. Um, you know, I'm trying to, cause I, when I came back from Europe, I threw out a hellacious amount of food. I want you to think a starving kid ways.

Speaker 11:         01:05:27       Because when I walked out, I felt like I had like six of them in my garbage bag. That's how much food I threw out. Some of them were jars, you know, wasn't all food. Some of it was the containers, but you know, a lot of it's made out of cardboard at this point. I threw out a lot of food. That's what I'm trying to tell you. So I'm really, I'm try, I bought some food this week and I'm trying to eat all of it up. I'm trying to be a less wasteful American. Oh, speaking of that shit. The fuck did I look up? I was on youtube the other day and they had these German mother fuckers and they would, they would, they were trying out the new, um, um, dodge challenger. The fucking Xjs sets a Jaguar, whatever the fuck you call it, the, the Hemi one versus the Shelby Mustang versus, um, that dodge viper and their whole thing was they just kept relating the cars to eating fast food and a big cheeseburger. They will basically saying, these are American cars. Americans are fat fucks. And, uh, I gotta admit, man, we earned it. We did earn it, but you know, we don't do, we don't test out a Porsche and Audi in a BMW with some sort of Nazi theme underneath it. You know, I'm fucking really getting tired of this man. Everybody's taken shots at the good old USA. So you know you got to do, I've got a new segment called let's get smart America.

Speaker 11:         01:06:55       I wish she had some sort of production on this where I could just have a fucking silly ass song. What are you going to do this week as it a fucking American to make yourself a little less fat? A little less dumb, a little less something else. Cause the magic number's three. Say I'm too fucking stupid to come up with three examples. What are you going to do? I got to tell you, these motherfuckers over in England, man, are not in good shape and they weren't in good shape and fucking in Scotland either. Ireland, they were all right. You know, it's like they're not fat, but they just like, they look like at a shake. Seventh graders, like there's not a lot of weightlifting over there. Like I just saw arms. You don't like straight arms like Dilbert. I'm not saying they're all like that, so fucking don't get your blood up over there. Right. You know what I'm saying? Put it this way. My girlfriend saw somebody over in, um, in, uh, we were fucked with, I think we were in Scotland and she saw somebody and this kid looked like he was in his early twenties, his face. But his body was just, she just looked at me and she just goes, his body is unacceptable.

Speaker 11:         01:08:08       And it wasn't even that he was fucking ridiculously out of shape. It's just that not only those fucking guys over there mushy, they were the tightest fucking shirts ever. I'm not saying I'm in shape. I got a nice little fucking poach going right now that I need to try to work down. But I have the decency, the common fucking decency for my fellow man to wear a button down. You know, give yourself a little space, let it hang off your man tits a little bit so we don't have to see, you know, these fucking guys over in Europe, it's like, they want you to know exactly how many pounds overweight they were. It was disgusting. You know, and appreciate a little courtesy out of my fellow man. That's all I'm saying. Okay. You got, you've gotta be honest with yourself. All right. What kind of shape?

Speaker 11:         01:08:54       My mind wife shape am I and t shirts shape? Am I in fucking buttoned down shape? Do I need to put on a Hoodie? You know, sport coach shape. Remember that Shit. I used to have a regular job. Why am I walking around? I think I'm excited. This is one of the exciting moments of the podcast for me. Look at me pacing back and forth as if I'm fucking coming up with some brilliant shit here. I remember when I had a regular job, he used to work in a warehouse unloading trucks. You know, it's not curing cancer, but it served a purpose and a, I remember once a year they would have, they'd have the company cookout and all these fucking suits that you thought were in shape do. They would show up with their fucking tee shirts on. Wow.

Speaker 3:          01:09:40       Wow. You know,

Speaker 11:         01:09:43       I'm talking like a fucking big slice of cake just hanging off each side of him. I remember it made me feel good too because they will make them more money than me,

Speaker 3:          01:09:51       you know?

Speaker 11:         01:09:53       You know when you do that, you just fucking good your wedding in that category. So I'm glad that you're losing in this one. Did that go anywhere? Have another grape? God Damn it. These things are tart. So here we go. I'm trying to become a better speller everybody. And uh, I'm sick of being a fucking moron in that category. So I figured I'd give you a spelling test this week. All right? You don't have to play along. You know what am I going to do that I can keep fucking rambling for another 40 minutes. She can tell at this point. I don't have shit to talk about this week. I just emptied my brain on Thursday. It takes a week for it to fill up. It's like it just jerked off and you want another load? I don't have one inmate got a fucking empty chamber this week. All right, you guys sitting at your desks, this would be even better.

Speaker 11:         01:10:43       This. And you know what's great about this? If I actually add this to the podcast where I teach it fucking 10 words every week, okay? We all learn and together this is the great thing. Cause if you're listening to a guy at work, you shouldn't be doing that. You know it. And I know it looked down in shame right now at your desk. Now don't fuck that. He shouldn't have any shame. Did you dream about your job then? There's no fucking shame fucking off. Um, the great part about this part of the podcast is you're actually going to start writing and people going to be thinking, Oh wow, okay. Sandy's over there taking notes on something important, you know, who fucks off and writes at the same time. Um, all right, so here we go. Here's 10 words that I think, uh, I don't think anything about them.

Speaker 11:         01:11:28       These are just words I fucking found that I could, I couldn't spell. Catalysts is the first word. What did this yelled at into the mic. Catalysts is your first word. All right, let's see how fucking dumb you are. We need, we need to gauge how fucking stupid you are to have a jumping off point. All right. Catalyst is your first word. Um, can you use it in a sentence? Uh, I don't think I can. Um, this spelling test was the catalyst to expose how fucking stupid I am. Catalyst is a fucked up one. We all eat them cantaloupe.

Speaker 10:         01:12:11       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:12:11       Hey, what'd you look at that fucking cantaloupe? I, you know, I just realized I could never do this. I could never be a teacher. Chloroform,

Speaker 10:         01:12:23       okay.

Speaker 11:         01:12:23       Hey, you know what? If you don't shut the fuck up, I'm going to take a chloroform reg and put it over your face there. Chloroform. God, this is like designed to make you smarter and it's really exposing how dumb I am is a tough one. Uh, penitentiary. Don't go to the penitentiary. You might get fucked in the ass penitentiary. Uh, you know, I love about this podcast is, even though I have no idea whether this is the, you know, I, there's no way to hear feedback or anything. I know this is bombing and I don't give a shit. I don't know. You know what? I don't even know how many I've done. I'm going to fucking do all 10, one, two, three. I did three, three c words and I'm not, I would say contemplate. It's too easy. Uh, let's go with another one.

Speaker 10:         01:13:14       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:13:15       Was another one. Aesthetics. There's a great one. Here's a great one. Aesthetics. Use it in a sentence. Bill, come on. You dummy. Jesus Christ. Look at these aesthetics. And you know, it's funny, I know how to spell all these words now, but I can't use them in a sentence. Just really a fucking moron. All right, let's go. Infrastructure.

Speaker 10:         01:13:40       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:13:40       You know, I'm sick of this infrastructure. It's really, uh, it's really unnecessary infrastructure. Now I can use that in a sentence. The infrastructure of the company was a exquisite, Oh, Jesus Christ. Gee. Oh, G Gee, what else we got? How many, how many words is that? One, two, three. That's four.

Speaker 10:         01:14:07       Yeah,

Speaker 11:         01:14:07       there is a tough one. Succinct. I think I did that last succinct. Um, what somebody who stutters brushes his teeth in a succinct, can I just do five? Can I bail on this? Are you guys enjoying how fucking horrific. This is a pertinent,

Speaker 10:         01:14:32       okay,

Speaker 11:         01:14:34       what does that six, I'm going to say that six pertinent. Um, you know what? This is pertinent information. That's the only time anybody ever uses that word is when they're describing information.

Speaker 10:         01:14:48       Okay?

Speaker 11:         01:14:48       If I had an access to the pertinent, pertinent information, I wouldn't have to deal with this infrastructure at this cantaloupe colored company. Pardon it? Fuck you. You don't even know how to spell it. You can't smell it. Spell it. You can't fucking be laughing at me right now. All right. Here's a fun [inaudible]. These ones are all the ones that have psycho with the beginning of them. Here's one. Uh, negotiate.

Speaker 10:         01:15:21       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:15:21       You know, you guys want more money in your cubicles. You're going to have to negotiate. Oh, they go, she ate. Was that eight? Jeez, I'm even getting bored with this. Uh, this is a hell of a dilemma, Huh? Go ahead. Spell that one dilemma. I didn't realize this was going to bug bomb and now I'm in a fucking dilemma. Dilemma.

Speaker 10:         01:15:48       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:15:49       And when was the last one here? A silhouette.

Speaker 11:         01:15:54       Yay. When I see your silhouette up against the mood and makes me want to fucking baggy silhouette. Ah, all right. There you go. There's your spelling tests for the week. Do you have any desire to get better at this shit, my superimposing. That's what I do. I can spell all those fucking words. Huh? Are you impressed? You shouldn't be. Um, here's another new segment bills, embarrassing moments from the previous week's podcast. This is actually from two weeks ago. I actually re listen to these when I, uh, when I upload them, it takes a moment for me to upload all of these fucking things that no one can hear unless you go to bill bird.com. Um, [inaudible] um, and I listened to them and I listen, I hear all the dumb shit that I say and the stuff that I, I miss pronounce like I was trying to say exclamation point a couple of weeks ago, exclamation point as an exclaim.

Speaker 11:         01:16:49       And I actually said explanation point, like it was explaining it to me in a very excited way. Um, Jesus Christ, this is fucking awful. You know, this is, you know what this is like, this is like your second day back at the gym. That's what this podcast feels like. You know the first day like, fuck this, you know, when you go nuts and then the next day you wake up and you're all sore and now you just fucking drag and assets. What this podcast is just dragon fucking dragon. My Freckle Das. I don't have a freckle desk. By the way. That would mean that I stunned beds in the nude. Um, all right, last week I was talking about how our Avocados, that whole bullshit where they're, uh, they're too, oh wait, that's for the wrong part of the podcast. Where the fuck is that information? No, Jesus Christ. Bill. You know why?

Speaker 11:         01:17:40       Why? Why do you even try? Oh, I fucked up. I bet. I can just tell you the gist of it. The reason why Avocados costs more when you go to get a Burrito was evidently there was some damage done to the crop a couple of years ago or some bullshit. So there was a shortage of them. Thus they were more expensive. And as always, the corporate cons pass the expense onto the regular people. And this is what happens. Then they had more fucking avocado. So it wasn't a fucking problem anymore, but they were like, well wait a minute. People are already paying more for Avocados. Ain't never fucking complained. So they just kept them at the same price. So now you pay extra, which means means when it's time to change, what it means is that they're gonna fucking, they're going to do that with every kind of food now cause we're not bitching about, um, our bacon.

Speaker 11:         01:18:35       I've got a breakfast sandwich and they said Bacon was extra. So, you know what? That's my little rebellion. Fuck you. All right. I'm not paying extra for my Avocados, for my guacamole. You fucking cunts. You fuckin corporate cons helping. Did you? Goddamn ya'll gotta be all right. Let me, let me, I'm, you know, I'm going to wrap this up. You guys are getting a mini podcast this week. I'm not going to sit here and be treated this way on my podcast and I sit here fucking bomb and like this, I got a reputation. Um, last week I have saying I didn't understand the difference between Great Britain, the United Kingdom is England, a country is England in Scotland. Two separate countries. Are they the same fucking thing? It was all confusing. So a this guy says, hey bill, I'm from England, so I'll answer your question mate. Uh, England is a country, cause you said on your podcast, England wasn't a country, but is it you meant to write but it is, what are you, if you're questioning yourself sir, what the fuck am I supposed to do?

Speaker 11:         01:19:31       Scotland is a country, Wales is a country. I didn't know that. I thought maybe Scotland was a country, but I didn't think Wales was a country. Ireland is a bit different because it's split into two countries to spelled t oh there's one of your smart fucking Europeans there. Everybody see that if we learn how to spell America, we can start making fun of them again. We at least we can have a, a basis to make fun of them. Um, anyways, uh, continuing Ireland is a bit different because it's split into two countries. Northern Ireland, the Capitol is Belfast and the Republic of Ireland Capitol is Dublin. Both completely separate countries. Countries, spelled country apostrophe s yeah. See this. That's all they do over there. They watch fucking soccer and eat fish and chips. They don't have fucking spell either. United Kingdom. And this is what the United Kingdom is. It's a England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Great Britain. Great Britain is England, Scotland and Wales. Reason being is Ireland is an island. Hence why Northern Ireland and the Republican Ireland are just known as Ireland. That doesn't make any sense. England is in Ireland or whatever. Fucking do the United Kingdom is an island island. I don't understand that. How come fucking, uh, Australia is not an eye is not considered an island surrounded on all sides by water.

Speaker 11:         01:21:03       You know what the fuck? South America is an island at this point with the Panama Canal, isn't it? And why does it float away? Um, anyways. Anyways, this podcast sucks. I'm sorry. What? What the fuck do you want from me? All right. I'm fucking Neil O'Donnell this week. I've got nothing for you. I started doing this spelling test and all these fucking nerds came out of the goddamn woodwork. This guy goes, Bill, here's an interesting piece of trivia. Facetious is the only word in the English language that has every vowel in order. A. E. I. O. U. Isn't that interesting? Is that what I did with the spelling tests? Maybe this is why I never learned how to fucking spell cause that's the kind of people that you attract. Here's an interesting tidbit of information. Do you know that on the fuck, and they start talking about some moon off of Saturn that instead of fucking air, it's that their atmosphere as methane gas.

Speaker 11:         01:22:03       And I got to sit and I guess sit there and nod like wow, you know, and I'm like, and he's sitting there thinking, I'm nodding because I'm so fucking interested and I'm really trying to do the math in my head. Trying to figure out when was the last fucking time this guy got laid? There's another great stereotype. If you're some fucking smart nerd, that means you don't get late in life. That's bullshit. It's only in fucking high school, you know? I Dunno, is it, I don't even know if it's fucking true. I just figured, you know, when you get smart, if it's really smart and you're good at business and that type of shit, you go out and make money in the second you make money, what's going to happen? A bunch of fucking cons are gonna come out of the woodwork. Who wouldn't have fucked you back in the day because you couldn't throw a ball through a fucking hoop. You know? That's what that twats wanted to vacuum up when they were in high school. The now all of a sudden look at you, you invented a fucking Hula Hoop or whatever the hell you did and now they want to bang you.

Speaker 10:         01:22:59       Okay?

Speaker 11:         01:22:59       Right. Isn't that how it works? Anything? I am flailing.

Speaker 10:         01:23:04       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:23:05       I'm walking around.

Speaker 10:         01:23:06       Why do I feel like I have to make it 50 minutes spill if you don't have anything to say, fucking bail. Um, let me hike this. Um, the m m m m podcast.com is the fan page, the official fan page, the only one that I sponsor, www. The MLM, podcast.com. It's the only one that I, that I did. Well, who's kidding? Who? It's the only fucking one there is, but it's the only one that I sponsor. I'm trying to make it sound more official. Um, but anyways, I think there is that, the podcast for this week. I'm literally laying on my back right now just staring at the ceiling wondering where it all went wrong. Do I have anything left to talk about? Oh, I got something for you. Somebody sent me an email. Let me, let me just reach for this fucking Straw. At this point, somebody sent me an email and it said overrated in the subject line and then I open it and it said the Beatles and then underneath that he wrote, yeah, I said it. Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:24:06       Let me tell you something right now. What? Like how much I fucking hate people who go, yeah, I said it. You know like this shocking you. Like they're going after some sort of fucking, you know, taboo.

Speaker 10:         01:24:21       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:24:21       If you're ever in a comedy club, all right. And there's a comedian on, on stage and they, they're allowed one. Yeah, I said it. If they do any more than that. Yeah. You have my blessing to start throwing shit at them. I hate that. That fucking false dangerous fucking horse shit. Fucking bitches need to get a job. What asks say ass shit. You guys can't handle the truth. You keep fucking going. Yeah, I said it. What? I said it, but it's like dude, nobody in the crowd is going. Who said that? Did you say that? Yeah, I said it. You know what I mean? Like, like they're being let out and fucking let out and fucking handcuffs. When will people realize that nothing is shocking? You know, look at the fucking Catholic Church. Look what the fuck they're doing. You know what is more shocking than that? The fact that they fucking look the other way. Cause I understand why they look the other way. Cause there's so much fucking money involved and you know, to get to the top of any sort of pyramid, you have to be an ass kissing cunt. That's basically what it is. Unless you created it, unless you created whatever pyramid there is. And at that point you want your ass kissed.

Speaker 10:         01:25:42       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:25:42       So whenever there's money involved, they don't give a shit. I, you know what is the most shocking thing about all that is that people continue to go to the Catholic church.

Speaker 10:         01:25:52       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:25:52       Can anybody out there explained to me how they separate that? How do you separate that? How do you still go to the Catholic Church knowing that they had 16,000 cases? Those are just the ones that came forward. 16 fucking thousand. That's the population of a small town. 16,000 fucking rates of children and you still go and you give them fucking money. What do you think they're going to use that money for? Lawyers to get these fucking guys off. You know? I don't know.

Speaker 10:         01:26:23       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:26:24       Why don't I go Jesus Christ. Why? Why Bill? Why? Why do you go down that fucking road? All right. You know what? I'm really off my fucking game. Okay. Pate manning threw an interception. The final fucking drive of the Superbowl. This is my, this is my fucking Peyton manning Superbowl game right here. Cause this, this podcast, was it disjointed cluster fuck and I really have nothing done. I really think I was going to come here and I was, I had a little information about Avocados and uh, what is the United Kingdom when I was somehow going to be able to fucking talk for 50 minutes. Do you realize like when you guys, you get your, you have to understand is the level of fucking ego that it takes that I can look at three different things and think that I could run my fucking mouth for 50 minutes.

Speaker 11:         01:27:09       It's not, this is even the podcast anymore. This is my confession scene that I didn't get to do because they're retooling it. All right. You broke me down. It's fucking over. You got me. I have nothing left. I bought the box set of the wire just looking at mom around my room trying to come up with something. My voice gets weaker and I watched the first fucking season and that's a fucking great TV show, but I'm not going to be one of those guys who goes, it's the greatest TV show ever. It's fucking good. It's a really good show. I like it. I like it a lot. Did. I gave a spelling test and I really do that. I gave a spelling test on the fucking podcast.

Speaker 11:         01:27:54       All right. You know what? I'm going to, I'm going to bow out gracefully right now. Okay? If you want, I add, I added a date. Here we go. Let me, let me actually use this podcast. What I really want to use it for, my ulterior motive here is the height. My goddamn dates. I got some new dates out there. Everybody. Let's go to the official website of Bill Burr is doing officially one of the worst podcasts ever. Um, this week in Los Angeles, April 3rd at the Gibson [inaudible] theater. Um, I'm doing the, uh, Kevin and being a cancer show show for cancer. Hey, let's get rid of the cancer. Everybody. I believe that's the name of it. It's a fucking benefit for cancer. Um, I'm going to get the punch line in Atlanta, April 8th, ninth and 10th, and I'm hanging around the 11th. I have tickets for the finals, not the final is the final day of the masters. We, another buddy of mine are going down there cause we knew tiger woods will was going to play. We fucking knew it. Okay. Who's kidding? Who? You know he's sick. A Bang in that broad. That's why you fucked around on her. It was her fault. She stopped them. You know, she wasn't washing the dishes, she didn't make sandwiches for them anymore. She started taking tiger for granted and tiger was sitting there and his billion dollar lazy boy. And he's like, is this bitch take and tiger woods the greatest fucking golfer of all time?

Speaker 9:          01:29:18       Yeah,

Speaker 11:         01:29:19       actually isn't Jack Nicklaus Jack Nicklaus is, but she's taken me for granted. Fuck this. I'm going to go fuck a whore. That's the one thing that I hated about that story is how they just never blamed her for his fucking around because it was clearly her fault.

Speaker 9:          01:29:38       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:29:38       And if you're wondering why I'm coming up with that, I'm just using the F, you know, it's um, I'm saying it because of my respect for females, you know, because I respect you guys so much that I'm actually using your train of thought. When you look at, when you see a woman get caught cheating and you always, you always blame the guy.

Speaker 13:         01:30:02       Well it's funny cause he wasn't paying attention to or it's probably because he was doing this. It's probably because he was doing

Speaker 11:         01:30:10       well the shoe's on the other foot, you know, they never say it's cause she wanted to go out and get some Dick. Now they have a cause of that cause it's something that guy was doing. He left his shoes in the fucking kitchen after she'd fucking mopped the floor. So therefore she had to go to the fucking Luxor and collapse on somebody else's cock. Right. It's her fault.

Speaker 11:         01:30:33       You know, where the fuck does she get off getting mad at fucking tiger woods. Do you even have a fucking job woman? What is your job to go around? Go Dog fucking Tannen. Yeah. What are you going to do? I love these fucking twats who are married to some unbelievably rich person. Okay? They have kids with them and they don't have a fucking job and they still get help. Still got to have some fucking, you know nanny. It's like, do you want to fucking do anything? I tell you that that's the guy's fault. If you marry a fucking woman who you're making so much goddamn money, all right that they don't even have a fucking job and they still need help. You need help with doing nothing.

Speaker 13:         01:31:21       I'm raising kids

Speaker 11:         01:31:22       that are dirty with the foot. My Mother did that and at a job, you're lazy. Twat get off the Goddamn Sofa. That's what I would do. I take a right across my knee and pull off her fucking Gucci flip flop and I'd fucking paddle or right butt cheek until she admitted how fucking wrong she was. What do think about that? Maybe that's why I'm not a billionaire, you know, cause that's how I do it. John Papa Razzi would take a picture of it. I do that paddle a little fucking right, Fannie. As I had grapes and then when they questioned me, I just, we fucked you. The God Damn Golfer in the world.

Speaker 3:          01:32:02       Okay,

Speaker 11:         01:32:02       thanks to me. Your Sundays aren't boring.

Speaker 3:          01:32:06       Okay,

I want somebody who embrace being a piece of shit. That's what I want. That's what I got to say there. Tiger Woods wife is a lazy fucking Twat. All right? And that's why he cheated on her. And I'm going to tell you this right now. The reason why he's playing the masters is because they need the money. All right? This guy is at work since November and I know what you're thinking. Oh God, it, well, he's a fucking billionaire. Yeah. And he's living the lifestyle of a billionaire. Do you think he wants to? Of course he does. And he's got to keep that fucking whore happy,

Speaker 3:          01:32:46       you know?

Speaker 11:         01:32:47       Do you think she, who do you think paid for all the fucking window? She smashed with that golf club, right? I like how we denied that shit in that attack me with a golf club. Really? Your windows exploded and then you drove into a tree where you fucking on mushrooms. Did you think you could drive into that little? Not In the center of the trunk. Tiger me a fucking break. What are you sticking up for? You know why? Because he married her the fucking idiot. Now he's got this contract. You can't get ease. He's looking to lose all the fucking idiot. I hope. I hope she listens to this. I don't even know our Goddamn name. You know? I don't know your name sweetheart, because you never did anything with your life. You know was the last time you even fucking, you have even when a swim meet.

Did even when a ribbon, what have you ever done besides suck the Dick suck the Dick of the greatest golfer of the last 50 fucking years other than Jack Nicholas.
