10 Movie Inside Jokes You Didn't Get
Sometimes in the weird and wonderful world

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.510
of Hollywood, there are things included in
movies that seem a little bit out of place

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.090
or forced – certain lines of dialogue, props,
pieces of music or celebrity cameos, for example.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.720
Often this can be put down to poor filmmaking
or desperation, but these things can also

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.230
be included simply for the fun of it.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.230
Writers and directors love to make movies
their own and this can sometimes come in the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.230
form of the aforementioned inclusions.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.230
When watching a movie for the first time,
viewers might completely miss them or wonder

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.230
what on Earth is going on, but these inclusions
are generally clever in-jokes that make reference

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.230
to something else in a subtle way – things
like a director’s past projects, or a movie

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.230
a director liked in their childhood, for instance.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.230
In this video, we’re going to run through
a list of some of the best in-jokes in movie

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.230
history.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.230
Here are 10 movie inside jokes you didn’t
get.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.260
Spider-Man 2
The Spider-Man trilogy that starred Tobey

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.040
Maguire as the web-slinging superhero was,
of course, directed by Sam Raimi.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.720
Raimi was previously best-known for creating
and directing the Evil Dead series of movies

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.110
– and in 2004’s Spider-Man 2, there was
an entire scene that quite hilariously took

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.320
its visual cues from those cult horror movies.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.110
When the presumed-dead Otto Octavius was being
prepared for post-mortem surgery, his mechanical

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.899
arms developed sentience and attacked the
doctors who were present.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.810
In the most blatant callback to the Evil Dead
movies, one of those doctors reached for a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.190
chainsaw – as wielded by Bruce Campbell’s
Ash Williams – and used it in a failed attempt

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.130
to escape the clutches of the mechanical arm
that had a hold of him.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.750
Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
When movie franchises have writers and actors

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.540
in common with each other, they will often
make fun references to each other, and the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.470
first example of that in this particular list
comes from 1984’s Indiana Jones and the

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.470
Temple of Doom.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.330
With George Lucas having written the movie’s
story and Harrison Ford AKA Han Solo starring

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.520
in the titular role, Star Wars references
were guaranteed to happen.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.140
The movie’s opening took place in a Japanese
nightclub called “Club Obi Wan” – a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.540
reference to the Jedi first played by Sir
Alec Guinness in 1977’s A New Hope.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.710
Terminator 2: Judgement Day
1991’s Terminator 2: Judgement Day saw the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.759
return of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the titular
cyborg – only this time around he was a

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:47.759
good guy.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.440
Whilst trying to prevent Robert Patrick’s
T-1000 from killing Edward Furlong’s John

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.330
Connor, Arnie’s character stalked the liquid
metal robot through a shopping mall.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.890
Carrying a box of roses to disguise his intentions
– presumably to avoid upsetting the mall’s

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.640
customers – Arnie ultimately pulled a huge
gun from the box and used it to attack Patrick’s

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.640
character.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.050
A gun… in a box of roses?

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.060
Get it?

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.670
This was actually a very subtle and clever
nod to the legendary American rock band that

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.390
performed the movie’s theme song “You
Could Be Mine”.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.030
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York
Home Alone 2 was the New York-based sequel

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.680
to 1991’s Home Alone.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.030
This time around, Macauley Culkin’s Kevin
McCallister was left to survive on his own

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.780
in the Big Apple, as opposed to in his own
Chicago home.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.290
Kevin uses his father’s credit card to take
up residency in the Plaza Hotel – which

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.420
was then owned by current U.S. Presidential
candidate Donald Trump.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.200
As Kevin arrives at the hotel, he asks a fellow
visitor for directions to the lobby.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.640
Who was that fellow visitor?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.580
It was none other than Mr. Trump himself.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.750
How could you possibly miss that awful trademark
hair?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.800
Scream
It could be argued that 1996’s Scream is

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.780
one big long in-joke, but this one is just
so great that we couldn’t not include it

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.780
here.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.970
In a scene in Woodsboro High School, the janitor
is wearing clothes reminiscent of an iconic

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.100
character from another Wes Craven movie – Freddy
Krueger of A Nightmare on Elm Street fame.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.980
It was a fairly blatant reference, but what
wasn’t so blatant was that the character

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.170
– who was credited as “Fred” – was
actually played by a heavily-disguised Craven

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.390
himself.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.700
Shaun of the Dead
2004’s Shaun of the Dead is a brilliant

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.740
British horror comedy that pays tribute to
the zombie movies of old.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.800
The movie’s writer and star, Simon Pegg,
is a huge fan of the zombie genre and that

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.800
was clearly evident.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.450
A clever reference to George A. Romero’s
Night of the Living Dead came in the form

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.630
of a quote by Nick Frost’s character Ed.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.150
When Pegg’s character Shaun was speaking
to his mother in the movie, amid the zombie

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.200
apocalypse, Ed shouted “we’re coming to
get you, Barbara” down the phone – this

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.550
line was paraphrased from the famous “they’re
coming to get you, Barbara” quote, which

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.160
Russell Streiner’s Johnny Blair used to
scare his sister in the aforementioned 1968

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.600
classic.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.330
Thor
Marvel Cinematic Universe movies are always

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.340
full of in-jokes, Easter eggs and fun references
– to the point that we could saturate a

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.880
list like this with such examples – and
one of the best came in 2011’s Thor.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.690
The movie saw the blossoming of the perennially
reviled relationship between Chris Hemsworth’s

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.950
titular character and Natalie Portman’s
Jane Foster.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.881
At one point, Foster lends Thor a shirt that
she says belonged to an ex-boyfriend called

00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:04.881
Donald Blake.

00:04:04.881 --> 00:04:07.599
Eagle-eared fans of the Thor comic books will
have realized that this was a reference to

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.010
the human alter-ego of the Asgardian in the
character’s early years.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.890
Hot Fuzz
Hot Fuzz is the second movie in Edgar Wright

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.600
and Simon Pegg’s Three Flavours Cornetto
Trilogy – the first being the previously

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.039
mentioned Shaun of the Dead.

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.380
Coming two years after the brilliant horror
comedy in 2006, Hot Fuzz made a fun blink-and-you’ll-miss

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.380
it reference to it.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.720
When Nick Frost’s PC Danny Butterman was
browsing a DVD bargain bin at the local supermarket,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.590
a copy of a movie called “Zombies Party”
could be seen lying at the bottom of it.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.990
In reality, Zombies Party was actually the
name by which Shaun of the Dead was released

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.220
in some countries.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.639
I Am Legend
Back in 2007, when I Am Legend was released,

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.160
a Batman v Superman movie was still nothing
more than a dream.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.180
The idea had been conceived – I Am Legend
producer Akiva Goldsman had in fact been working

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.180
on the project - but putting it into practice
was a long way off.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.830
Goldsman’s involvement in the failed project
resulted in the inclusion of a fun in-joke

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.880
in the Will Smith movie.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.810
A Times Square movie poster showing Batman
and Superman’s respective logos overlapping

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.440
each other could be seen in the background.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.850
Of course, the movie has finally become a
reality here in 2016, but back then it was

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.190
almost as if Warner Brothers were saying “the
only chance of this movie happening is in

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.800
a fictional post-apocalyptic world”.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.860
Guardians of the Galaxy
2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy movie was

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.270
genuinely teaming with in-jokes and fun references
– even more so than the average comic book

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.750
movie, which is really saying something.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.480
One of the more subtle examples was the name
of the ship owned by Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.480
in the movie.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.460
It was called “the Milano”, which was
a cute nod to the fact that director James

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.750
Gunn used to have a huge childhood crush on
actress Alyssa Milano, the gorgeous star of

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.740
shows like Melrose Place and Charmed.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.850
