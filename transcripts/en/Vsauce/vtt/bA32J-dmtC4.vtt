00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.160
Come here. Come here.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.490
My webcam doesn't even work.
You know what these are?

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.960
What are they? Nuts.
You don't know what these are? Hazelnuts?

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.349
These are hazelnuts. No!
That's not what it is. They're kinda weird.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.920
What are these one?
Those are cashews. I hate cashew nuts.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.760
I hate hazelnuts.
Do you like chocolate-covered honey comb? No.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.410
Yes, actually. Oh, you do?
Take some of these. Alright.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.410
Speaking of mixed nuts,
today we've got a whole mix of

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.759
a bunch of weird stuff.
It's not a typical episode. We're just full of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.820
facts and bunch of people
I met over here in London. So,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.880
enjoy.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.550
I learned something.
Your eyeballs

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.030
grow when you're a kid.
Sh*t. Yeah.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.180
But once you turn 13 years old your eyeballs -

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.649
they stop growing. But you know what?
Your ears keep growing for ever.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.719
Did you know that?
Did you drink for breakfast again?

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.350
No, no, no, no.
But apparently, like every adult's

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.940
eyeballs are like the exact same size within
a couple millimetres.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.970
Yeah.
So your eyes are the same size as my,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.069
it's just your face is different. Like shows them off better. My face is better than your face.

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.450
Well, that we already established. But I'm
trying to talk about the anatomy of the eye.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.220
Thanks for ruining my self-esteem instead.
Anytime.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.560
Okay, here's a fact that'll make you feel happy.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.800
Did you know

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.170
that in a deck of cards there are so many ways to
arrange those cards

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.970
that when you shuffle a deck,
the order of those cards

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.580
has never ever existed on Earth

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.920
in history.
Yeah.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.330
So whenever you feel sad, shuffle a deck.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.660
Set aside and say "first."

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.560
Three hundred and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.700
fifty. The idea was not really great in this
weight-lifting room,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.260
but I need to be here because I ate a
bunch of liquid nitrogen

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.020
ice cream a couple days ago. It's this
place where they take liquid cream and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.220
sugar and all the ingredients

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.310
and rather than spend a bunch of time
waiting for it to cool down,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.929
they fill up a big ol' jug with liquid nitrogen

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.680
that freezes the cream in a matter of
seconds into delicious ice cream.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.209
They even serve the toppings out of
beakers and test tubes,

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.060
and it was delicious. After eating the
ice cream we stumbled upon an electric

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.160
harp player

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.800
and she told me after the show that even
though the harp's electric, the strings

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.810
are still made the traditional way -

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.970
out of the intestines of animals.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.360
Of course, you have to admit that the
only thing more delicious than liquid

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.010
nitrogen

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.760
ice cream or animal intestines is a cake
in the face

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.140
by iJustine.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.370
I leave you with British Pathé.
These guys have been filming human

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.090
activities

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.510
since we could film human activities and
they're putting all that content

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.250
out on the YouTube for free right now.
They've got early Arnold,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.340
they've got chickens being
hatched in a frying pan

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.790
and old taxidermy museum
and, of course, dogs getting married.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.660
Would you subscribe to British Pathé?

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.830
[Hazel:] I think so.
[Michael:] Yeah. Of course. As should all of you.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.490
Subscribe to Vsauce if you haven't.
[Hazel:] Oh my god, you're checking me again!

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.280
And as always,

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.850
thanks for watching.
