00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:08.190
Ok, 
so you,

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.850
are a 4 billion year old
meat robot.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.225
Yeah, you heard me right.

00:00:13.225 --> 00:00:16.232
In fact, as you're made of 
30-ish trillion cells,

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:18.335
and each of those have their own task,

00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:22.000
you're a robot made of trillions
of mini robots-

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.044
you are a mega-meat-bot!

00:00:25.044 --> 00:00:27.827
And your mission, for the past 4 billion 
years or so-

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.542
and for as long as you keep 
playing this game of life-

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:32.571
is to safeguard the code.

00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:35.012
To duplicate it. 
To pass it on.

00:00:35.012 --> 00:00:38.250
The thing is, you're rubbish at 
copying your own code.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.790
Every time it's copied, errors crop up.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.394
Not good when an error makes 
a robot worse at surviving,

00:00:45.394 --> 00:00:48.047
but sometimes a mistake 
helps them survive...

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:50.094
and they pass that glitch in the code on-

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:53.114
that's evolution in a nutshell, right?

00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:56.715
Which means you're not the result 
of some fancy design, I'm afraid.

00:00:56.715 --> 00:01:00.636
You're a result of billions of 
years of bad copies.

00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:01.663
Go you.

00:01:01.663 --> 00:01:03.767
Another reason you're not totally awesome

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:07.147
is because that megabot of yours 
often breaks down.

00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:07.924
Fortunately,

00:01:07.924 --> 00:01:11.611
cardiologists, immunologists, 
microbiologists- all the "ists"-

00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:15.044
have spent centuries figuring out 
our sensors and wiring

00:01:15.044 --> 00:01:18.764
so if something does go wrong, 
they can usually fix it.

00:01:18.764 --> 00:01:22.344
Where they struggle, though, is when 
the machinery turns on itself-

00:01:22.344 --> 00:01:26.494
when a copying error leads a cell 
to start dividing uncontrollably,

00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:29.604
to grow and multiply into a tumor.

00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:30.764
That's cancer.

00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:33.614
And sadly, even with the might 
of our modern medicine,

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:37.054
some cancers evade treatment.

00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:40.680
But this is where a new band of 
biologists step into the story:

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.750
The "Synthetic Biologists."

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.809
These biohackers are mashing up science, 
medicine and engineering

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:51.182
to rewrite the code and fix 
the un-fixable.

00:01:51.182 --> 00:01:53.803
Biohackers are going into a 
patient's genetic code

00:01:53.803 --> 00:01:56.163
and reprogramming their own immune system

00:01:56.163 --> 00:01:59.219
to recognize cancer cells 
and destroy them.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.349
It's called CAR T-cell therapy, 
and it's awesome.

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.307
See, you're constantly under 
attack by pathogens-

00:02:06.307 --> 00:02:09.431
single-celled bacteria, viruses and fungi.

00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:11.203
Despite deciding, back in the day,

00:02:11.203 --> 00:02:14.694
to stay solo and not 'avengers assemble' 
like you did,

00:02:14.694 --> 00:02:18.275
those pathogens see you, in all 
your mega-meat-bot glory,

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:21.610
as a fortress ripe for the plundering.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.621
Thankfully, you've got a security team 
in place to battle these invaders-

00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:26.961
your immune system-

00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:30.203
and some of it's top guards are 
your white blood cells.

00:02:30.203 --> 00:02:32.807
They trawl the darkness 
that is your inner space,

00:02:32.807 --> 00:02:35.942
checking the IDs of any cells they pass...

00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:37.561
although they're not name badges,

00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:41.526
but rather protein fragments on 
the cell's surface called antigens.

00:02:41.526 --> 00:02:45.656
There are two types of these guards: 
T-cells and B-cells.

00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:49.535
T-cells check those antigen IDs 
using special claws-

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:52.396
receptors that lock with a 
particular antigen.

00:02:52.396 --> 00:02:56.026
If they find a match, they attach and 
they release toxic chemicals

00:02:56.026 --> 00:02:59.281
that burst open the 
invading cell's membrane.

00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:01.851
Their B-cell workmates create antibodies-

00:03:01.851 --> 00:03:03.691
loads of small proteins,

00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:07.173
little claws that latch perfectly onto 
a particular antigen,

00:03:07.173 --> 00:03:12.093
marking them for destruction.

00:03:12.093 --> 00:03:14.255
These two comrades have got your back

00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:17.775
and your immune system is brilliant at 
spotting and fighting pathogens

00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:20.035
that invade from outside.

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:20.885
However,

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:24.713
they're not so good at spotting your 
own cells that have gone rogue.

00:03:24.713 --> 00:03:27.655
The antigens on cancerous cells 
don't look weird,

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:29.767
they look a lot like your own cells,

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:33.771
and the T's and B's aren't 
programmed to attack them.

00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:37.365
The usual way to deal with cancer is 
to try to cut the tumor out,

00:03:37.365 --> 00:03:40.143
or turn to radiotherapy and 
then chemotherapy

00:03:40.143 --> 00:03:43.218
to destroy or block the 
growth of cancer cells,

00:03:43.218 --> 00:03:47.019
but if it's a blood cancer, if it's 
floating around your whole body,

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.864
you can't do that.

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:53.316
And if the blood cancer actually starts in
your white blood cells-

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.918
those key guards in your immune system-

00:03:55.918 --> 00:03:58.538
you'll really struggle to spot it.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:01.624
That's the case with acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia,

00:04:01.624 --> 00:04:06.949
and that's where CAR T-cell therapy 
is kicking butt.

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.563
The biohackers are reprogramming a 
patient's own immune system

00:04:10.563 --> 00:04:14.419
to recognize particular antigens- those 
particular protein fragments-

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.650
on the cancer cells.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.441
To do it, you first need millions 
of a patient's T-cells

00:04:21.441 --> 00:04:24.028
Then, to get a T-cell to do 
something different,

00:04:24.028 --> 00:04:27.401
you need to replace its normal 
code with something new,

00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:29.225
something you've designed.

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:33.644
What synthetic biologists can now do
with DNA is super cool-

00:04:33.644 --> 00:04:37.474
they use a computer to put together 
their own sequences of bases-

00:04:37.474 --> 00:04:40.014
the chemical letters that spell 
out the DNA-

00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:43.342
then they model what that new genetic 
code will do on a computer

00:04:43.342 --> 00:04:46.830
and then make those sequences 
on a DNA printer-

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.048
yeah, that's a thing!-

00:04:48.048 --> 00:04:51.605
printing not with ink, or with a plastic 
polymer like in a 3D printer,

00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:54.617
but with those fundamental 
building blocks of life,

00:04:54.617 --> 00:04:57.857
with those A's and C's and T's and G's.

00:04:57.857 --> 00:05:02.407
The new code they designed for a 
T-cell has 3 key instructions:

00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:06.118
1. It tells it how to recognize 
and kill a cancer cell.

00:05:06.118 --> 00:05:07.146
More specifically,

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:09.196
how to modify an antibody-

00:05:09.196 --> 00:05:12.450
what the B-cells make to latch 
onto a target antigen.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.340
The antibody is modified to 
make a new receptor

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.762
that can detect the particular antigens 
on the specific cancer.

00:05:19.762 --> 00:05:25.064
2. It tells it to make copies of itself 
when it finds that cancer cell

00:05:25.064 --> 00:05:29.154
and 3. It tells it to survive 
in the patient's body.

00:05:29.154 --> 00:05:31.844
To get this new code into 
the patient's T-cells,

00:05:31.844 --> 00:05:33.163
you use a vector-

00:05:33.163 --> 00:05:35.657
it's something that will easily 
infect the T-cell

00:05:35.657 --> 00:05:38.396
and carry that bespoke DNA in with it.

00:05:38.396 --> 00:05:41.318
And voila! 
One CAR T-cell.

00:05:41.318 --> 00:05:44.528
The name comes from a fire-breathing 
monster from Ancient Greece,

00:05:44.528 --> 00:05:48.603
that had a lion's head, a goat's 
body and a serpent's tail.

00:05:48.603 --> 00:05:51.873
It was called "Chimera"-
a name that has now come to be used

00:05:51.873 --> 00:05:56.121
for something that contains two or 
more different types of tissues or cells.

00:05:56.121 --> 00:06:01.021
As this newly engineered cell's genetic 
code is part T-cell, part antibody,

00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:04.974
it's a "C"himera and it goes in search 
of the cancer's "A"ntigen

00:06:04.974 --> 00:06:11.454
using its new "R"eceptor.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:14.742
Before you put the multiplied up 
T-cells back into the patient,

00:06:14.742 --> 00:06:18.963
you give them a mild dose of chemotherapy 
to wipe their existing T-cells.

00:06:18.963 --> 00:06:22.276
Then you simply reinsert the 
now modified T-cells-

00:06:22.276 --> 00:06:23.496
the CAR T-cells-

00:06:23.496 --> 00:06:27.624
and they follow their normal DNA 
programming to move and search.

00:06:27.624 --> 00:06:30.489
However, thanks to their new 
butt-kicking code,

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:32.714
they've changed what they're looking for:

00:06:32.714 --> 00:06:38.313
they're now on a mission to find the 
cancerous cells and destroy them.

00:06:38.313 --> 00:06:40.545
Unlike conventional chemical-based drugs

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:43.821
that get used up or excreted from 
the body pretty quickly,

00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:48.801
CAR T-cells are living drugs that stay in 
the patient's bloodstream for years.

00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:50.476
That's a huge pro.

00:06:50.476 --> 00:06:53.088
The flip side is that they're expensive-

00:06:53.088 --> 00:06:56.274
each CAR T-cell treatment is 
bespoke to the patient-

00:06:56.274 --> 00:06:59.031
and it's more difficult to get them to
work with common cancers

00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:03.192
like breast or lung, because you need a 
specific antigen on the cancer cells

00:07:03.192 --> 00:07:05.347
for the CAR T-cell to target-

00:07:05.347 --> 00:07:08.871
and it's much easier to find 
that in blood cancers.

00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:10.349
It's still early days, though,

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:13.443
and there's an exciting 
future for CAR T-cell therapy.

00:07:13.443 --> 00:07:16.751
Researchers like Dr. Martin Pule 
and his team at UCL,

00:07:16.751 --> 00:07:21.042
are working on improving the leukemia 
and lymphoma treatments even further,

00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:24.757
and there's recently been some 
promising work on solid cancers.

00:07:24.757 --> 00:07:26.566
Thanks to CAR T-cell therapy,

00:07:26.566 --> 00:07:31.368
the survival rate for B acute
lymphoblastic leukemia has improved hugely

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.507
-nearly all patients go into remission-

00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:36.649
which means that leukemia cannot 
be detected anymore-

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:39.967
and most patients stay in remission.

00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:41.646
Biohacking is here,

00:07:41.646 --> 00:07:46.337
and it can reprogram your own 
genetic code to enable your mega-meat-bot

00:07:46.337 --> 00:07:50.107
to do things it's never been 
able to do before!
