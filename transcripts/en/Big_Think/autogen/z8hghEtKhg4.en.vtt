bitkha maybe the most important social

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220
bitkha maybe the most important social
 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.670
bitkha maybe the most important social
experiment going on right now and

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680
experiment going on right now and
 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.089
experiment going on right now and
because it is at the social level it's

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099
because it is at the social level it's
 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.280
because it is at the social level it's
an experiment technologically it's not

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290
an experiment technologically it's not
 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.440
an experiment technologically it's not
an experiment it is robust and it works

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450
an experiment it is robust and it works
 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.990
an experiment it is robust and it works
but because at the social level it's an

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000
but because at the social level it's an
 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.160
but because at the social level it's an
experiment there's still a chance that

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170
experiment there's still a chance that
 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.590
experiment there's still a chance that
it fails and therefore it's risky and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600
it fails and therefore it's risky and
 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.050
it fails and therefore it's risky and
nobody should invest in Bitcoin an

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060
nobody should invest in Bitcoin an
 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.700
nobody should invest in Bitcoin an
amount of money that they cannot afford

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
amount of money that they cannot afford
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.220
amount of money that they cannot afford
to lose because of that risk but there's

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
to lose because of that risk but there's
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.710
to lose because of that risk but there's
also chance that it works out well and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
also chance that it works out well and
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.650
also chance that it works out well and
if it works out well it may be the first

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
if it works out well it may be the first
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.780
if it works out well it may be the first
thing in 5,000 years that finally

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
thing in 5,000 years that finally
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.240
thing in 5,000 years that finally
replaces the gold standard which has

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250
replaces the gold standard which has
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.930
replaces the gold standard which has
been the standard for quite a very long

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
been the standard for quite a very long
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.410
been the standard for quite a very long
time

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
time
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.770
time
and it becomes a new meta currency that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780
and it becomes a new meta currency that
 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.779
and it becomes a new meta currency that
sits atop all currencies I don't think

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
sits atop all currencies I don't think
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.150
sits atop all currencies I don't think
Bitcoin should or would ever replace any

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
Bitcoin should or would ever replace any
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.729
Bitcoin should or would ever replace any
national currencies I think that

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739
national currencies I think that
 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.750
national currencies I think that
salaries need to be paid in local

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
salaries need to be paid in local
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.150
salaries need to be paid in local
currencies and countries need to have

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
currencies and countries need to have
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.549
currencies and countries need to have
their monetary policies and you need

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
their monetary policies and you need
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.410
their monetary policies and you need
lenders of last resort and the system

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
lenders of last resort and the system
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.900
lenders of last resort and the system
that we have in place and probably need

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910
that we have in place and probably need
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.569
that we have in place and probably need
to stay at that level but people need to

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
to stay at that level but people need to
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.119
to stay at that level but people need to
have options and I think that bitcoin

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
have options and I think that bitcoin
 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.570
have options and I think that bitcoin
will become probably the currency of the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
will become probably the currency of the
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.219
will become probably the currency of the
internet or of the digital world but

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
internet or of the digital world but
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.830
internet or of the digital world but
also in in that sense a new currency

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
also in in that sense a new currency
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.539
also in in that sense a new currency
that sits at up all currencies and for

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
that sits at up all currencies and for
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.370
that sits at up all currencies and for
certain transactions that you do either

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
certain transactions that you do either
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.020
certain transactions that you do either
because there on the internet or because

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
because there on the internet or because
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.340
because there on the internet or because
they're international it makes more

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350
they're international it makes more
 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.929
they're international it makes more
sense to do them in Bitcoin

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
sense to do them in Bitcoin
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.260
sense to do them in Bitcoin
than in any other currency eventually

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270
than in any other currency eventually
 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.789
than in any other currency eventually
gold is decentralized nobody decides how

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
gold is decentralized nobody decides how

much colder is it's centralized there's

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189
much colder is it's centralized there's
 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.069
much colder is it's centralized there's
not one company or one country or one

not one company or one country or one
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.840
not one company or one country or one
person deciding how much colder is

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
person deciding how much colder is
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.810
person deciding how much colder is
there's also not one company one country

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
there's also not one company one country
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.060
there's also not one company one country
one person deciding what's the price of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
one person deciding what's the price of
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.630
one person deciding what's the price of
gold it's decided in the market and also

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
gold it's decided in the market and also
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.090
gold it's decided in the market and also
there's not one person one country or

there's not one person one country or
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130
there's not one person one country or
one company deciding what you can

one company deciding what you can
 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.810
one company deciding what you can
exchange gold for it's totally

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
exchange gold for it's totally
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.090
exchange gold for it's totally
decentralized and it's also sort of

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
decentralized and it's also sort of
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.819
decentralized and it's also sort of
anonymous if I pay you with something

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
anonymous if I pay you with something
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.550
anonymous if I pay you with something
for something with gold there's no trace

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
for something with gold there's no trace
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.469
for something with gold there's no trace
of that if I pay you for something with

cash it's absolutely anonymous so I

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
cash it's absolutely anonymous so I
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.039
cash it's absolutely anonymous so I
think that we need to regulate Bitcoin

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049
think that we need to regulate Bitcoin
 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.650
think that we need to regulate Bitcoin
to have basic consumer protections to

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
to have basic consumer protections to
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.160
to have basic consumer protections to
prevent criminal activity on it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170
prevent criminal activity on it
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.040
prevent criminal activity on it
to prevent money laundry but I think

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050
to prevent money laundry but I think
 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.110
to prevent money laundry but I think
doing so is not hard and I think doing

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
doing so is not hard and I think doing
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.920
doing so is not hard and I think doing
so it's doable with the regulations that

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
so it's doable with the regulations that
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.670
so it's doable with the regulations that
we already have in place to account for

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
we already have in place to account for
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.979
we already have in place to account for
cash cash is very anonymous and we have

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989
cash cash is very anonymous and we have
 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.860
cash cash is very anonymous and we have
regulations in place to manage the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
regulations in place to manage the
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.260
regulations in place to manage the
anonymity of cash and each country has

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270
anonymity of cash and each country has
 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.570
anonymity of cash and each country has
regulations to address people having

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580
regulations to address people having
 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.130
regulations to address people having
foreign currency so between the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140
foreign currency so between the
 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.930
foreign currency so between the
regulations that exist for cash gold and

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940
regulations that exist for cash gold and
 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.580
regulations that exist for cash gold and
foreign currency you have all of the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590
foreign currency you have all of the
 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.589
foreign currency you have all of the
regulatory infrastructure you need to

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599
regulatory infrastructure you need to
 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.509
regulatory infrastructure you need to
deal with Bitcoin but you do not need to

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519
deal with Bitcoin but you do not need to
 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.759
deal with Bitcoin but you do not need to
what we're seeing right now is because a

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769
what we're seeing right now is because a
 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.650
what we're seeing right now is because a
lot of the regulators are still getting

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660
lot of the regulators are still getting
 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.080
lot of the regulators are still getting
their arms around Bitcoin the first

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090
their arms around Bitcoin the first
 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.420
their arms around Bitcoin the first
reaction is it's a scare reaction that

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430
reaction is it's a scare reaction that
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.400
reaction is it's a scare reaction that
tends to over-regulating which that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410
tends to over-regulating which that
 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.110
tends to over-regulating which that
wouldn't wouldn't be good for the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120
wouldn't wouldn't be good for the
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.490
wouldn't wouldn't be good for the
regulators wouldn't be good for the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500
regulators wouldn't be good for the
 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.590
regulators wouldn't be good for the
industry but I think we will get there

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600
industry but I think we will get there
 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.130
industry but I think we will get there
and it's not so complicated
