[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: Hi,
everybody, and welcome to Coffee

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:07.914
With a Googler.

00:00:07.914 --> 00:00:10.740
Today, I'm in Sydney, Australia,
in a music room in the Google

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.740
office to chat with Casey
Whitelaw, who is an engineering

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.270
director for Google Maps.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.930
Welcome, Casey.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.200
Thanks for being on the show.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.640
CASEY WHITELAW: Thanks a lot.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.610
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.080
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So tell us what

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.120
is it that you do as an
engineering director.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.661
CASEY WHITELAW: The
teams that I work

00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:24.570
with build Google Maps APIs.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.600
So this means, basically, if
you see a Google map that's

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.910
not inside the
Google Maps app, then

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.640
that's probably served through
one of the APIs that we build.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: So there's,
like, lots of geo-type data

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.207
that gets fed into lots
of different sources.

00:00:36.207 --> 00:00:37.540
And that's what you're building.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.998
CASEY WHITELAW:
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:38.998 --> 00:00:41.760
So the most obvious examples
that you'll see, on the web

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.180
we have the web Maps API.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.042
So you can put a map
in your web page.

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:47.500
And it's not just
a map, of course,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.860
but it's drawing lines on
that map, and directions,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.790
and Street View.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.750
And basically, almost everything
that's in Google Maps itself,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.430
you can put inside
your own web pages

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.395
and use to present
your own information.

00:00:58.395 --> 00:00:59.520
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.061
CASEY WHITELAW: And you can take
all of that, the same things

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.739
that you can do with web Maps
API, and do that on Android

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.730
through Android MapView.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.912
And also in iOS,
through iOS Maps SDK.

00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:09.870
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.770
Now, in working all this,
you must have some favorites.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.360
CASEY WHITELAW:
There's so many APIs.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.670
Right?

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.890
I mean, we haven't even
mentioned all of them yet.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.770
Like, I mentioned web
and Android and iOS.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.710
Everything that you get
through all of those, and even

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.360
some more things again, you
can get through web services.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.140
And so this means that you can
use them directly with your web

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.815
server, or on a client that
you need to customize more.

00:01:30.815 --> 00:01:31.690
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.090
CASEY WHITELAW: So the
range is really huge.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.590
I think it's something you'll
see if you go to the dev site,

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.350
as well.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.090
CASEY WHITELAW: Something
which often strikes people

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.400
as being very simple,
that is actually, I think,

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.915
fascinatingly complex
is the Directions API.

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:47.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.456
CASEY WHITELAW: So
on the surface of it,

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:50.430
you're just moving.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.471
You want to know how long
it's going to take you,

00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:54.500
or how you should get
from point A to point B.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.540
CASEY WHITELAW: And so that
seems like a pretty simple API.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.770
Right?

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.760
I'm going to give
you a source, I'm

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.240
going to give you a destination.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.700
You tell me how it
is that I'm going

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.580
to go from one to the other.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.455
CASEY WHITELAW: But just
like in Google Maps,

00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:09.531
this gets quite complicated.

00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:12.030
The things that you can do with
this are quite complex, too.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.821
So something that most
people don't realize

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:16.080
is that we use
live traffic data.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.700
So that the ETAs
that you're getting

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.635
and the directions
that we're giving you

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:21.450
aren't the same,
depending on exactly when

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.880
it is that you request for.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.780
So you can request a
specific time of day,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.880
for example, and
get a travel time

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.220
that actually reflects that.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
love planning ahead.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.129
Like, when I have to go
to the airport tomorrow,

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.092
I need to know now when
I would be leaving,

00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:34.050
and that kind of stuff.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.435
So I can actually feed in, I'm
going to the airport tomorrow

00:02:36.435 --> 00:02:36.990
at this time.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.040
What's the traffic
going to be like?

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.270
CASEY WHITELAW: And
if you're a developer,

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.228
and you're developing an
application for people

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.330
to get to an airport,
you can actually do that.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.830
Right?

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.200
You can give them directions
if you know when they're

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.560
going to need to be traveling.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.620
You can actually give them
directions and travel time,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.440
together with showing
that on the Google Map.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.550
That's for the time that you
know that they have to travel.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.330
LAURENCE MORONEY: Exactly.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.690
CASEY WHITELAW: And then that's
going to be synced to it.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.300
So I think that's really cool.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.410
LAURENCE MORONEY: And it's
not just driving, right?

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.390
There's also things like
public transport and walking.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.190
CASEY WHITELAW: Public
transport, and walking,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.690
and cycling.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.620
So most of what you
can do on Google Maps,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.330
you can do through
the API as well.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.770
So that's one aspect of
it being richer than just

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.810
saying from here to there.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.574
The multiple modes,
and the using traffic.

00:03:16.574 --> 00:03:18.240
Including predicted
traffic, by the way.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.160
So if you said, for
sometime in the future,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.130
we'll use our models to
try and work out our best

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.150
estimate of the traffic.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.650
And you can also do things like
multi-waypoint optimization.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.690
So you can, if you
know that you have

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.340
to visit many different
locations, like maybe--

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: Stop
for a coffee on the way?

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.559
CASEY WHITELAW: Exactly.

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:37.840
It's like, come to Google,
have a coffee with me.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.230
Then head out into the city,
and so forth, but you're

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.510
not sure exactly what
the best order is

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.950
in which to do those things.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.370
You can actually just
send a set of waypoints,

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.299
and say, optimize.

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.340
And then we're going to
do the traveling salesman

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.470
problem for you.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.840
Because we're Google, and
that's the kind of problem

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.907
we like solving.

00:03:55.907 --> 00:03:57.990
And we'll do a traveling
salesman problem for you,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.420
and actually
optimize your route,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.910
so that you've got the most
efficient path through those.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: Pretty cool.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.010
CASEY WHITELAW:
Yeah, really cool.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.280
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.779
So that efficient path is
based on traffic conditions,

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:08.570
and those type of--

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.230
CASEY WHITELAW: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.490
And optimizes for travel
time, not just time, not just

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.420
distance, for example.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.200
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now, not that
long ago, apps for geo and apps

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.149
for maps on your phone
used to be like a map.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.020
Here's A, and here's B, and
here's how you get there,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.200
but without all that kind
of location intelligence.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.533
But now we're just seeing
more and more innovation, more

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:29.430
and more cool things happening.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.280
What cool apps have you
seen that have excited you,

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.530
or inspired you?

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.830
CASEY WHITELAW: Yeah,
in the location space.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.120
So I saw one recently, which
was a great, kind of cute use

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.820
of location
information, which isn't

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.160
in itself very sophisticated.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.050
But I think it's a great
example of, I think,

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.400
the democratization, really,
of location information.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.044
So the app that I saw
is called platypusSPOT.

00:04:53.044 --> 00:04:54.335
LAURENCE MORONEY: platypusSPOT?

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:55.210
CASEY WHITELAW: platypusSPOT.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.930
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.810
CASEY WHITELAW: And so, it's
pretty Australian-focused.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.184
You know, so the international
readers out there, viewers

00:05:00.184 --> 00:05:01.760
out there--

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.930
so platypuses are a
relatively rare creature here

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.680
in Australia, and
there's plenty of people

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.780
who are interested
in finding them,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.160
and then sharing when they do.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.670
So it's basically
Instagram for--

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.097
LAURENCE MORONEY:
For platypuses.

00:05:13.097 --> 00:05:14.680
CASEY WHITELAW: And
so what you do is,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.150
you're out on a bushwalk.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.560
Or maybe you're even in
the city or something,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.520
at the Yarra River in Melbourne,
and you see a platypus.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.420
And you can tag it.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.890
You say, this is where I am.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.470
Here's my photo of the
platypus, if you're lucky enough

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.910
to take a photo of one.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.530
And that all gets logged.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.080
So if you then want
to see a platypus,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.030
you can see where
have platypuses

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.920
been sighted recently,
so I can go and find one.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.260
But also, it's
building this database

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.300
behind the scenes,
which scientists can

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.530
use for other things as well.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.350
So I've heard-- I'm
no expert in this--

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.220
that platypus is related
to water quality.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.710
So platypus presence is related
to water quality in rivers.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.210
So imagine--

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.749
CASEY WHITELAW: You can build
up some kind of location

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:59.170
intelligence information from--

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.465
LAURENCE MORONEY: Interesting.

00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:00.290
CASEY WHITELAW: --from
these sightings.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.580
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
they like clean water.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.730
So if you see them,
you know that's where

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:04.800
this-- that's cool.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.240
CASEY WHITELAW: Yeah.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.906
LAURENCE MORONEY: So,
platypus metadata.

00:06:06.906 --> 00:06:09.520
CASEY WHITELAW: And the
thing is, they would never--

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.110
if you didn't have a map
that you could use easily--

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.550
and if you wind back 10
years, pre-Google Maps,

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.790
because the Maps API
happened really early

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.300
on in the development
of Google Maps, too--

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.880
if you wind back the clock,
and there is no easy way

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.460
to show things on a
map on your own site,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.520
you have no option
for how to do this.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.920
So like, you can get
people to enter an address.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.444
Where were you standing
when this happened?

00:06:34.444 --> 00:06:35.360
And so the fact that--

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.070
LAURENCE MORONEY:
On a tiny keyboard.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.670
CASEY WHITELAW: Exactly.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.470
Well, I guess in those
days, you probably

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.850
would have had to carry your
computer around with you,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.190
or wait 'till you got back.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.440
LAURENCE MORONEY: I had one
of those 10-pound laptops.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.630
CASEY WHITELAW: Yeah.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.120
And so, now you have
a map that you can use

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.060
very easily inside your app.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.450
Location information
from your phone,

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.390
which is pretty
accurate basically

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.440
everywhere in the world,
a camera, and some web

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.070
service that's collating
all of this for you.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.070
It's just amazing.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.653
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Isn't it incredible?

00:07:04.653 --> 00:07:07.120
The amount of intelligence
and data that's there, that--

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.370
but then, how people are
turning that into innovation,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.520
and building really cool apps.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.766
Like the platypusSPOT.

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:13.640
CASEY WHITELAW: Yeah.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.710
And the other thing
I'm seeing, everyone's

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.220
seeing a lot at the moment,
is location-based games.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.710
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yes.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.126
CASEY WHITELAW:
Obviously, there's

00:07:20.126 --> 00:07:22.570
Pokemon GO, which has been
a huge hit everywhere.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.370
And you can see
that building on top

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.890
of a model of the real world.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.547
So there's a lot more that I
expect we'll see in the future.

00:07:29.547 --> 00:07:30.880
We had a play-around with this--

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.210
I'm sure that you know about
this-- in Santa Tracker

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.920
last year.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.150
So we had our own
location-based game

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.580
in there, which was a lot
of fun to put together

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.020
on top of Google Maps.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.574
So that was a really great first
test for us, building that.

00:07:44.574 --> 00:07:46.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
that whole concept

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.270
blew my mind, because to me
all of the innovation in gaming

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.740
was going into power.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.290
You know, better and
better GPUs, higher frame

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:54.940
rate, higher resolution.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.410
And then suddenly,
out of the blue,

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.500
some games came out that
changed the paradigm completely.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.155
And it was getting
you off the sofa,

00:08:01.155 --> 00:08:03.280
and going out and running
around in the real world.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.440
And that's incredible.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.590
CASEY WHITELAW: Yeah.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.173
I think it just shows you what
you can do when you have access

00:08:07.173 --> 00:08:08.500
to different kinds of data.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.375
You can build different
experiences around it

00:08:10.375 --> 00:08:11.420
than you could otherwise.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.134
So, good APIs enable innovation.

00:08:14.134 --> 00:08:15.550
CASEY WHITELAW:
Yeah, and things--

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.300
if we go back to the
platypusSPOT example,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.677
this is never something-- as
much as I love platypuses,

00:08:21.677 --> 00:08:24.260
it's never something that we're
going to build in Google Maps,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:24.760
right?

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.370
Because we'd have to
build a platypus tracker,

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.850
and then we'd probably turn it
into a all things in the world

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.130
tracker by the time
it became something

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.409
that was in Google Maps.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.159
And so it's just
not going to happen.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.966
And so, if we were the only ones
building on top of Google Maps,

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:43.299
then platypusSPOT wouldn't
exist in the form that it is.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.000
So it's great to have a
platform that other people can

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.382
build on top of and make it
part of their businesses.

00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:49.840
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I mean, who would

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.780
have thought that we would think
of a platypus spotter, even?

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:53.280
Right?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.738
But if there's somebody who's
really passionate about them,

00:08:55.738 --> 00:08:57.520
or somebody who's
researching about them.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.320
And this having an API
allows them to build a tool

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.570
that they could share with us.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.460
CASEY WHITELAW: And we don't
need to think about it, either.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.380
It doesn't need to
be important to us

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.900
for it to exist in the world.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.630
I think it's something, which
is that there's a balance there.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.540
We see a lot of people solving
the same kinds of problems

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.400
over and over again,
and using Maps.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.120
To pick a very common online
example, if you've got a store,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.400
you probably want to point out
to people where that store is.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.730
And so that's
something that, yes,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.670
we don't need to know
about your particular store

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.770
in order to make our Maps API.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.420
But it's important
for us to understand

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.630
that this is a use case
that's important to people.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.857
That many people are going
to use Maps to build a store

00:09:38.857 --> 00:09:40.690
finder, and so we should
make that something

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:41.620
that's really easy to do.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.310
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yup.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.739
So if I'm a
developer, and I want

00:09:43.739 --> 00:09:45.280
to build a store
finder for my store,

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.710
or I want to build
the next platypusSPOT

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.566
or whatever it is
type spotting app,

00:09:50.566 --> 00:09:51.690
where should I get started?

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.110
What advice would you give me?

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.693
CASEY WHITELAW: So
go to the dev site.

00:09:54.693 --> 00:09:56.040
There's lots of documentation.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.590
There's sample code.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.010
There's even some complete
applications that are on there.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.420
You can get started
really quickly.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.850
I would just say,
go check it out.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:03.470
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.000
Download some source
code and start hacking.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.630
CASEY WHITELAW: Yeah that's it.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sounds good.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.860
And that's
developers.google.com/maps,

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.360
right?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.140
CASEY WHITELAW:
You're the expert.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.879
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's
a beautiful thing.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.170
Well, thank you so much, Casey.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.730
It's been a lot of fun,
and I'm going to go check

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:14.840
out that platypus app.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.070
CASEY WHITELAW:
Thank you, Laurence.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.700
LAURENCE MORONEY:
