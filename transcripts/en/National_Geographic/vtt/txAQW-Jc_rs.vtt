00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:10.467
Red diver, uh-- take
a look at your green.

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:12.066
Make sure that's not caught.

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.500
Understand red.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.900
NARRATOR: 20 feet
underwater, Coast

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.667
Guard divers are trying
to check the props

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:21.233
and rudder for damage.

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.033
Hey, red, turn to your left.

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:25.400
NARRATOR: But one of them
is caught on the ice.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.567
Red diver's trying to
assist him right now.

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:28.500
Put your arm up.

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.066
Green diver, squared away.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.633
Is he good?

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.033
OK, both divers?

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:38.967
OK, red.

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:40.000
OK, green.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.467
OK, both divers.

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:44.100
There they go.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.667
Now the fun begins.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.667
Where are you guys headed?

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:52.900
Uh, we're just gonna
check [bleep] out.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.467
I only have one rudder.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:58.567
If I lose it, I
can't steer the boat.

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:01.233
Hey, dude, you want
to check out over here?

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:01.934
Yeah.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.633
This isn't the normal world.

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:14.533
This is Antarctica.

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:18.433
And we have to do
dangerous things.

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:21.400
The overriding pressure
on my shoulders

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.066
is fulfilling that mission
to resupply Antarctica.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:33.567
Now we look in--

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:36.467
Prop looks good.

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:38.533
Hubs look great.

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:39.834
Let's check out the rudder.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.400
Sir, uh, everything
looks good down here.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.834
All right, just keep it here.

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:50.800
Put the engines on
30 minutes standby.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.734
30 minute standby on.

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:53.533
Woo-hoo!

00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:54.467
We're good.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:55.867
Looking great.

00:01:55.867 --> 00:02:00.834
Red diver, do you see the
marine life 20 feet from here?

00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:03.767
Woo-hoo!

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:06.133
Got a big orca back here.
