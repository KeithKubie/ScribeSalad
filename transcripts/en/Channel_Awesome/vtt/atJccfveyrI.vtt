00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.460
Well, I've already reviewed a ton of direct-to-DVD sequels. Why not review this one?

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.320
"Inspector Gadget 2". Yeah, kind of an Inspector-Gadget-filled month, isn't it?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.000
This is a follow-up to the first film starring Matthew Broderick, and though it's not nearly as bad

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.720
-- hell, you just subtract Matthew Broderick from it, it's immediately better -- it's still pretty bad.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.620
This time, Inspector Gadget is played by French Stewart of "Third Rock from the Sun" fame.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.720
At first, you think it's going to be *exactly* like the first one with its awkward style and weird, in-your-face effects that...

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.900
*really*, really suck even more this time.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.880
But, as it goes on, it calms down... a bit as it tries to squeeze a story in.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.060
Inspector Gadget is having a bunch of glitches, and his niece, Penny,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.680
now in high school, is starting to notice and tells him to go get it fixed.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.280
His inventory, however, has an even better plan: make a brand new Gadget.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.740
Enter G2, an updated version of Gadget, who seems to be a better officer in every way,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.260
not only having no glitches, but no human parts at all! That's right. She's 100% Machine.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.020
And as soon as Inspector Gadget hears that, he falls immediately in love...

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.780
yeah... that's kinda weird/creepy.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.300
She does the typical robot stuff: doesn't understand human emotion,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.800
(robotic voice) talks like this all the time, (normal voice) that whole jazz.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.320
But give her credit; it's a lot more interesting than Dr. Claw escaping!

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.380
Only this time, it's not played by Rupert Everett, and this time you don't see his face.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.980
Well... okay, you sorta... you see his mouth and his noise, sometimes you see his eyes

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.160
-- actually, you kinda do see his face, but they at least make an attempt to hide it.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.060
This time, it's played by some... old guy with a really weird voice that sounds nothing like the original Claw,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.960
but he has the claw from the first movie, but you don't see his face like the cartoon. It's... really kinda confusing.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.440
But at least we see Penny snooping around with her dog, Brain, and she has the little watch.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.300
Ehh... no computer book, but... she has the watch! And they give her a kinda bigger part.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.900
Then it's weird because she'll tell Brain to look after Gadget, but, y'know, he's a dog, like a real dog,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.520
so he can't do anything like what he does in the cartoon, and wh-- What is the movie trying to be?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.420
The sad, desperate souls that actually like the first film aren't gonna connect that much with it.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.160
Like I said, Gadget's different, Penny's different, Dr. Claw is *really* different,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.340
and the fans of the cartoon are gonna like a few things changed, but it's still clearly not trying hard enough to be the cartoon.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.560
It's almost like the filmmakers got all these really angry notes, and they said, "Oh, okay. We're not supposed to see Claw's face,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.520
Penny's supposed to snoop around, Brain's supposed to help. Okay. We'll do that."

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.220
But then, for some reason, they still never looked at the cartoon. They didn't see *how* you're supposed to do it.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.360
And, don't get me wrong, the cartoon's weird. I think it's kinda debatable whether not it's actually even good.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.220
But it was kind of entertaining, and interesting, and had kind of it's own unique formula, and it's all kind of awkward charm.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.720
*This* doesn't.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.220
While French Stewart is definitely a better Gadget than Matthew Broderick,

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.360
he still doesn't seem like he's being told the right things to do.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.220
That is to say, comedically, his line delivery just seems off.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.240
It doesn't sound like he's trying to impersonate Don Adams or do his own thing. It's just kind of... weird.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:29.160
{... all my years of crime fighting, Gadgetmobile... is that it's always the most quiet... RIGHT before the criminals strike!}

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.300
On top of that, a lot of the comedy is off. Every once in a while, you get a little bit of a giggle,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.920
like I like how the bad guys are sneaking in as this band, and none of the instruments they're playing matches

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.700
the music that's being played behind 'em on an obvious recording.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.860
In fact, it's sitar music and there's not even a sitar in there.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.740
That's funny. Once in a while, you'll get a little moment like that.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.360
The effects are really awful.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.020
At the very least, in the first film, they tried to mix some practical effects with the CG. Here, it's all CG.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.260
And it's "We don't give a crap" CG.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.840
Look at this scene where this rope is supposed to wrap around Gadget... What the hell am I even looking at?

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.980
It looks like one of those old Marvel hologram cards. It doesn't even look solid.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.820
The acting, pretty much from everybody, either ranges from bad to just... off.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.280
I don't know what direction they were given, but it was always kind of the wrong direction.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.520
Everyone says their lines just a little strangely, and that's already made odd by the fact that they already have strange voices.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.200
The only time the acting does work a little bit is when French Stewart has to have an emotional moment.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.260
I know that sounds strange, and there aren't that many of 'em, but when he genuinely seems confused,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.260
or sad, or upset, it's done in such a brainless way that he still kinda seems sympathetic.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.480
I can't explain it. There's something weirdly genuine about it.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.840
Aside from that, I don't know what this film is going for.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.800
It'll have the little MAD logo like from the cartoon, but even that looks a little different.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.360
Why? You have the rights to Inspector Gadget. Just go all-out there.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.380
So, okay. Is it as bad as the first one? No.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.820
There's very few things that are as bad as the first one. The first one was painful.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.940
The first one, every single time a joke was made, or somebody gave a weird look, it hurt. The first film hurt.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.360
This film doesn't hurt, it's just... dumb. It's a dumb movie. It'll probably be forgotten the minute you watch it.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.680
The first film leaves scars -- scars that will never heal. This is just a lame flick.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.340
So, if for some reason, your kid wants to see it, you can go ahead and show it. There's nothing that's gonna screw 'em up.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.420
But for anyone else, if you have any interest in seeing this movie,

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.220
Go Go Gadget Don't.
