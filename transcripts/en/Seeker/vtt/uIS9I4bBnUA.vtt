00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.830
Are humans the only animals
that enjoy a nice drink

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.226
after a hard day's work?

00:00:04.226 --> 00:00:04.725
Nuh-uh-uh!

00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:11.190
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.070
Hey, everyone.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.389
Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.930
There comes a time
in everyone's life

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.365
when we ask ourselves, wait a
minute, do animals get drunk?

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:20.710
This is usually asked
when we are drunk

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.380
and possibly watching
viral videos on YouTube,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.500
like the classic video of
this little square that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.456
got a little to
hammered snacking

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:29.830
on fermented pumpkins that
were left outside these folks'

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.890
house for Halloween.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.550
I die pretty much every
time I watch that one.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.360
Just like humans,
animals can get drunk.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.310
And some species actively pursue
intoxication out in the wild.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.900
Of course, these animals aren't
hitting the local rain forest

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.600
fridge to crack
open a can of beer.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.100
They're hitting the
fermented fruit.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.330
Fermented nectars,
pumpkins, and berries

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.290
all contain small
amounts of alcohol,

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.430
which is perfect if
you're a small creature.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.980
And smaller creatures
are the ones

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.810
usually getting drunk
because it doesn't

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.080
take as much to do them in.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.740
Take, for instance, the
tiny pen-tailed tree shrew

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.180
which loves to sit the
nectar of the bertam palm

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.510
in the Malaysian rainforest.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.260
Thanks to its own
production of yeast,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.950
the bertam palm
produces fermented

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.310
nectar that's about 4% alcohol,
the same as some beers.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.940
Animal physiologists in Germany
observed the pen-tailed tree

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.440
shrews making their way over
to the bertam palm every night,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.900
sometimes making
two or three trips

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.810
and hanging out for a few hours.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.280
And the tree shrews
aren't alone.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.210
Tumblr's favorite,
the low loris,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.480
also enjoy a nightly
brew in the rainforest.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.190
But even though these
guys love to drink,

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.900
the animal kingdom's real
alcoholics are vervet monkeys.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.720
Vervet monkeys
have the same rates

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.520
of alcohol consumption in
their colonies as humans do.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.310
Most of the monkey's
drinks some.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.380
12% drink heavily.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.110
5% drink excessively, and a
small group don't drink at all.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.710
In this species,
the monkey youth

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.450
also tend to drink more
than the grown-up monkeys.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.850
Sounds familiar?

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.070
It's all coming together now.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.389
These mischievous little
fur balls are cray-cray.

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:52.180
The ones that live in
the Caribbean islands

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.080
are known for snagging
alcoholic drinks

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.580
from tourists
lounging on the beach.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.704
In the past, they were
known for gorging themselves

00:01:57.704 --> 00:01:59.400
on fermented sugar
cane crops being

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.120
grown by the rum industry.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.540
Now, hop on over to
Australia, and Darwin locals

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.790
are about to experience an
annual phenomenon dubbed

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.270
drunk lorikeet season.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.699
And around October or
November, hundreds of lorikeets

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.750
exhibit tell-tale
symptoms of drunkenness.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.270
They can be seen falling over,
having difficulty flying,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.010
or flying into things.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.670
They also become very
friendly with humans,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.112
which is not typical
of lorikeets.

00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:23.570
Scientists in the
area believe this

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.220
happens because there
are lots of fleshy,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.890
fermenting fruit
available for the birds

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.460
to snack on in the fall.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.720
And a similar phenomenon happens
in Vienna with the song birds.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.960
But here's the sad part.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.520
About half of the
drunk lorikeets

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.130
seen by vets in
Darwin, Australia die.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.810
Just like too much
alcohol kills humans,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.790
too much alcohol kills animals.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.080
The lorikeets are so small,
their little bodies just

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.650
can't handle it, which FYI, is
why human peoples should never

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.500
give alcohol to animal peoples.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.390
So there you go, DNews answering
your life-altering questions

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.520

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.265
You're welcome.

00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:55.390
Thanks for joining me guys.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.980
