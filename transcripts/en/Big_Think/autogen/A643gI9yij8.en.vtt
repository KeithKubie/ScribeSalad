about three years ago I became the

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970
about three years ago I became the
 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.369
about three years ago I became the
national coach of the United States

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379
national coach of the United States
 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.070

international math Olympiad team I was

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080
international math Olympiad team I was
 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.570
international math Olympiad team I was
very happy for a day thinking this is

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580
very happy for a day thinking this is
 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.400
very happy for a day thinking this is
this is this is very interesting but the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410
this is this is very interesting but the
 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.379
this is this is very interesting but the
next day I started to think that maybe I

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
next day I started to think that maybe I
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.910
next day I started to think that maybe I
should do something with this and I

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
should do something with this and I
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.769
should do something with this and I
decided that I wanted to focus not only

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779
decided that I wanted to focus not only
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.929
decided that I wanted to focus not only
on training an elite group of students

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939
on training an elite group of students
 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.700
on training an elite group of students
but trying to do some as much as I could

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
but trying to do some as much as I could
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.820
but trying to do some as much as I could
to boost the baseline mathematics

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830
to boost the baseline mathematics
 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.839
to boost the baseline mathematics
capability in this entire country

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
capability in this entire country
 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.820
capability in this entire country
unfortunately I had no money no

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
unfortunately I had no money no
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.910

connection and only one person so the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
connection and only one person so the
 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.170
connection and only one person so the
only thing I knew was mathematics

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
only thing I knew was mathematics
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.990
only thing I knew was mathematics
algorithms and this probability and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
algorithms and this probability and
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.180
algorithms and this probability and
network theory so after thinking for

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
network theory so after thinking for
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.240
network theory so after thinking for
some time I actually came to an idea

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
some time I actually came to an idea
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580
some time I actually came to an idea
which was based on using these core

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
which was based on using these core
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.380
which was based on using these core
mathematical areas I had been working

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390
mathematical areas I had been working
 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.500
mathematical areas I had been working
with to actually build a solution for

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
with to actually build a solution for
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.090
with to actually build a solution for

free on every smartphone this is
 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.479
free on every smartphone this is
actually the project I'm working on

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
actually the project I'm working on
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.420
actually the project I'm working on
right now called XP our principle is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
right now called XP our principle is
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.580
right now called XP our principle is
that actually you could turn that

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
that actually you could turn that
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.400
that actually you could turn that
smartphone into a virtual tutor which

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
smartphone into a virtual tutor which
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.709

automates what a person would get if

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
automates what a person would get if
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.690
automates what a person would get if
they hired a tutor it wouldn't be as

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
they hired a tutor it wouldn't be as
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580
they hired a tutor it wouldn't be as
good as a tutor but it could get very

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
good as a tutor but it could get very
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.010
good as a tutor but it could get very
close and if you could deliver a free

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
close and if you could deliver a free
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.130

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.170
wealthy because today the cost of a
tutor is in the thirty dollars an hour

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
tutor is in the thirty dollars an hour
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.240

depending on how you look at it if you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
depending on how you look at it if you
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.359
depending on how you look at it if you
can reduce that to zero dollars an hour

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
can reduce that to zero dollars an hour

can reduce that to zero dollars an hour
you would actually open up this

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
you would actually open up this
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.350
you would actually open up this
accessibility to everyone if we realize

can start to conceptualize well

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
can start to conceptualize well
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.109
can start to conceptualize well
knowledge happens to be all of these

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
knowledge happens to be all of these

concepts linked together in this network
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.069
concepts linked together in this network
then the problem becomes if you have

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079
then the problem becomes if you have
 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.020
then the problem becomes if you have
this network how do you mathematically

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
this network how do you mathematically
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.719
this network how do you mathematically
analyze where a person should go next

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
analyze where a person should go next
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.510
analyze where a person should go next
that can be done by using probability

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
that can be done by using probability
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.219
that can be done by using probability
and statistics to find new ways to

and statistics to find new ways to
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.230
and statistics to find new ways to
measure how much each person understands

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
measure how much each person understands

about each concept statistics because
the way that one would measure this is

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
the way that one would measure this is
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.050
the way that one would measure this is
by asking them questions the experience

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
by asking them questions the experience
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.789
by asking them questions the experience
someone has is they indicate what they

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
someone has is they indicate what they
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.529
someone has is they indicate what they
want to learn and then the system starts

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
want to learn and then the system starts
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.600
want to learn and then the system starts
to pitch questions at them questions

they want to understand as the questions
 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.610
they want to understand as the questions
come based on people's responses to the

next questions come from in the same way
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.009
next questions come from in the same way
that a human tutor adjust their line of

successful or not successful at the
 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.860
successful or not successful at the
previous question if the student reaches

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
previous question if the student reaches
 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.539
previous question if the student reaches
a point where they are hopelessly

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549
a point where they are hopelessly
 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.039
a point where they are hopelessly
confused meaning they don't know how to

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049
confused meaning they don't know how to
 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.229
confused meaning they don't know how to
do this question at all then the system

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239
do this question at all then the system
 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.089
do this question at all then the system
suggests that maybe they could read some

idea is that this should cure boredom at
 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.100
idea is that this should cure boredom at
the high end and also cure confusion at

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110
the high end and also cure confusion at
 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.170
the high end and also cure confusion at
the struggling end I actually started

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
the struggling end I actually started

us built this system together but when

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840
us built this system together but when
 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.619
us built this system together but when
when you start with no resources you

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629
when you start with no resources you
 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:16.850
when you start with no resources you
