the flat body are not possible that's
 

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:43.970
the flat body are not possible that's
not commenced formal and so that's the

an interview and she places it on a
 

00:30:56.909 --> 00:31:00.380
an interview and she places it on a
video monitor downstage and then the

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:00.390
video monitor downstage and then the

obviously it's impossible for her to
sink that up it's always behind or ahead

00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:12.419
sink that up it's always behind or ahead
 

00:31:12.419 --> 00:31:15.110
sink that up it's always behind or ahead
or not quite exactly the same movement

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120
or not quite exactly the same movement
 

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.140
or not quite exactly the same movement
so that gap is clearly there and what

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:18.150

further further behind both temporally
and spatially so by the time it reached

then I mixed them so that they kept
shifting into one another so they kept

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:04.660
shifting into one another so they kept
 

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.360
shifting into one another so they kept
shifting between different temporalities

dimension through tuition in you you
also dimension yeah well I don't know if

00:55:20.289 --> 00:55:20.299
also dimension yeah well I don't know if
 

00:55:20.299 --> 00:55:21.609
also dimension yeah well I don't know if
this comes from but what's interesting

00:55:21.609 --> 00:55:21.619
this comes from but what's interesting
 

00:55:21.619 --> 00:55:25.499
this comes from but what's interesting
about metaphor for me is that it is a

00:55:25.499 --> 00:55:25.509
about metaphor for me is that it is a
 

00:55:25.509 --> 00:55:29.620
about metaphor for me is that it is a
vibration between the thing itself and

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:29.630
vibration between the thing itself and
 

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:32.829
vibration between the thing itself and
its reference and what the reason I use

00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839
its reference and what the reason I use
 

00:55:32.839 --> 00:55:35.769
its reference and what the reason I use
is that then that vibration introduces

00:55:35.769 --> 00:55:35.779
is that then that vibration introduces
 

00:55:35.779 --> 00:55:38.979
is that then that vibration introduces
the concept of movement that the

00:55:38.979 --> 00:55:38.989
the concept of movement that the
 

00:55:38.989 --> 00:55:41.019
the concept of movement that the
metaphor is not lifeless that it

00:55:41.019 --> 00:55:41.029

00:55:41.509 --> 00:55:41.519
actually
 

00:55:41.519 --> 00:55:43.639
actually
has this shimmering effect because you

00:55:43.639 --> 00:55:43.649
has this shimmering effect because you
 

00:55:43.649 --> 00:55:45.229
has this shimmering effect because you
must actually hold both of those at the

00:55:45.229 --> 00:55:45.239
must actually hold both of those at the
 

00:55:45.239 --> 00:55:47.120
must actually hold both of those at the
same time in your mind in order for that

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:47.130
same time in your mind in order for that
 

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:50.749
same time in your mind in order for that
operation to work and in order to hold

00:55:50.749 --> 00:55:50.759
operation to work and in order to hold
 

00:55:50.759 --> 00:55:52.819
operation to work and in order to hold
them both you actually have to hold your

00:55:52.819 --> 00:55:52.829
them both you actually have to hold your
 

00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:54.919
them both you actually have to hold your
attention to both poles and then go back

00:55:54.919 --> 00:55:54.929
attention to both poles and then go back
 

00:55:54.929 --> 00:55:56.659
attention to both poles and then go back
and forth very quickly between them to

00:55:56.659 --> 00:55:56.669
and forth very quickly between them to
 

00:55:56.669 --> 00:55:59.329
and forth very quickly between them to
kind of wrap them I guess in a way and

00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339
kind of wrap them I guess in a way and
 

00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:00.919
kind of wrap them I guess in a way and
it's interesting that you know when I

00:56:00.919 --> 00:56:00.929
it's interesting that you know when I
 

00:56:00.929 --> 00:56:02.630
it's interesting that you know when I
actually did this gesture with the dress

there was a way which she was trying to
 

00:56:04.019 --> 00:56:05.809
there was a way which she was trying to
wrap herself around that's I don't know

00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819
wrap herself around that's I don't know
 

00:56:05.819 --> 00:56:07.969
wrap herself around that's I don't know
if that's actually helpful for you but

00:56:07.969 --> 00:56:07.979
if that's actually helpful for you but
 

00:56:07.979 --> 00:56:11.239
if that's actually helpful for you but
to me that it was a it was a figure that

rhetorical tropes and that movement the

00:56:21.859 --> 00:56:21.869
rhetorical tropes and that movement the
 

00:56:21.869 --> 00:56:23.870
rhetorical tropes and that movement the
reason why we even have that movement

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880
reason why we even have that movement
 

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.849

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:00.220
of the interesting things to merge from
 

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:02.940
of the interesting things to merge from
the research was that people are are

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:02.950
the research was that people are are
 

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:06.390
the research was that people are are
more often narrating recursively than we

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400
more often narrating recursively than we
 

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.880
more often narrating recursively than we
think they are and by recursive I mean

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:08.890
think they are and by recursive I mean
 

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:11.280
think they are and by recursive I mean
that they return to certain notes of

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:11.290
that they return to certain notes of
 

01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:14.730
that they return to certain notes of
importance and so for example one of my

01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:14.740
importance and so for example one of my
 

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:16.650

this is hard eight is why did two

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:22.030
this is hard eight is why did two
 

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:23.490
this is hard eight is why did two
interviews before and then two

01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:23.500
interviews before and then two
 

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.370
interviews before and then two
interviews the day after the day i had

01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:26.380
interviews the day after the day i had
 

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:27.900
interviews the day after the day i had
to get to Brooklyn to do which was

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:27.910
to get to Brooklyn to do which was
 

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:32.160
to get to Brooklyn to do which was
amazing but he was very engaged with

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:32.170
amazing but he was very engaged with
 

01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:34.860
amazing but he was very engaged with
this idea of self-reflection and he had

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:34.870
this idea of self-reflection and he had
 

01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:36.990
this idea of self-reflection and he had
certain nodes in his history that were

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.000
certain nodes in his history that were
 

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.090
certain nodes in his history that were
very important ones and I considered

01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:39.100
very important ones and I considered
 

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:42.870
very important ones and I considered
them that i would call stable elements

01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880
them that i would call stable elements
 

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.560
them that i would call stable elements
of immobilized life trajectory so in the

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:46.570
of immobilized life trajectory so in the
 

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:47.730
of immobilized life trajectory so in the
love of movement now

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:47.740
love of movement now
 

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:49.440

system one of the main paradigms is

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:49.450
system one of the main paradigms is
 

01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:51.960
system one of the main paradigms is
stable mobile that is to say if you're

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:51.970
stable mobile that is to say if you're
 

01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:54.450
stable mobile that is to say if you're
actually moving your arm it's not just

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:54.460
actually moving your arm it's not just
 

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:55.830
actually moving your arm it's not just
moving around you're actually stabilize

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:55.840
moving around you're actually stabilize
 

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.390
moving around you're actually stabilize

somebody walking is an exercise in
stable mobiles and so that paradigm

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:08.410
stable mobiles and so that paradigm
 

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:11.310
stable mobiles and so that paradigm
actually is very helpful overall

01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:11.320

what I noticed for him is that when he

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:16.150
what I noticed for him is that when he
 

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:18.600
what I noticed for him is that when he
would recurse back to these knows he

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:18.610
would recurse back to these knows he
 

01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:20.490
would recurse back to these knows he
would actually do these amazing this is

01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:20.500

just one gesture in which he would do
 

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.450
just one gesture in which he would do
this stable stable mobile gesture and so

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:27.460
this stable stable mobile gesture and so
 

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:30.000
this stable stable mobile gesture and so
that that was something that it turns

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:30.010
that that was something that it turns
 

01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:32.160

that's another practical side yeah it's

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:50.390
that's another practical side yeah it's
 

01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:53.050
that's another practical side yeah it's
great it makes me wonder also about what

01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:53.060
great it makes me wonder also about what

blankness for that opening in some sense
and and how that works with silence yes

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:07.130
and and how that works with silence yes
 

01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:08.650

not cope with the status difference so
 

01:14:47.159 --> 01:14:49.939

they allowed the teacher to to

01:14:49.939 --> 01:14:49.949
they allowed the teacher to to
 

01:14:49.949 --> 01:14:52.429
they allowed the teacher to to
intimidate them so that this child who

01:14:52.429 --> 01:14:52.439
intimidate them so that this child who
 

01:14:52.439 --> 01:14:53.929
intimidate them so that this child who
was old enough to go to school didn't go

was old enough to go to school didn't go
 

01:14:53.939 --> 01:14:55.729
was old enough to go to school didn't go
to school for a year so that was a very

parents objected buying power in the
 

01:15:03.209 --> 01:15:05.330
parents objected buying power in the
status of the teacher and so I wrote

01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:05.340
status of the teacher and so I wrote
 

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.969
status of the teacher and so I wrote
about it but I didn't think about the

01:15:07.969 --> 01:15:07.979
about it but I didn't think about the
 

01:15:07.979 --> 01:15:11.270
about it but I didn't think about the
body of how the body itself might have

01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280
body of how the body itself might have
 

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:14.419
body of how the body itself might have
shown that objection and so my professor

01:15:14.419 --> 01:15:14.429
shown that objection and so my professor
 

01:15:14.429 --> 01:15:16.250
shown that objection and so my professor
actually asked me to explore that as a

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:16.260
actually asked me to explore that as a
 

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:19.250
actually asked me to explore that as a
core element in movement terms what

01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:19.260
core element in movement terms what
 

01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:21.199
core element in movement terms what
would it mean to be objective Gucci

01:15:21.199 --> 01:15:21.209
would it mean to be objective Gucci
 

01:15:21.209 --> 01:15:22.819

01:15:22.829 --> 01:15:24.649
shrink which you stand behind your
mother would you look at your mother

01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:24.659
mother would you look at your mother
 

01:15:24.659 --> 01:15:26.330
mother would you look at your mother
which you shrink and look at your mother

01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.340
which you shrink and look at your mother

which you shrink and look at your mother
what's the body experience of doing that

01:15:28.609 --> 01:15:28.619
what's the body experience of doing that
 

01:15:28.619 --> 01:15:31.009
what's the body experience of doing that
and that enabled me to actually get into

01:15:31.009 --> 01:15:31.019
and that enabled me to actually get into
 

01:15:31.019 --> 01:15:33.109
and that enabled me to actually get into
a whole discussion of power relation

01:15:33.109 --> 01:15:33.119
a whole discussion of power relation
 

01:15:33.119 --> 01:15:35.089
a whole discussion of power relation
power relations between the child and

01:15:35.089 --> 01:15:35.099
power relations between the child and
 

01:15:35.099 --> 01:15:36.799
power relations between the child and
the parent and relations between the

the parent and relations between the
 

01:15:36.809 --> 01:15:38.839
the parent and relations between the
parent and the teacher how the teacher

01:15:38.839 --> 01:15:38.849
parent and the teacher how the teacher
 

01:15:38.849 --> 01:15:41.149
parent and the teacher how the teacher
might have become more like a parent to

might have become more like a parent to
 

01:15:41.159 --> 01:15:43.129
might have become more like a parent to
the making the parents in two children

01:15:43.129 --> 01:15:43.139
the making the parents in two children
 

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:45.350
the making the parents in two children
and maybe that the daughter actually

01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360
and maybe that the daughter actually
 

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.989
and maybe that the daughter actually
mirrored the objection of the parent

01:15:47.989 --> 01:15:47.999
mirrored the objection of the parent
 

01:15:47.999 --> 01:15:49.489
mirrored the objection of the parent
becoming a child all of these

01:15:49.489 --> 01:15:49.499
becoming a child all of these
 

01:15:49.499 --> 01:15:51.739
becoming a child all of these
