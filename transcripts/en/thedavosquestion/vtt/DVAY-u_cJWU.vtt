00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060
&gt;&gt; As for the question whether India can become
a superpower -- it's a

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.840
great question.
There's, I mean, political, particularly for

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.299
consumer-wise, in the
economy development, I think I prefer the

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.510
latter.
In that sense, I think the eyes are on to[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:30.579
directed towards a
India as a market with enormous potential.

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:38.380
It's structures, infrastructures, directions,
focus on targets can be

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.550
set.
And there is a reasonable alignment around

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.760
that question, all those
questions.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.210
And I'm pretty sure that the domestic market
in India will become a

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.830
very strong driver for economic development,
even to the level of

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.220
superpower.
Thank you.
