DON DODGE: Hi, I'm Don Dodge.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.070
And this is "Google Root
Access," the show for startups

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.510
about issues that every
startup has.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.650
Today, we're going to
talk about user

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.710
experience and user design.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.760
I have a special guest, Nazmul
Idris, who works on the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.250
Android team and focuses
on user design.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.290
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.800
NAZMUL IDRIS: Thank you.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.590
I'm glad to be here.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.260
DON DODGE: So, you talked about
reducing friction and

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.090
creating a great first
minute experience.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.250
So what do you mean
by friction?

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.890
NAZMUL IDRIS: That's a
very good question.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.910
If you were to measure the
emotional response a user has

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.130
when they're interacting with
your application, and let's

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.560
say those responses were
negative, if they were angry

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.310
or frustrated, anything that
causes a negative reaction or

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.180
negative emotional reaction
is considered friction.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.290
So it's not just that it's
good practice not to have

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.080
friction in your applications.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.190
If you consider prospect
theory, which is a

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.120
psychological thing, it tells
us that for every negative

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.900
interaction you have with
something, you need three

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.190
positive interactions.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.410
So for a startup with limited
funding, limited everything,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.800
it's much easier to remove
friction than to come up with

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.980
really amazing experiences
to delight someone.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.080
So it's good for startups to
get into the mindset of

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.000
removing friction and delighting
rather than just

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.700
delighting but then also leaving
friction in, which now

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.460
you have to work three times
as hard, essentially.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.030
DON DODGE: So by friction do you
mean preventing the user

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.500
from getting at the meat of
what they want to do, like

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.580
putting steps that they have
to take or sign up or that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.970
kind of thing?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.030
Is that what you mean
by friction?

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.260
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.920
So it's important for your
application to understand that

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.710
the user has a limited amount
of bandwidth, limited amount

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.720
of focus or cognitive load.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.090
Like you can't just ask people
to do complex things without

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.100
actually first letting them
know what the value

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.720
proposition is for them to
actually take those actions.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.230
Additionally, you want to
simplify those complex actions

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.060
as much as possible.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.580
So it's very deep in
how you have to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.970
consider removing friction.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.160
DON DODGE: So most applications
have an account

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.620
creation process, sign-in
process, maybe they have a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.570
walk-through or demo or
something that they make you

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.200
go through.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.040
What's your advice on
that kind of thing?

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.760
How do you handle account
creation or demos or

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.860
walk-throughs?

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.630
NAZMUL IDRIS: That's a
very good question.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.100
The most important thing right
away when you actually first

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.350
experience an application is
for the application to give

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.660
you an idea of what
it's going to do.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.390
And if it needs you do
something like sign

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.240
in to tell you why.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.610
Then you'll be more eager
to actually, for

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.660
example, sign in.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.420
Now, once you've understood why
you need to sign in and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.350
then you go to sign in, the
application developer should

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.560
take a lot of effort to remove
any friction from

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.750
that step as well.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.130
So that involves using something
like sign in with

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.200
Google, or log in with
Facebook, or

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.180
something like that.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.980
Does that make sense?

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.680
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.680
So my son has an app that he
built, and he required

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.100
Facebook sign in to create an
account before you got going.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.520
And he called it the
Facebook wall.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.600
Because a big percentage of
the users wouldn't do that

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.670
because they hadn't yet seen
the value of the app.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.910
So he allowed them to get into
the app and start using it and

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.140
do a few things before
requesting that

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.490
they create an account.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.470
So is that an example of
friction and how you might

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.310
handle making it work?

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.550
NAZMUL IDRIS: Yes.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.610
That's a great example.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.040
So what your son did was instead
of putting the onus on

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.480
the user to do something that
they didn't know that they

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.020
wanted to do, they are
continuing to interact and

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.190
engage with the application,
which makes them want to

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.390
engage with it more.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.330
And the more they want, the more
they'll interact with it.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.670
And they're OK with spending
more time and energy with the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.780
application once they have an
idea that there's going to be

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.980
a good reward.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.200
DON DODGE: So that's sort of
like progressive disclosure or

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.410
progressive disclosure of
features, where you give them

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.200
more, don't overwhelm them
in the beginning.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.980
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.220
And not only that, but if you
consider things like sign in

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.190
or sharing, you don't need
permissions to do

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.200
everything up front.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.880
So let the user kind of flow
through the application a

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.360
little bit.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.280
And when they need to do
something, whether they need

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.720
to be signed in, or they need
to share, then kind of load

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.610
them with kind of overcoming
that step.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.340
DON DODGE: So let's say I have
a rather complex application

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.160
that has lots of features and
lots of surface area.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.360
How do I make that first
minute experience be

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.190
delightful?

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.230
NAZMUL IDRIS: So that's actually
not easy to do.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.730
But if we use an example like
Google Now, that's actually a

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.470
fantastic, fantastic example
of how to do it right.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.630
If you consider Google Now,
it's taking into account a

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.660
tremendous number of signals.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.920
It's a very complicated thing.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.685
But when you first launch Google
Now, it gives you like

00:04:58.685 --> 00:04:59.640
a sample card.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.970
And it kind of gets
you thinking.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.890
It basically says, hey, if you
sign in, or if you opt in to

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.890
using Google Now, these are the
amazing things that you

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.980
might be able to do.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.390
It doesn't really contextualize

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.560
them for you yet.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.530
It just gives you samples.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.230
So then you say,
OK, yes I'm in.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.330
That's the message.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.180
Then it starts showing
you sample cards.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.550
And those sample cards aren't
yet tailored to your life.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.150
Or it's just giving like, for
example, the weather.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.520
The simple things.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.260
The idea there is that as you
live in Google Now more and

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.070
more, Google Now unlocks
more and more and more

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.100
capabilities, and it asks you
to customize it more or

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.010
interact with it more.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.450
And so it doesn't feel
like friction.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.860
It feels like it's enticing you
to do something that you

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.630
wanted to do.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.960
And it's delighting you with
unexpected things you didn't

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.920
even know you needed, but
when it showed you,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.670
you were like, wow.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.380
I didn't know you
could do that.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.075
So that's the reaction that
we're trying to get.

00:05:51.075 --> 00:05:52.440
It's that moment of delight.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.710
And those can be engineered.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.120
It's not random that those
things happen.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.030
It takes a lot of work,
but it can be done.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.610
DON DODGE: So making that first
minute experience to be

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.430
delightful is really,
really important.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.915
Progressive disclosure of
features and letting them into

00:06:07.915 --> 00:06:10.570
it, reducing friction, those
are the keys to making it

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.845
successful.

00:06:10.845 --> 00:06:12.220
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.590
DON DODGE: Great.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.410
