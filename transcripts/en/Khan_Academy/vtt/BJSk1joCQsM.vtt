00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.950
We're on problem 31.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.280
A sewing club is making a
quilt consisting of 25

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.650
squares, with each side of
the square measuring 30

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:10.240
centimeters.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.000
OK, and there's going
to be 25 of these.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.260
And they're going
to be 30 by 30.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.580
If the quilt has 5 rows and 5
columns, what is the perimeter

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.560
of the quilt?

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.190
OK, so let me draw that out.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.865
So it has 5 rows and 5 columns
and they're all squares.

00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:31.005
So the quilt itself is
going to be a square.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:39.050
It has 4 rows, one two, three,
four, and then five.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.490
And then one, two,
three, four.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.230
So that's a 5 by 5.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.970
And each of these squares,
their sides are 30

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.030
centimeters.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.120
So how long is one side of
this quilt going to be?

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.280
It's going to be 30 times 5.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.800
So it's going to be
150 centimeters.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.446
Same argument, that's going
to be 150 centimeters.

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:06.410
And that's going to be
150 centimeters.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.230
30 times 5.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.520
And this is going to
be 150 centimeters.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.260
So the perimeter is 150 plus
150 plus 150 plus 150 and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.280
that's 600.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.590
So that's choice C.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.330
32.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.370
The four sides of this figure
will be folded up and taped to

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.520
make a box.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.530
Fair enough.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.010
What will be the volume
of the box?

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.790
OK, so if we cut this out right
now and we folded it

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.100
along where I'm drawing these
green lines, we'll get a box.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.870
And they want to say,
what's the volume?

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.720
Well, volume is just
the base times the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.200
height times the depth.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.150
So if I were to fold up this
box is going to look

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.580
something like this.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.210
You're going to have the base,
which is this base right here.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.970
And this is one, one, two,
three, four, five by one, two,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.370
three, four, five.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.660
So it's 5 by 5 base.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.470
And then each of the sides are
going to be 2 high if I fold

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.440
this up, it's going to
be 2 high like that.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.910
It's going to look like that
if I folded that side up.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.140
This side, when I fold it up,
is going to look like this.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.340
One, two, three, four, five.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.860
That's side when I fold it is
going to look like that.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.700
And this side when I fold it up
is going to look like that.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.230
One, two, three, four, five.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.250
The big picture, the width is
5, the depth is 5, and the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.360
height is 2.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.330
So the volume is 5 times
5 is 35 times 2.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.470
Which is equal to 50.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.230
And that's choice A.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.070
Problem 33.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.650
Where's 33, I think it's
on the next page.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.210
OK, let me copy and paste it.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.120
I should just copy and
paste the whole test.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.020
OK, it says a classroom globe
has a diameter of 18 inches.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.080
If I were to go from
the center to the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.700
side, it's 18 inches.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.090
Which of the following is the
approximate surface area.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.590
Oh no, sorry, I just
drew the radius.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.280
It has a diameter
of 18 inches.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.490
This is 18.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.760
Which of the following is an
approximate surface area in

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.480
square inches of the globe?

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.520
And surface area, they give us
the equation, they give it in

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.650
terms of the radius.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.210
So if the diameter is 18,
what's the radius?

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.460
The radius is half
of the diameter.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.050
So the radius is equal to 9.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.580
And we just plug
that into here.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.140
So the surface area is equal
to 4 pi times the radius

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.420
squared, times 9 squared.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.110
That equals 4 times
81 times pi.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.010
So it's 324 pi.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.350
And they actually multiplied
it out.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.810
So let's see.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.620
Let's see, 324 pi.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.320
And if I were to guess this, I
mean, look at all the choices.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.470
Pi is more than 3.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.820
So this value is going to be
more than 3 times 324.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.230
So it's going to be around 1,000
or a little bit more

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.160
than 1,000.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.240
And the only one that's even
close to that is D.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.070
But if you wanted to confirm
that, you could multiply 324

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:35.010
times 3.14 and that is
equal to 1,017.4.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.030
All right, next problem.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.830
Problem 34.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:52.480
I'll copy and paste 34 and
35 at the same time.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.270
There you go.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.520
I put this there.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.720
All right, ready to do it.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.750
The rectangle shown below has
a length of 20 meters and

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.460
width of 10.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.380
So this is 10 and this is 20.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.100
I just picked that because this
looks longer than that.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.600
That's a 10 I drew.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.200
I know it doesn't
look like a 10.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.490
If the four triangles are
removed from the rectangle as

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.000
shown, what will be the area
of the remaining figure?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.320
So what's the are before
I remove them?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.980
It's 20 times 10.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.910
That's the area of the
whole rectangle.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.390
So it's 200.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.270
And then how much area
am I removing?

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.130
So each of these triangles,
what's its area?

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.810
It's base times height
times 1/2.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.920
That's the area of a triangle.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.400
Because if you just did base
times height, you'd be

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.040
figuring out the area of this
little rectangle there.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.200
So the area of this is 4 times 4
is 16 times 1/2, which is 8.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.400
This is going to be 8, going
to be 8, going to be 8.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.720
So we're removing four
8's from this area.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.520
So we're removing 32.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.410
So minus 32.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.710
And that's 168.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.095
So that's choice C.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.880
Problem 35.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:14.780
If RSTW is a rhombus, so rhombus
tells us that all the

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.960
sides are equal and
they're parallel.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.450
What is the area of WXT.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.740
So this right here.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.250
OK, so this is something that
you may or may not have

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.960
learned about a rhombus
already.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.580
But its diagonals actually
intersect at a

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.210
perpendicular line.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.740
And let me see what
else we can see.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.020
This is 60 degrees, so
this is 30 degrees.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.990
Let's see what we can
get from this.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.300
This is 12.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.540
Then this is 12.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.680
OK, I see where they're
going with this.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.740
So if this is 90 degrees,
this is 90 degrees.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.280
This is a rhombus, so all
the sides are the same.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.370
If this is 60, this is 90, this
has to be 30 degrees.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.320
And then you could actually make
a very strong argument

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.650
that these are similar
triangles.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.300
Whatever length this is,
that's the same length,

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.860
because this is a parallelogram
and the

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.350
diagonals bisect each other.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.710
This side is equal
to that side.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.730
That side is equal
to this side.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.220
So these are congruent
triangles.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.450
So this is also going
to be 60 degrees.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.590
This is going to be 30.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.400
But if you have a 60, let me do
it in another color, if you

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.720
have a 60, 60, 60 triangle,
all of the angles are 60

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.560
degrees, you're dealing with
an equilateral triangle.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.960
So that tells you that all
the sides are the same.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.580
So if this side is 12, that side
is 12, this side right

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:04.650
here also has to be 12.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.280
If that whole side is 12,
what's this length?

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.320
We already know that in a
parallelogram the diagonals

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.220
bisect each other.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.820
So this length is 6.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.330
And this length is 6.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.750
Fair enough.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.430
And let's see, if each of these
lengths are 6, can we

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:23.850
figure out what this
height is equal to?

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.790
Because if we know the base and
the height, we're ready to

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.390
figure out the area
of a triangle.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.820
So let's see if we can use
the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.950
If we called this x, we could
say x squared plus 6 squared

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:41.490
plus 36 is equal to 12 squared,
is equal to 144.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.580
And we you could say that x
squared is equal to, what's

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:52.200
144 minus 36, that's 108.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.660
Let's see, 108.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.882
x squared is equal to 108.

00:08:58.882 --> 00:09:01.750
x is equal to the square
root of 108.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.430
And I can simplify that
more because 9

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:10.680
goes into 108 12 times.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.210
Let me do that.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.240
So x is equal to the
square root of 9

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.250
times 12, that's 108.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.900
So that's equal to the square
root of 9 times the square

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.380
root of 12.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.190
That's equal to 3 times
the square root of 12.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.030
Square root of 12 is the same
thing as the square root of 3

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:32.640
times the square root of 4.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.720
Square root of 4 is 2.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.830
So that's 2 times 3 is
6 square root of 3.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.260
This is 36 times 3.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.870
We could have said this is equal
to the square root of 36

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.210
times the square root of 3.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.360
All right, so 6 square
roots of 3.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.510
That's this side.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.940
So what's the area of this
triangle right there?

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:59.280
It's 1/2 times this base times
6 times 6 square roots of 3.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.040
So that's 1/2 times 6 is 3,
times, 6 square roots of 3 is

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.170
18 square roots of 3.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.280
Now that's just this triangle.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.970
This triangle is congruent to
this triangle, so it will have

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.450
the same area.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.100
And you can make the same
argument that all of these

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.440
triangles are congruent.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.176
So the area of this entire
rhombus is going

00:10:17.176 --> 00:10:18.530
to be 4 times this.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.540
Is that what they wanted?

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.930
Oh no, they wanted of
the area of WXD.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.000
That's what we just
figured out.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.250
They didn't want the area
of the whole rhombus.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.880
They want just the area of this
triangle right there,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.170
which we just figured out, which
is 18 square roots of 3.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.060
I'm trying to think if there's
a simpler way of doing this.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.510
There might be some formula for
the equation for the area

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.790
of a rhombus that I've forgotten
in my memory.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.120
But we were able
to re-prove it.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.770
And that's always better, to
come from basic principles.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.220
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
