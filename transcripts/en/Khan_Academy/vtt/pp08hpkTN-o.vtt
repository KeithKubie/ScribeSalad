00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.600
- [Instructor] An object
is moving along a line.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.910
The following graph gives the
object's velocity over time.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.450
For each point on the graph,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.260
is the object speeding up,
slowing down, or neither?

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.270
So, pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.970
All right, now, let's do it together,

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.310
and first, we need to make sure

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.370
we're reading this carefully,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.203
'cause they're not asking

00:00:20.203 --> 00:00:21.970
is the velocity increasing,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.900
decreasing, or neither,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.780
they're saying is the object speeding up,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.780
slowing down, or neither?

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.810
So, they're talking about speed,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.420
which is the magnitude of velocity.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.990
You can think of it as the
absolute value of velocity,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.823
especially when we're thinking

00:00:35.823 --> 00:00:38.210
about it in one dimension, here.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.910
So, even though they're
not asking about velocity,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.350
I'm going to actually wanna answer both

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.730
so that we can see how sometimes,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.230
they move together, velocity and speed,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.010
but sometimes, one might be increasing

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.120
while the other might be decreasing.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.270
So, if we look at this
point right over here,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.560
where our velocity is
two meters per second,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.920
the speed is the absolute
value of the velocity,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.670
which would also be two meters per second,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.440
and we can see that the slope

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.120
of the velocity-time graph is positive,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.210
and so, our velocity is increasing

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.550
and the absolute value of our velocity,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.170
which is speed, is also increasing.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.070
A moment later, our velocity
might be 2.1 meters per second

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.920
and our speed would also
be 2.1 meters per second.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.750
That seems intuitive enough.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.900
Now, we get the other scenario

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.640
if we go to this point right over here.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.510
Our velocity is still positive,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.450
but we see that our velocity-time graph

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.940
is now downward sloping, so,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.840
our velocity is decreasing
because of that downward slope,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.780
and the absolute of our
velocity is also decreasing.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.200
Right at that moment, our
speed is two meters per second,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.440
and then, a moment later, it
might be 1.9 meters per second.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.440
All right, now, let's go to this point.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.970
So, this point is really interesting.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.200
Here, we see that our velocity,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.030
the slope of the tangent
line, is still negative,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.670
so, our velocity is still decreasing.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.080
What about the absolute value

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.180
of our velocity, which is speed?

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.550
Well, if you think about
it, a moment before this,

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.490
we were slowing down to
get to a zero velocity,

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.250
and a moment after this,
we're going to be speeding up

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.080
to start having negative velocity.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.180
You might say, wait, speeding
up for negative velocity?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.090
Remember, speed is the absolute value,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.980
so, if your velocity goes from zero

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.350
to negative one meters per second,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.490
your speed just went from
zero to one meter per second,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.620
so, we're slowing down here
and we're speeding up here,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.560
but right at this moment,
neither is happening.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.890
We are neither speeding
up nor slowing down.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.820
Now, what about this point?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.550
Here, the slope of our
velocity-time graph,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.050
or the slope of the tangent
line, is still negative,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.100
so, our velocity is still
decreasing, but what about speed?

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.430
Well, our velocity is already negative,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.480
and it's becoming more negative,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.120
so, the absolute value of velocity,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.610
which is two meters per second,

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.010
that is increasing at that moment in time,

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.680
so, our speed is actually increasing,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.320
so, as you notice here,
you see a difference.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.010
Now, what about this point?

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.230
Well, the slope of the tangent line here

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.790
of our velocity-time graph
is zero right at that point,

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.410
so, that means that our
velocity is not changing,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.803
so, you could say velocity not changing,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.970
and if speed is the absolute value

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.500
or the magnitude of velocity, well,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.300
that will also be not changing,
so, we would say speed is,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.100
I'll say, neither slowing
down nor speeding up.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.810
Last but not least, this
point right over here.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.300
The slope of the tangent line is positive,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.320
so, our velocity is increasing,
but what about speed?

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.900
Well, the speed here is
two meters per second.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.220
Remember, it'd be the absolute
value of the velocity,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.410
and the absolute value
is actually going down

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.870
if we forward in time a little bit,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.300
so, our speed is actually decreasing.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.060
We are slowing down as our velocity

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.400
gets closer and closer to zero,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.960
'cause the absolute value

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.383
is getting closer and closer to zero.
