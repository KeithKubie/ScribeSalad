00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
to explain to 13 14 year old I

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:02.990
to explain to 13 14 year old I
 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.710
to explain to 13 14 year old I
essentially try to give my lecture to my

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720
essentially try to give my lecture to my
 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.459
essentially try to give my lecture to my
granddaughter who is much is maybe 14

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469
granddaughter who is much is maybe 14
 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.770
granddaughter who is much is maybe 14
and then I found out that I have to

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780
and then I found out that I have to
 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.919
and then I found out that I have to
change a lot but so there are several

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
change a lot but so there are several
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.590
change a lot but so there are several
think that's well first of all the idea

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600
think that's well first of all the idea
 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.210
think that's well first of all the idea
which is very simple to any age that if

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
which is very simple to any age that if
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.050
which is very simple to any age that if
you have a very very complex system hey

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
you have a very very complex system hey
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.349
you have a very very complex system hey
you have to the best is to focus on the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
you have to the best is to focus on the
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.490
you have to the best is to focus on the
main part n not to like if it is a

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
main part n not to like if it is a
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.100
main part n not to like if it is a
picture not to look on all the parts in

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
picture not to look on all the parts in
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.470
picture not to look on all the parts in
the same details so for example in in my

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
the same details so for example in in my
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660
the same details so for example in in my
lecture we try to I'm still working on

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670
lecture we try to I'm still working on
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.569
lecture we try to I'm still working on
it but wherever a cut in the forest and

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
it but wherever a cut in the forest and
 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.260
it but wherever a cut in the forest and
we try to focus on the carton to have

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
we try to focus on the carton to have
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.910
we try to focus on the carton to have
the forest with much less pixel so this

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
the forest with much less pixel so this
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.119
the forest with much less pixel so this
is the general idea of what one call

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
is the general idea of what one call
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.549
is the general idea of what one call
multi scaling now when it come to

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
multi scaling now when it come to
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.420
multi scaling now when it come to
biology you have a complex porting and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430
biology you have a complex porting and
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.730
biology you have a complex porting and
you want to understand how it works so

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740
you want to understand how it works so
 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.670
you want to understand how it works so
first of all you have to assume that you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
first of all you have to assume that you
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.370
first of all you have to assume that you
could deal with it this is you know not

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
could deal with it this is you know not
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.499
could deal with it this is you know not
to listen to people who say that it is

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
to listen to people who say that it is
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.249
to listen to people who say that it is
too complex then you say I want to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
too complex then you say I want to
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.920
too complex then you say I want to
understand how it works like if you have

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
understand how it works like if you have
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.440
understand how it works like if you have
a watch and you want to the watch is

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
a watch and you want to the watch is
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.899
a watch and you want to the watch is
already there and you want to understand

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
already there and you want to understand
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.920
already there and you want to understand
how it works you have first to think

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930
how it works you have first to think
 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.850
how it works you have first to think
about it which I think that certain your

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
about it which I think that certain your
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.469
about it which I think that certain your
world boy or girl could understand then

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479
world boy or girl could understand then
 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.270
world boy or girl could understand then
then you look on parts of it and try to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
then you look on parts of it and try to
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.389
then you look on parts of it and try to
figure out how they work when all the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
figure out how they work when all the
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.990
figure out how they work when all the
rest is not moving and then you try

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
rest is not moving and then you try
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.999
rest is not moving and then you try
after you understand this to let the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
after you understand this to let the
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.710
after you understand this to let the
rest of it move and then you get a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
rest of it move and then you get a
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.399
rest of it move and then you get a
picture how it works so it's basically

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409
picture how it works so it's basically
 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.959
picture how it works so it's basically
understanding how biological molecule

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
understanding how biological molecule
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.030
understanding how biological molecule
works and to explain more you have to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
works and to explain more you have to
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.229
works and to explain more you have to
take given system like proteins that

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
take given system like proteins that
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.440
take given system like proteins that
chop molecules and you want to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
chop molecules and you want to
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.730
chop molecules and you want to
understand white walk

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
understand white walk
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.560
understand white walk
so fast and the main point is that it's

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570
so fast and the main point is that it's
 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.060
so fast and the main point is that it's
very hard to do it without a computer so

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070
very hard to do it without a computer so
 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.410
very hard to do it without a computer so
young people understand what is computer

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420
young people understand what is computer
 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.160
young people understand what is computer
but this is not to send text message but

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170
but this is not to send text message but
 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.100
but this is not to send text message but
to actually model how things are working

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110
to actually model how things are working
 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.850
to actually model how things are working
in when you model it you kind of

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860
in when you model it you kind of
 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.950
in when you model it you kind of
understand it it's like simulator for

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960
understand it it's like simulator for
 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.210
understand it it's like simulator for
flight training so you are going inside

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220
flight training so you are going inside
 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.720
flight training so you are going inside
the port in and see how it works
