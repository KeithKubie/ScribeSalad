00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.890
This lesson is all about
the world's most amazing number.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.939
And I really mean this.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.570
This is an exciting number.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.190
And it's okay if you don't
get as excited as I am, but

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.500
the number we're going to talk
about today really is mind blowing.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.630
And the amazing things you can do
with it are incredibly useful.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.050
And this number has two important
properties that I want to discuss.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.360
One of these properties has to
do with multiplication, and

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.960
the other has to do with division.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.700
So let's actually start with
the second property, division.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.430
And let's do that by doing
some division problems.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.890
So can you tell me what is 3/3,
and what is pi/pi?

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.603
And also, what is -4/-4?

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:41.800
Enter your answers in these three boxes.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.000
And bear with me, this lesson is
going to start a bit slowly, but

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.710
I promise it's going to
get very interesting.
